“It would have been nice, from my perspective, had we started at a faster pace,"" Plosser said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed’s tapering of its stimulus programme. “Given the fact that we’ve embarked on measured reductions, it’s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we’re doing. It’s OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction.""

The Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.

New York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a “reasonably favorable"" outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a “considerable time.""

The US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.

No Whip-Saw

Improvement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.

Policy shouldn’t be “whip-sawed from month to month,"" Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were “encouraging,"" though they follow other data in the previous two months that were “weak,"" he said.

Yellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.

The Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn’t find work.

Plosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank’s district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Bloomberg

http://www.moneynews.com/Economy/federal-reserve-charles-plosser-weather-job-growth/2014/03/10/id/557011,business,"Severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest a bit of weakness in the labor market is only temporary.



In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser pointed to U.S. payroll gains in December, January and February. ""All three of these numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter weather,"" he said according to prepared remarks.



A government report on Friday showed U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month after creating 129,000 new positions in January. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.



Plosser is a long-time critic of the Fed's aggressive bond-buying program, which is meant to spur hiring and economic growth, but which policymakers have trimmed in measured steps despite some weak growth in jobs, manufacturing and retail sales in the world's largest economy so far this year.



Aside from the reference to the jobs report, Plosser's speech was largely the same as a speech he gave in London on March 6.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-plosser-taper-pace-may-be-too-slow-2014-03-10\?reflink=MW_news_stmp,business,"PARISn — The Federal Reserve may have to accelerate the pace of tapering to take into account the economic pickup currently ongoing in the U.S. and the improving forecast for the near future, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said Monday.

“We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,” Plosser told a panel in Paris. “Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts.”

Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half.

As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.

But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.

“If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction,” Plosser said.

He also raised concerns about how the Fed might ultimately reduce the size of its balance sheet without disrupting inflation or the economy.

“Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,” he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.

The ECB bought bonds of some troubled peripheral countries through its Securities Market Programme (SMP) in an attempt to counter spiking yields as the crisis worsened.

In order to keep the money supply stable and avoid fuelling inflation, it “sterilizes” the purchases by offering deposits equal in value to the government bonds it holds.

Eighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop.

Some economists and investors had expected the ECB to announce a halt to sterilization at last Thursday’s monthly policy meeting, to boost excess liquidity in the financial system and help bring down interbank lending rates.

In the event, it left interest rates on hold and unveiled no other measures to bolster the fragile euro zone recovery, and ECB chief Mario Draghi said the benefits of not sterilizing would be “relatively limited”.

The poll predicted that banks will repay 4.0 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of the ECB’s three-year emergency loans next week, less than half the 11.4 billion euros they are set to return this week.

The euro zone’s central bank pumped over a trillion euros into banks’ coffers in two long-term refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012 to help lenders ride out funding constraints.

Banks have repaid a little more than half of those loans since January last year, helping push excess liquidity - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - down to levels seen before the twin ECB operations.

This week’s repayments are more than six times the amount that was expected, accelerating the drain of extra cash out of the bloc’s financial system. When asked if the ECB would take steps to provide more liquidity, 14 of 24 traders said they would.

Of those 14 traders who expect a boost, nine said it would come in six months, three in the next three months and the remaining two in a year.

The regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation.

Eighty-seven billion euros is maturing this week for the one week tender and 6.5 billion euros for the one month.

http://blogs.reuters.com/hugo-dixon/2014/03/10/eus-half-baked-bank-union-could-work/,business,"The European Union’s half-baked banking union could be made to work – even though it wasn’t strictly needed to solve the euro zone’s problems and what has been agreed isn’t what the designers wanted.

The original advocates of banking union saw it as a way to prevent the euro collapsing during the dark days of early 2012. The idea was that a well-funded, euro-wide deposit insurance scheme would stop savers panicking. Meanwhile, if banks got into trouble, a strong euro-wide safety net would be able to bail them out.

During the crisis, savers and investors lost faith in the ability of weak governments to rescue their banks. That’s why banking union enthusiasts wanted euro-wide support systems.

In the end, what has emerged from the European policy factory is completely different. Germany latched onto a part of banking union that hadn’t previously got much attention, centralised supervision of banks, and nixed the idea of common deposit insurance. It didn’t want to be on the hook for bailing out other countries’ banks. Berlin also diluted the plan for a euro-wide safety net for bust banks – though the European Parliament is still trying to beef it up.

Despite all this, banking union doesn’t have to be a disaster. To see this, it is important to understand why the euro zone doesn’t actually need one.

In 2012 much was made of the “doom loop” that connected weak banks and weak governments. This had two elements: bust banks dragged down their governments if the latter had to bail them out; and bust states dragged down their banks if the latter had bought too many of their bonds.

This doom loop was, and remains, a serious flaw. But it is a mistake to think the only way to cut the loop is by euro-wide bailouts. There are better alternatives.

Look, first, at the problem of bust banks infecting their governments. This is only a problem if taxpayers have to rescue them. But who said governments should be in the business of bailing out banks? It is much better to make banks safe enough so that they don’t get in trouble in the first place; and, if they do, to require their investors to foot the bill.

That, indeed, is the broad programme that governments around the globe have been pursuing for the past five years. It involves preventing credit bubbles, forcing banks to hold more capital, “bailing in” bondholders if they run out of equity and restructuring lenders so it is easy to close them down if necessary.

The EU is doing all this too. But it didn’t require banking union to push it forward.

That said, the ECB could speed up some of these initiatives.

First, the central bank needs to work out how it is going to stop bubbles. In its new supervisory role, it will have what are known as “macroprudential” powers. This will allow it to tell national authorities to do things like jack up banks’ capital ratios if it fears credit is growing too strongly.

The snag is too many cooks may spoil the broth, as there are multiple bodies with macroprudential responsibility for all or parts of the euro zone. Even the ECB will have two units – the new bank supervisor and its financial stability directorate. It needs to provide clarity over who is going to do what.

Second, many banks don’t have enough debt that could be easily bailed in if they run out of equity. The solution is to require all banks to hold a minimum amount of bail-in debt, so that taxpayers don’t have to ride to the rescue.

This can be done without banking union. Indeed, the Group of 20 nations has asked for a global proposal later this year. The ECB should use its influence to produce a robust proposal.

Then there’s the matter of avoiding situations where banks are deemed too important to fail because their bankruptcy would cause havoc for the whole system – and so again have to be rescued. Part of the solution is to require lenders to draw up “resolution plans” that spell out exactly how they can be packed off to the knacker’s yard without too much contagion.

Again, banking union is not required. But, as a result of it, the ECB will be responsible for vetting euro zone banks’ resolution plans. With luck, the central bank will be less susceptible than national supervisors to lobbying by national champions – and so force banks to restructure themselves if that is needed to stop the too big to fail phenomenon.

Now look at the other half of the doom loop: how weak sovereigns infect their banks. Yet again, banking union per se does nothing to address that problem. It can only be dealt with if lenders are told they can’t hold more than a certain amount of their own governments’ bonds.

The ECB would prefer to impose such limits as part of a global regime. The snag is that countries with their own currencies and central banks don’t have such a need to follow suit. So the ECB may, at some point, have to face going it alone.

It won’t be easy for the ECB to bite these bullets. But it will need to, if the euro zone’s half-baked banking union is to be turned into something that is fit for purpose.",

* Ministers to debate scheme to close banks

* Much still up for grabs, including imposing investor losses

By Jan Strupczewski and John O’Donnell

BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - European governments and lawmakers will try to reach a deal this week on how to wind down failing banks, clearing the way for a landmark reform as time runs out to win European Parliament approval before May elections.

Negotiations are set to span days and may be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for euro zone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one pot of money to pay for it.

“There will not be an outcome today or tomorrow, because the real negotiations will take place on Wednesday and days after that if necessary,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is chairing Monday’s meeting of euro ministers, told reporters, referring to talks with the European Parliament’s lawmakers.

As he entered for the first day of talks with European counterparts, Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said he was optimistic agreement could be clinched.

Talks on a new European agency to shut down failing banks, and on a fund to pay for such closures, need to be agreed before the last sitting of the European Parliament in mid-April.

Failure to do so would delay the law by at least seven months, and probably more. It could also mean it is scrutinised by a new group of lawmakers with a higher count of eurosceptics, as such parties are expected to do well in the May poll.

The banking union, and the clean-up of banks’ books that will accompany it, is intended to restore banks’ confidence in one another and boost lending across the currency bloc, helping foster growth in the 18 economies that use the euro.

“This is a large scale political project which will allow countries to borrow at the same rate whether you are Spanish, Italian, German or French,” French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici told reporters.

New lending has been throttled by banks’ efforts to raise capital and cut their risks in recession.

The banking union is also supposed to break the vicious circle of indebted states and the banks that buy their debt, treated in law as ‘risk-free’ despite Greece’s default in all but name.

Euro zone banks now hold about 1.75 trillion euros of government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to the European Central Bank. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the banking system is now on loan to governments.

The biggest political reform since the launch of the euro currency, banking union also touches on sensitive issues for investors, including the imposition of losses on bondholders of failing banks.

Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank will be the supervisor for euro zone banks, a role it takes on in November.

In return for giving its blessing to the wider scheme, Germany wants to see losses imposed from that point onwards on bondholders and others who have backed troubled banks.

TUG OF WAR

Officials caution that a deal may not be possible this week and could be postponed until the end of the month.

To further complicate matters, European governments disagree not only amongst themselves, but also with the European Parliament, which must give its blessing to the project before it can become law.

At the heart of the dispute is the complex process of closing a bank. Countries are reluctant to cede authority to Brussels and want a laborious system of checks before any decision to shut a bank can be taken.

EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the euro zone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that the decision must then be signed into law by the finance ministers.

Under that scenario, if the ministers want to change the board’s decision, they also have to involve the European Commission and start a procedure so complex that it is doubtful it can be completed quickly.

The European Parliament, on the other hand, wants no involvement of EU ministers, arguing it would politicise the process and make it cumbersome. It wants leave the final go-ahead to the more impartial European Commission.

Parliament also wants the ECB - the supervisor of all banks - to be the only institution to declare a bank is failing. EU governments want the agency board and national authorities to have a say.

Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the ‘resolution’ fund, used to cover the costs of shutting a bank, and how soon countries should be able to dip into the pot. The fund will be filled by euro zone banks and is slated to reach around 55 billion euros ($76 billion).

Governments want the fund to reach full size over 10 years, while the parliament wants the fund to be fully available to all euro zone countries after just three years.

Finally, policymakers must decide if they will allow this fund to borrow if it is short of cash, or if it should borrow from the euro zone bailout fund or receive state guarantees.",
http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/ecb-policy-idINL6N0M71K320140310,business,"FRANKFURT, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s emphasis on slack in the euro zone economy at its March policy meeting shows it intends to keep interest rates low even if growth rates pick up, sending a dovish message.

Investors, however, were disappointed by the ECB’s lack of action last week, when the bank published an inflation forecast for 2016 that sees price rises still far below its target for price stability of below but close to 2 percent.

The euro rose against the dollar to a 2-1/2 year high after the ECB signalled no need for new economic stimulus and took a slightly more optimistic view of the recovery. That seemed to have drowned the dovish message the ECB intended to send.

For the first time, the ECB in the opening statement to the post-meeting news conference alluded to “the high degree of unutilised capacity” in the euro zone economy as one of the reasons for subdued inflation extending into the medium term.

“Our monetary policy stance will stay in place even after we see improvements in the economy,... because we have a stock of slack that is weighing on the economy,” ECB President Mario Draghi said.

Ahead of the meeting, a growing minority of economists polled by Reuters said the ECB may be forced to print money this year to fight off deflation risks, while some had expected a cut in interest rates, below the record low of 0.25 percent.

The fact that the ECB refrained from suspending the weekly withdrawal of money it spent on Greek and other governments’ bonds during the debt crisis - the least divisive “sterlisation” measure - suggests the ECB may have to take a big step next or none at all.

TAKING THE SHINE OFF

Deutsche Bank, for example, now expects rates to remain at a record low of 0.25 percent throughout this year.

“The ECB seems to be ‘hoping for the best’, and we have probably underestimated the limitations to the Governing Council’s room for manoeuvre on its policy instruments in the last few months,” said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche.

Draghi said the benefits of a so-called sterilisation of bond purchases under its Securities Markets Programme were “relatively limited” because of the short maturity of the bonds still in the SMP portfolio, currently worth 175 billion euros ($242.58 billion).

A programme to revive the market for securitised loans, especially for small and medium sized companies, remains on the agenda, but may require legal and regulatory changes and third party guarantees in order to work, Draghi said.

The ECB could launch another long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), similar to the three-year loans they handed out in late 2011 and early 2012 to ease banks’ funding strains, but banks are increasingly paying back such loans early.

Which leaves the most powerful tool to fight deflation, quantitative easing, by which the central bank would buy securities from banks that have then more money to lend.

But while other major central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have long been relying on this stimulus, QE would be a highly political tool to agree on in the euro zone with its 18 member countries.

Inflation would have to undershoot the ECB’s target for price stability significantly to sway the Governing Council.

A further appreciation of the euro might do just that.

The euro hit a 2-1/2 year high on Friday at $1.3915.

ECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said on Monday he was “not very happy” with the recent appreciation of the euro’s exchange rate, because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation. ($1 = 0.7214 euros) (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)",

Investing.com -

Investing.com - The pound fell to one-month lows against the broadly stronger euro on Monday as expectations for further easing by the European Central Bank eased, after the bank refrained from tightening monetary policy last week.

EUR/GBP hit 0.8344, the highest since February 6 and was last up 0.48% to 0.8341.

The pair was likely to find support at 0.8291, the session low and resistance at 0.8360.

Demand for the euro continued to be underpinned after the ECB left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% on Thursday, saying economic conditions did not support tightening, despite the low inflation outlook for the euro area.

The euro added to gains on Friday after a report from the ECB showed that euro area banks are set to repay a large portion of its emergency loans this week.

Overall market sentiment remained subdued after data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed in February, fuelling concerns over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Sterling was also lower against the dollar, with GBP/USD down 0.40% to 1.6647.

Data on Friday showing that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs continued to support the dollar.

Attention is focused on China’s trade deficit and growth possibly falling far short of target, but another bit of data over the weekend should not be neglected—China's inflation rate dropped to 2% y/y in Feb, from 2.5% in Jan and 2.6% in 2013, the same as 2012. As everyone notes repeatedly, you can’t trust Chinese data, but if we were to trust the latest inflation data, we should start worrying about deflation instead of inflation. The PBOC target is 3.5%, by the way. Suppliers to China—like Australia—are not failing to notice. A global slowdown inspired by a Chinese slowdown is back on the fear-list, along with the inevitable suggestion that the motive for devaluation is the classic one, to promote exports, in the guise of corralling speculators.

The other big issue is the collection of worries about Europe’s institutional infrastructure. We pretty much stopped worrying about it when the peripheral sovereign debt crisis abated, but the inability to work together to put a bank failure mechanism in place is a pretty big failure. The bank examinations, to be followed by stress tests, have to be credible, too. Meanwhile, the Europeans can’t get their act together on sanctions against Russia, either.

We believe Merkel when she says sanctions are a real possibility, but the French are not willing to give up their sale of warships, and evading sanctions is a time-honored business practice in many countries. Europe has long preferred to spend public money on social programs rather than defense, and why not, since the US has been willing to take that expense. But at some point the absence of a coherent European foreign policy is damaging to reputations. As we have noted many times before, a reserve currency is classically the currency of the top military power of the day. The eurozone is trying to redefine a reserve currency as coming from the bloc that has the gold standard of fiscal excellence. It’s an interesting concept and one that is working so far, but it’s not inconceivable that Russia/Ukraine may derail it.

Finally, at least we have a complaint about the too-strong euro from a top figure, ECB executive Noyer. He said ""It is clear that when the euro starts to strengthen it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and additional downward pressure on inflation. Both cases aren't warranted at the moment. We are clearly not very happy at the moment.""

Noyer says everything is on track and there is no need for the ECB to take any of the many possible actions if “prospects deteriorate or its economy is hit by a slowdown elsewhere in the world.” Meanwhile, Noyer claims a plan is on track for French banks to securitize bundles of small business loans, possibly as early as end-March or April and forming a model for the rest of Europe.

Gee, what could go wrong? Well, it’s one way to get non-performings off bank balance sheets. Nobody knows or is willing to disclose how bad the bank situation is in Europe. Draghi is probably sweating over this Achilles heel.

The calendar is light this week until Thursday, when we get the usual weekly jobless claims and retail sales. Until then, everyone will watch Russia/Ukraine, China and the European Parliament, all imprenetrable institutions with untrustworthy news bites. This is the ideal environment for a little dollar strength, or at least a decent Tuesday pullback. (Note that the USD/CAD bounced off support in a textbook-perfect response to an oversold condition.",
http://www.businessinsider.com/opening-bell-monday-10-2014-3,business,"Good morning. Here's what you need to know.

Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. ""Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan (CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014,"" say economists at Standard Chartered.

Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier, marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.

Copper falls. Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.

Quiet markets. Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.

Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.

Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of ¥1.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to ¥2.345 trillion fom ¥1.047 trillion. ""Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments,"" says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.

Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to 13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take — the consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this month.

Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of 2013. ""International banking activity was characterised by lower credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013, mirroring developments in the previous quarter,"" said the BIS in its Quarterly Review published Sunday. ""Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466 billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late 2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or 4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres ($35 billion or 1.7%).""

Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region. ""Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow,"" write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. ""For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine).""

ECB not happy with euro strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength. ""It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,"" Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. ""When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment."" The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.",

European Central Bank officials aren't happy with the recent strength of the euro, Governing Council member Christian Noyer said Monday.

""It is clear that when the euro starts to strengthen it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and additional downward pressure on inflation. Both cases aren't warranted at the moment,"" said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.

""We are clearly not very happy at the moment,"" he said. ECB officials say the exchange rate isn't a target of policy.

The euro has risen about 6.5% against the dollar in the past year, sapping demand for European exports and bearing down on prices in the 18-member currency union. Annual consumer price inflation in the euro zone was 0.8% in February, well below the ECB's target of just below 2%.

Euro-zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target.

Still, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation.

""Low inflation is not deflation,"" Mr. Noyer later told a panel discussion at the Bank of France. ""There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages.""

He warned however that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched.

""Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policy-making.""

And he acknowledged low inflation is hampering efforts by some governments to make their economies more competitive.

""The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability.""

Despite weak inflation, the central bank took no new stimulus measures at its monthly meeting March 6. Mr. Noyer told Bloomberg TV the euro-zone economy is performing in line with the ECB's forecasts.

""We think that the extreme degree of accommodation we have at the current juncture with our monetary stance seems to work so far.""

The French central bank chief said the ECB ""stands ready to act"" if the bloc's prospects deteriorate or its economy is hit by a slowdown elsewhere in the world.

Mr. Noyer said he is ""very open to all kinds of tools"" the ECB could deploy if more stimulus is needed, including a new round of financing for banks or the purchase of assets in markets that aren't functioning smoothly.

He added a plan to encourage banks in France to bundle up packages of small-business loans and sell them to investors---an effort to make more credit available to firms--is nearing fruition. Banks should have new products available by the end of March or early April, he said.

In the panel discussion, Mr. Noyer sounded open to a proposal to scrap a policy that requires the ECB to drain cash from the financial system to offset its government bondholdings, a process known as sterilization. By ending the weekly funding drains, the ECB would potentially leave an extra EUR175 billion ($243 billion) in the banking system, which in turn may reduce the rates banks charge each other for short-term cash.

He said suspending sterilizations is potentially ""a very interesting tool.""

EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair’s strongest since October 2011.

“It’s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,” Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. “When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn’t warranted. So we’re not happy at the moment.”

The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone’s exporters.

Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank’s price-stability objective.

On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB’s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro’s demand.

The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank’s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.

In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts’ projections for a 0.7% increase.

At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts’ forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January’s 0.8% increase. February’s reading was also the strongest since September.

While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.

Meanwhile, greenback’s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation’s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn’t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.

The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.

“The fundamentals are good,” Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report. “Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they’ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing.”

At the same time, the deficit on United States’ trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.

Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair’s strongest since January 23rd.",

DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations in an announcement on Tuesday on how it will test the balance sheets of the euro zone’s largest banks, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters.

The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors deciding whether they need billions of euros of extra capital.

The tests are being done to restore investor confidence and clean up any lingering problems in the euro zone’s banks before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.

The methods some euro zone banks use to decide if a loan has turned sour will fall short of those in the ECB’s review of banks’ loan books, a source with knowledge of the matter said.

The rules will require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said, and will also set the banks estimates of loan losses against ‘challenger models’ created by external auditors.

* Loans pitted against auditors’ ‘challenger models’

* Collateral not valued for over a year must be revalued

By Laura Noonan

DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank’s stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone’s largest banks when it details on Tuesday how it will test balance sheets, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters.

The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors looking at whether they need billions of euros of extra capital to strengthen balance sheets. Estimates of the capital shortfall range from 280 billion euros ($388.13 billion)to as much as 770 billion.

The tests are being carried out to restore investor confidence in the banks and clean up any problems left over from the financial crisis before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.

As well as the initial review on whether banks’ assets are correctly valued now, banks will also be subjected to a stress test looking at whether they need more capital to deal with future crises.

A document detailing the tests’ methodology has been in circulation amongst national supervisors and consultants for several weeks. Recipients have signed non-disclosure agreements and face penalties for any breaches.

“It will terrify them, even though they’ve got a reasonable idea of what’s coming,” one source with knowledge of the guidelines told Reuters, pointing to the very prescriptive approach laid out over nearly 300 pages.

The ECB declined to comment.

The three sources said the most closely-watched areas in Tuesday’s announcement would be the ECB’s view of when loans become impaired, and the way ‘hard to value assets’ are treated.

For loan losses, the guidelines include a simple rule that any loan more than 90 days overdue is non-performing and a more complex one that sets out the other triggers that suggest full repayment is unlikely, two of the sources said.

A third source said that while the ECB’s decision on impairment triggers was “reasonable” some banks would still fall short of it since not all banks would use all the triggers on the ECB’s list of definitions of indicators for impairment.

Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen. “Triggers can be subjective,” the second source said.

If a loan’s status is changed from performing to non-performing, it would have a higher probability of default, some thing that would force a bank to set aside more capital to provide for higher likely losses.

Banks’ estimates on loan losses will be pitted against ‘challenger models’ created by external auditors - carrying out the tests on behalf of supervisors - an approach first tried in Ireland’s balance sheet assessment in late 2013, two of the sources said.

Previous rounds of bank tests have tested the models in use by the banks rather than creating brand new ones.

The rules also require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said.

Beyond loans, the ECB’s treatment of ‘Level 3 assets’, a broad group of assets that are difficult to value, will also be closely watched. Those Level 3 assets include derivatives and also include assets such as real estate holdings banks have acquired through foreclosures, their participations in private equity deals and special investment vehicles.

PARIS (Reuters) - Price stability is under threat in major economies due to low inflation, warranting action from central banks, ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday.

* Euro strength adding to downward inflation pressures (Adds details on ECB action)

PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - Price stability is under threat in major economies from low inflation, warranting action by central banks, ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday.

Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, warned that “permanent and deep forces” were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world.

“Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today,” Noyer told a conference at the French central bank.

Noyer cited slack in many economies as a source of low inflation, as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.

“The recent appreciation of the euro has had indeed a strong disinflationary impact,” Noyer added. The euro rose in recent days to 1.39 to the dollar, its highest since late 2011, after the European Central Bank left its monetary policy unchanged on Thursday.

The Eurostat EU statistics agency estimated euro zone inflation held steady in February at 0.8 percent, well below the ECB’s target of close to but less than 2.0 percent.

Noyer said he did not currently see deflation - what he described as a “pernicious spiral” downward in prices that chokes consumption and investment - in the euro zone and that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in positive territory.

The ECB’s inflation target was meant to provide a cushion against negative shocks to the economy that could drive inflation lower, Noyer said. The euro zone was vulnerable without a buffer, he said.

Against that background, the ECB’s Governing Council has made it explicit that its members expect to keep interest rates at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.

Such forward guidance is a relatively new tool the ECB has called on to influence the economy. Noyer said it was unlikely central banks would go back to relying solely on their conventional tool, short-term interest rates.

But even with more levers available to central banks than in the past, Noyer warned that there were limits to what monetary policy could do.

“The longer interest rates are kept at low levels, the greater the risk for financial stability,” he said. (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Larry King)",

“I fully agree with Jens Weidmann that the suspension of sterilisation is one of the tools we may use if needed,” Noyer, head of the Bank of France and a member of the ECB’s governing council alongside Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, told Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of a conference in Paris.

Concerning appreciation of the euro’s exchange rate, Noyer said he was “not very happy” because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation. (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Hugh Lawson)",
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ecbs-noyer-low-inflation-may-hamper-adjustment-2014-03-10,business,"PARIS--The slow pace of price increases and nominal wages in the euro area risks hampering adjustment strategies within the currency zone, a process necessary for some member countries to become more competitive, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said Monday.

""The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability.""

A country's inflation differential with others has a direct impact on its real exchange rate, a measure of its competitiveness. In order to make the goods and services it produces more competitive, a euro zone country would need to post inflation lower than the bloc's, a difficult challenge if prices are overall close to zero.

Euro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB also recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target of just under 2% over the medium term.

Still, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation.

""Low inflation is not deflation,"" Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run. ""There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages.""

He warned however that the problem needs serious consideration, and that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched.

""The situation today calls for a very careful assessment in the balance of risks,"" Mr. Noyer said. ""Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policymaking.""

The reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.

http://www.irishexaminer.com/business/failing-banks-focus-of-eu-talks-261384.html,business,"European Union governments and parliamentarians will try to reach a compromise this week on how to wind down failing banks in marathon talks intended to settle who decides to close banks and who picks up the bill.

A deal in the negotiations, set to span three days, would be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for all eurozone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one common pot of money to pay for it.

The union, and the thorough clean-up of banks’ books that will accompany it, is meant to restore banks’ confidence in one another and boost lending to other businesses and households.

New lending has been throttled by banks’ efforts to raise capital and reduce the bad loans that proliferated in the recession triggered by the global financial crisis and deepened by the eurozone’s own sovereign debt crisis.

Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the single supervisor for all eurozone banks from November.

But talks on a single European agency to wind up or close failing banks, and on a single fund to back it up, have entered a crucial stage: EU governments, represented by finance ministers of the 28-nation bloc, and the European Parliament must reach a deal next week.

If they don’t, there won’t be enough time to complete the legislative process for the resolution mechanism before the last sitting of the current parliament in mid-April. The key law would be delayed by at least seven months, probably more.

“The ground is very well prepared, now we have to show political will. We will stay there (in the meeting) as long as it takes to find a solution,” one EU official involved in the preparations for the talks said.

“It’s clear to all EU member states that if we want to achieve an agreement there’s only one direction to go — to try to accommodate the parliament,” the official said.

The problem is that European governments and the European Parliament want different things.

EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the eurozone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that decision must be signed into law by the EU’s executive Commission and by all the finance ministers.

The European Parliament wants no involvement of EU finance ministers, arguing it would politicise the process.

Parliament also wants the ECB — the supervisor of all banks — to be the only institution that can declare a bank is failing and that its fate has to be resolved. EU governments want the single resolution agency board and national authorities to have a say.

Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the shared resolution fund and how soon all the money in it should be accessible to all countries.

The fund will be filled from contributions of all eurozone banks and is to reach, eventually, around €55bn.",

This scenario is helpful for thinking about the eurozone as it attempts to survive its next round of trials – beginning with the European Parliament election in May. Can it continue simply to ‘lie still’, hoping that no new shocks arise that diminish its economic health, if not threaten its survival?

Some take the sanguine view that the current ‘lie still’ approach is adequate to ensure that the eurozone economy does more than avoid decline. From their perspective, Germany’s decision over the last three years to permit actual and prospective transfers just large enough to prevent financial meltdown will somehow be enough to enable the eurozone finally to begin to recover from a half-decade of recession and stagnation.

But the fact is that these transfers – that is, European Stability Mechanism-financed bail-out programmes and the European Central Bank’s prospective ‘outright monetary transactions’ (OMT) bond-buying scheme – can do little more than fend off collapse. They cannot boost economic output, because they are conditional upon recipient countries’ continued pursuit of internal devaluation (lowering domestic wages and prices).

Reinvigorating the eurozone economy requires a more radical effort to resolve the inter-linked sovereign-debt and banking crises. Specifically, it demands sovereign-debt mutualisation through Eurobonds, and thus the elimination of eurozone countries’ fiscal sovereignty, and a full-fledged banking union with recapitalisation authority and shared deposit insurance – a far cry from the arrangement that has been agreed.

If Europe’s leaders continue to choose mild palliatives over bold tactics, the best-case scenario is a lacklustre recovery, with GDP growing at a 1%-2% annual rate. Unfortunately, this best case probably is not enough to prevent future sovereign-debt defaults in countries like Italy, Spain, and eventually even France. In other words, at some point, lying still will no longer be an option.

In fact, eurozone leaders might be spurred into action even sooner. While the prospect of OMT seems to be keeping financial shocks at bay, at least for now, a political shock seems increasingly likely, with voters reacting against the internal-devaluation policies that are fuelling high unemployment and undermining living standards. The upcoming European Parliament election could be just such a shock.

As it stands, Europe’s political class is committed to internal devaluation in all of the troubled eurozone economies. The alternative approach – dismantling the eurozone to allow for external devaluations – has thus become the playground of hitherto marginal political parties, which are now surging ahead in opinion polls.

In France, the groups concerned – the National Front and the Union of the Left – represent political extremes. In Italy, a more ideologically neutral anti-establishment force may arise, with a much sharper anti-euro focus than Beppe Grillo’s populist Five Star Movement, which emerged last year to become the country’s third-largest political force. As these parties gain traction, the euro’s chances of survival diminish.

The predicament of Europe’s political establishment stems from a combination of irrational fear and vain ambition. This is particularly apparent in France, where the monetary union has often been viewed as a tool for harnessing Germany’s economic strength to project power worldwide. Given that dismantling the eurozone would mean the end of the French establishment’s European project and would weaken Europe’s ability to advance its interests vis-à-vis global powers like the United States and China, ‘monetary anti-union’ is unthinkable.

France’s global ambition is apparent whenever its mainstream politicians discuss the euro. For example, in 2011, Edmond Alphandéry, a former economy minister, declared that a eurozone exit by a member country was as likely as a dollar exit by Texas or California. Here, on full display, was the wishful thinking that brought the euro into existence in the first place: its French architects dreamed of a Europe that could equal the US. That was always an illusory ambition, but it continues to cloud European leaders’ judgment.

The single currency’s advocates are right about one thing: political motives have always underpinned the establishment of monetary unions, from Latin America’s in the period from 1865 to 1927 to that between Ireland and Britain from 1922 to 1979. But they are missing a crucial point: politics is also the reason for these unions’ dissolution. When the economic costs and divergences become too much of a threat, the political will to do what it takes to ensure the common currency’s survival collapses.

Voter reaction against the euro may well force the eurozone to stop lying still and take real action. The question is whether that would mean that some or all eurozone countries must go their separate ways.

- Forex seasonality over the past 20 years favor a stronger EURUSD in March.

- A better than expected February Nonfarm Payrolls report stunted a potential major EURUSD breakout.

- Have a bullish (or bearish) bias on the Euro, but don’t know which pair to use? Use a Euro currency basket.

The Euro’s resiliency continued to shine this week as a bout of mixed economic data took a backseat to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday. On a cooling of tensions in Eastern Europe and seemingly diminished outcome of military conflict, the higher yielding currencies led the pack as risk appetite surged: the EURAUD depreciated by -1.08% and the EURNZD eased by -0.38%. The Euro’s strength came through in the last two days of the week, and its gains elsewhere are constructive going forward.

While the ECB’s meeting on Thursday helped the Euro realize its pent up bullish potential, it may have just paved the way for further gains over the coming months. The window in which to ease further may be closing, and as a result, the door to a period of monetary stability may have been opened.

As ECB President Mario Draghi made clear in the press conference on Thursday, the ECB does not want to simply just inject more liquidity into the Euro-Zone banking system; there is little need right now. Interbank lending rates (EONIA) are stable below the ECB’s overnight reference rate of 0.25%, which means funding stresses are low. Sovereign yields are stable at multi-year lows (bond prices at highs) and equity markets are buoyed; the linkages between the Euro-Zone banking system and her sovereigns are being strained.

With the PMI surveys pointing to continued modest growth and Euro-Zone inflation starting to tick higher, any new non-standard dovish policies could send the wrong signal as the ECB undertakes role as supervisor of the Euro-Zone banking system; economic data has been generally improved recently, even consumption. As the ECB prepares its stress tests (AQR), announcing a liquidity injections before the results come out might signal to the market that the ECB discovered something unknown and materially negative once they began to review banks' balance sheets.

Instead, so as to prevent unnecessary confusion about the health of the banking system, the ECB is stuck in neutral. To be clear: the ECB stands ready to act if necessary, and quite frankly, it seems that the Governing Council would like to do more. But at present time, short-term economic momentum doesn’t dictate that necessity. This is not inaction; this is a deliberate attempt to do nothing and see where the chips fall. Only if data falls back will the ECB act – crisis conditions don’t exist.

Eventually, a BoE-styled Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) seems like the most palatable outcome for the market is crisis conditions remain absent. This could address credit concerns at the consumer and small business level (SMEs), and it wouldn’t put the Euro at risk of a massive ECB balance sheet expansion that another LTRO or a Fed-styled QE would bring (this would please the German influence). For now, data needs to remain sturdy as the door remains open for further Euro gains. – CV

EBay has come out swinging against activist investor Carl Icahn.

The San Jose e-tailer on Monday officially rejected Icahn’s proposed two board nominees. Icahn, who holds a 2.2 percent stake in eBay, wants the company to spin off PayPal, its electronic payments division. He wanted two of his employees on the eBay board to promote that agenda.

“Neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise,” said Richard Schlosberg, chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee.

Instead, eBay backs the re-election of four existing board members: President and CEO John Donahoe; Fred Anderson, co-founder and managing director of Elevation Partners; Edward Barnholt, former CEO of Agilent Technologies; and Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit.

Talking smack, the company and the pugnacious billionaire issued dueling press releases notable for their frankness.

In a lengthy screed on his website, ShareholdersSquareTable, Icahn accused eBay CEO John Donohoe of “inexcusable incompetence (that) cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion” for selling Skype too soon and too cheaply. He also attacked eBay board member Marc Andreessen, whose investor group bought Skype and then flipped it to Microsoft at a $4 billion premium. Previously, he’d also taken aim at Intuit’s Cook,

Under eBay’s tender ministrations, PayPal may “wither,” Icahn wrote. “ I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL ,” he wrote.

For its part, Ebay said Icahn is dabbling in “false and misleading” statements.

“New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected, accomplished and value-driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley,” it said, referring to Andreessen and Cook. “And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years.”

Icahn’s 2.2 percent eBay stake isn’t actually enough for him to actually wrest much control. So what’s his real agenda?

As Icahn biographer Mark Stevens last week told Chronicle business editor and columnist Tom Lee: ”It’s all a game to him. He’s a master chess player. The only person who knows what Carl Icahn really wants is Carl Icahn.”",

""We rate EBAY INC (EBAY) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share and good cash flow from operations.

Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.

The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.

The chairman of eBay’s corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because “neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise.”

EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay’s guidelines on “overboarding.”

EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company’s slate, which includes Chief Executive John Donahoe.

The company also said Donahoe’s 2013 compensation fell by more than half to $13.8 million. That largely reflects the board’s decision in 2012 to give him a one-time award of $14.8 million in performance share units, although eBay’s weaker-than-expected financial performance also hurt his pay.

The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.

Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.

The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.

In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of “inexcusable incompetence” and said the fast-growing PayPal could “wither” if it remains part of eBay.

“PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL,” Icahn said.

EBay called Icahn’s comments “false and misleading.”

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebay-and-icahn-keep-trading-punches-2014-03-10,business,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — After taking the weekend off to recuperate, both Carl Icahn and eBay Inc. put their gloves back on Monday and got personal by trading more punches in the ongoing public slugfest between the activist investor and the online retailing giant.

Bloomberg News Carl Icahn

Before the market opened, eBay EBAY, +0.31% filed a preliminary proxy statement calling upon its shareholders to reject Icahn’s two nominees for the e-commerce company’s board of directors at eBay’s next annual meeting. Ichan has nominated Jonathan Christodoro and Daniel Ninivaggi, to eBay’s board, as part of his efforts to get eBay to spin off its PayPal e-payments business as a separate company.

EBay also urged shareholders to vote for the current directors that are up for re-election: Fred Anderson, Edward Barnholt, Scott Cook and company Chief Executive John Donahoe.

And it was Donahoe, in particular, who was in Icahn’s sights on Monday.

In the latest of his colorful open letters to eBay shareholders, Icahn claimed that the “inexcusable incompetence” of Donahoe has cost eBay’s stock owners more than $4 billion, and based his views on Donahoe’s overseeing of the company’s sale of Skype to a private-equity consortium in 2009.

“Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners?” Icahn said. “But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards.”

EBay shares fell 1.4%, to close Monday at $58.22.

While eBay was in the red, Facebook Inc. FB, -0.64% rose more than 3%, to $72.03. UBS analyst Eric Sheridan raised his price target on the social-networking giant to $90 a share from $72. In a research note, Sheridan said that Facebook’s shares are a “snowball” that is picking up speed, in part from new advertising deals that are helping the company gain more traction with brands.

Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.79% ended the day with a gain of 48 cents a share to close at $530.92 after the company released iOS 7.1, the latest upgrade to its operating systems the iPhone and iPad. The newest version of iOS 7 comes with Apple’s new CarPlay technology that integrates iOS content with compatible automobiles.

Among other leading tech stocks, decliners were in the majority, as sector leaders such as IBM Corp. IBM, -1.56%, Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.90%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.80%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.10% and Google Inc. GOOG, -0.93% retreated.

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.13% managed to erase almost all of its early losses and dow by 1.7 points at 4,334 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, -0.53% also ended the day in the red.

eBay's other board nominees are Elevation co-founder Fred Anderson, former CEO of Agilent Technologies Edward Barnholt, and John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO.

In his latest letter to the eBay's board this morning, Icahn writes that Donahoe has cost shareholders $4 billion because of his incompetence.

eBay responded by accusing Icahn of a ""false and misleading"" attack:

John Donahoe has delivered astounding results for eBay shareholders since he became CEO in 2008.

“In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John,” eBay said.

http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/carl-icahn-donahoe-cost-ebay-investors-more-than-4b/,business,"Carl Icahn has again posted an open letter on his website, Shareholders’ Square Table, about eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and the ongoing conflicts of interest he sees with the company’s board members. He said he has uncovered new evidence which he says makes his assertion that shareholders lost billions on the Skype deal indisputable.

Skype sale resulted in eBay shareholders losing

The activist investor blames CEO John Donahoe for overseeing “a premature sale of Skype at a diminsted price,” which he says resulted in eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) shareholders losing more than $4 billion compared with how much Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) paid for the VoIP service provider. Icahn believes Donahoe would be fired if eBay was a private company and the “facts” about this were disclosed.

Donahoe decided in 2009 to sell Skype after receiving offers from “multiple bidders.” Icahn isn’t sure whether there were “multiple bidders,” which eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) originally said or whether the company contacted a number of buyers, which the auction site now claims. The activist investor believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was “clearly interested in buying Skype but ‘walked away’ because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Sky’e founders.”

Icahn uncovers new documents

Icahn said they discovered new litigation documents in which Donahoe and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) board member Marc Andreessen learned about a workaround of the licensed technology which caused Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to walk away. He states that Andreessen bought a controlling interest in Skype at that point for $1.9 billion, then settled the licensing litigation and “flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion—tripling their money in only 18 months.” The activist investor questions why Donahoe didn’t settle the issue and then just sell Skype directly to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

He then made the case for why PayPal should be separated from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), suggesting that there would be “a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal” and that if the payment services provider is left under eBay’s management, then it could “wither,” like BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) (TSE:BB), Dell, Nintendo and other technology companies.

eBay launches its own website

Donahoe has maintained that they should keep PayPal as a subsidiary, and his company launched a website—bettertogether.ebayinc.com—which puts forth his case for why the two companies should remain together. On the site, the company states that PayPal has grown faster with the auction site and that it generates about 30% of PayPal’s new users. The company also states that the auction site speeds up PayPal’s success and makes it “smarter.” In addition, it states that it funds the services provider’s growth.",

http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765649410/McDonalds-sales-dip-amid-shifting-eating-habits.html,business,"NEW YORK — McDonald's is fighting to hold onto customers in the U.S. — and all that snow didn't help.

The world's biggest hamburger chain said Monday that sales fell 1.4 percent at established U.S. locations. It blamed the harsh winter weather, but conceded that ""challenging industry dynamics"" also played a role.

After years of outperforming its rivals, McDonald's has been struggling to boost sales as people increasingly flock to places like Chipotle and Five Guys Burgers and Fries. Those chains have popped up quickly across the country by positioning themselves as a step up from traditional fast food, for a little extra money. They also offer greater customization, meaning diners can dictate exactly what toppings they want.

Executives at McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., acknowledge Americans' changing eating habits.

""A long time ago, mass appeal had to be mass appeal,"" Jeff Stratton, the president of McDonald's USA said in an interview with The Associated Press last month. ""That's not necessarily the case anymore today.""

The restaurants are adapting to a world where McDonald's traditional strength — consistency — isn't always enough.

For example, McDonald's is rolling out new prep tables that can hold more toppings and sauces, a sign that it plans to give customers greater variety.

In Southern California, the company is even testing a ""build-your-own-burger"" concept that lets people use tablets to tap out the bread, cheese and other toppings they want on their burgers. Executives say results are promising so far, but rolling out the offering across its more than 14,000 U.S. locations would require considerable changes to kitchens.

In the meantime, McDonald's has made other changes to its menu, including the option to get egg whites in breakfast sandwiches, and the rollout of chicken McWraps, which are intended to appeal to people who want fresher, healthier food.

Globally, McDonald's said sales declined 0.3 percent at locations open at least 13 months in February. It warned that its muted performance so far this year could hurt first-quarter profit margins.

In region encompassing the Middle East, Africa and Asia, sales declined 2.6 percent. The company cited weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as a shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.

Europe was a relative bright spot, with sales up 0.6 percent on a strong performance in the U.K. and growth in France.

McDonald's has more than 35,000 locations in more than 100 countries.

Its stock shed 31 cents to $95.19 in morning trading.

http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/mcdonalds-corporation-mcd-february-sales-results-decline/,business,"The same-store sales results of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) declined 0.3% in February as the company experienced weakness in the United States and Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA).

According to the largest fast food chain operator, the sales performance of its segments in the United States and APMEA dropped 1.4% and 2.6% respectively while its segment in Europe rose 0.6%.

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is experiencing challenges trying to increase its sales performance, particularly in the United States. Last January, the sales performance of the company’s U.S. fell 3.3%. CEO Don Thompson previously stated that McDonald’s needs to improve its menu offerings as it became less relevant to some customers.

McDonald’s growth priorities

Today, Thompson reiterated that the growth priorities of McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) globally include optimizing menus, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening the accessibility to McDonald’s brands. According to him, these priorities are the foundation of the company’s customer-centric approach in building its business over the long-term.

“We are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald’s each day,” added Thompson.

Severe weather conditions

McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) explained that its U.S. sales was impacted by challenging industry dynamics and severe weather conditions last month. In APMEA, its sales were affected by weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as the shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.

On the other hand, the largest food chain operator said its positive sale performance in Europe was due to the continued strong sales in the United Kingdom and France, which offset the ongoing weakness in Germany. McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its European segment is benefiting from its local menu options, expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours.

Peter Bensen, chief financial officer at McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its relatively flat global comparable sales year-to-date will pressure margins in the first quarter. He emphasized that the company is “diligently strengthening” its performance, and he is confident that the management is taking the right actions to clearly align with customer’s needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitability.",

http://blogs.marketwatch.com/behindthestorefront/2014/03/10/5-20-piece-chicken-nuggets-didnt-help-mcdonalds-reverse-u-s-sales-decline/,business,"In another sign of continued pressures facing the fast-food industry, McDonald's Corp. on Monday reported disappointing monthly same-store U.S. sales, its fourth-straight month of declines despite its aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games where it plugged products like its $5 20-piece chicken nuggets.

Like retailers across the board, McDonald's again cited weather as a negative factor. But that's not all. The absence of real per capita disposable income growth that has hurt retailers like Wal-Mart also has hurt restaurant chains like McDonald's, analysts said. The company also has faced increased competition from fast-casual chains including Chipotle and Panera . More importantly, analysts said the changing consumer preference to eat more healthy has left fast-food restaurants like McDonald's struggling to make itself relevant for today's consumers.

According to the National Restaurant Association's 2014 industry forecast, only 29% of quick-service restaurants forecast a rise in sales from last year's level, versus 55% for fast-casual chain operators. And while 40% of quick service restaurants forecast profit declines this year, only 16% of fast-casual eateries feel that way. Half of fast casual chains think their profit will rise from 2013 level.

""The U.S. consumer, and the global consumer, are changing and McDonald's hasn't kept up,"" Customer Growth Partners President Craig Johnson told MarketWatch.

A case in point, pressured by declining mall traffic and changing consumer eating habits, pizza chain Sbarro on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than three years.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast food prices to rise this year by as much as 3.5%. It warned that the ongoing drought in California could have a significant and lasting effect on prices of fruit, vegetable, dairy, and eggs.

To reverse waning demand, McDonald's recently hired a new U.S. marketing chief to help it refine its pitch to consumers. Chief Executive Don Thompson also is ""enhancing the breakfast experience"" at the chain to create ""more of a coffee culture."" After the 20-piece nuggets promotions, the company is promoting five wings for $3 to clear its excess inventory. It also will be offering a new Bacon Clubhouse sandwich featuring Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions. The company is also testing giving consumers the ability to customize their orders, taking a page from its rivals like Chipotle.

U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, after a 3.3% drop in January. The unit has missed Wall Street expectations for seven straight months, according to Thomson Reuters. Overseas, European comparable sales were up 0.6%, while sales in Asia, Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6%. International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan. Meanwhile, as well as a stronger dollar, which made its food more expensive abroad.

Without the weight of a stronger dollar, total world-wide sales would have risen 2.2% , instead of a 0.6% decline in February, the company said.

Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald's is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.

""We believe the current more challenging reality is reflected in valuation,"" said Barclays analyst Jeffrey Bernstein, who rates the stock overweight. ""While not the strongest near-term performer, we expect

MCD to regain lost U.S. share in '14, and benefit from a European macro recovery.""

McDonald's shares dipped 0.4% to $95.11 Monday morning. They are down 3.6% during the past year, the third-worst Dow performer. In comparison, Chipotle jumped 82%, while Panera is up 11%, during the same period.

The broadcaster has agreed to acquire and integrate a FORscene server into its workflow with immediate effect.

It follows a six-month trial that impressed Channel 5, said Forbidden, which added that it proved especially valuable as a logging and rough-cut tool on the programme ""Go Hard or Go Home"" where it replaced tape and paper-based logging.

Chief executive of Forbidden Stephen Streater said: ""I first worked with Channel 5 back in 2005 when it became the first broadcaster to log a TV series in FORscene.

March 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp on Monday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales for February, hurt again by slow business in the United States.

The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue said worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent last month. That was below analysts’ average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.

U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast.

McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year “will pressure margins” in the first quarter.

McDonald’s has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service.

That performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald’s since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year.

Beef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year.

Thompson said in a statement that McDonald’s is “intent on improving our business performance.” McDonald’s said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes.

McDonald’s is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands’ Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos.

McDonald’s again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald’s less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages.

In Europe, the company’s biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent. Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region.

Analysts looked for Europe to be down 0.1 percent and for APMEA to drop 1.1 percent. Sales in Britain and France led the way in Europe, while poor business in Japan weighed down sales in Asia.

McDonald's reported sales at stores open at least 13 months fell in February as its U.S. business slumped for the fourth straight month amid harsh weather. The fast-food chain has been trying to attract Americans with coffee and breakfast foods.

(Star-Ledger file photo)

McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in February as its U.S. business slumped for the fourth straight month amid harsh weather.

Analysts estimated a 0.1 percent decline, the average of 15 projections from Consensus Metrix. Domestic same-store sales slid 1.4 percent, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s said in a statement today, while analysts anticipated a drop of 0.6 percent in the U.S.

McDonald’s, which has more than 14,200 U.S. locations, has been trying to attract Americans with coffee and breakfast foods. The fast-food industry also is struggling with shaky consumer confidence and a severe winter that McDonald’s says hurt its U.S. sales last month.

“Weather was definitely an impact in the month of February -- that’s going to be a drag on everybody,” Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in an interview. Also, rival fast-food chains are introducing new items, improving stores and drawing U.S. diners away from McDonald’s, he said.

“The other players from Wendy’s to Jack in the Box to Sonic to Burger King have just improved their game a little bit and they’re taking back some share,” he said.

The shares fell 0.3 percent to $95.20 at 9:44 a.m. in New York. McDonald’s slumped 1.6 percent this year through March 7, the most recent full trading day, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Restaurants Index declined 1.7 percent.

Pressuring Margins

Little-changed global comparable-store sales so far this year will pressure margins in the first quarter, McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said in the statement.

While U.S. consumer sentiment rose in February after declining in January, the economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter than was previously estimated. Smaller gains in consumer spending, inventories and exports are weighing on the economy and indicate less momentum heading into 2014.

McDonald’s, along with other chains, is trying to draw diners and boost revenue in the morning. While it pushes new McCafe beverages and $1 coffees, Starbucks Corp. is revamping its breakfast sandwiches, and Yum! Brands’s Taco Bell is rolling out breakfast foods, such as sausage burritos and waffle tacos, to its U.S. stores this month. Burger King Worldwide Inc. also has said it’s focused on improving and advertising its morning menu.

European Sales

Same-store sales rose 0.6 percent in Europe and fell 2.6 percent in the company’s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Analysts estimated drops of 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, according to Consensus Metrix, which is owned by Kaul Advisory Group in Wayne. Same-store sales declined 8.7 percent in Japan last month.

In February, breakfast foods and extended hours contributed to a “strong performance” in the U.K. and positive same-store sales in France, McDonald’s said.

Comparable-store sales are considered an indicator of a retailer’s performance because they include only older, established locations. McDonald’s has about 35,400 restaurants worldwide and 81 percent of those are franchised.

McDonald’s is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 22.

Activision Blizzard’s CEO Bobby Kotick was understandably pumped by the numbers.

“Call of Duty is once again the top selling new premium game of the year, proving the enduring nature of the franchise across console, PC, mobile, and esports. In its first three days of release, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare more than doubled the box office opening of Joker.”

The wording in the rest of the statement gives us an idea of how Modern Warfare stacks up in the franchise.

“The title has sold more units in its first three days than any other Call of Duty game sold in its first three days in this console generation.”

That means Modern Warfare had the most successful launch since Black Ops II. In 2012, Black Ops II sold $500 million in its first day and hit the $1 billion mark two weeks after launch.

Last month, NPD showed us the top 10 best-selling games of 2019. We can put Modern Warfare at the top and knock everyone else down a spot now:

NBA 2K20 Mortal Kombat 11 Borderlands 3 Madden NFL 20 Kingdom Hearts III Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 Anthem Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Resident Evil 2 2019 Grand Theft Auto V

It still blows my mind to see how well GTA V sells.

Modern Warfare also had the biggest launch on PC ever, which isn’t too big of a surprise given the support on the PC side, cross-play, and Twitch.

Modern Warfare’s launch was also strong enough to bump Fortnite off the top spot on the most played charts on Xbox One.

Fortnite gave up this spot when Gears 5 launched too but quickly grabbed it back. It’s almost inevitable that Fortnite will reclaim the top spot once again.

While Modern Warfare isn’t perfect, the story was a welcome return to form for the franchise. And despite a frustrating multiplayer, I can’t stop playing it.",

http://247wallst.com/services/2014/03/10/mcdonalds-february-sales-threaten-first-quarter-margins/,business,"In a near repeat of January’s results, February same-store sales for McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) U.S. stores fell and the company’s global sales were rescued by sales in Europe. U.S. same-store sales in February fell 1.4%, while sales in Europe rose 0.6% and sales in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) fell 2.6%. Overall global same-store sales were down 0.3% in February, compared with sales in February 2013.

That is much worse than the January performance, where global same-store sales were up 1.2%, even though U.S. sales were down 3.3%. Europe and APMEA both grew sales in January by 2% and 5.4%, respectively, to offset the big decline in the United States.

U.S. sales were down due to “challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather.” APMEA sales fell as a result of weaker sales in Japan, the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday and negative performance in Australia. The United Kingdom and France offset weaker sales in Germany to post a slight gain in European sales.

The company’s CFO noted that year-to-date performance “will pressure margins in the first quarter.” That is not good news for shareholders.

What is even worse news is that the company’s priorities do not appear to be having a significant positive impact on sales. In the fourth quarter of 2013, same-store sales fell 0.1% and consolidated net income was flat. U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% while rising 1% in Europe and falling by 2.4% in Asia. That is just about where the stores are at the end of February, and that is why the CFO is hinting that profits appear to be headed to finish no better than flat in the first quarter of this year.

McDonald’s shares were down about 0.2% in premarket trading Monday, at $95.25 in a 52-week range of $92.22 to $103.70.",

What a difference five years makes.

Five years ago Sunday, the stock market indexes toppled to their low points of recent times, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 6,547.10 on March 9, 2009 -- less than half of what it had been 17 months earlier. The S&P 500, meanwhile, dipped to 676.53, also far less than half of what it had been in October 2007, when it had soared to 1,565.15.

* Download the above chart in full-size

Today, the indexes are hitting new highs almost every week, as the Dow stands at more than 16,400 and the S&P is at more than 1,875.

Many of our local companies have enjoyed a similar ride with their stocks in the last five years, as share prices have soared and dividends have increased in many cases.

The chart below looks at the total five-year return of 62 area companies. Most are in Greater Cleveland. A few are outside the immediate region but are of keen interest to local investors, consumers and workers. The total return includes appreciation in the share price and income including dividends.

So if you invested $1,000 in a stock back in March 2009 and the return since then was 100 percent, you'd have $2,000. If the total return in the last five years was 2,738 percent, as is the case with Polyone Corp. of Avon Lake, your $1,000 investment would now be worth $28,380.

If you'd invested the same $1,000 with Cedar Fair, parent of Cedar Point, your investment would now be worth $11,240. In many cases, the returns wouldn't be quite so incredible: $1,000 then in J.M. Smucker or Progressive Corp. or A Schulman of Fairlawn would be worth about $3,000 today.

In some cases, the fabulous returns are a reflection of how low the stock has sunk during the financial meltdown of 2008 and early 2009. In other cases, the return reflects how well the company has done since then.

Likewise, at the bottom of the list: In a few cases, the companies haven't performed well in the last five years.

In other cases, like CBIZ Inc. of Independence, the company's stock price didn't fall much during the meltdown (only about 19 percent) and has gained since then (40 percent), but the growth has been more modest compared with other companies that plummeted and then rebounded.

In the case of FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, the electric utility has been undergoing a turnaround after posting big losses in 2012. Your $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth only $1,070 today.

The five-year returns are through Thurs., March 6; the share prices and year-to-date returns are as of Wed., March 5.",
http://www.livemint.com/Money/1Dp2lXhREFGhKVQlhD6QLL/Weak-China-exports-weigh-on-stocks-hit-commodities.html,business,"New York: Global stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1% from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,"" said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.

Prices on benchmark 10-year US treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78%.

The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.

In the US stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.96 points or 0.5%, to 16,369.76, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points or 0.34%, to 1,871.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.561 points or 0.38%, to 4,319.662. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.2% to $31.16 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6%.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5%, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.5% and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3%.

German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3%, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world’s top commodity buyer.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,"" said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.

Adding to the day’s concerns, in Crimea unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post, in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.

Russia said the US had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis.

On Wall Street, Boeing Co. shares lost 2.3% to $125.62 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that “hairline cracks"" had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet.

Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,"" a senior official said on Monday.

Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.7% at $23. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice-president, global communications and investor relations.

Chinese Data Weighs On Australian, Canadian Dollars

The Aussie traded 0.4% lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2% at $1.1104.

“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning—you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,"" said Alvin Tann, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.

The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.

The US dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that the US job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.75.

In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since 25 June and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.

Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30% in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27% from last year’s levels.

The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 79 cents lower at $108.23. The US oil fell $1.25 to $101.33 a barrel. Reuters

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/10/earnings-season-and-the-dow-an-early-look.aspx,business,"Today, the stock market opened lower on fears of global economic sluggishness, with the Dow Jones Industrials (DJINDICES:^DJI) falling 72 points as of 12:30 p.m. EDT and the S&P 500 declining from Friday's record close. Yet in light of the longer-term trends that helped the Dow's bull market reach the ripe old age of 5 yesterday, many investors are looking forward to the beginning of the first-quarter earnings season for signals about whether the blue-chip index has further to climb in the months and years ahead.

Will winter ever end?

The main storyline that most investors have followed closely during the first quarter is the impact of harsh winter weather on the economy. Already we've seen countless companies cite weather problems to justify sluggish results, with even major producers citing issues that could hurt first-quarter earnings. For instance, automaker Ford (NYSE:F) said last week that delays in fleet orders due to the winter weather played a sizable role in the company's overall 6% drop in total sales in February from year-ago levels. Many retailers have issued similar warnings, with the latest earnings insight report [opens PDF] from FactSet revealing that 86 companies in the S&P 500 have given negative guidance on first-quarter earnings per share.

On the whole, earnings growth for the first quarter is now seen coming in at just 0.5%, down from expectations of 4.4% at the beginning of the year. Consumer-discretionary stocks such as Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) have seen some of the biggest downward revisions, with GM cutting its earnings estimates nearly in half. Among S&P sectors, only utilities have seen higher expected earnings growth, and those stocks obviously aren't included in the Dow Industrials. Yet in the past, a recurring theme has played itself out over and over again: earnings expectations fall in the period leading up to the time at which companies actually start to report results, but then companies are able to beat those modest expectations, sending actual earnings growth higher by the end of earnings season.

From that perspective, the early reporting companies in the Dow will have a lot of insight to give to investors. Nike (NYSE:NKE) reports next week, and investors expect to see a substantial rise in sales accompanied by a slight decline in earnings from year-ago levels. Those results would be very much in line with what retailers reported recently, as heavy promotional activity has hurt margins. Even though Nike's strong brand value should help it maintain revenue growth more easily than some competitors, even the athletic-apparel giant has to deal with shoppers who don't want to venture into the cold.

Bank stocks will also be among the earliest to issue earnings numbers, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) slated to report on April 11. Banks will have lower hurdles to overcome, as investors already expect headwinds from falling levels of mortgage refinancing to have substantial year-over-year impacts on earnings. Yet housing has been relatively resilient so far, raising the hope that new-purchase mortgages can pick up the slack and help boost overall earnings. With financial stocks among the leaders of the latest push up for the Dow, JPMorgan and its peers need to deliver on their promise in order to keep the bull market going.

Are markets too expensive?

The other question earnings season should help answer is whether the Dow has simply risen too far. After such strong gains since 2009, concerns about extreme valuations for stocks have risen to new heights. Yet in driving prices higher, earnings have also posted substantial gains, with forward earnings estimates almost doubling since the 2009 lows. Indeed, FactSet noted that current forward multiples are actually below their 15-year average, albeit with that period including not only inflated late-1990s projections but also the boom markets of the mid-2000s.

Those who would like the 5-year-old bull market to reach its next birthday hope that earnings can keep growing enough to satisfy gun-shy investors who grow more nervous at every new record high. First-quarter earnings season will reveal some useful secrets in determining whether the Dow can keep climbing or whether investors should brace for tough times ahead.",

European markets closed mostly in the red. And Asian markets ended significantly lower after China trade data and revised Japanese GDP numbers came in weaker than expected.

Boeing (BA) shares fell after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777, disappeared Saturday in mysterious circumstances en route to Beijing. The company also announced late Friday that ""hairline cracks"" had been found on some of its Dreamliner 787 jets still in production.

The S&P 500 and Dow gained modestly on the back of better-than-expected nonfarm payroll data. These marginal gains were strong enough for the S&P 500 to hit another record high for the second consecutive day. Investors were also kept on the edge by recent developments in the Crimea region; leading to a volatile trading session.

For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.2% to close Friday's trading session at 16,452.72. The Standard & Poor (S&P 500) edged up 0.1% to finish at 1,878.04. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 4,336.22. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped 0.7% to settle at 14.11. Total volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.5 billion shares. Advancing stocks were outnumbered by declining stocks on the NYSE. For 41% stocks that advanced, 56% declined.

For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 1.0% and the Dow posted a gain of 0.8%. The Nasdaq gained for the fifth-straight week and has improved 0.7% since last Friday. The benchmarks managed to remain in the positive territory through the week as tension between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea region subsided. Following these developments, investors have been confident enough to invest in equities rather than traditional safe-haven assets.

The new agreemenmt between The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH ) has added to the bullish mood. The European Central Bank and the Central Bank of United Kingdom's decisions to not change the key lending rates were welcomed by investors. There were mixed reports on the economic front; which investors overlooked as an outcome of the bitter winter season.

Coming back to Friday's events, US stocks began the day on an upbeat note following a better-than-expected nonfarm payroll report for February. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payroll employment had risen to 175,000 in February from 129,000 in January. The rise came despite the harsh winter weather. The increase was more than the consensus estimate of a jump to 152,000.

This report from the Labor Department pushed the S&P 500 to an intraday record of 1,883.57. However, the benchmarks gave away some of the gains as investors remained apprehensive about the US Federal Reserve's next possible move following better jobs data. The Fed's next policy meeting will take place later this month.

The Labor Department also reported that unemployment rate had edged up to 6.7% in February from 6.6% in January. This rise in unemployment rate was the first increase in 14 months and was more than the consensus estimate of it remaining flat at 6.6%.

Meanwhile, consumer credit increased 5.3% or $13.7 billion in January according to the Federal Reserve. However, the increase in the indicator of potential future spending levels was slightly less than the consensus estimate of an increase by $14 billion.

Separately, the Department of Commerce reported a deficit in goods and services of $39.1 billion in January, up from revised $39.0 billion in December. This rise in the country's largest component of balance of payments was also more than the consensus estimate of $37 billion.

Investors also kept an eye on the developments in the Crimea region where a referendum on whether or not to split the region from Ukraine and make it a part of Russia is possibly being prepared. Geo-political concerns surged when Russian President Vladimir Putin turned down a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over movement of Russian troops in the Crimea region.

Five out of ten sectors of the S&P 500 ended in green. Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) led the gains as the sector rose 0.5%. Top holdings from the sector such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) and American Express Company and (NYSE: AXP ) increased 1.3%, 0.9%, 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively.

Among the declining stocks, SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) led the decline as the sector fell 0.5%. Key stocks from the sector such as USG Corporation (NYSE: USG ), DR Horton Inc. (NYSE: DHI ), NVR, Inc. (NYSE: NVR ) and Lennar Corp. (NYSE: LEN ) decreased 2.4%. 1.6%. 0.6% and 1.9%, respectively.

Investing.com -

Investing.com - U.S. stocks opened lower on Monday, weighed by the release of downbeat Chinese trade balance data, while trading volumes were expected to remain light with no U.S. economic reports to be released throughout the session.

During early U.S. trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.28%, the S&P 500 slipped 0.22%, while the Nasdaq Composite index edged down 0.11%.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Among tech stocks, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices was up 1.52% after surging nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.

That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read.

In the energy sector, U.S.-traded BP shares dropped 0.35% following reports the company is now the biggest loser among U.S. government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel supplier.

Adding to losses, McDonald's slid 0.35% after reporting a larger-than-expected decline in comparable global sales at established restaurants in February.

Elsewhere, Boeing shares plummeted 2.11% after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.

On Friday, the company had said that ""hairline cracks"" had been found in the wings of roughly 40 787 Dreamliners currently in production.

Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters, scheduled to report quarterly results after the closing bell.

Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed. The EURO STOXX 50 added 0.16%, France's CAC 40 rose 0.36%, Germany's DAX declined 0.45%, while Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.23%.

During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 1.75%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index lost 1.01%.

http://www.rttnews.com/2283436/stocks-seeing-modest-weakness-in-early-trading-u-s-commentary.aspx\?type=uscom,business,"Stocks have moved modestly lower in early trading on Monday, giving back some ground after trending higher over the past few weeks. The major averages have all moved to the downside, although selling pressure has remained relatively subdued.

Currently, the major averages are posting modest losses, near their lows for the young session. The Dow is down 66.73 points or 0.4 percent at 16,385.99, the Nasdaq is down 6.95 points or 0.2 percent at 4,329.27 and the S&P 500 is down 4.19 points or 0.2 percent at 1,873.85.

The early weakness on Wall Street comes on the heels of the release of disappointing Chinese trade data, with a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.

With Chinese exports falling 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of $22.98 billion compared to a trade surplus of $31.86 billion in the same month last year.

Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.

The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.

Nonetheless, trading activity on Wall Street has remained somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, ""In the U.S., the important economic data of the week doesn't come until Thursday's retail sales and Friday's PPI, and with commodity prices at the highest level since October '12, inflation numbers should now be a focus.""

Steel stocks have moved sharply lower, however, with worries about the outlook for Chinese demand weighing on the sector. The NYSE Arca Steel Index has fallen by 2.2 percent, hitting a five-month intraday low.

In overseas trading, stock across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable weakness during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.8 percent.

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged modestly lower on Monday, and the S&P 500 held near record highs, as investors largely shrugged off unexpectedly weak data in China.

http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/the-stock-market-rally-is-5-years-old-today--can-it-last-another-year--141435188.html,business,"Five years ago today the stock market, reeling from the financial crisis, hit bottom. The Dow (^DJI) closed at just under 6,500 and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended at 676.5. Since March 9, 2009, the Dow and the S&P 500 have more than doubled but how much longer can this rally last?

No one knows the answer, of course, but there are reasons to be cautious. Here are five of them:

1. Tenure: The average bull market lasts about 4.5 years. Only three of the 11 previous bull markets (excluding this one), celebrated a sixth birthday.

2. Valuation: Profit growth is slowing and revenue growth is sluggish, but the price-to-earnings-ratio for the S&P 500 is still strong--about 16 times earnings for the past 12 months. That's near the peak reached in October 2007, just before stocks began their decline during the financial crisis.

3. Margin debt: It's been rising since June and reached a record $488 billion in January. Investors are borrowing to invest, which is a euphoric sign, says Phil Pearlman, interactive editor at Yahoo Finance. And too much euphoria in the stock market is considered a sign of vulnerability. But Pearlman notes that a major reason for rising margin debt is that the cheap cost of borrowing due to extremely low interest rates.

4. The Fed: the U.S. central bank is reducing its purchases of mortgage debt and long-term Treasuries, which have kept long-term rates low and helped fuel the stock market rally. Many strategists say Fed policy is THE key factor for the stock market rally so less Fed asset purchases means less support for the rally.

5. Biotech weakening. Pearlman says biotech stocks have been a leader in the bull market but have been selling off lately. Over the past two weeks the Nasdaq Biotech index (IBB) has fallen 2.3% while the Nasdaq has gained 1.6% and the S&P 500 and Dow are both up about 2%.



Biotechs have been lagging big-cap growth stocks like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Priceline (PCLN) and Netflix (NFLX), which have also outperformed in the current rally, says Pearlman. ""Keep an eye on biotechs and large-cap growth stocks,"" he warns. ""When they [both] start to roll over that would be a second signal that momentum is waning.""

http://news.stocktradersdaily.com/news_releases/Dow+Averaging+3+percent+Since+2000+31014.html,business,"Dow Averaging 3% Since 2000

Recent headlines make you believe that the market has been doing exceptional, and it is had a nice run recently, but let's get real. The Dow Jones industrial average (NYSE:DIA) has barely increased by 3% annually on average since January 1, 2000, and that beats the S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and NASDAQ (NYSE:QQQ) handily. In addition, if current sentiment has anything to do with it, another major peak may be on the horizon.

Smaller investors are greedier today than they have been in quite a long time. My business is one that is constantly monitoring these smaller investors, be it through their responses through social media, traditional media outlets, market based financial articles, television, or through the real time trading reports that we publish for individual stocks, and in keeping my finger on the pulse of these smaller investors I often find contrarian indicators that are actionable from time to time.

This might be one of those times.

The epitome might be a conversation I had with one of my best friends, who said real estate would never fall again. Clearly, the sentiment on the street is not limited to the stock market, it is based on asset price increases from virtually all asset classes, but my primary business is the stock market, and as stock market investors come across my plate I find that every one of them, with the exception of a very small niche, are actually expecting to get 15 or 20% a year from their stock market investments.

To anyone experienced in this industry, that's an eye opener. The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily). Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.

During that time it has had its share of collapses and recoveries, and a resounding similarity occurs after every recovery. Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy. They become overly confident, and they start to throw caution to the wind. On the other side of the coin, when everything looks ugly, smaller investors get defensive, but in each case that is almost exactly the opposite of what they should be doing. When everything is ugly, investors should be aggressive and taking positions to buy the market, and when the market is at relative peaks and everyone else is greedy, prudent investors should become defensive.

Given what I know about today's environment, the greedy sentiment on the street today is very similar to the over exuberance that I have been witness to many times during the life span of my business. The boom and bust cycles are almost predicated on sentiment sometimes, and if that is true this time we will soon see a peak in the market that will last for quite awhile.",

Weighing on stocks was a report from China, the world’s second-largest economy, over the weekend that showed its exports unexpectedly skidded 18.1% in February over a year earlier. Economists had expected an increase of 5%. The surprise drop also hit copper prices.

“In the short term, China’s trade data was disappointing, however, at this point it is unclear how much of it was distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday,” said John De Clue, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

“U.S. equities still remain the market of choice for a lot of international money, which is why we have seen more multiple expansion over the past few weeks,” he added.

Among individual stocks, shares of Chiquita Brands International Inc. US:CQB jumped 11% after the company announced an all-stock merger deal with Fyffes PLC UK:FFY worth $1.07 billion on Monday.

FMC FMC, +1.34% shares climbed 6.2% after the company said Monday it will split into two entities by early next year, with one company consisting of FMC’s agricultural solutions and health and nutrition units and the other will focus on its minerals business.

Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. CLF, -3.70% shares dropped 3.8% in the wake of weak data out of China.

Boeing Co. BA, +4.55% shares fell 1.3% after The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that the company has discovered cracks in some 787 Dreamliner jets, which will lead to a delayed delivery of some aircraft.

Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ALXN, -1.61% shares gained 7.1% after the biopharmaceutical company on Monday raised its 2014 adjusted earnings outlook .

Plug Power Inc. PLUG, +7.69% shares jumped 25%, adding to last week’s gains of 77%. Plug Power last week scored a contract with six distribution centers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.33% and the price target on its shares was boosted by Cowen & Co. analysts on hope of more contracts.

Facebook Inc. FB, -0.64% shares rose 3.2% after UBS raised the stock’s price target to $90 from $72. Analyst Eric Sheridan said Facebook shares are undervalued but is expected to accelerate in value going forward.

In overseas markets, Asian stocks fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -1.83% down nearly 3%. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, -0.26% lost 1%. European markets fell.

Oil prices fell, with April crude CLJ24, -50.57% off more than 1%. Gold prices regained foot and rose.

http://www.nasdaq.com/article/dow-jones-transportation-average-pushing-higher-cm333680,business,"With both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index hovering just below major trend line resistance levels, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) continues to push to new highs and well above former “channel top” resistance.

Importantly, this upward movement in transportation stocks is very positive for equity prices in general since a key element of Dow Theory suggests that transportation stocks usually lead the industrials to higher levels as economic activity improves.

Although overbought conditions are clearly present on all three indices at the moment, near-term corrections are always possible on each. Nevertheless, key trend line resistance on the DJT average currently sits at 9,515 and rises over time.

That represents a potential 24% advance above current levels. It does not mean, however, that a move up to the 9,500 area is likely to emerge anytime soon, but it does represent an underlying optimism in equities that persists.

At this point in time, geopolitical and weather related issues continue to cloud future expectations for growth. That, in turn, has held trading volumes within a normal or even muted range.

Still, another facet of Dow Theory suggests that rising equity prices are usually accompanied by rising trading volumes which act as a confirmation to the prevailing bullish trend.

As a result, it would not be surprising to see a rise in trading volumes if and when the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index break above their long term trend line resistance levels currently sitting at 16,677 and 1,885 respectively.

http://www.investing.com/analysis/dow-jones-industrial-average-gained-last-week-205343,business,"Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed last week as warning signs flashed

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and the S&P500 (SPY) posted gains for the week as Friday’s employment report exceeded expectations and Ukraine stayed on the back burner.

For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gained 0.8%, the SP500 (SPY) added 1% and the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.7%.

The week was choppy as markets reacted to the situation in Ukraine and also hit new highs.

Economic reports were mostly positive as U.S. PMI registered 57.1 and exceeded expectations and initial jobless claims posted 323,000 versus expectations of 335,000 and last week’s 349,000.

February ISM was also well received at 53.2% compared to expected of 52.5% and last month’s 51.3%.

The big news of the week was the conflict with Russia in Ukraine and Russia’s stock market (RSX) fell approximately 12% for the week.

This coming week brings NFIB small business index on Tuesday, Thursday sees weekly jobless claims, February retail sales, and Friday reveals producer prices and University of Michigan consumer sentiment.

Other factors at work next week will be:

1. Ongoing concern over margin debt which is at record highs and which usually peaks near stock market highs.

2. The bull market’s fifth birthday last month which makes this a longer than average bull run.

3. New concern voiced by Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher, a new voting member and hawk, suggesting that the Fed needed to watch for stock market bubbles and new irrational exuberance.

4. Excessive valuations, now comparable to levels seen at the 2007 peak.

A quick glance at the chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average reveals that the market is close to overbought levels and approaching significant resistance.

Dow Jones Industrials Daily

Bottom line: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and other major indexes continue to climb while valuations and margin debt flash warnings.

Nonetheless, trading on Wall Street may be somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, ""In the U.S., the important economic data of the week doesn't come until Thursday's retail sales and Friday's PPI, and with commodity prices at the highest level since October '12, inflation numbers should now be a focus.""

Among individual stocks, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) may come under pressure in early trading after the household goods retailer warned of weaker than previously estimated fourth quarter results due to adverse weather conditions.

After failing to sustain an initial upward move, stocks turned in a lackluster performance over the course of the trading day on Friday. The choppy trading came despite the release of a relatively upbeat monthly employment report.

The major averages eventually closed mixed for the third consecutive session. While the Nasdaq dipped 15.90 points or 0.4 percent to 4,336.22, the Dow rose 30.83 points or 0.2 percent to 16,452.72 and the S&P 500 crept up 1.01 points or 0.1 percent to 1,878.04.

Nonetheless, the major averages all moved higher for the week due to the substantial rally seen last Tuesday. The S&P 500 jumped by 1 percent, while the Dow and the Nasdaq advanced by 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.

In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable weakness during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.8 percent.

Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.5 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is just below the unchanged line.

In commodities trading, crude oil futures are sliding $1.27 to $101.31 a barrel after ending almost flat at $102.58 in the week ended March 7th. Gold futures, which rose $16.60 or 1.3 percent to $1,338.20 an ounce last week, are edging up $0.30 to $1,338.50 an ounce.

On the currency front, the U.S. dollar turned in a mixed performance last week. The greenback rose 1.5 percent against the Japanese yen to 103.28 yen but fell 0.5 percent versus the euro to $1.3875. The dollar is currently trading at 103.31 yen and is valued at $1.3883 versus the euro.

However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.

That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in pre-market trade, down 0.25%.

The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel supplier.

Bloomberg reported that a combination of no big contracts awarded and promised military work withdrawn left BP with a net loss of $654 million in federal contracts in the year that ended September 30, compared with $2.51 billion in awards in fiscal 2012.

Elsewhere, Boeing shares tumbled 1.98% in early trading after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.

Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters, scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.

Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.58%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.87%, Germany's DAX slipped 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.41%.

During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 1.75%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index lost 1.01%.

Twelve of the passengers were from Malaysia and eight were from China. CNN reported that despite a wide-scale search for the plane and its passengers and crew involving 34 planes, 40 ships and search crews from 10 countries, no signs of the plane have turned up.

Stovall comments that the S&P 500 rose a cumulative 178% in price from March 9, 2009 through March 7, 2014, second only to the bull market that started in August of 1982, which gained 225%. ""Even though outlooks are very different today than they were in 2009, the same question remains: When will it end? As Brooke Benton once sang, 'It's Just a Matter of Time,'"" Stovall wrote in his note.

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open slightly lower on Monday, on the heels of a record high for the S&P 500, following unexpectedly weak data in China which tempered enthusiasm over the strength of the global economy.

* China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

* The data put a damper on positive sentiment generated by Friday’s better-than-expected U.S. payrolls report, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high for a second consecutive session.

* Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 1.4 percent to $31.74 in premarket trade as concerns over China sent London copper to an eight-month low.

* Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P’s 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades.

* In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.

* S&P 500 e-mini futures slipped 3 points and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures shed 28 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1 point.

* McDonald’s Corp reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales.

* Boeing Co shares lost 1.2 percent to $127.06 in premarket trading after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

* The situation in Ukraine remained unsettled. Russia’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine, blaming the far-right paramilitary movement Right Sector for “conniving” with the new government in Kiev. Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

* Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe’s largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world’s biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 18.1 percent to $12.80 in premarket trade.

* United Rentals Inc, the world’s largest equipment rental company, said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.",

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-futures-ease-as-chinese-trade-payrolls-compete-2014-03-10\?link=MW_latest_news,business,"MADRID (MarketWatch) — Stock futures shifted lower in choppy trade on Monday, as investors struggled to balance weaker-than-expected China trade data with upbeat U.S. jobs numbers from last week, in a bull market that is celebrating its five-year anniversary.

Coming off sharper losses out of Asia, futures for the S&P 500 index US:SPH4 fell 3.4 points to 1,874.50, while those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJH4 were down 35 points to 16,413. Futures for the Nasdaq-100 index US:NDH4 slipped 3.5 points to 3,700.75.

There is no data on the docket for Monday, but a couple of Federal Reserve officials are on the calendar. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser spoke earlier out of Paris, saying the pace of tapering may be too slow. Last week, Plosser said in an interview that he was worried about how the central bank’s asset purchases are affecting the U.S. economy.

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak at 12:40 p.m. Eastern at Columbus State University.

The Wall Street Journal’s Jon Hilsenrath said Monday that Fed officials are shifting their outlook on how to normalize monetary policy.

So far, Monday has been somewhat of a tug-of-war between some surprising trade numbers out of China and Friday’s better-than-expected jobs report. Wall Street stocks closed mostly higher on Friday, with the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.20% gaining 0.1%, notching the latest in a string of record highs.

Data over the weekend showed Chinese exports unexpectedly fell 18.1% in February, compared with a year earlier, which left a trade deficit of $22.98 billion for the month. Economists had been expecting an expansion of 5%, and the number was also well off a rise of 10.6% in January.

“The shock drop in exports raises serious questions about how realistic Chinese growth prospects are and casts doubt on their current target,” said Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor. “This increased uncertainty is not helpful for either the commodity market or wider global-equity markets.”

Asian markets fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -1.83% down nearly 3%. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, -0.26% lost 1%. Also coming under pressure were the Australian dollar USDAUD, -0.0146% and copper prices US:HGK4 — the latter fell more than 1%. Oil prices were also sharply lower, with April crude CLJ24, -50.57% off more than 1%.

Stock futures struggled between the flat line and losses, and European markets also traded choppy.

“We think this is just the market trying to weigh out two real stories: The positive numbers from payrolls against Chinese numbers overnight, and it almost seems the positivity of payrolls has won out over China,” said James Hughes, chief market analyst at Alpari U.K.

Some are cautious as the S&P 500 is up more than 170% since its March 9, 2009 low. That string of S&P 500 highs, along with levels of margin debt and a small number of prior bull markets that have made it this far, are among reasons why some investors are wary.

Reuters Shipping containers are seen piled up at a port in Qingdao, Shandong province in China on Dec. 10, 2013.

Hughes said that markets were also ignoring negative data that arrived in 2008, near the beginning of the euro crisis. While investors will be keeping an eye on geopolitical situations such as Ukraine, at the moment, he said it is just hard to bet against the market.

Shares of Chiquita Brands International Inc. US:CQB jumped 13% in premarket. Chiquita and Fyffes PLC UK:FFY announced an all-stock merger deal worth $1.07 billion on Monday.

Friday’s non-farm payrolls report showed an increase of 175,000 jobs in February versus an expected 152,000. But the unemployment rate rose to 6.7% from 6.6% in January.

The Nasdaq was weak as a second day of profit-taking in the biotech sector coupled with weakness late in the day in other technology stocks kept a lid on a possible recovery. The S&P 500 held onto its gains thanks to strength in the financial sector, which posted a 3% gain for the week.

At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 31 points to 16,453, the S&P 500 rose 1 point to 1,878, and the Nasdaq fell 16 points to 4,336. The NYSE’s primary market traded 723 million shares with total volume of 3.6 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 2.1 billion shares. On the Big Board, decliners outpaced advancers by 1.3-to-1, while on the Nasdaq, there were only slightly more decliners than advancers.

For the week, the Dow rose 0.8%, the S&P 500 gained 1%, the Nasdaq was up 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 gained 1.7%.

The Nasdaq broke to a new 13-year closing high on Thursday but gave back the gains on Friday. The index is slowing its advance slightly, and that is showing in MACD and other momentum indicators. Immediate support rests at the 20-day moving average, and a fall to that level would close the gap opened earlier in the week.

The Russell 2000 broke to new intraday and closing highs last week. The breakout was from a very bullish “V” formation that bottomed precisely at its intermediate trendline early in February. Both MACD and momentum are strong, but a small horn formation has developed, which could slow the advance until that is resolved.

Conclusion: Despite economic and political uncertainties, stocks continue to make new highs. The advance is characteristic of a bull market that has considerable strength behind it. Institutional interest is demonstrated by higher-than-average block trading, while average investors’ bearishness increased by over 5% last week, according to AAII’s sentiment survey.

I focused on the small- and mid-cap stocks for this report, but the broad-based S&P 500 scored four consecutive new intraday highs last week. The highs were accompanied by higher volume, and group rotation was very active.

Everything points to higher prices, but that doesn’t mean that daily adjustments won’t occur. When they do, we should use them to take new positions in high-quality, oversold stocks. Patience is the key to success, and chasing stocks that are making new highs is a high-risk proposition in a stock market that is celebrating its fifth year as a bull.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/09/3-predictions-for-the-new-week.aspx,business,"I went out on a limb last week, and now it's time to see how that decision played out.

I predicted that RadioShack OTC:RSHCQ)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJINDICES:^DJI)

My final call was for Ambarella NASDAQ:AMBA)

Two out of three? I can live with that! I have now gone a solid 20 out of 24 over the past eight weeks.

Let me once again whip out my trusty, dusty, and occasionally accurate crystal ball to make three calls that may play out over the next few trading days.

1. Novavax will post a wider loss than expected

Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) is a widely traded maker of vaccines. It moved higher late last month after extending its contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences to develop seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.

Unfortunately, Novavax is losing money, and analysts seem to underestimate the red ink. Wall Street has failed to nail its projections when it comes to Novavax, aiming for a much smaller deficit than what the vaccine maker ultimately reports.

Why get in the way of a long-running streak? My first call is for Novavax to post a wider quarterly loss than Wall Street's projecting this week.

2. The Nasdaq will beat the Dow this week

I've routinely picked the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but I've been switching things out in recent weeks. I'm going back to my original call this time around, betting on a strong week for tech now that earnings season is starting to wind down. This approach didn't pan out for me this past week, but that won't deter me.

My second call is for the Nasdaq Composite to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the week.

3. magicJack VocalTec will beat Wall Street's earnings estimates

Some stocks are just flat-out better than others.

magicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL) is a provider of Web-based phone services. Consumers looking to save money have been ditching traditional landlines, and the VoIP pioneer has sold 10 million of its magicJack devices.

Another thing it does is make analysts look like perpetual underachievers. If analysts say the company posted a profit of $0.19 a share in its latest quarter, I'll argue that it held up better than that. History's on my side!

One of my best tricks to beating the market is finding stocks that perpetually land ahead of the prognosticators. Let's go over the past year of earnings reports.

Quarter EPS Estimate EPS Surprise Q4 2012 $0.60 $0.95 58% Q1 2013 $0.51 $1.17 129% Q2 2013 $0.32 $0.49 53% Q3 2013 $0.42 $0.48 14%

Things can change, of course. Analysts are starting to catch up as the strength of the bottom-line beats have weakened in each of the past two quarters. This is a competitive market, and it bears pointing out that analysts see magicJack VocalTec earning less than half as much as it did a year earlier.

It's still hard to argue against the trend. Everything seems to be falling into place for another market-thumping quarter on the bottom line.",

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/08/this-weeks-top-dow-stocks.aspx,business,"Ukraine and Russia were the talk of the markets this week and made for some wild trading. Stocks were down big Monday when tensions increased, but Tuesday was one of the best days of the year, and by the end of the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES:^DJI) was up 0.80%.

Russia is the world's largest oil producer, so it's worth keeping an eye on how it handles Ukraine and the region of Crimea, but the harsh drop of Russian stocks and the ruble on Monday may have been the warning it needed to not escalate the conflict. Russia's economy is on fragile ground, and markets showed that they'd crush Russian assets if a military conflict erupts.

While Russia garnered headlines, it was financial stocks that led the Dow Jones Industrial Average higher this week. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was the top stock, gaining 4.7%. Outside of hiring Apple's retiring CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for its board of directors, there wasn't a lot of news out about Goldman this week. Goldman continues to benefit from the strong market for underwriting stock and bond offerings, and as long as the economy continues to improve, the finance giant will fare well.

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) rose 4.5% this week and settled another lawsuit. The company agreed to pay $400 million to Syncora Guarantee to settle mortgage-backed-securities lawsuits. The bond insurer was claiming JPMorgan misrepresented the quality of loans in securitized and therefore increased liabilities to Syncora. This is on top of $23 billion in fines and settlements last year, but thus far it's done little to slow down JPMorgan's stock.

American Express (NYSE:AXP) was up 2.8% to round out the top three stocks this week. Again, there was little significant news, but the slowly improving economy is helping revenue and earnings as consumers spend more money. The other advantage American Express has is that it more heavily targets affluent consumers than its rivals do. Those consumers are doing well in this economy, which will bode well for American Express long-term.",

I remember the scene as if it was yesterday: It was Sept. 15, 2008, and investment banking giant Lehman Bros. had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The S&P 500 fell more than 4.5% on the day, and as I left the office around 6pm after a busy trading day in Manhattan, the streets were quiet — much too quiet for New York City.

On any other day, a sea of yellow cabs greeted me right outside my building in mid-town Manhattan, but not on Sept. 15. I found myself walking a few blocks north just to find a cab. It was eerie. With the financial epicenter of the globe being shaken to the core that day, the fear in the air was palpable.

The market eventually would take the market through a shaky autumn and winter. In fact, it wouldn’t be until six months later, while headlines of doom and gloom were still flying faster than ever, that the market began to climb out of the abyss. On March 6, 2009, the S&P 500 finally capitulated to the ironic intraday level of 666, then on March 9, the market hit its closing low point at 676.53. A day later, stocks saw a big follow-through buying day, with the index rallying more than 6%.

As it usually goes, neither the media nor the investing crowd took the March 10 bounce as anything more than a short-lived lift, and those smart enough to buy kept very quiet. But to me, it became clearer that considering the typical six-month lag in which the market works, coupled with the still-paralyzed investing public, at least a medium-term bottom was in place.

I wasn’t smart/dumb enough to go all-in on stocks that day either, but because the psychological picture seemed to match up with what I saw on the charts, I knew better not to be caught short the market at the time.

I was right.

Of Bulls and Bears

The general story in terms of bull and bear markets, particularly in the S&P 500, is that roughly every 13- to 17-year bull market is followed by a 10- to 15-year bear. (The Great Depression, depending on when you’re measuring from, stands out as an exception.)

So, looking at the below chart of the S&P 500, which spans all the way back to 1927, this rhythm should somewhat stand out. After a flat tape the bear market from the mid-’60s through the early ’80s, the S&P 500 began its great bull run. Aside from the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, the bull market really kept running until the dot-com bubble of the late ’90s and early aughts popped. This then led to the “lost decade” and the easy monetary policy introduced by then-Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, during which stocks wildly gyrated and ultimately bottomed five years ago … in March 2009.



Click to Enlarge

Looking at the past 20 or so years of trading in the S&P 500 a little more closely, what stands out on the below weekly chart is that the March 2009 capitulation marginally and classically broke below the index’s 2002 lows. This helped to wash out all those players who placed their stop-loss orders around this area, and paved the path for the steep and vicious rally we have witnessed since.

The nail in the coffin for the bears came in spring 2013, when the S&P 500 broke to fresh all-time highs, leaving behind the market tops from 2000 and 2007.



Click to Enlarge

This has, in my opinion, given birth to a new secular bull market — the long 13- to 17-year type of cycle that I discussed above.

However, with the cyclical bull market now five years of age, it is slowly but surely getting somewhat long in the tooth. While many sectors and industries/groups of stocks still look good on the long side, it is somewhat too early to clear the portfolio and or lean short this market. But if history is any guide, then at some point over the next three to nine months, a first cyclical bear market will throw investors a curveball.

The thing to remember when all turns to panic (which it inevitably will) is that if we do indeed find ourselves in a new secular bull market, then the next cyclical bear should lead to a correction no bigger than roughly 30%.

That would mean the major breakout that the S&P 500 staged in spring 2013 when it broke past long-term highs around 1,550 could easily get retested at some point.

And if it does, just remember — the market always bounces back.

While the current bull market is already longer than average, most market strategists expect stocks to have another good year in 2014. Stocks gained last week, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs, despite the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The Dow Jones industrial average is less than 1% away from its all-time high.

But with little economic and corporate earnings news on tap this week, it may be tough for stocks to move much higher. So instead of our usual preview of the days ahead, we've decided to take a look back at the best and worst performing S&P 500 stocks of the past five years.

Online travel companies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE) are two of the biggest winners of the bull market. Priceline shares have surged 1,646% and Expedia has soared 1,182% during the past five years.

Fast-growing consumer stocks have also done well, including Chipotle (CMG), Whole Foods (WFM) and Starbucks (SBUX). Wynn Resorts (WYNN), the casino company, and Netflix (NFLX) were big winners as well. Those stocks also gained at least 1,000%.

Big tech companies Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) had slightly less spectacular gains. They're in a group of stocks that have gained between 500% and 1,000% since March 2009. Ford (F) and Delta Airlines (DAL), two companies that were hit hard during the recession, are also among the companies that have far outpaced the S&P 500's gain of nearly 180%.

But there were a few stocks that have been left behind.

Avon Products (AVP), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF) were big laggards. Best Buy (BBY), which was one of the best performers in 2013, is still up only 4% in the past five years.

And a few stocks actually missed the rally entirely. Shares of Staples (SPLS), which recently announced plans to close hundreds of stores, have fallen. First Solar (FSLR) shares are down 47% over the past five years, giving it the dubious distinction as the bull market's biggest loser.",

The current bull run is not the longest, or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the United States (US) government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria.

Despite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P Capital IQ. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 178 per cent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.

A bull market is a rise of 20 per cent or more over a period of at least six months, following a decline of 20 per cent or more. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.

current bull

The current bull had a tough start to 2014. In January, the S&P 500 index fell 3.6 per cent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. Investors also worried about the strength of the US economy. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where the region of Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to split away and join Russia. President Barack Obama and several other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.

Despite the latest setbacks, stocks recovered and the S&P 500 index closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.

There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest one stretched for almost a decade, between October 1990 and March 2000. The average bull market lasts 41⁄2 years, making the current one longer than average.

The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was taking hold. The S&P 500 index dropped 57 per cent from a record high of 1,565.15 on October 9, 2009, before bottoming out at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.

Greek equities are one of only two major asset classes (the other is the U.S. dollar) to fall over the period, and are down 30 percent – but this followed a huge credit crisis which some worried would force the country to leave the euro.

The bull market shows how faith in the will of the European Central Bank and European governments to keep the euro afloat has been restored. Confidence in European equities has returned.

Yet stocks recovered and the S&P 500 closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.

There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest stretched for almost a decade, October 1990 to March 2000. The average bull market lasts 4½ years, making the current one longer than average.

The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was beginning. The S&P 500 fell 57 percent — from a record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2009 — before bottoming at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.

Typically, bull markets end when investors are spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks. None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet. The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving, and consumer confidence is rising.

Inflation also remains low. When the Fed starts to worry about rising prices, it raises interest rates to curb them. The higher rates can tip an economy into recession and prompt a sell-off in stocks.

But with inflation under control, the Fed has stressed that it plans to keep its key short-term rate near zero.

Stock valuations remain in line with historical averages, says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next 12 months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, is 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.

The stock market is ‘‘not cheap, but it’s not expensive either, so I think the market continues to move higher until further notice,’’ Manley says.

Since starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent. If you played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays US aggregate index, which tracks the broader debt market.

If you played it even safer and invested in short-term government debt, certificates of deposit, and other short-term debt securities, your return would be even smaller. Fidelity’s money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent.",

http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/03/09/Bull-Market-Turns-5-Don-t-Break-Out-Champagne,business,"Happy birthday, bull market.

If that sounds less than super-enthusiastic (what, no exclamation mark?), so be it. Yes, the S&P 500 index hit another record on Friday. But two facts make it hard to uncork the champagne and cut myself a slice of cake. The first is that a very large proportion of Americans haven’t benefited from this five-year-long rally. The second? I’m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors. I certainly doubt whether we’re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.

I’d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country. Data from Lipper and other providers who monitor flows into mutual funds show that until last year, ordinary investors stayed away in droves; they were more likely to keep yanking money out of stock mutual funds. So while the S&P 500 index is up 177.6 percent since the March 9, 2009 bottom (and 208.9 percent if you take dividends into consideration), anyone who delayed investing until last January lost out on most of those gains. Stocks have continued to soar since then – the S&P 500 is up 28.4 percent, and 31.7 percent if you include dividends – but that’s a fraction of what investors could have earned had they been willing and/or able to jump back in the market in 2009.

Of course, ordinary investors had plenty of reasons to stay away. In the wake of the financial crisis, many Americans simply may not have felt financially solvent enough to take more risks with their money. Collectively, they had seen trillions wiped off their net worth as a result of the 40 percent stock market nosedive and the meltdown in real estate values.

At the same time, it’s not easy to follow Warren Buffett’s advice and be greedy when others are fearful, especially when the pain of market losses is so fresh. Consumer confidence – a proxy of sorts for the willingness of investors to take risks – has recovered from the lows seen during the crisis and up until 2009, but it still languishes below its average during non-recessionary periods.

Whatever the reason for the average investor’s reluctance to load up on stocks, it’s clear they haven’t benefitted as much from the market’s run. Yes, the net worth of U.S. households hit a new record of $80.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Federal Reserve — about $12 trillion above where it stood in the spring of 2007, before the financial crisis. Yet the income gap has only widened in recent years: By the time the economic recovery (as distinct from the stock market recovery, which preceded it) finally got going, the top 1 percent of earners collected 93 percent of income gains.

Let’s put to one side the vexing question of whether that’s fair or moral or sustainable. This data suggests that the vast majority of American households likely were less able to take advantage of the stock market’s recovery, even if they had been able to shake off the lingering psychological effects of the events of 2007 to 2009. Corporate profits may have rebounded, justifying the increase in price/earnings multiples and market valuations that we have witnessed – most dramatically during the course of 2013 – but personal earnings and profits didn’t.

By the time individual investors shook off their aversion to stocks and climbed back on the bandwagon, it was already 2013. The lion’s share of the gains had already been captured. Of course, to the extent that those investors already had a toehold in the market in the form of 401(k) investments in mutual funds that owned stocks, they benefited to some extent, but odds are that their risk aversion was mirrored in their choice of 401(k) allocation as well.

The question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward. It’s certainly possible, but market fundamentals are less rosy than they have been. The S&P 500 looks relatively pricey, and analysts are calling for relatively unimpressive first-quarter earnings growth. And economic growth is still clouded in uncertainty.

The Federal Reserve is another source of uncertainty. How committed is the Fed to easing up on its bond market purchases and allowing interest rates to drift higher once more? It’s hard to argue that the incredible inflation in the size of the Fed’s balance sheet that accompanied the stock market rally is merely a coincidence; what remains unclear is the degree of willingness on the part of investors to focus on equity market fundamentals when the Fed removes its heavy hand from one side of the scales.

That doesn’t mean that we’re about to careen off the edge of a cliff – clearly, the bull market requires more than just a slow-motion taper on the part of Fed policymakers and pockets of bad news from emerging markets before it bids us sayonara.

It’s worth remembering, however, that if you do feel like celebrating the bull market’s birthday, the safest way to do it may be by ordering up a big dessert after dinner rather than by allocating a lot more of your assets to U.S. stocks. Analysts widely expect that, even if the rally does continue, the path forward may be much bumpier than it has been. Certainly, it will be tough for the broad market to replicate its outstanding gains from last year.

If you haven’t already rebalanced your portfolio in the wake of the 2013 gains, this is probably a great time to do so – and to scour the market for asset classes that are just as much in the doldrums today as U.S. stocks overall were back in the gloomy days of March 2009.

http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2023026953_pffiveyearreturnsxml.html,business,"Originally published Saturday, March 8, 2014 at 8:00 PM

Many funds have more than doubled in the last five years, but that’s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market.

Fabulous can have a flip side.

It’s something investors should remember as mutual funds’ five-year return figures grow more eye-popping by the day. Many funds have more than doubled over that time, but that’s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the five-year anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market.

That means the darkest days of the financial crisis are no longer counted in five-year returns, leaving only the recovery that sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 index to a record high.

The anniversary is a key milestone because many potential investors scrutinize a fund’s five-year record when deciding whether to buy a fund. It’s important, though, to put those stellar performance numbers in context and to temper expectations.

Market conditions are stacked against both stock and bond mutual funds having such strong returns over the next five years, analysts say. Plus, some of the funds with the best five-year returns led the pack because they focused on the riskiest investments. Many conservative managers, meanwhile, got left behind in the bull market.

To see how big the numbers are, check the performance of the largest mutual fund by assets. Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index fund (VTSMX) has a five-year annualized return of 23.2 percent, according to Morningstar. At the end of 2012, its five-year annualized return was only 2.2 percent.

Investors already have some experience with this effect. Something similar happened with funds’ three-year returns in early 2012.

A fund’s three- and five-year returns are typically the numbers that average investors find most important, says David Mertens, a principal at Jensen Investment Management. Its mutual funds include Jensen Quality Growth (JENSX), which has Morningstar’s gold-medal analyst rating.

Mertens would prefer that investors give greater weight to a fund’s returns over 10 years or even longer. But “people tend to buy what’s just happened,” he says. “People buy yesterday’s story.”

Before you invest, here are some key considerations to put that story in perspective:

• A repeat performance is doubtful

Stocks are unlikely to rise as dramatically, in part because they don’t look as cheap as they did in 2009. One popular way to measure whether a stock is expensive is to divide the price of a stock by its earnings per share over the last 12 months.

Robert Shiller, a professor at Yale University and one of the winners of the Nobel Prize in economics last year, takes it a step further. He thinks it’s misleading to look at just one year because earnings can surge or drop in an economic cycle. To smooth out distortions, he looks at the S&P 500’s level versus its average earnings per share over the prior 10 years, adjusting for inflation.

By that measure, the S&P 500 in March 2009 was at its cheapest level in 23 years. Now, it’s nearly twice that level and back above its average since World War II. That suggests future gains for stocks won’t come from a further rise in price-earnings ratios as much as from growth in earnings.

This year, analysts forecast earnings per share for S&P 500 companies to rise 7.9 percent.

For bond funds, strategists are more pessimistic given expectations that interest rates will rise from their relatively low levels. Five years ago, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 3 percent and on its way down. Falling interest rates help bond mutual funds because they push up prices for existing bonds.

Now, the 10-year Treasury’s yield is below 2.7 percent, but strategists say it’s on its way up. Many bond mutual funds in 2013 had their first down year in more than a decade amid rising interest rates.

• The last five years have rewarded risk

The top-performing stock fund over the last five years has been the Direxion Monthly NASDAQ-100 Bull 2x fund (DXQLX), which has a 60.7 percent annualized return. But it’s not what most people would consider a core investment. The fund is meant more for short-term traders than long-term investors.

It uses leverage in its attempt to double the monthly results of the Nasdaq 100 index, before fees and expenses. While that supercharges gains when the market is strong, it also accelerates losses during downturns. The fund lost 82.8 percent in 2008.

The reward for risk taking can also be seen among target-date mutual funds, which many savers depend on for their retirement accounts. These funds own mostly stocks when an investor’s retirement date is far off and automatically migrate toward bonds as the date nears. But some have less in stocks than others, even if they’re targeted at the same year of retirement.

The Wells Fargo Advantage Dow Jones Target 2025 fund, for example, is more conservative. That’s why it’s in the bottom 3 percent of its peer group for five-year returns. But in 2008, its greater emphasis on bonds helped to cushion the stock market’s losses, and it was in the category’s top 7 percent.

The good news is that investors don’t have to look back too far to see how a fund manager performed in a variety of markets, says David Lafferty, chief market strategist for Natixis Global Asset Management. It has $867.2 billion in assets under management.

Since the late ’90s, stocks have undergone three bull markets (the dot-com boom, the housing bubble and the most recent recovery for stocks) and two bear markets (the dot-com bust and the financial crisis).

After the Dow Jones hit an (at the time) all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at 14,164.43, it would fall by more than 50% to 6,594.44 by March 5, 2009 – a little under 18 months later.

U.S. markets hit their lowest point in the crash on March 9, 2009; the 5-year anniversary of that low point is this Sunday.

Since that day, U.S. markets have skyrocketed. The S&P 500 Index is up 174.7% (1,193.85 points), the Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a 148.35% gain (9,830.98 points), and the Nasdaq is up 235% (3,040.5).

However, the longer this rally lasts, the greater the anxiety there will be a stock market crash, or at least an official stock market correction – defined as a decline of 10% or more.

""I am very concerned about a correction right now,"" Money Morning Chief Financial Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald said on Friday. ""The past few weeks have seen higher prices and lower volume.

Do you remember where you were on March 6, 2009?

It was five years ago today that the S&P 500 (SPX) recorded its intraday bottom for the financial crisis of just under 667. It was the lowest point for U.S. stocks in over a decade.

Fast forward to today and the benchmark is notching a fresh record nominal high of 1,882, nearly tripling from the 2009 low.

The current bull market is sixth on the all-time list in terms of duration, according to Bespoke Investment Group. When looking at total percentage gains, this bull ranks fourth.

Of course, the big question for investors is what's next after such a big rally. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher made headlines this week when he warned the Fed should make sure “the ghost of 'irrational exuberance' does not haunt us again.”

Some are worried that valuations are stretched and that central-bank stimulus has fueled a bubble. Then again, investors have been hearing those concerns for years, and yet the market continues to grind higher.

Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, notes that since the end of World War II, there have been 11 bull markets. Fewer than 30% of these bull markets have celebrated a sixth birthday. However, bull markets that have survived a sixth year have averaged gains of 26% that year, according to Stovall.

Unfortunately, in the company's most recent attempt to save its legacy, the virtual company has had to file for bankruptcy to protect its remaining assets, while trying to expand internationally.

Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Chapter 15 bankruptcy is special because it often deals with cases and scenarios that are related to other countries as well. The goal of this proceeding is to combine efforts to come to a mutual agreement.

The Japanese company first filed for bankruptcy protection on February 28, back in Tokyo, Japan. Filing in the U.S. enables the virtual currency company to use the U.S. court systems which would help solve the company's case faster and much more efficiently.

CEO Mark Karpeles is blaming cyber attacks and theft for the loss of monetary gain and has even stated that it can go bankrupt at any point in time. ""For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that 'transaction malleability' caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it.""

Karpeles continued, ""Gox's own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years.

""The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company.""

Furious about your Mt. Gox losses? You’ll have to cool your heels.

U.S. legal actions against Mt. Gox — notably a lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court that sought class-action status — are on temporary hold after the bitcoin exchange submitted a bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday.

Mt. Gox sought Chapter 15 protection, designed for cases where the parties are based in multiple countries. The Tokyo company, once the world’s largest bitcoin trading post, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Feb. 28.

At the time it said 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 Mt. Gox bitcoins were missing, meaning a cool $450 million had gone up in smoke.

The U.S. bankruptcy eventually could benefit stranded investors, giving the U.S. a structure to work with other countries to track down any remaining assets.

Over the weekend, furious bitcoin users hacked the website of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, posting data that appears to show that the exchange still holds customer investments in the millions of dollars.

“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities’ wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” an anonymous hacker wrote.

So on the downside, Mt. Gox has imploded. On the upside, it’s vaulted into the echelons of companies whose names became common verbs. Of course, being synonymous with total flakiness is not something most CEOs aspire to.

Believe it or not, getting “goxed” first showed up in Urban Dictionary almost three years ago after a spate of Mt. Gox closures and trading delays, but it’s caught fire in the past couple of weeks.

"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2454756,00.asp",business,"Hackers this weekend targeted the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of the bankrupt Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, posting information online that they claim proves Karpeles is actually hoarding bitcoins he claims were stolen.

The hackers charge that some of the nearly half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency lost in recent cyberattacks is actually still in the French CEO's possession.

""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" the unnamed group wrote, according to Forbes, a reference to the downtime and other glitches that have plagued Mt. Gox.

The hackers initially posted to Karpeles's website a 716MB file of stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers; it included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, the company's balance in 18 currencies (including bitcoin), administrative access to Gox parent company Tibanne Limited, and a screenshot of the hackers' access, as well as a list of Karpeles's home addresses and personal resume.

An abridged version, which features Mt. Gox's balances, was later posted online, with a link to the entire set of data.

""This release would have been sooner, but in the spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data,"" the hackers wrote on Pastebin, advising readers to ""repost and share this info before it's gone.""

Karpeles's website is currently offline, and the original Reddit post has since been deleted.

Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan late last month, saying it lost 750,000 bitcoins, or about $480 million7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins. An attack on the company's computer systems also cost Gox about 100,000 of its own units.

The filing came days after the exchange mysteriously went offline, halting trades of the cryptocurrency.

Last month, meanwhile, bitcoins valued at approximately $2.7 million went missing from Silk Road 2, allegedly due to a hack. Silk Road 2 is the reincarnation of the original Silk Road, an online black market for all things criminal that was shut down by the feds last year. The new site emerged in November and is only accessible to those who have an invite and sign in using the Tor anonymizing service.

Bitcoin has been a popular topic of late. Last week, Newsweek said it had uncovered the creator of bitcoin, a 64-year-old California man named Satoshi Nakamoto. But has denied any involvement.

Who’s “Goxing” who now? Vitriolic hackers hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’s personal blog, Tumblr and Reddit accounts yesterday, hurling accusations that head of the defunct exchange is sitting on the missing $500 million-plus bitcoins he says cyber attackers stole.

The anonymous hackers leaked data allegedly proving that customer bitcoins are not lost after all and that some 951,116 BTC might still exist and Karpeles is still in control of them.

Meanwhile, CoinDesk warns that the leaked .exe and .app files “are bitcoin wallet-stealing trojans.” The issuer of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index strongly cautions against opening the files and advises anyone who already has to “transfer your bitcoins to another wallet immediately.”

Mt. Gox has not yet officially commented on the hacker attacks, but a spam warning titled “scam alert notification” appeared on its website last night.

The 700-plus MB data dump “evidence,” which consists of a large zip file called “MtGox2014Leak.zip,” was posted on Karpeles’ now offline MagicalTux.net blog and microblogging accounts.

Not long after the leak, which might have come from disgruntled former Mt. Gox employees, individuals claiming to be Mt. Gox customers took to Twitter to say that they opened the zip file and were able to confirm their own account balances based on their user Mt. Gox IDs issued in their initial Mt. Gox registration email.

Someone also posted an Excel spreadsheet mirror of based on the leaked data with accounts and balances stripped of identifying user information. Although the mirror spreadsheet appears to no longer be available from the source, several screenshots of it are making the rounds on various news sites, blogs and social media platforms. One leaked document appears to have exposed two of Karpeles’ residential street addresses.

Mt. Gox’s Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.

Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.

The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox’s request for Chapter 15 protection.

On 28 February the exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo claiming that 850,000 bitcoins (at the time worth around £240 million) had been stolen from the exchange, 100,000 which belonged to the company and 750,000 belonging to the customers.

Chapter 15 protection in the US was introduced back in 1997 and is almost entirely based on the UN Model Law which aims to modernise and harmonise cross-border insolvencies around the world.

Some relief

If granted it would provide some relief for Mt. Gox, including the granting of an ""automatic stay"" preventing creditors seizing its US assets.

A company files for bankruptcy protection if it believes it can recover financially, given time and some amount of restructuring and reorganisation - this could include a change of management, business model or the selling of a highly-value assets such as buildings (which could be leased back from the buyer) or vehicles.

When a company files for bankruptcy outright, it has accepted that it is no longer able to repay its creditors and any steps for recovery are impossible.

The latest move in Mt. Gox's story comes after hackers claim to have stolen transaction logs from the exchange which they published on Karpeles' personal blog over the weekend. The hackers claim the under-fire CEO was lying about the amount of bitcoins the exchange had leading to many users of Mt. Gox to claim Karpeles had stolen their bitcoins.",

http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/10/mt-gox-files-for-chapter-15-bankruptcy-in-the-u-s/,business,"Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox on Sunday filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S., more than a week after it filed for bankruptcy in Japan and disclosed that it had lost about 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins.

Chapter 15 is a chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code that facilitates insolvency cases involving parties in more than one country. Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 in Dallas and is being represented by Baker & McKenzie, which is also the law firm representing Mt. Gox its civil rehabilitation proceeding in Japan.

""There may be Mt. Gox assets and liabilities in the U.S. -- clearly there is at least one lawsuit that we're already aware of -- and to the extent bitcoins with a relationship to Mt. Gox are accessible in the U.S., Mt. Gox wants to invoke the bankruptcy automatic stay,"" said Ira Herman, a partner at Thompson & Knight in New York.

""The automatic stay will serve to halt attempts including litigation to recover against Mt. Gox or to seize Mt. Gox's assets,"" said Herman, adding that the stay doesn't apply until a recognition order is entered.

Mt. Gox's Chapter 15 filing showed it is seeking relief from two parties in the U.S. with pending litigation: CoinLab Inc. and Gregory Greene, a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit who alleges he lost $25,000 worth of bitcoin. The class-action lawsuit was filed against Mt. Gox and Chief Executive Mark Karpeles on Feb. 28 in Illinois on behalf of all people in the U.S. who held bitcoins in the exchange by the law firm Edelson PC. The lawsuit seeks the return of the customers' funds and damages against Mt. Gox and Karpeles.

There is an emergency hearing scheduled for Monday in Texas on Mt. Gox's filing, according to Christopher Dore, a partner at Edelson who is working on the case. He refused to comment until after the hearing.

Mt. Gox's application for a Japanese civil rehabilitation proceeding on Feb. 28 disclosed that the exchange's liabilities exceed its assets, and some of the liabilities may have been linked to missing bitcoins. The Japanese proceeding, which is similar to a Chapter 11 filing in the U.S., noted the possibility of letting Mt. Gox continue business operations ""in order to increase repayments to our creditors.""

The bankruptcy filing in Japan came after Mt. Gox abruptly shuttered its website, leaving users unable to trade or access the bitcoins stored in the exchange, and followed days of halts on bitcoin withdrawals.

""Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community,"" the application for civil rehabilitation in Japan said.

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 U.S. bankruptcy protection on March 9, a follow up to a similar filing in Japan in late February.

Chapter 15 protection allows for insolvent international companies to benefit from the U.S. court system. It is not exactly clear yet how this will benefit Mt. Gox. The purpose of Chapter 15, and the Model Law on which it is based, is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants and other parties of interest involving more than one country.

""Generally, a chapter 15 case is ancillary to a primary proceeding brought in another country, typically the debtor's home country,"" according to the U.S. Federal Court bankruptcy statute.

Another report has the Mt. Gox system being hacked over the weekend with someone breaking into Mt. Box CEO Mark Karpeles blog. The hackers allegedly pulled a spreadsheet showing that 950,000 Bitcoins were still on the books. Other tidbits include that Mt. Gox had around 1 million customers as of December, although no personal data was released by these tech hounds.

Karpeles has blamed his company's weak security system for the original Bitcoin loss.

This is just the latest in a string of moves surrounding Mt. Gox and the Bitcoin world during the last week.

Bitcoin itself has been the center of controversy since it was created in 2009. Banks and nations have fretted over what it could do to traditional currencies and the bankruptcy of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last month is causing further worries over the viability of the currency and the fact that the largest such exchange simply lost or could not find 850,000 Bitcoins priced at the time at around $500 billion.

That is a lot of money, real or digital.

Then, last week the burner was turned on full blast with the revelation by Newsweek that the mysterious man behind Bitcoin was an unassuming, retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto has denied he is the brains behind Bitcoin and that until recently he had never even heard about Bitcoin, but Newsweek is sticking by its story.

Since then Nakamoto has had to lead a life more akin to a Hollywood celebrity, with dozens of reporters chasing his every move.

The urge to discover who truly is the founder of the digital currency is understandable. That person could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and if a face could be connected with the service it could help make it even more successful or at least save it from an early death.

A famous definition of money is that it's an idea backed by confidence, something that is lacking right now. A currency depends on people believing that it is a safe haven and there is little reason for any confidence to be placed on Bitcoin now with the only names associated with Bitcoin either denying their affiliation or trying to explain why their firm went bankrupt or dying.

The most important failure may well be that the entire Bitcoin universe is nothing but a house of cards waiting to topple.

""Mt. Gox is not alone. Forty-five percent of Bitcoin exchanges to date have failed, in most cases with their customers' money. The digital currency industry's track record on fiduciary responsibility is abysmal,"" wrote Ken Griffith.

The other aspect of this that has to be studied is whether or not a currency, digital or otherwise, can be sustainable without being governed and backed by a national entity.

At Hackingdistributed.com Bitcoin exchanges were compared to the infamous Nigerian prince Internet scams, but these are actually targeted at tech-savvy people.

""Even if the Bitcoin protocol were perfect, and it isn't, our computing infrastructure is not up to the task of handling high-value transactions. The exchanges are built on the latest hyped technologies that have incredibly poor guarantees, and routinely run into technical problems,"" the site wrote.

TOKYO, March 10 (UPI) -- Anonymous hackers published what they claim is evidence of fraud conducted by Japan-based bitcoin trader Mt. Gox and the virtual money isn't missing.

Mt. Gox closed last month, claiming cybercriminals stole about 850,000 in bitcoin cybercurrency, worth more than $500 million, over several years. At the time, Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said bitcoins were lost ""due to weaknesses in the system,"" and Mt. Gox since filed for bankruptcy in Japan.

During the weekend, however, anonymous hackers said they hacked into the trading post and accessed Mt. Gox data, ZDNet reported Monday. After taking over Karpeles' blog and an account during the weekend, the group that hacked into the system posted:

""It's time that Mt. Gox got the bitcoin communities' wrath instead of bitcoin community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data. ...

Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets.Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.Mt.

Gox has been forced to file for bankruptcy in the US in the hope of climbing out of the huge hole it's found itself in. Still reeling from the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins (currently worth around $549 million) and debts of more than $63.6 million, the company has filed papers that will temporarily suspend US legal action against it, allowing it to work out how ""weaknesses in the system"" allowed the digital currency to go missing in the first place. It's not quite the news customers were hoping for, but it's a logical move by Mt. Gox as it will better protect investors located outside of Japan and could also open avenues for it to take on financial aid. While it continues to piece together exactly what happened, some are taking matters into their own hands. Over the weekend, hackers reportedly gained access to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog as well as his Tumblr and Reddit accounts, accusing the company of fraud and alleging it kept some of the Bitcoins that had been reported stolen.",
http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/10/5489582/mt-gox-hackers-say-exchange-still-has-customers-bitcoins,business,"Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox lost $400 million worth of bitcoins in February. Its management said the amount was stolen after hackers exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, but some of Mt. Gox's users are not so sure, suggesting instead that the exchange's owners pocketed the cash. Now, facing silence from those owners about the fate of the money and the methods by which 6 percent of all of the Bitcoin in the world could have been stolen, a group of hackers claims it has broken into the bankrupted Bitcoin exchange's network to get answers.

Forbes reports that the group gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's CEO. The hackers used the platforms to post a message that claimed Karpeles still had access to some of the bitcoins that he'd reported stolen. In support of the claim, they uploaded a series of files that included a spreadsheet of more than a million trades, Karpeles' home addresses, and a screenshot purportedly confirming the hackers' access to the data.

The hackers claim that Mt. Gox still has access to 951,116 bitcoins

Also included as part of the 716MB file was a file that appears to show the exchange's balances in 18 currencies. The hackers point to this file — which reportedly shows a balance of 951,116 bitcoins — as evidence that Mt. Gox is misrepresenting the current situation. A note in the file from the hackers reportedly reads ""That fat fuck has been lying!!""

The files could simply show poor accounting practices

Forbes says the veracity of the file has yet to be confirmed. It could simply highlight the kind of poor accounting practices that allowed hackers to steal the money in the first place, showing money in Mt. Gox's balances that has long since made its way to hacker hands; or it could be evidence to support the theory that the company used the cover of a transaction exploit to steal its customers' money. The exchange claimed it had lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins in its bankruptcy protection filing — in addition to 100,000 of its own bitcoins — but users of the cryptocurrency are yet to see that money appear on the log of public Bitcoin transactions known as the blockchain. That would suggest whoever does have the money isn't spending it at the moment.

Forbes suggests the hack may be related to another supposed breach in which a user on BitcoinTalk's forums offered a 20GB file that they said was also stolen from Mt. Gox. The user claims the file is full of Mt. Gox users' personal details and passport scans, and that they were planning to sell it for 100 bitcoins ""one or two times to make up personal losses from Mt. Gox closure.""",

Gox has been accused of pocketing its users’ cash by a group of hackers who infiltrated the personal blog and Reddit account of the service’s CEO.

The repository made headlines last month after £200 million worth of Bitcoins were allegedly stolen by hackers, forcing the organisation to file for bankruptcy protection in Japan and close its doors.

The company claimed in the bankruptcy filing that it had lost 750,000 customer Bitcoins, as well as 100,000 company-owned ones too.

However, a separate group of hackers have now accused the firm of pocketing at least some of the money it told users had been stolen.

According to a report by Forbes, the hackers gained access to the Reddit account and personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles to post a missive detailing their accusations.

“It’s time that MTGOX got the Bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote.

The term “Goxed” is often used by Mt. Gox users to describe instances where the site has gone offline or experienced other technical issues.

The group also reportedly posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles’ personal website that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox’s servers about the organisation’s finances.

The hackers said it shows the company has a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins, and have used it to pour scorn on Mt. Gox’s assertion that users’ money had been lost.

Karpeles was unresponsive to requests for comment from Forbes, and – at the time of writing – the hackers’ claims were still awaiting verification.

In the meantime, industry watchers have started questioning why no evidence has been uncovered to date about how the stolen Bitcoins are being spent, fuelling speculation they may not have been stolen at all.",

The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called ""Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!"" and posted the stolen information there.

The information was contained in a 716 megabyte file which includes an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades as well as an internal SQl database administration tool and even Karpeles' own CV.

A note on the file add: ""That fat f**k has been lying!!"" The hackers also took over the Reddit account of Karpeles and posted the information there too. Reddit moderators have since removed the post, which said: ""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed.""

Scam exposed

Despite the removal of the post, users of the bitcoin subreddit have made their position very clear, with one of the top posts on the forum saying:

""Mt. Gox scam was just exposed — MK [Mark Karpeles] officially stole our funds.""

Karpeles has so far not responded to the claims.

The hackers added that the bitcoin community could use the relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialised tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data from the given download link to help expose what really went on at Mt. Gox.

The hackers have redacted any user details from the files.

Collapsed

Last month Japan-based MtGox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to a hack - 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. Two weeks ago, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan.

The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m, £38m, €46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.

The Tokyo-based company was the largest and most well-known bitcoin exchange in the world when the cryptocurrency shot to fame last year.

The exchange claims that problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins than were being recorded by the exchange.

Known as ""transaction malleability"", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.

The exchange's collapse led to the price of bitcoin crashing but the virtual currency has shown remarkable resilience and the price of the cryptocurrency has bounced back and is currently trading at £381 on the Coindesk index.",

The data appears to show that MtGox did not have all its bitcoins cleaned out by hackers, as it claimed when it went bankrupt.

“Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,” the hackers wrote in the document they published. No user data was included, but some of those “specialized tools” linked to in the document turned out to be Bitcoin wallet-stealing malware (taken down by the host, once Redditors notified it.)

If you can’t trust an angry cryptocurrency-fanatic hacker to dump a risk-free executable file into the wild, who can you trust?

Sarcasm aside, the leaked information appears to bolster the case of those who suspect Karpeles of defrauding his customers. The way Karpeles and his lawyers told it, hackers had stolen 750,000 bitcoins belonging to MtGox’s customers and 100,000 belonging to the exchange itself, supposedly leaving nothing.

According to the data leaked on the weekend, MtGox actually still has 951,116 bitcoins. This detail is accompanied in the document by a strongly-worded suggestion that Karpeles has been less than honest. One bitcoin is currently worth around $620, so that would be roughly $590 million worth.

That said, by MtGox’s version of events, the exchange only recently noticed that the 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen a long time – perhaps even years – ago. There’s no evidence that the outfit ever conducted a proper audit of what it did and didn’t actually hold, so the possibility remains that the information leaked over the weekend is just plain wrong.

Either way, that’s not even the end of the risky business floating around the MtGox collapse. The exchange also put out a notice on Saturday, warning that its former users were being targeted by spam/phishing emails, dressed up to look like MtGox emails and asking for MtGox and bank account details.

“We highly recommend not to respond to these emails,” MtGox said in the notice. That much, certainly, is true.",

Hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US, having already filed in Japan last month, and seen its CEO’s blog vandalized with claims of exactly how much of investors’ virtual cash was lost. The bankruptcy filing, on Sunday, March 9th, follows revelations by Mt. Gox that hackers broke into its digital vaults and drained them, leaving the Japanese company $63.6m in debt.

The Japanese bankruptcy filing was made on February 28th, MarketWatch reports, but now has been extended to a US filing under Chapter 15. That’s the part of the bankruptcy process which facilitates representatives of non-US companies from accessing the US legal system, such as when assets in the US are at stake.

Whether that will mean US investors who had their bitcoins holdings stored with Mt. Gox will ever see any of their money back is unclear at this stage.

Also unclear is just how much was stolen. Mt. Gox originally declared 744,408 bitcoins had been taken, but documents acquired by hackers over the weekend claim the figure is more like 951,116. The alleged numbers – as well as other details – were posted to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ own blog.

“We stole no bitcoins” the hackers added. “There were none to steal.”",
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/10/mtgox_files_bankruptcy_us_1million_bitcoins_say_hackers/,business,"Hackers have released what they claim are genuine documents which they say prove the stricken exchange still controls almost a million Bitcoins.

As Bitcoin exchange MtGox was filing for bankruptcy in the US on Sunday, a group of hackers took over MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog, which has since been taken down, and posted a 716MB file they claimed they had snatched from MtGox's servers.

Although the document's veracity cannot be confirmed, it suggested the exchange was still in possession of 951,116 Bitcoins.

MtGox's US bankruptcy case was filed under Chapter 15, which is used to handle bankruptcy cases where parties are based in more than one country. This comes two weeks after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan.

“It’s time that MtGox got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote.

However, even if the leaked docs are genuine, it does not necessarily prove wrongdoing. It is still unclear what exactly happened to MtGox that caused it to file for bankruptcy protection. It may be that its systems still show a huge balance even though the Bitcoins have all disappeared, because any theft may not been properly recorded.

MtGox also released a statement (PDF) warning former users of a number of phishing attacks that may be directed at them.

Meanwhile, Dorian Nakamoto, the man Newsweek controversially accused of being the inventor of Bitcoin, has kept a dignified silence whilst the world frantically debates whether or not he was wrongly identified as the creator of the cryptocurrency.

Someone claiming to be Dorian's brother Arthur Nakamoto – who was supposedly quoted in the Newsweek article – took to Reddit and issued various bizarre statements about the alleged Bitcoin brainbox.

""Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exist today,"" the other supposed Nakamoto wrote. ""I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.""

He added: ""I understand that I will be mis-quoted and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. What I wanted to do is to plead to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. What's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is that I cannot physically go to to see him and my mother to be of family support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger."" ®

http://www.zdnet.com/mt-gox-files-for-bankruptcy-in-u-s-7000027136/,business,"Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.

The once-dominant Bitcoin trading post filed for Chapter 15 in the U.S. on Sunday. This particular chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.

On 28 February, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. However, by filing for Chapter 15 in the United States, foreign debtors and parties are able to use the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and systems. This means that Mt. Gox's insolvency now reaches beyond the confines of Tokyo, and the U.S. is able to work with other countries and connected parties around the world in order to better solve the case and protect the interests of all creditors as well as Mt. Gox and its remaining assets.

As Mt. Gox accounts for investors worldwide, it makes sense that this secondary bankruptcy filing has occurred. Through Chapter 15, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court will generally defer to the actions of a foreign court -- in this case, in Japan, as the primary place for bankruptcy procedures. However, when circumstances do not violate laws or public policy in the U.S., Chapter 15 also allows aid to be offered to the foreign company filing for bankruptcy protection.

The Bitcoin exchange shut down abruptly last month, closing its Twitter feed and rendering itself mute for over a week before announcing that Mt. Gox was closing its doors. In total, according to Mt. Gox's announcement that it was filing for Japanese bankruptcy protection (.PDF), approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox disappeared, which is worth roughly $500 million in today's trading rates.

Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the loss -- taking place over several years -- was due to ""weaknesses in the system"" which allowed cyberattacks and Bitcoin theft to occur.

Over the weekend , anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to Mt. Gox systems and lifted apparent evidence that customer investments were not the target of theft, but instead are still being held at the exchange as part of a fraudulent plot by Mt. Gox management.",
http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a556605/mtgox-boss-mark-karpeles-targeted-by-hackers.html,business,"MtGox boss Mark Karpeles has been targeted by hackers following the company's recent bankruptcy protection filing.

The Bitcoin magnate's personal blog and Reddit account were breached, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.



The leaked material includes an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million transactions, entries from the firm's business ledger and details about its admin software.

""It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" said the hackers in a statement accompanying the data dump.

MtGox went dark last month after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around £210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole.

""On Sunday,"" reports Forbes, ""hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users.""

The blog has since been taken down, but the hackers' message is available on Pastebin. ""It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.""

The message provides a link to a zip file. ""Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.""

The hackers also provide what they claim to be the balances of virtual currencies still existent – and it includes more than 950,000 bitcoins. This alone is proof of nothing. Forbes points out, ""I couldn’t verify that Sunday’s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox’s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins–that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.""

Nevertheless, the lack of movement for the stolen bitcoins has puzzled the community. On Friday, however, writing in Coindesk, Danny Bradbury noted that a wallet most likely owned by Mt Gox had started to be active. This wallet had been dormant until July 2012, when it started receiving small transactions. ""However,"" writes Bradbury, ""no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totaling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million).""

Since then, he continues, ""these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins.""

Why this is happening is not so clear. ""One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions,"" suggests Bradbury. Another possibility, of course, is that it also makes them harder to trace.

It is not absolutely clear that the bitcoins concerned are still 'owned' by Mt Gox, but bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell suggests they are. ""Maxwell also argued that the splitting behavior is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox,"" writes Bradbury. ""This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said.""

One thing is clear: the Mt Gox debacle is still posing more questions than it is providing answers.",

Anonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles lied about the theft of more than $500 million worth of bitcoin.

According to the hackers, Karpeles still controls all of the cryptocurrency he says was stolen recently in the biggest heist of bitcoin’s brief history. Mt. Gox was the world’s largest bitcoin exchange until about 850,000 bitcoin were allegedly stolen during a breach, forcing the exchange to shut down and file for bankruptcy protection.

According to new claims from anonymous hackers, however, the heist never occurred and Karpeles still controls nearly 1 million bitcoin worth approximately $596 million at Monday’s exchange rate.

According to a report from Forbes, the anonymous hackers took over Karpeles’s blog and published a post supposedly exposing fraud committed by the CEO. The post was also published on Pastebin.

“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] bitcoin community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote. “This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of [our] ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than [we] would have liked to verify the data.”

The hackers’ note was accompanied by a file containing what they claim to be evidence of fraud. They say that they have managed to obtain various personal data belonging to Karpeles, including what they claim to be evidence that Mt. Gox’s current bitcoin balance is in fact 951,116, which would mean that the 850,000 bitcoin the exchange claimed was stolen is still in its control.

As Forbes noted, however, the evidence may in fact simply reveal remarkably poor accounting practices at Mt. Gox, a former hub for trading “Magic: The Gathering” cards, rather than fraud.",

They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox’s claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.

Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.

Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.

Karpeles’ blog was titled “Magical Tux in Japan—Geekness brought me to Japan!” Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname “MagicalTux” when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline on Sunday shortly after it was attacked.

Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.

The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users’ personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.

The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles’ CV and a Windows executable called “TibanneBackOffice,” among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.

The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.

Mt. Gox’s demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin’s public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.

One of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.

Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.

The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin’s core software who’ve said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.

Follow the money

Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.

The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user’s public bitcoin “address” or “wallet,” which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.

Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox’s bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.

In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.

At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.

The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million.

Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.

“There’s a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it’s very, very difficult, and it’s tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it’s just obvious,” he said.

The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cybercrime thefts on record.

An academic paper published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.

“For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,” they wrote.

Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.

“A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,” said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. “This is serious money for serious people.”

Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.

If that’s the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.",

Original Story:

One of the things that's been puzzling the Bitcoin community is, if the Mt Gox wallet really was emptied by person or persons unknown, where did all the coins go? You'd think a transaction of that size would show up in the public ledger of transactions, runs the theory. Those of you following all things Bitcoin related may remember that other self-appointed investigators followed a very similar theory searching for Sheep Marketplace's Bitcoin, with dismal results. Now some of Mt Gox's customers have hacked the personal blog and Reddit account of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpales, posting what they claim is evidence of fraud. Or, as they prefer to put it, evidence that they've been Goxed.

The hackers posted messages, since removed from Karpales' blog and Reddit, claiming that they had discovered where Karpales stored the loot. The hackers claim Karpales kept back 951,116 Bitcoin, though this claim may not be all it seems.

For one, as Forbes points out, the spreadsheet posted by the hackers may simply indicate how badly Mt Gox dropped the ball; that all those figures show is what Mt Gox thought it had, not what it actually possessed.

For another, the information posted seems to be infested with Trojans. The posts included genuine Mt Gox data mixed in with a healthy helping of .exe and Mac.app files, some of which are actually Bitcoin stealing viruses disguised as back office tools. Should you go looking for the files yourself, you're advised not to open them.

One poster says that the data was obtained by installing a rootkit months ago on one of Mt Gox's servers via known Gentoo Linux distribution flaws, and the installation was successful because Karpales didn't bother to update. This same poster, nanashi, claimed to have access to much of Mt Gox's customer data in a 20GB stolen database, possibly including bank details, passwords, usernames, even passport scans. Nanashi offered this database for sale for 100 Bitcoin. ""Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure,"" he says.

Last week, Canadian-based online bitcoin bank Flexcoin was forced to close down after losing about $600,000 in the virtual currency to hackers. The shuttering came hot on the heels of the collapse of MtGox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan at the end of last month after someone hacked into its system and stole some 850,000 bitcoins, representing around 7 percent of the estimated global total of the digital currency.



For the beleaguered bitcoin market, these thefts are just the tip of the iceberg. Unless bitcoin can recover its credibility, these recent setbacks could mark its demise.



For a decentralized currency like bitcoin, confidence means everything. When hacker attacks caused several bitcoin exchanges, including MtGox, to suspend withdrawals of the currency in February, its value plummeted down below $600, compared to a peak of $1,124 in late November.



Since its introduction in 2009, bitcoin has become increasingly popular thanks to its ease of global transaction, difficulty in counterfeiting, high standardization, decentralization and inflation immunity due to a hard limit of 21 million. Compared to real-world currencies, perhaps the most unique feature of bitcoins is its decentralization, which means that the value of the digital currency is set independently of any bank or government.



However, the decentralized nature of bitcoin is also a fatal flaw for the crypto-currency as there's nothing real to support its credibility; unlike gold for example, which is a physical commodity that has intrinsic value. As bitcoins do not have a financially sound issuer or any institutional valuation basis, its price could be very volatile and easily affected by outside factors. Looking back, losses of bitcoins to hackers have happened several times in the past, shaking investor confidence and causing sharp plunges in its prices. So for a currency which relies on user trust, if its credibility foundation is compromised, then its value would suffer enormously.



In the meantime, hacker attacks are just one of the risks facing bitcoins. Since the online virtual currency has aroused concerns over financial stability, money laundering and other illegal activities, many governments are considering restrictions against bitcoins.



Unlike a traceable credit card or online banking transfer, bitcoin transactions are relatively similar to cash transactions in that they are both nearly impossible to trace. The Silk Road, an eBay-like bitcoin exchange that included listings for guns and heroin, was recently shut down by the US authorities, Reuters reported.



Meanwhile, Canada was said to be tightening rules to keep closer track of virtual currencies to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Also, in December 2013, the largest bitcoin exchange in China was required to stop accepting deposits in renminbi, a move which drove prices down considerably. Given investor complaints pertaining to the collapse of MtGox, more regulatory scrutiny and restrictions could be expected in the coming years.



While hacker attacks and tightened regulations may hurt its value, bitcoin copycats are meanwhile undermining its status as a unique virtual currency. Even though only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created, the crypto-currency market can expand limitlessly as new alternatives to bitcoins can always be created without laws or regulations to stop copycats.



In the wake of bitcoin's success last year, a variety of competing crypto-currencies were quickly introduced. In fact, there were already more than 140 copycats by the end of 2013.



In this sense, it could be just a matter of time before bitcoins lose their uniqueness. Take litecoin, currently the most popular bitcoin alternative, as an example. By the end of last year, the total circulation value of litecoin had exceeded $1 billion.



Nonetheless, bitcoin is an obvious breakthrough in terms of financial market innovation. Maybe its most fundemental problem now is that it's too surreal and forward-looking, at least from the point of view of existing political and economic establishments. While bitcoin hints at future evolutions in the world financial market, it may be too early yet for the world to completely embrace it.

Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the exchange was hit by continued distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, during which hackers take control of computers to send large amount of data to a target, resulting in servers to crash.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many bitcoins were stolen from Mt. Gox, according to the newspaper.

Mt Gox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to DDoS attacks. The company has filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.

The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m, £38m, €46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.

Problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers reportedly manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins.

Known as ""transaction malleability"", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.

The exchange's collapse questioned the reliability of bitcoin that suffered a plunge in prices subsequently.

Separate investigations are underway in Japan and the US against Mt. Gox.

UK-based law firm Selachii said earlier that more than 400 people are willing to join a class action in London against Mt. Gox and its owners.

Bitcoin was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers. They can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, reducing fees involved in the services significantly.

The digital currency gained more popularity and value as more and more merchants started accepting bitcoins, boosting investors' morale.

However, a number of adverse incidents including the Mt. Gox debacle questioned the digital currency's reliability.

Governments across the globe have made different decisions regarding businesses related to bitcoin. While some have banned all dealings in the currency, some others have come up with pro-active policies that consider bitcoin firms just like any other tax-compliant companies.",

At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.

Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.

""There's a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it's very, very difficult, and it's tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it's just obvious,"" he said.

The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cyber crime thefts on record.

An academic paper published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.

""For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,"" they wrote.

Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.

""A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,"" said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. ""This is serious money for serious people.""

Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.

If that's the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.

Hackers have taken over some of the web accounts of Mark Karpeles - boss of the troubled MtGox Bitcoin exchange.

The attack on Mr Karpeles seems to have been motivated by growing frustration over the actions of MtGox.

Last month MtGox stopped trading and filed for bankruptcy after finding out that $465m (£279m) in bitcoins had been lost via a security bug.

Many have called on the exchange to release more information about what happened to the lost bitcoins.

The attacks were mounted on the personal blog and Reddit account of Mr Karpeles and left the hackers in charge of both social media accounts.

The attackers used their access to grab detailed information about trading activity at MtGox. They then shared their findings by posting a 716MB file containing much of what they had found.

The material posted included an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million trades, entries from MtGox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.

""It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed,"" wrote the hackers in a message accompanying the data dump. The word ""Goxed"" has been used to describe the sudden interruptions in trading MtGox imposed when it was going through technical problems before its final closure.

It was not yet clear whether the information dumps were real or shed new light on what had happened at the exchange, said Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg.

He pointed out that although $465m in bitcoins (approximately 744,000 coins) had supposedly gone astray from MtGox, no activity suggesting they had been traded had been seen in the blockchain - the central list of buying and selling that underpins the entire Bitcoin network.",

http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9246842/Mt._Gox_CEO_39_s_blog_goes_blank_after_alleged_hack,business,"Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.

They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox's claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.

Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.

Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.

One of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.

Karpeles' blog was titled ""Magical Tux in Japan -- Geekness brought me to Japan!"" Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname ""MagicalTux"" when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline Sunday shortly after it was attacked.

Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.

The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users' personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.

The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles' CV and a Windows executable called ""TibanneBackOffice,"" among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.

The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.

Mt. Gox's demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin's public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.

Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.

The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin's core software who've said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.

Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.

The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user's public bitcoin ""address"" or ""wallet,"" which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.

Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox's bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.

The site's owners said in February 744,408 bitcoins were stolen due to a glitch in the Bitcoin protocol and took the site down, but updates were scarce since then.

Now, unidentified hackers claim they have data, including database dumps, that proves Mt. Gox's owners actually kept the bitcoins for themselves.

According to a report by Forbes, Hackers claim to have stolen the data from Mt. Gox's servers; they also took control of CEO Mark Karpeles' Reddit account and personal blog.

""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" hackers wrote, claiming no user database dumps have been included.

The data comprises of a spreadsheet of more than a million trades on Mt. Gox as well as a 716MB file that appears to show Mt. Gox's balance in 18 currencies, including bitcoin. The file points to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox, with a note saying ""That fat f*ck has been lying."" At the current exchange rate on bitcoin exchange BTC-e.com, that amount of bitcoins is worth approximately $595 million.

Early reports on Reddit claim the database file is genuine, but it's hard to confirm anything at this point, especially since many of the related posts on Reddit have been deleted.

Mt.Gox did not directly respond to the incident, but it did put a warning notice over the weekend, claiming that phishing emails impersonating Mt.Gox were being sent to users and warning them not to respond to these emails.",
http://www.zdnet.com/hackers-allege-mt-gox-ceo-still-controls-stolen-bitcoin-7000027137/,business,"Following the closure of Mt. Gox and the theft of Bitcoins worth millions, anonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that customer Bitcoin is not missing -- but instead is held at the heart of attempted fraud.

Last month, the abrupt closure and week-long silence of Mt. Gox and its team frustrated, confused and angered investors. Once the dominant trading post for the cryptocurrency, Mt. Gox closed its doors after saying that cybercriminals managed to steal approximately 850,000 BTC, worth over $500 million, in cyberattacks taking place over several years.

Company CEO Mark Karpeles said Bitcoins were lost ""due to weaknesses in the system,"" and while Mt. Gox has now filed for bankruptcy in Japan, thousands of users have been left out of pocket -- as well as in the dark over their investments' future.

Now embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings, Karpeles and Mt. Gox staff have gone quiet, but this hasn't stopped other parties from trying to get to the bottom of the issue. Over the weekend, anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to the trading post and accessed to Mt. Gox data. After taking over Karpeles' blog and Reddit account over the weekend, on Pastebin, the group who broke in to the system said:

""It’s time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin communities' wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data [...] Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.""

According to Forbes, the 716 megabyte file dump appears to include personal data including Karpeles’ home address and resume, an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, Mt. Gox's Bitcoin balance and screenshots of the hackers' access to such information through database cracking.

Within the Pastebin summary, the hackers claim that the trading posts' current balance is 951,116 BTC, which if true, means that customer Bitcoin has not been lost -- and therefore fraud has been committed.

It is worth noting that this leak could show nothing more than poor accountancy practices -- one aspect of the company which has been reported as a crucial factor which led to the original cyberattacks going unnoticed for so long -- and the database may only show Bitcoins that were believed to be safe but were already gone. However, since Mt. Gox has filed for bankruptcy protection, the public ledger of Bitcoin transactions -- the Bitcoin blockchain -- has not registered the movement of ""stolen"" coins.

In related news, whether or not Mt. Gox personnel have sought to capitalize on their customers, cybercriminals have jumped upon the demise of the Bitcoin trading post in their own way to profit.

According to a press release (.PDF) issued by Mt. Gox, phishing campaigns have been making the rounds. Within the spam emails, hackers have used Mt. Gox's identity and asked for the name, address, username, password and bank account numbers of those who have lost Bitcoin.",

Over the weekend hackers released information they claim shows Karpeles continues to lie about the amount of bitcoin stolen from the exchange, however the continuing uncertainty over what exactly happened at Mt. Gox doesn't seem to have impacted the value of cryptocurrencies in general.

According to stats from CoinMarketCap.com, bitcoin's value rose 3% in the last 24 hours to $640, continuing to show resilience in the face of the Mt. Gox uncertainty. While the cryptocurrency is still some way off its high of $1,200, it is proving some naysayers wrong by remaining relatively stable in the face of widespread upheaval.

Bitcoin's relative stability has buoyed the rest of the cryptocurrency market, with 11 of the top 15 mineable cryptocurrencies showing a rise in value in the last day.

The big winner however was the eco-focused mintcoin which rose some 30% in value in the last 24 hours.

Hackers claim Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles is lying

Over the weekend hackers posted account transaction information from beleaguered Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.

The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.

The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called ""Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!"" and posted the stolen information there.

Karpeles is remaining silent about the accusations for now.

The bitcoin-friendly gunstore

The reputation of bitcoin was for years hampered by its connection to illicit marketplaces on the dark web - such as Silk Road - where you could anonymously buy everything from drugs to machine guns.

Now one businessman is looking to get remove that stigma by allowing people to purchase guns using bitcoin directly in its store. The firearm shop and training centre Central Texas Gunworks , based in Austin, has installed a bitcoin ATM to allow those wishing to purchase a gun using the cryptocurrency to do so.

However, unlike on the dark web, you won't be able to buy any firearms anonymously as the same paperwork and background checks required of anyone will still apply. Even online buyers can only have firearms shipped to a nearby gun store where the same legal process applies.

Dogecoin on BitPay before Litecoin

According to a comment from the CEO of Bitcoin payment processor startup BitPay, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin could be the next virtual currency accepted on the platform – even before the world's second biggest cryptocurrency litecoin.

Reddit user and dogecoin enthusiast jimmy0x52 claims to have spoken to CEO of BitPay Tony Gallippi at music, film, and interactive conference SXSW which is taking place in Texas this week. Gallippi is reported to have said:

""Think about the consumer - if they have LTC [litecoin] they have BTC [bitcoin]. Doge is really popular and a whole new marketplace currency""

This is contrary to a tweet from BitPay in February, when it said: ""Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow.""

Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow. — BitPay (@bitpay) February 13, 2014

BitPay has yet to officially confirm its plans for accepting other cryptocurrencies, but with more than 10,000 bitcoin-accepting merchants on its books, the addition of dogecoin to a platform like BitPay could be huge for the young cryptocurrency.",

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.

While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.

Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.

MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.

Given how much Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has lost, both in terms of money and trust, it was only a matter of time before hackers struck back. Now such a group of enraged victims have hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles’ own blog to reveal just how much the company really lost.

Mt. Gox’s fall from grace is a matter of public knowledge, but the true extent of the damages incurred by the company is unsurprisingly kept behind closed doors. In fact, the entire company’s strategy in dealing with its financial, and now legal, problems were supposed to be a secret until a “crisis strategy draft” document was leaked.

The document details the steps the company needs to take in order to appear less culpable, starting from inexplicably disappearing from the Internet, stepping down from the Bitcoin Foundation board, issuing a vague statement explaining the disappearance, and filing for bankruptcy, all of which took place the past weeks. Also notable in that document was the admission that Mt. Gox lost as much as 744,408 bitcoins due to a bug, amounting to around $340 million at that time. It seems, however, that the real, undisclosed figures are far worse.

Hackers dived into Mt. Gox’s database not to steal bitcoins, or so the hackers said, but to get their hands on databases that will reveal the truth. With a hint of poetic justice, these same hackers used Karpeles’ blog to post database dumps and other files that they were able to acquire. Among those is a list of the actual Bitcoin balances, which revealed the real number to be 951,116 bitcoins. That amount is a far cry from that in the leaked document as well as the numbers given by Mt. Gox itself when it filed for bankruptcy.

Karpeles’s blog has been taken down now but, under the exhortation of the hackers, the data has been mirrored and made available elsewhere for others to see and review, including anonymized user accounts and their balances. Although the hackers claim that no user database dump has been made public, the incident demonstrates how Mt. Gox’s security can be so easily compromised, which is how it ended up in trouble in the first place.

The Yomiuri Shimbun's English-language Japan News reports that the attacks in early February reached 150,000 DDOS hits per second, “mostly from servers in the United States and Europe”.

Japan News notes that it doesn't require any special skill to launch a DDOS attack, citing Tetsutaro Uehara, a professor of information security at Ritsumeikan University: “DDoS attacks can be done without high-level hacking techniques.”

Referring to attacks on Slovenian Bitstamp and Canada's Flexcoin, Uehara said: “It is possible that copycats turned their eyes on other exchanges after weaknesses in Mt. Gox’s system were found.”

By February 10, Mt Gox threw its hands up in the air and suspended Bitcoin withdrawals. It later emerged that attackers had found a way to exploit the Mt Gox code to steal 850,000 Bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Of the stolen Bitcoins, 750,000 belonged to customers and 100,000 were Mt Gox's own holdings.

The most important number, obviously, is the 951,116.21905382 balance. As you recall, Mt.Gox filed for bankruptcy while stating a 850,000 BTC loss. This would suggest Karpeles’ estimates were off by a large margin. Whether all of this is accurate or not is an entirely different manner. What the leak does show us is how easy it was to grab nearly all of Mt.Gox’s user data as well as how hardened Karpeles’ blog was. Furthermore, the files contain the app Mt.Gox admins used to manage transfers. A screenshot appears below.

Bitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when Mt. Gox, the world’s largest exchange, defaulted on $470 million worth of deposits and closed. The virtual currency was supposed to provide a safer, more private and less costly alternative to money issued by governments, but lacking the imprimatur of a sovereign is failing. Fundamentally, money provides a secure place to keep your wealth—you can store your savings for later use at a government guaranteed bank. And it eliminates the inconvenience of barter—a necessity for even the most rudimentary market economy. Money permits a nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker who gets his music from iTunes. All accept dollars, because the U.S. government declares those to be “legal tender for all debts public and private.” You can do business through barter or some alternative currency. However, workers, suppliers and landlords expect to be paid in dollars, and the IRS will require dollars at tax time for income earned through barter. What gives money its value are the goods and services that may be purchased and taxes paid within the sovereign jurisdiction of the issuing government. The earliest currencies were coins, often with the face of the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence. Yet, governments minted coins with non-precious metals, and the Chinese issued paper money more than two thousand years ago. The creators of Bitcoin and advocates of virtual currencies are fixated by the temptation of governments to print too much and destroy its value through inflation. However, inflation is hardly a problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries hold dollars, euro and yen to back up their currencies. Bitcoin is created by ordinary folks solving increasingly difficult mathematical problems defined by the virtual currency’s creator, and like gold, is naturally limited in supply. It is stored in virtual wallets on private computers, or deposited at exchanges like Mt. Gox. These function much like commercial banks but are not guaranteed for safety by the FDIC, Federal Reserve and similar regulatory agencies around the world. There is no “Bitland” where a government has declared it legal tender to buy goods and services and pay taxes. Lacking such a tangible connection to the real economy, it is very hard to value day-to-day, never mind next year. Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands only about half that amount. It is no place for your children’s college fund or retirement savings. Bitcoin is hardly secure. A hacker can steal it from your digital wallet or an exchange that holds your deposits, just as pirates stole bank debit and credit card numbers from Target. And the government does not stand ready to back up Bitcoin exchanges that lose your money or identity to thieves. A 2013 study found some 45 percent of all Bitcoin exchanges closed, taking their depositors money with them. Bitcoin is supposed to be more private, because unlike commercial banks, its exchanges are not monitored by regulators, and its private payments system charges lower fees than do Visa and MasterCard. However, personal and business transactions can be spied by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments system. The government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your exchange when it needs. Factoring in such risks and potential intrusions, Bitcoin is a lot less private and more expensive to use than advertised. Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a currency accepted and secure—the government guarantee and the good sense of the sovereign not to abuse its franchise. It’s not the gold but the face of Caesar—the promise his image carries—that makes a coin money.

The recent bankruptcy of the Bitcoin exchange has many up in arms and some are deciding to get answers on their own. Some of the data released and posted on Reddit has already been taken down. Greenberg reached out to disgraced Mt.Gox C.E.O. Mark Karpeles but has yet to get a reply back.

From the article:

The Bitcoin community has been angrily pressing for details on what the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has described as a massive hacker attack that stole hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its users’ bitcoins and left the company bankrupt. Mt. Gox’s staff isn’t talking. So another group of hackers say they’ve broken into the company’s servers to provide answers of their own.

On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox’s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. “It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be “goxed”–to suffer from Mt. Gox’s technical glitches.",

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted losing half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since about February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reports.

While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.

Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.

The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said on Sunday.

MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with about 100,000 units the company owned.

Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.

After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $US40 a coin in late 2012 and $US1100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.

Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.

US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.",

Gox lost hundreds of millions of dollars in a security lapse, hackers hit the personal blog of Bitcoin exchange's chief executive to level charges of fraud.

The Reddit account and personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, MagicalTux.net, were hijacked Sunday and defaced with a post that alleged the exchange kept some of the coins allegedly stolen in fraudulent withdrawals. Hackers also posted a 716MB Zip file that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox servers on the sites as well as to Pastebin.

The data dump claims that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The embattled exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, saying that Mt. Gox lost nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.

""First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles,"" hackers wrote. ""It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed."" The phrase ""getting Goxed"" has become synonymous with the frustration felt by many Mt. Gox investors, who have suffered frequent outages, delayed trading, and suspended withdrawals.

""Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,"" the hackers wrote their profanity-laced diatribe. ""No user database dumps have been included.""

CNET could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims, but some Reddit users said they were able to confirm that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, which was posted in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.

CNET has contacted Mt. Gox for comment and will update this report when we learn more.

At its height, Mt. Gox was one of the largest and most popular Bitcoin exchanges. However, the troubled exchange suspended customer withdrawals on February 7, claiming a fundamental flaw existed in Bitcoin that affected all transactions. Mt. Gox later apologized for the issue and said it had developed a workaround that would allow it to resume service, but that has not yet happened.

Due to the currency's encryption technology, it might be difficult, if not impossible, for the stolen bitcoins to be restored to their owners' accounts, leaving people across the globe with significant losses.",

After seizing control, the hackers posted (Pastebin) a message to the two spaces detailing their findings and the reasoning behind the attack.

""It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities [sic] wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,"" the message reads. ""This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data... Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.""

Forbes reports the 716 megabyte file placed on Karpeles' site included items like his home address, CV, and an Excel spreadsheet that seems to document more than a million trades. But the most interesting piece of information shared is a summary of 18 different currency balances—with 951,116 bitcoins listed. In light of the 850,000 bitcoins supposedly lost in the recent attack, the hackers concluded this figure demonstrates fraud. The footnote reads, ""That fat fuck has been lying!!""

Despite the hack making noise around the Internet today, this leak is not yet guaranteed evidence of foul play. As Forbes notes, the balances could be a case of awful bookkeeping (it's not too far-fetched that MtGox was unaware of the hack for a while), and Karpeles has yet to return that site's request for comment.",

The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February, was hit with crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.

During DDoS attacks, hackers take control of multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, causing servers to crash and making websites unavailable.

Lawyers for MtGox said that during the attacks, which lasted for several days, 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers were stolen, worth an estimated $575m (£344m).

Unlike traditional currencies, which are backed by central banks, Bitcoin is created by complex interactions between a large network of computers across the globe.

Janet Yellen, head of the US Federal Reserve, said that it has no control over virtual currencies which are not backed by any central authorities. Several countries, such as Russia and China, have placed heavy restrictions on how Bitcoin can be used.

MtGox was founded in 2010 by programmer Jed McCaleb, who sold the company to Tibanne Co. in March 2011. It became the world’s largest marketplace for Bitcoins, handling an estimated 80pc of all transactions of the digital currency.

Last week, more than 400 people signalled that they would join a class action lawsuit against MtGox, according to British law firm Selachii.

It is the latest effort to try to reclaim some of the hundreds of thousands of lost Bitcoins from the exchange.

Richard Howlett, co-founder of Selachii, said: “On the back of the MtGox collapse, a lot of people say they feel the truth is not being stated.”

Mark Karpeles, chief executive of MtGox, apologised for the collapse at a news conference earlier this month, blaming a “weakness in our system”, but predicted that the market will grow.",

http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-international/uks-first-bitcoin-machine-opens-in-east-london-caf,business,"Britain’s first machine for dispensing digital currency opened for business in a cafe near London’s “Silicon roundabout” tech hub in east London on Friday, offering customers the ability to exchange bank notes for bitcoins.

Nick Letchford, managing director of the group that owns the Old Shoreditch Station cafe, decided to install the machine after noticing the popularity of bitcoins among his customers working nearby in the digital industries.

“It gets used regularly based on where we are located,” he said. “There are lots of technology-orientated consumers within our area, and it caters very easily for them,” he said.

“Currently people are buying coffees and beers with bitcoins, mostly beers actually,” Letchford added.

He sees a mainstream future for the virtual currency, even though the top bitcoin exchange has collapsed and the currency has been volatile due to speculation as well as prone to criminal activities.

At the beginning of March, the Tokyo-based company Mt. Gox, once the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange, declared bankruptcy saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.

In 2012, a leaked FBI report said the virtual currency was an “increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm”.

Bitcoin, which has been growing in popularity, relies on a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction.

The currency came into existence in 2009, with the value negotiated by individuals chatting on bitcoin forums. The whistle-blowing site Wikileaks and other organisations began to accept the currency for donations, and by the end of 2012 some 1,000 organisations had followed suit.

Customers who use the machine in East London are charged an 8 percent commission, and each customer is limited to 1,000 pounds ($1,700) in transactions per month.

“I think it is very much a burgeoning thing,” Letchford said. It’s not mainstream in any way, but I think from a vendor’s perspective it is so straightforward and simple. There is a future in it as it becomes embraced by the mainstream.”",

It's in good company, joining Seattle and Austin, which were the first cities to host pop-up Bitcoin ATMs last month.

The cash machine can be found inside the Old Shoreditch Cafe and Bar, and lets people top-up their Bitcoin wallets easily by scanning the QR code from their Bitcoin wallet, where they can insert up to £1,000 in cash, and bam! Instant Bitcoin. Sadly it doesn't work the other way around, as the cafe's owner, Joel Raziel, has decided against letting people use the machine to swap their Bitcoins for real cash.

The machine has apparently been a big success, with one nutter man coming all the way from Manchester for the chance to use the machine. Raziel hopes that the machine will catch on in other parts of the country, and it's probably not the worst thing that Shoreditch can offer the world, all things considered. But with Bitcoin's mysterious founder being outed, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox collapsing, and the Winklevoss twins using it to pay Richard Branson for a galactic flight (virtually killing it with their uncoolness), we're not too confident this ATM will last past summer.

http://www.rightsidenews.com/2014030833964/us/economics/bitcoin-banking-and-deposit-security.html,business,"A currency is only as safe as the bank that stores it. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the recent turmoil in the bitcoin community.

One the primary advantages of bitcoin, perhaps even the greatest advantage of the cryptocurrency, is the ability to do away with traditional banking institutions. By providing an option to transfer payments peer-to-peer at low cost and with great ease, bitcoins allow the currency user full autonomy in not only how he uses his cash, but also how others use it along the payments system. Indeed, the initial marvel of the bitcoin protocol from a purely technological point-of-view was the solution to the double-spending problem when making payments using a peer-to-peer system.

On 7 February of this year, Mt. Gox – a bitcoin exchange which essentially functioned as a depository (i.e., bank) for bitcoins – halted all withdrawals in the crypotcurrency. At the time I wrote two articles making a pretty clear case for Mt. Gox operating like a run-of-the-mill fractional-reserve bank (here and here).

Fractional-reserve banks that existed before the advent of deposit insurance were constrained by some real pressures as they decreased their reserves. As depositors became less sure that they would be able to access their deposits on demand, they would start demanding the fractional-reserve bank’s services at a discount to its competitors. As depositors started withdrawing their funds and endangered the liquidity and eventual solvency of the bank, the bank would react by either halting withdrawals outright (as Mt. Gox did on February 7), or temporarily delaying them while remunerating the client with an interest payment (i.e., enact a “option clause”, something Mt. Gox effectively did by charging clients an extra fee if they wanted their withdrawals expedited.)

The claim that Mt. Gox was operating with fractional reserves came as shocking to some. After all, the exchange functioned by providing a shared wallet for depositors. Each time a deposit was made in bitcoin, the proceeds were moved to the shared wallet. This wallet was safely stored offline (“cold storage”) so that hackers could not gain access to them. In addition, a very high percentage of bitcoin was supposedly stored in this way – up to 98% by some claims – with only a small amount held online to facilitate withdrawals and other transactions.

In theory, since almost all of the bitcoin were held safely offline by Mt. Gox, the “bitcoin bank” should have been behaving like any standard full-reserve bank. The evidence over the past months proved this to be anything but the reality of the situation.

On 28 February Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy, with its liabilities amounting to about 2.65 trillion Japanese Yen ($25 billion) more than its assets. Also unaccounted for were about 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins and 100,000 of its own bitcoins. This amounted to 7% of the total bitcoins in existence at the time, with a dollar value of nearly $500 million.

Mt. Gox believes “there is a high possibility that the Bitcoins were stolen.” As far as I am concerned, it doesn´t matter too much if the bitcoins were stolen by a third party, or used in some way by Mt. Gox as would be the case with most other fractional-reserve banks. The fact of the matter is that the bitcoins are not in the vault, and that has created the difficulties the exchange´s clients currently find themselves embroiled in.

Of course, it wouldn´t be the first time that a bank had its bitcoins stolen. Flexcoin – a Canadian outfit that actually referred to itself as a “bitcoin bank” – has just closed its doors for good. Apparently 896 BTC (over half a million dollars) were removed from its online storage. Hackers attacking coins held online are a continual and well-noted threat to the bitcoin community. For this reason many exchanges, like Mt. Gox and Flexcoin, secured their bitcoins in cold storage, an unconnected hard drive safe from the dangers lurking online.

Indeed, Flexcoin has pledged to return all bitcoins that it held in cold storage provided that the identity of their true owner is confirmed. All at no cost, no less!

Mt. Gox is a little different. Despite holding the vast majority of its bitcoin securely in cold storage, its claim is that somehow these were stolen by someone. In standard fractional-reserve banking theory, the reason a less than 100% reserve is held is because the bank has knowingly made use of the deposited goods, not because hackers have prevailed in cracking an impervious safe. The dust will settle on what happened to the bitcoins deposited with Mt. Gox. For now I will let Occam´s razor prevail in providing me with an answer to the whereabouts of the missing coins.

It´s neither here nor there what happened to the lost bitcoins. (Unless you are one of the unlucky ones who entrusted them to a bitcoin bank and lost them.) The real lesson is that the actual good used as “money” is largely inconsequential relative to the banking system that manages it.

Bitcoin has been heralded as a free-market alternative form of money. We should hope so! Away from the central control of any one government, the cryptocurrency is an example of a free market´s response to an imperfect publically provided good. This great achievement of bitcoin is largely lost on those who have lost their savings because of a fractional-reserve bank.

When banks operate with fractional-reserves, whether those reserves are defined in fiat currency, bitcoins or gold, bad things happen. At the very least, that should be the real lesson we can take away from the misfortune befalling the empty-pocketed depositors of Mt. Gox.

Bitcoin is not a currency but transactions involving it should be ""subject to taxation"", Japan's government said Friday, in a move that could pave the way for formal regulations on the troubled virtual unit, AFP reports.Tokyo also said that banks could not broker Bitcoin transactions or open accounts holding the virtual unit, which launched just five years ago, in an apparent bid to clamp down on the digital currency.But, as regulators around the world grapple with how to handle Bitcoin, the Japanese statement did not specify if Tokyo would immediately begin cracking down on it, or how it would do so, given the unit's opaque nature.Bitcoin ""does not fall under the category of a currency"" as defined by Japanese law, the government statement said, echoing the views of central banks in other countries.And ""generally speaking it is subject to taxation if it meets conditions laid out in income tax law, corporate tax law and sales tax law, among others"", the statement added.If Bitcoin transactions were used for money laundering ""that would constitute a crime"", it said, adding that ""there are no Japanese laws that clearly define Bitcoin"".""As a matter of common sense, if there are transactions and subsequent gains, it is natural... for the finance ministry to consider how it can impose taxes,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Friday.Asked whether Japan would become a global leader on regulating Bitcoin, Suga said: ""We are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do.""Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.Last week, the spectacular failure of the Japan-based MtGox trading exchange set off alarm bells over Bitcoin, which backers have promoted as a low-cost alternative to fiat currencies such as the US dollar or Japanese yen.US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.Yellen has said US regulators, including the Treasury, are watching the Bitcoin sector for potential money laundering and other criminal uses of the digital currency.MtGox, which at one time reportedly processed 80 percent of global Bitcoin transactions, last week sought bankruptcy protection and admitted that it lost half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency.Suga said Friday that Japanese officials were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.This week, an alleged theft of $600,000 worth of the currency by hackers forced a Canada-based online business serving Bitcoin traders and investors to shut down.In more misfortune linked with the troubled currency, Singapore police on Thursday said they were investigating the ""unnatural""death of a 28-year-old American boss of a Bitcoin exchange.Autumn Radtke, chief executive of Singapore-based First Meta, was found dead on February 26, but no foul play was suspected, police said.Also on Thursday, Newsweek claimed it had found the true identity of the mysterious person or group behind the Bitcoin revolution -- ""Satoshi Nakamoto"", a 64-year-old, Japanese-American physicist and model train enthusiast.Nakamoto has denied being involved in Bitcoin.The Bitcoin Foundation, which supports the development of the currency, would not confirm Newsweek's story.After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $650 level.",

http://www.moneynews.com/Markets/bitcoin-digital-currency-mt-gox-japan/2014/03/07/id/556606,business,"A week after the collapse of Mt. Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.

In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered - or more often, not covered - by existing law.

The issue took on new prominence in Japan on Feb. 28, when Mt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.

Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, ""we have not grasped the situation in its entirety.""

The authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.

Fewer than 1 percent of Mt. Gox's 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.

""It's not money,"" said Finance Minister Taro Aso. ""Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?"" he asked at a regular news conference. ""Opinions are divided.""

The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.

But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.

Regarding money laundering, certain transactions - whether with bitcoin or not - require people to identify themselves, it notes.

The 6-page document is the government's official response to questions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.",

http://qz.com/185319/japan-just-realized-that-its-now-the-center-of-the-bitcoin-universe/,business,"Japan has become perhaps the world’s most important locale for bitcoin, the digital currency that was supposed to liberate its users from the tyranny of geography—and its government is playing catch-up.

This week the creator of bitcoin has been allegedly unmasked as a Japanese-born Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, who was “descended from samurai and the son of a buddhist priest,” according to Newsweek. The media circus around Nakamoto, who has denied Newsweek’s claims, comes as the bitcoin world is still reeling from the failure of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which went from being the world’s biggest bitcoin exchange to an ignoble bankruptcy last week.

It was the failure of Mt. Gox that finally spurred prime minister Shinzo Abe’s government to issue its first major proclamation about bitcoin on March 7, and it’s fair to say that Japan’s stance is still a work in progress.

Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that bitcoin would be treated as a commodity, not as a currency, and “as a matter of common sense” it would be “natural” for the government to tax bitcoin transactions. But the government also said it was still gathering information on bitcoin—including an attempt to determine the total volume and value of bitcoins in circulation. The total number of Japanese bitcoin owners is also not clear.

“We are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do,” Suga added.

Japan’s financial institutions have also been grappling with how to deal with bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported that Mizuho Bank, which handled wire transfers and other business from Mt. Gox, repeatedly asked the exchange to shut down its account (paywall) because of an “unmanageable volume of money transfers,” many of them between Mt. Gox and its international customers.

The Japanese government issued a statement earlier this week that it does not prohibit financial firms from investing funds in bitcoin, but they are banned from exchanging between bitcoins and conventional currencies.

At least a few Japanese bitcoin owners are still optimistic despite the events of the last few weeks. Keiichi Hida of the Japan Digital Money Association, who lost¥100,000 ($980) when Mt. Gox failed, told Reuters, “We should make it a national project to have bitcoin used nationwide at the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” he said. “I think then everyone would come to Tokyo in an instant.”",

The UK's first Bitcoin cash machine has been installed in London - allowing people to exchange their digital credits for cash and vice-versa.

Users of the digital-only currency keep their Bitcoins in virtual online wallets and until now used specialist software on their mobile phones or computers to transfer funds to others.

But now Bitcoin has launched its first cash machine in the UK located at the Old Shoreditch Cafe and bar in east London.

And it is no surprise that the location has been chosen due to the cafe accepting Bitcoins as payment since last year.

The bitcoin dispensers will also scan government-issued identification such as a driver's licence or a passport to confirm users' identities.

The custom-designed app is run from essentially a Google Nexus 7 tablet and additional hardware to scan QR codes.

Customers use a mobile wallet app on their phone to display a QR code pointing to their Bitcoin wallet, which the cash machine scans and sends money to.

Paying by Bitcoin is faster for customers than using a traditional debit or credit card.

Transaction fees are also lower than the 2–3 per cent imposed by credit card companies.

The cash machine charges a eight per cent commission but this is hoped to be reduced once the machine, which is currently manually topped up is converted to automated.

Transactions are limited to £1,000 per month for each customer.

What is a Bitcoin ?

Bitcoin is an internet currency that is created using an increasingly complex mathematics formula.

Last week the US Senate described virtual currencies as a “legitimate financial service”.

There are 12 million Bitcoins, worth about $12.9 billion at recent prices.

Bitcoin is not backed by physical assets and is not run by any person or group. Its value depends on people’s confidence in the currency.

Bitcoin is created by a process called mining, in which participants verify and record payments into a public ledger in exchange for transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins.",

It is located at the Old Shoreditch Cafe and bar in east London - which has accepted Bitcoin as payment since last year - and operated by Future Coins . The venue is within a stone's throw of the Silicon Roundabout home of the East London Tech City.

Currently there is a commission fee of eight per cent and transactions are limited to £1,000 per month for each customer. The machine needs to be manually topped-up with Bitcoins when it runs out, but once the process is automated it is hoped that fees can be brought down to around five per cent.",

Metro-North says James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers, died at Mt. Sinai Hospital after he was struck by a passenger train while working near 106th Street on the Park Avenue viaduct shortly before 1 a.m Monday morning. He had worked with the railroad for eight years.

He was working with a crew assigned to restoring power to track that had been closed for the weekend.

The railroad says he was struck at 12:54 a.m. by the 12:47 a.m. train en route to Poughkeepsie, on its regular schedule. Why the crew was along this certain section of track is being investigated.

Senator Charles Schumer held a press conference at Grand Central Terminal to question the safety improvements the MTA has put in place.

Senator Schumer said he did not think a federal take over of the railroad is an option to discuss now.

The NTSB and the FRA are investigating the incident along with Metro-North and the MTA Police Department.

“The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff’s family,” said Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti.

“Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad. With our partners at the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, we will re-examine our procedures and protocols to ensure we are performing our jobs with safety as the paramount concern.”",

About 50 passengers were aboard the train, the 12:47 a.m. from Grand Central Terminal bound for Poughkeepsie.

Service was suspended while emergency crews worked, and the 50 passengers on the train that hit the worker were transferred to another train resuming their trip at 2:17 a.m.

The death is being investigated by Metro-North and MTA police.

Service was restored before the morning rush.

MANHATTAN — An MTA worker died after being struck by a Metro-North train in East Harlem Monday morning, officials said.

James Romansoff, 58, was finishing up weekend track work with two others near Park Avenue and East 106th Street when the train hit him about 1 a.m., MTA and FDNY officials said.

Preliminary investigation indicated it was an accident and that the worker left the blocked off work area to retrieve an item when he was hit, sources said.

""They knew the train was coming, but he apparently walked off for something,"" a source said.

Romansoff, who had worked for the MTA for eight years, was taken to Mount Sinai hospital and pronounced dead, the MTA said.

""The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family,” said Metro-North President, Joseph Giulietti.

Romansoff and his crew were restoring power to the tracks after they were closed for weekend maintenance, the MTA said.

Neighbors described hearing a loud screech about 1 a.m.

Jovanna McCoy, who was at her mother's home at 102nd Street and Park Avenue, ran to the window overlooking the elevated tracks and watched as emergency responders converged on the accident site, she said.

""I'm devastated to find out this man has died,"" McCoy said.

Thirty-six people were aboard the Hudson line train that had just left Grand Central en route to Poughkeepsie, the MTA said.

The motorman knew about work in the area and was driving accordingly before he hit Romansoff, sources said.

The passengers were transferred to another train and continued their journey north about 2:15 a.m., the MTA said.

The train that hit Romansoff was taken away by daybreak, McCoy said.

The MTA, along with two federal agencies, was still investigating the circumstances of the incident, a spokesman said.

The National Transportation Safety Board was dispatching three investigators, they said.

""Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad,"" Giulietti said.

Monday's train fatality came seven days after the MTA unveiled its ""100-Day Action Plan,"" a list of proposals to improve safety throughout Metro-North in light of the Dec. 1 derailment that killed 4 people and injured dozens more.

The plan, which includes a proposal to give track workers a confidential code that they have to send dispatchers before trains can return to the rails, is intended to strengthen safety procedures, according to the MTA.

The plan has not been fully implemented, an MTA spokeswoman said.

Metro-North has been plagued with problems over the past year, including the death of a worker on the tracks in West Haven, Conn. last spring. In that case, the worker was hit by a train on a supposedly inactive section of track.

Also last spring, two trains collided during the evening rush in Connecticut, injuring more than 60 people.

And in December, a speeding train derailed in the Bronx, killing four people and injuring dozens more. The Federal Railroad Administration is expected to release its review of the December derailment in a week.

http://washingtonexaminer.com/democrat-donor-william-ackman-conspires-to-destroy-herbalife-to-win-billion-dollar-bet/article/2545402,business,"If the billionaire Koch brothers are trying to “buy our democracy,” as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., put it, what is Democrat donor William Ackman buying?

The billionaire hedge fund manager has conspired with members of Congress and outside groups to destroy Herbalife, a nutrition products company, according to the New York Times.

Why?

To win a billion-dollar bet he made that the company would collapse.

And he’s using the federal government to help win that bet.

Despite what you may believe about the seediness of Washington, this is actually unprecedented.

“Mr. Ackman’s campaign to take this fight ‘to the end of the earth,’ using every weapon in the arsenal that Washington offers in an attempt to bring ruin to one company, is a novel one, fusing the financial markets with the political system,” the Times said.

Ackman claims he is trying to take down the company to protect Hispanics, who are apparently Herbalife’s main distributors, but Ackman’s staff says the real goal is to win that bet.

The situation has led to a prominent Democrat-on-Democrat lobbying effort.

Ackman read from a letter he said was written by Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-Calif., to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into Herbalife. The thing is, the FTC hadn't received the letter yet, and Sanchez didn't post the letter on her website until a month later -- but backdated it for good measure.

Another letter, supposedly written by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also appeared on Ackman's anti-Herbalife website before the senator's press release. Markey's letter to the FTC and Securities and Exchange Commission caused Herbalife's stock to drop by 14 percent.

Ackman also enlisted lobbying firms to help crush Herbalife — including one run by former Rep. Toby Moffett, D-Conn. The other firm is run by a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, Robert Walker.

But wait, there's more! Ackman also hired lobbying firms run by former top aides for President Obama and President Clinton, as well as Jim Papa, who worked on legislative affairs for Obama.

Also contracted: Lobbyist Larry Rasky, a former aide to Markey during his time in the House of Representatives, and lobbyist Malcolm Grace, a former aide to Sanchez. How convenient that both members of Congress would go on to assist Ackman.

The Times claims Ackman also recruited “four members of Congress, a New York State senator, a City Council member in Boston, the majority leader of the Nevada Senate and other elected officials in California” to join his efforts.

Herbalife followed suit, hiring a lobbying group founded by former Clinton administration aides and the Podesta Group, run by Tony Podesta, whose brother, John Podesta, was Clinton's chief of staff and is now a senior counselor in the Obama White House.

Ackman has given far more to Democrats than to Republicans over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Oh, and even if Ackman loses his bet, he’s still going to “personally pursue the Herbalife matter to the end of the earth,” because he’s totally not doing it for the money, remember?",

http://www.thestreet.com/story/12523619/1/why-herbalife-hlf-is-up-today.html,business,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Herbalife (HLF - Get Report) was rising 1.81% to $65.91 at 1:31 p.m. on Monday after the company issued a statement to denounced William Ackman's claims that the company is a pyramid scheme.

The New York Times published an article on Sunday in which it detailed Ackman's meticulous and aggressive campaign to put pressure on lawmakers and other officials to investigate and consequently eliminate Herbalife in order to protect the $1 billion bet he made against the company. The bet came in the form of a short, which only pays off if Herbalife's stock drops.

Herbalife issued the following statement on Monday in response to the article:

""For the past 15 months, Bill Ackman has executed an unfounded, relentless and fraudulent public attack on Herbalife's business model, blasting Herbalife to any media outlet or hedge fund audience willing to listen. As The New York Times reports, Ackman has, out of desperation, shifted his focus from Wall Street to Washington and key states across the country. Ackman's unprecedented campaign to destroy Herbalife has now been exposed for what it is: a cynical, self-serving attempt to manipulate the market by buying his way into an investigation to cover his own reckless $1 billion dollar bet. There has never been merit to his accusations. Now we know how he has been orchestrating the appearance of outrage and concern. There should be no question any longer about Ackman's motives, his techniques and his goals.""

STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.

TheStreet Ratings team rates HERBALIFE LTD as a ""buy"" with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

""We rate HERBALIFE LTD (HLF) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, increase in net income and good cash flow from operations. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.""

Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:

The revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 9.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 19.8%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.

Investors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company's shares by a sharp 60.78% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, HLF should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.

HERBALIFE LTD has improved earnings per share by 15.0% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, HERBALIFE LTD increased its bottom line by earning $4.91 versus $3.95 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($6.00 versus $4.91).

The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the Personal Products industry average, but is less than that of the S&P 500. The net income increased by 10.1% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $112.21 million to $123.54 million.

Net operating cash flow has increased to $195.89 million or 16.67% when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of -24.79%.

http://www.businessinsider.in/REVEALED-How-Bill-Ackman-Has-Been-Lobbying-To-Bring-Down-A-Company-That-Hes-Bet-1-Billion-Will-Collapse/articleshow/31796517.cms,business,"The New York Times' Michael Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson have a big front page story on Bill Ackman and his $1 billion bet against Herbalife.

In late 2012, Ackman publicly revealed that Pershing Square had put on a $1 billion short position on Herbalife, a multi-level marketing company that sells nutritional supplements and weight loss products.

Since then, he's been leveraging his political connections to help bring down Herbalife.

The New York Times reports that Ackman's team has ""helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them.""

From the NYT:

A wave of additional letters started to be sent to federal regulators by groups like the Hispanic Federation and the Consumer Federation. Each person contacted by The Times acknowledged in interviews that they wrote the letters after being lobbied by representatives from Pershing Square, or said they did not remember writing the letters at all. Mr. Ackman's team also then started to make payments totaling about $130,000 to some of these groups, including the Hispanic Federation - money he said was being used to help find victims of Herbalife. The pitch by Mr. Ackman peaked in early February, when nearly 30 people affiliated with Latino advocacy and church groups, several of whom had joined the cause after being briefed by consultants hired by Mr. Ackman, flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress and the head of the F.T.C., again pressing for investigators to take action against the company.

Ackman believes that Herbalife operates as a ""pyramid scheme"" that preys upon lower income individuals, particularly from his Hispanic population. Ackman is betting that the company's share price will plummet to $0. In other words, he believes regulators, specifically the FTC, will be persuaded to shut down the company.

He has also said that any personal profits he makes from the short will go to charity.

So far, the short hasn't played out in Ackman's favor. Since revealing his short position, shares of the stock have skyrocketed and his fund has suffered about $500 million in mark-to-market losses. What's more is other fund managers, most notably Ackman's long-time rival Carl Icahn, have amassed significant long positions in the stock.

Still, Ackman has said that he will take his Herbalife short ""to the end of the earth.""

One way to do that is to lobby.

Since Ackman's short position became public, a slew of letters calling for an investigation of Herbalife have been sent to the FTC by various consumer and Hispanic groups. Some of the letters have come from a couple members of Congress.

Both sides have the right to lobby. What's more is Herbalife's lobbying has dwarfed Pershing Square's contributions. According to Reuters, Herbalife spent $2 million on federal lobbying in 2013.

http://www.futureofcapitalism.com/2014/03/ackman-and-herbalife,business,"The New York Times has a long article detailing the lobbying on both sides, but particularly Bill Ackman's short-selling side, of the battle over Herbalife. Earlier coverage of Herbalife and of Mr. Ackman from this site is here, here, and here.

Not among the three bylines on the Times article is Alison Leigh Cowan, who was described in the book Confidence Game as Mr. Ackman's pipeline into the Times. The Times article reports:

In a book about his MBIA wager called ""Confidence Game,"" the reporter-turned-financial analyst Christine S. Richard chronicled how he fought with regulators for seven years before his prediction that MBIA stock would ""spiral downward"" came true. In a twist, it was Ms. Richard, who left Bloomberg News to start up the Wall Street research shop Indago Group, who gave Mr. Ackman the idea to short Herbalife.

The press can be almost as powerful as, or even more powerful than, the regulators in these high-stakes battles involving shortsellers and battleground stocks. While the Times does a good job of tracing the role of the regulators, politicians, lobbyists, and advocacy groups, it leaves the press's own role mostly unexplored.",
http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/03/10/ackmans-anti-herbalife-lobbying-detailed/,business,"There's more than one way to go after Herbalife .

The New York Times has an extensive report about how, after staking $1 billion on the collapse of the nutritional supplement company, Bill Ackman's activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has been aggressively lobbying to bring the company down.

An investigation by the Times found Ackman's team has helped organize protests and letter-writing campaigns across the U.S. to pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife. Ackman retained the Dewey Square Group, a Washington-based firm that specializes in ""grass-roots advocacy,"" to influence officials by recruiting surrogates to speak out against Herbalife in emails, letters, tweets or rallies, the Times said.

The report says Ackman's team has paid civil-rights organizations at least $130,000 to collect names of people who claim they were victimized by Herbalife. Ackman has argued that he is trying to protect Hispanics, who he says are most frequently recruited by Herbalife as distributors – only to find out that there is little money to be made from selling the supplements.

Herbalife has mobilized its own lobbyists to defend itself. Last month, the Times says, the company held a private briefing for more than 30 Capitol Hill aides to argue against Ackman's charges.

The Times points out Ackman so far has little to show for his efforts. Herbalife's stock has risen, in part because billionaire investor Carl Icahn decided to buy a large stake in the company, and regulators lobbied by Ackman haven't take any formal action against Herbalife.

(NYSE:HLF) have spent a lot of money on lobbying efforts aimed to help them get their way. Ackman wants to discredit Herbalife as a pyramid scheme, while Herbalife is trying to convince regulators, lawmakers and consumer advocates that it isn’t a pyramid scheme. So far as Herbalife shares have risen, Ackman’s bet against the company got him into the red there. However, CNBC reports that he’s spent less on lobbying than Herbalife has. But then as they say, money talks, and of course there’s also the fact that Herbalife has—so far anyway—been winning the lobbying battle.

Ackman spends thousands, Herbalife spends millions

The network reports that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) spent almost $2 million in its lobbying efforts last year. Bill Ackman, on the other hand, spent $264,000 last year to lobby against the company. Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF) is trying to convince policy makers that it isn’t a pyramid scheme, which is defined as a company in which distributors make more money for recruiting new distributors that they do for actually selling the company’s products.

Ackman reportedly hired three Washington lobbyists last year, making it the first time the fund has ever hired lobbyists, according to the U.S. Senate Disclosure Act Database. The filing indicates that Ibarra Strategy Group earned $30,000 from Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management fund during 2013. That firm specializes in outreach to the Latino community. The activist investor maintains that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) unfairly targets minorities and low income communities, although the company says it does not. The Moffett Group earned $84,000 from Pershing Square, while Wexler and Walker Public Policy Associates earned $150,000 from the firm.

Pershing may be stepping up its lobbying efforts this year, as the firm’s latest attempts have focused on discrediting Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s top distributors.

Will U.S. regulators investigate Herbalife?

Consumer advocates, including at least one Latina organization, have called for an investigation into Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF)’s business practices. U.S. Sen. Ed Markey also called for a probe, sending letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both agencies refused to give a definitive answer on whether they were investigating, although the FTC said it was considering Sen. Markey’s request for an investigation.",

That amount is dwarfed by the nearly $2 million Herbalife spent in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss company fought the billionaire investor's claims it runs a pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the products outside the network.

Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists, data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database show.

In October Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filingshows.

The group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton, specializes in Latino outreach.

Ackman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities. Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens, which has asked California's Attorney General to probe Herbalife, echoed the fund manager's accusations. Herbalife said last month that it does not target members of minorities or low income communities.

The battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company's fate.

In the last days, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward Markey, who asked them to probe the company, what they were doing on Herbalife. But each offered plenty of examples of having shut down illegal businesses before.

SEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of shareholder activism, said the SEC's Enforcement Division has previously probed whether statements made about a business are ""materially false or misleading, including statements regarding the compensation levels.""

Ackman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife distributors' testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said distributors results' depend on time, energy and dedication.

Ackman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground however, falling 17 percent.

Pershing Square also paid $84,000 to Moffett Group, run by former U.S. Representative Toby Moffett, who promises to bring clients' messages to the highest levels in Washington.

The bulk of its lobbying budget, $150,000, went to Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, which describes itself as a full service government affairs firm.

During the same year, Herbalife spent at total $1.89 million on lobbying, according to public data from the Center for Responsive Politics.

Herbalife paid $250,000 to government relations firm Downey McGrath, which counted Boeing, Microsoft and Time Warner among its past clients.

IBC earned $30,000 from Herbalife last year while $140,000 went to Ogilvy, $160,000 was paid to Podesta Group and $40,000 went to Glover Park Group.

Herbalife also spent $1.27 million on lobbying on its own behalf.

Separately the company made a $10,000 donation last year to Democratic Attorneys General Association, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Pershing Square did not donate to this group. California's Attorney General, Kamala Harris, the person the Latin civil rights group LULAC last year asked to probe Herbalife is a Democrat.

http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/us-airlines-outlook-idUSBREA2911I20140310,business,"(Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines on Monday said cancellations of thousands of flights would hurt first-quarter profit, but some added that revenue would still show improvement.

Flight cancellations tend to add to airline costs during the first quarter, when winter storms hit the hardest. Five U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc UAL.N - said that winter storms had led to more than 78,000 canceled flights among them.

Some airlines cited a noticeable increase in their canceled flights tied to bad weather this year, with American Airlines saying its 28,000 cancellations for January and February more than doubled from the year earlier.

Delta said that as of the end of January, its cancellations from bad weather had topped all of those for 2013.

Delta told a J.P. Morgan investor conference disruption from winter storms hurt revenue for the current quarter by $90 million as it canceled 17,000 flights. The storms dented pretax profit for the quarter by about $55 million, Delta added.

The carrier said it expected operating margin, a measure of income to costs, of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent for the first quarter, compared with a prior view of 6 percent to 8 percent.

Cancellations can help unit revenue, an important measure of pricing power and how full planes are, as more travelers are put on remaining flights.

Delta said unit revenue would rise 3 percent to 4 percent in the current quarter, compared with its prior view of a 2 percent to 4 percent increase. American added it still expected unit revenue to rise about 2 percent to 4 percent in the period.

United said it halted 23,000 flights tied to weather in the first two months of 2014. The company had disclosed last month that disruption from the storms would hurt first-quarter unit revenue.

JetBlue told the same conference it canceled nearly 4,000 flights because of the winter storms, and Southwest said it halted about 6,500 flights in January and February.

JetBlue forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in first quarter unit revenue, while Southwest outlined expected growth of 3 percent.

Cowen & Co airline analyst Helane Becker cut her first quarter profit estimate for Delta to 30 cents a share from 32 cents in a note to clients, citing the updated outlook. She raised her quarterly estimate for Southwest to 17 cents a share from 14 cents, but also cut her estimate for JetBlue for the period to 6 cents a share from 13 cents.

Shares of the major U.S. airlines ended mixed, with Delta down 0.5 percent to $35.17 and United off 2.3 percent to $46.66. American was off 0.2 percent to $38.96 and JetBlue fell 1.8 percent to $8.87. Southwest shares rose 2.2 percent to $23.60.",

(NASDAQ: AAL) said Monday that it has ended its inline agreements with JetBlue Airways Corp. (NASDAQ: JBLU), which covered ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs.

Such agreements allow customers to buy connecting flights for participating carriers on one ticket, and they allow airlines to offer more destinations without having to make large investments. JetBlue has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, and CEO Dave Barger said Monday that the partnership with American Airlines was “not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have.”

Also, customers of American Airlines and JetBlue using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, as of April 1. Points already accrued through the partnership would be credited to customers’ accounts and will not be affected.

American also reported Monday that severe weather had an impact on performance in the first two months of the year. However, total revenue passenger miles for February were up 0.5% year-on-year to 15.1 billion, and total capacity was 0.8% higher to 19.2 billion available seat miles.

American Airlines shares were up fractionally to $39.10 in mid-day trading Monday. The 52-week range is $14.71 to $39.88.

JetBlue’s shares were down fractionally, to $8.95 in a 52-week range of $5.95 to $9.45.",

American Airlines Group Inc. said Monday that the cancelations hurt first-quarter profit, but it didn't give a figure. The company said it expects to give more details in early April.

Despite the storms, the company said, a key figure of revenue for every seat flown one mile rose between 2 percent and 4 percent in the first quarter. That statistic rises when an airline fills more seats or raises average fares.

American and US Airways canceled about 28,000 flights in the first two months of the year, up 164 percent from the same period in 2013 as storms hit hubs in Chicago, Dallas and elsewhere.

Despite the cancelations, traffic rose 0.5 percent, as passengers flew 15.08 billion miles last month, up from 15.01 billion in February 2013.

American and US Airways boosted capacity by 0.8 percent, so the average flight was a bit less crowded; 78.4 percent full, down from 78.7 percent a year earlier. All of the capacity increase was on international flying.

Shares of Fort Worth-based American rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $39.71 in morning trading. They began Monday up 55 percent so far in 2014.

Last month, Wolfe Research's Hunter Keay stated his belief that the partnership between JetBlue (JBLU) and American Airlines (AAL) would come to an end. That day has finally come.

The Wall Street Journalhas the details:

American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp.agreed to end their partnership, which has been in effect since 2010.

Starting Monday, the airlines will stop accepting new interline sales on the other carrier, while on April 1, customers will stop earning miles and points from each when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline. Customers' already-accrued miles and points won't be affected and will be credited to their accounts, the airlines said.

Canceled flights were up 149 percent compared to February 2013. For the first two months of 2014, American said it had canceled about 28,000 flights, which is a 164 percent increase over January and February of 2013.

""The company believes the weather-related cancellations had a slightly positive impact on unit revenue but had a larger negative impact on unit cost and first-quarter profitability,"" American said in its monthly traffic report.

American said passenger traffic rose slightly, up 0.5 percent in February as the carrier increased capacity 0.8 percent in the month.

Its load factor dropped 0.3 percentage points to 78.4 percent

The carrier said it expects unit revenues to be up 2 to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2014 and will disclose its weather impact on profitability in early April.

Separately, American and JetBlue Airways announced that the two airlines will no longer sell tickets on each other's networks for select flights out of New York and Boston.

The companies will also end their frequent flyer agreement that allowed customers to earn miles or points on certain routes operated on the other airline.

The end of these agreements is effective April 1.

The American-JetBlue partnership, announced in March 2010, allowed Jet Blue customers to connect to American's international flights out of Boston and New York's JFK Airport while American customers were able to connect to JetBlue flights to domestic cities where the two carriers didn't compete, such as JFK to Portland, Maine, or Nantucket, Mass.

* Merger with US Airways gives “greater connectivity” - spokesman

March 10 (Reuters) - American Airlines said it planned to end agreements covering ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs with JetBlue Airways after its merger with US Airways gave it “greater connectivity” along the U.S. East Coast.

American Airlines, which merged with US Airways in December to form American Airlines Group Inc, had a so-called interline agreement with JetBlue that allowed customers to buy connecting flights on each other’s planes on one ticket.

New York-based JetBlue has 80 percent of its operations in the U.S. Northeast.

“Through the merger with US Airways, American’s network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement,” American Airlines’ spokesman Casey Norton wrote in an email to Reuters.

Carriers enter into interline agreements because they allow them to offer more destinations without having to make large investments.

The partnership with American Airlines was “not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have,” JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said at a JP Morgan conference in New York City on Monday.

JetBlue, which has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, also said it expected unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, to rise 1-2 percent in the current quarter.

American Airlines and JetBlue will not accept new interline ticket sales with each other from Monday, the companies said in a statement.

The carriers also said customers using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs would no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, effective April 1.

The frequent-flyer program agreement between the two includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport.

All American Airlines’ “AAdvantage” miles or JetBlue’s “TrueBlue” points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers’ accounts and will not be affected, the carriers said.

American Airlines Group also said its February load factor, or percentage of seats sold, fell to 78.4 percent from 78.7 percent a year earlier.

TriMet buses on the downtown Portland transit mall.

(Jamie Francis/The Oregonian.)

In the past 18 months, TriMet bus drivers have been on the receiving end of some brutal attacks, including three stabbings and a vicious beating at a North Portland stop last fall.

On that, the driver’s union and management at Oregon’s largest transit agency agree.

But Amalgamated Transit Union 757, tangled up in an ugly showdown with management over health benefits, is claiming that TriMet managers are intentionally downplaying the number of times riders assault bus and train operators.

TriMet officials have maintained that serious assaults on its drivers -- while a heinous reality of the job -- are rare. ATU, however, is circulating a list of 130 reported incidents dating to May 2010 that it says have been intentionally hidden from the public.

Operations managers at the transit agency say most of the cases – dozens of incidents of riders spitting on drivers, for example – don’t meet the legal definition of assault and many reports were later found to be unsubstantiated.

“The ATU leadership’s accusations are inaccurate and the document (supplied by the union) contains just initial information inputted by a controller or dispatcher,” said Roberta Altstadt, a TriMet spokeswoman, in an email.

Fair or not, the ATU’s “list of invisible assaults,” which is it says it plans to make public, is demonstrative of how the union is taking its fight to keep its generous health-care benefits to the people. The public, said Bruce Hansen, ATU 757 president, needs to know about the on-the-job hazards that operators face every day.

“There is a reason that we need the (health care) benefits that we have fought for,” Hansen said. “Failing to record theses assaults goes to show how TriMet tries to deceive the public, whether its with operator assaults or wages.”

Of course, not all of the “reported assaults” on documents shared with The Oregonian involve weapons or flying fists. In fact, the average person would probably dismiss many of them – thrown cups of coffee, spitting and a snowball thrown through an open driver’s window – as small potatoes.

<a href=""http://polldaddy.com/poll/7866985/"">Do you thinking spitting at bus driver should be considered assault?</a>

But ATU claims bus drivers consider them attacks that make it hard for them to safely ferry passengers in the Portland metro area, while destroying morale on the job.

What's more, Hansen said, TriMet needs to start taking spit attacks more seriously, especially since some diseases can be transmitted by saliva if it gets in a driver's eye or mouth.

Under Oregon law, spitting on a law enforcement or corrections officer is classified as assault. But the statute doesn't apply to other public employees.

Hansen said other incidents on the list clearly cross a line that TriMet isn’t willing to acknowledge. In one case, a driver reported that she asked a man who was vomiting at the back of a bus to step off. A woman traveling with the man reportedly responded by shoving the driver and throwing paper towels drenched with vomit at her.

“That one just disgusted me when I saw it,” Hansen said.

Altstadt said the agency takes reports of menacing or physical attacks against its drivers seriously. But TriMet, she said, doesn’t determine definitions of crimes. Police analysts, guided by the FBI’s Uniformed Crime Reporting, define many of the initial calls on the list don't meet the definition of assault -- even if they're found to be true.

“Spitting – even in the face – is generally categorized as harassment but may be categorized as an assault by the PPB crime records specialist depending on the full details of the incident,” she said.

In countless cases, Altstadt said, harassment, assaults and concerns about weapons on the transit system turn out to be baseless.

As an example, Altstadt recalled a recent report from a train operator who said a rider spotted an elderly woman in a trailing car who apparently had a “shotgun.” In the end, it turned out to be a cane.

“Our staff looks into each security related incident -- again, crime or not -- to see how security might be improved,” Altstadt said. “We are also transparent about reported crimes on our system.”

On the long list of incidents being circulated by the ATU to the media, the most common type is passengers spitting at drivers. (Not surprisingly, most reported confrontations result from bus drivers simply asking free-loaders to pay their fare.)

Whether or not you believe the next contract with TriMet union workers should maintain the most generous public-employee health benefits in Oregon, the ATU list serves as a reminder that your bus driver deserves a big ""thank you"" during the evening commute.

Of course, you might want to think twice about trying to hug him or her. One of the reported assaults was an unwanted kiss.

Here’s the complete list of reported incidents -- which TriMet says are largely unverified initial calls -- broken down by type from May 2010 to the end of 2013:

Spitting: 65 reported.

Punch, hit, slap, shove, grab: 48.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise � the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released today by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored after economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.

Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased 6 percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained 9 million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for 1 in 3 trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/record-number-public-transportation-trips-2013-64158/,business,"As the legislature debates whether to let Central Indiana voters decide whether to expand public transit, a new report shows there is more demand for seats on buses and trains.

The number of rides taken on public transportation systems in the United States last year was the highest it has been since the 1950s, according to a report from the American Public Transportation Association released today.

While Indiana has less public transportation than some other states, it is in line with the upward trend.

The new report shows ridership in Bloomington increased 1.6 percent and 2.7 percent in Indianapolis in 2013.

IndyGo reported more than 10.2 million dixed route trips taken on its buses, its highest number since 1991.

President and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association Michael Melaniphy says the report’s findings reveal a fundamental change in people’s lifestyles.

“2008 was a high watermark when fuel was over four dollars here and five dollars on the West Coast,” he says. “People were flocking to transit, they came, they found out they liked it and they stayed. Now fuel is well under four dollars and they’re continuing to stay. It’s also driven by growth and the economy. As people go back to work they’re riding transit more. About 50 percent of all trips are on transit.”

According to the Indiana Department of Transportation’s 2012 Public Transit Report, one percent of people over 16 used public transportation to get to work in Indiana, compared to the national average of 5.2 percent. A new proposed bill to expand mass transit in Central Indiana, however, could help to increase these rates.

Vice President of Government Relations for the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Mark Fisher supports the bill and says the new report attests to public transportation’s long-term viability.

“People are choosing different lifestyles than they were even 10 or 15 years ago where it was a continuous push out to suburbs. Transit provides a very cost-effective option for them to be able to move around their community,” Fisher says.

If the proposed bill passes, funding would come from fares as well as business and local income taxes.

The trade group said in its annual report that 10.65 billion passenger trips were taken on transit systems during the year, surpassing the post-1950s peak of 10.59 billion in 2008, when gas prices rose to $4 to $5 a gallon.

The ridership in 2013, when gas prices were lower than in 2008, undermines the conventional wisdom that transit use rises when those prices exceed a certain threshold, and suggests that other forces are bolstering enthusiasm for public transportation, said Michael Melaniphy, the president of the association.

APTA said overall transit ridership rose 1.1% during 2013, with almost 10.7 billion trips taken on public transport, recovering from somewhat depressed levels attributed to the Great Recession.

Among other large systems, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) light rail transit ridership rose 6% from 2012 levels, in part due to LACMTA’s expanding LRT reach. Including bus transport, LACMTA ridership rose 1.9% over 2012 levels.

2013 was the eighth straight year in which more than 10 billion trips were taken on U.S. public buses, subways, commuter rail and streetcars, the American Public Transportation Association(APTA) said in a report.

2013 marked the highest level of ridership since 1956, it said.

“It’s all about, if you build it, they will come. The investment pays off,” APTA President and Chief Executive Michael Melaniphy said in a telephone interview.

Melaniphy said the increase in part reflected increased investment in public transit by the federal government, along with that by states and cities which want to attract new businesses and workers.

The U.S. trend toward urban living and walkable cities also is behind the upturn in ridership. A surge in ridership that came in 2008 when gasoline and diesel prices spiked has continued even though the cost of fuel has fallen, Melaniphy said.

“People are coming and staying,” he said. The upturn in the U.S. economy also means more people commuting to work.

Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent.

The increase has outpaced a 20.3 percent rise in population and a 22.7 percent upturn in vehicle miles traveled, the report said.

Among transport sectors, ridership for heavy rail, or subways and elevated trains, was up 2.8 percent last year. Commuter rail rose 2.1 percent.

Light rail, or streetcars and trolleys, experienced a 1.6 percent increase in ridership. Buses overall saw a 0.1 percent fall, though ridership in cities with less than 100,000 population rose almost 4 percent.

Cities with the largest increases in ridership included:

- Salt Lake City, which saw a 103.3 percent in commuter rail traffic after the opening of a new line in December 2012;

- Austin, Texas, with a 37.3 percent rise in commuter rail use;

- Miami, with an increase of almost 11 percent in heavy rail use, largely because of increased frequency during peak hours;

- and New Orleans, with a 29 percent rise in light rail use.

Release of the report coincided with the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, which is aimed at helping shape federal and industry policy.",

The last year transit ridership was this high in the United States, Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act. Not since 1956, according to the American Public Transportation Association, have Americans logged as many transit trips as they did in 2013: 10.7 billion. It was the eighth year in a row that Americans have made more than 10 billion transit trips.

Growth in transit ridership is outpacing changes in driving. While total miles driven by Americans rose 0.6 percent in 2013, public transit use was up 1.1 percent.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities” said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy in a press release. “People in record numbers are demanding more public transit services.”

Some of the big increases were in places like Los Angeles and Salt Lake City that have been pouring resources into expanding their transit networks. L.A. saw a 4.8 percent increase in heavy rail ridership and a nearly 6 percent increase in light rail ridership, following the opening of its Expo Line in 2012. Salt Lake City, meanwhile, saw a doubling in commuter rail riders, on the heels of a significant expansion of its Frontrunner system.

Growth also occurred in cities with established train networks. Rail ridership in the New York region, for instance, grew 4.2 percent.

The positive trend, while not uniform, was widely spread. Places as diverse as Fort Myers, Florida; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Yuma, Arizona, saw sizable bumps in ridership either systemwide or on specific lines.

Heavy rail ridership recorded the strongest growth of any transit mode in 2013, with an increase of 2.8 percent, while commuter rail rose 2.1 percent. Light rail trips, including streetcars, increased by 1.6 percent. Meanwhile, bus travel was up 3.8 percent in cities with populations less than 100,000, but was down 0.1 percent overall, APTA reports.",

“It’s truly a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities,” says Michael Melaniphy, the group’s president and CEO, noting the growth started several years ago.

“Initially, when fuel prices spiked, it drove people to transit, and once they came, they decided it was good, and they stayed.”

There is a correlation, Melaniphy says, between high ridership and the health of the U.S. economy. Sixty percent of trips taken on public transit are work commutes.

However, Michael Moss, who directs the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, argues the other 40 percent is also important:

“Mass transit today is not just a peak-hour activity,” he says. As public transportation becomes more popular, and as cities spend more money on expanding it, transit systems are opening earlier and closing later.

“There was a time when you said, ‘I want to live near a good school district,’” Moss says. “Today, people want to live near a good transit connection.”

Moss is referring to young people especially, who are ever less likely to own cars.

http://www.fastcoexist.com/3027455/more-people-rode-public-transit-last-year-than-anytime-in-the-last-60-years,business,"We’ve recently covered the news that more people are foregoing car ownership than ever before, so it would make sense that public transit is becoming more and more popular at the same time. Now there’s data to prove it.

The American Public Transportation Association’s latest figures, released today, show that more Americans used public transit in 2013 than at any time in nearly 60 years. That amounts to a whopping 10.65 billion passenger trips, beating the previous record in 1956 and a more recent peak in 2008, when gas cost more than $4 a gallon and 10.59 million trips were taken.

This time around high gas prices aren’t the main reason, and the trend is more about a basic shift in attitudes about how people travel in their cities, as well as a generally strong urban economy. Michael Melaniphy, president of the advocacy group, told the New York Times:

“Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,” Mr. Melaniphy said in an interview. “We’re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities.”

From 1995 to 2013, transit ridership rose 37 percent, well ahead of a 20 percent growth in population and a 23 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled, according to the association’s data.

Cities should be paying attention, especially as many aim to attract young people to live and work in their borders. Young people traveling more often at “off-peak” times accounted for some of the increases seen over the last year, the New York Times reported. Public transit agencies reporting the biggest ridership increases included those in smaller cities, such as Ann Arbor, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Riverside, California.

These are all reasons for cities to invest more in subways, buses, and rail systems though that is sure to raise the hackles of dedicated drivers. It may pay to note, however, more than 70% of transit tax efforts succeeded in the last two years, according to the association.",

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise — the highest total since 1956. While the number of national vehicle miles traveled on roads increased 0.3 percent, public transportation use in 2013 increased by 1.1 percent, according to the study.

“As the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,” Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of the Grand Rapids’ transit authority in Michigan, said in a press release.

“Public transportation systems nationwide — in small, medium, and large communities — saw ridership increases. Some reported all-time high ridership numbers.”

Expanding bus and train networks and increased service helped spur the growth, as did the nation's urban shift, the report found. Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent, outpacing both population growth and the number of vehicle miles traveled on roads.

“There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities,” said Michael Melaniphy, APTA president. ""People are making a fundamental shift to having options"" aside from a car in how they get around, he added. ""This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip.""

The economic recovery is another driver behind the increase in transit ridership. Nearly 60 percent of trips taken on public transportation in 2013 were for work commutes, the study found.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, the numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

Heavy rail (subways and elevated trains) ridership saw the biggest jump with 2.8 percent nationally in 2013. Increased service during peak hours in Miami accounted for the bulk of the jump, increasing local usage by 10.6 percent. Commuter rails also became more popular as ridership increased 2.1 percent nationally. A new rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah, which opened in 2012, registered more than double the number of passengers compared to last year. Light rail systems, such as modern streetcars, trolleys and heritage trolleys, usage increased 1.6 percent, according to the study.

Nationally, bus ridership remained stable, declining by 0.1 percent. But in cities with a population of below 100,000, the number of passengers increased by 3.8 percent.

Demand-response ridership, a flexible mode of public transit that doesn’t follow fixed routes or schedules, such as shared taxi or minibuses that pickup and deposit passengers along the way, increased by 0.5 percent in 2013.

Overall, the sprawling city of Houston had a large ridership gain. So did Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

The stats are pretty impressive:

Often people claim that the lousy economy makes people take cheaper transit rather than drive. The APTA claims the opposite:

Another reason behind the ridership increases is the economic recovery in certain areas. When more people are employed, public transportation ridership increases since nearly 60 percent of the trips taken on public transportation are for work commutes.”

Toronto opponents of light rail should note that the statistics here are pretty impressive. One can go on and on about how light rail has more stops that are closer together so that it can do a better (and cheaper) job of serving neighborhoods than subways can.

Light rail (modern streetcars, trolleys, and heritage trolleys) ridership increased 1.6 percent in 2013 with 17 out of 27 transit systems reporting increases. Systems that showed double digit increases in 2013 were located in the following cities: New Orleans, LA (28.9%); Denver, CO (14.9%); and San Diego, CA (10.4%).

And, Melaniphy said, the inverse is true as well: cities that invest in public transit often see shrinking unemployment rates, because people have access to job opportunities that may have been off-limits before.

Americans aren’t just taking public transit more often, however. They’re also driving less, according to a 2013 report from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The report found that the amount of miles driven per person has dropped in 46 states since 2007, with Washington, D.C. residents driving the least and young people across the country driving less than older generations.

If this trend of fewer miles driven and more miles spent on a bus or subway continues, it won’t just be good for the environment — it’ll also be good for Americans’ health. Multiple studies have linked air pollution exposure to heart damage and birth defects, and exposure to traffic pollution in particular could be linked to kidney damage.",

Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time in half a century.

They made nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013 – the highest total since 1956, according to passenger data reported by transit systems nationally and released on Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.

Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the recession in the wake of the financial crisis. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.

“People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. “This is a long-term trend.”

Expanding bus and train networks help push the growth.

Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large passenger gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area’s huge transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.

Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation’s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.

“People want to work and live along transit lines,” Melaniphy said. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.”",

For China and Chinese leaders, the past week was not an easy one. The terrorist attack in Kunming left at least 29 dead and more than 130 wounded. Now, the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 inevitably has made the situation more anxious.

As hours turn into days, a multinational rescue team has started searching for the missing plane. According to China Daily (Chinese), as of March 9, 11 countries have joined in an international search and rescue operation after this flight mysteriously disappeared from radar. China Daily says vessels and aircraft in this international rescue operation come from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Britain. The 239 people on board, including 227 passengers, are from 11 different countries, according to a Malaysia Airlines press briefing. 154 of the missing passengers are Chinese, including one from Taiwan. There are no citizens from Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines, aboard the missing plane, but all four countries are close to the incident site and have joined the search efforts. Other countries, such as Britain, participated in the search for MH370 despite not having any citizens involved and a large geographical distance.

There are no Japanese citizens on MH370, and given the current situation on East China Sea, Japan certainly has no obligation to join the rescue. However, Japan has the most advanced technology and facility in Asia-Pacific region, highly trained rescue personnel, and extensive experiences in disaster management. So what if Japan had volunteered to join the MH370 international rescue operation?

China has been closely watching Japan’s overseas operations. If a Japanese civilian rescue team participated in the search, would Beijing regard it as at least a positive and friendly gesture in the enduring Sino-Japanese standoff? Such a gesture might just help to promote bilateral dialogues and ease the tensions that have been created by historical and territorial disputes. Both China and Japan did enjoy a symbolic friendship when then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Japan’s earthquake-hit area on May 21, 2011 “to convey the Chinese people’s sympathies for the local people and to demonstrate China’s support for Japan’s reconstruction efforts.” However, the Sino-Japanese relationship hit the rocks again in 2012 after this period of brief amity.

The Sino-Japanese bilateral relationship has reached a deadlock and there seems to be no panacea for this conundrum in the near future. Under these circumstances, more indirect approaches might help to make some changes, if not outright diplomatic achievements. Such indirect actions could simply serve to send intended messages, especially at a time when high-level inter-governmental channels have basically failed. One such notable case, reported by media from both countries, took place in mid-November 2013, when the Japanese government recognized a Chinese student for saving a Japanese boy from drowning.

Unfortunately, that moment was just a flash in the pan, and reconciliation between these two neighbors is still nowhere to be seen. According to Xinhua (Chinese), on February 28, Japan’s Foreign Ministry held a meeting with Japan’s 30 ambassadors to Asia-Pacific countries such as China, South Korea, and Australia. The Foreign Ministry urged the ambassadors to “defeat the opposite side [China] by substantially utilizing their personal charm and hit hard on those governments.” Obviously, Japan’s Foreign Ministry intends to fight back against China’s previous round of public diplomacy in global media.

However, a spiraling escalation of confrontation ultimately is not what can help to solve territorial disputes, especially between China and Japan, both of which are giant economies with growing military capability. At this moment when war preparations seem to appear in both countries, it is critically urgent to find all possible opportunities to take a step back and to give each country a way out. It may not be another award for a notable deed, but could be something more emotionally and intuitively acceptable and thus helpful to ease the bilateral confrontation. Both China and Japan should find or create these opportunities.",

Investing.com - Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in April traded at $101.21 a barrel during U.S. trading, down 1.34%. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $100.86 a barrel and a high of $102.73 a barrel.

The April contract settled up 1.00% at $102.58 a barrel on Friday.

Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $100.17 a barrel, Thursday's low, and resistance at $102.89 a barrel, Friday's high.

Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday.

Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.

A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.

The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling.

China is the world's second-largest consumer of crude oil.

Cushioning losses, however, were ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.

Friday's better-than-expected U.S. jobs report offset losses as well by boosting hopes demand will pick up in the world's largest consumer of oil.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase.

January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000.

Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for April delivery were down 0.90% and trading at US$107.49 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at US$6.28 a barrel.

By Jeanine Prezioso and Elizabeth Dilts

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. oil fell by more than $1 per barrel on Monday to a three-week low, pressured by an unexpected drop in China’s exports that stoked fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

Oil prices were weighed by moderate temperatures that reduced the need for heating fuels and refinery maintenance season in the U.S., when demand typically wanes.

U.S. commercial crude oil inventories were forecast to have risen by 2.2 million barrels on average last week, according to a Reuters survey taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration.

As well, oil on both sides of the Atlantic was pressured by easing fears over the crisis in Crimea.

“We’re rolling into refinery maintenance season and the market was bid up too far on the Ukrainian news,” said Paul Smith, chief risk officer with Mobius Risk Group in Houston. “I see no issue with U.S. crude going below $100.”

U.S. oil settled $1.46 lower at $101.12 a barrel, its lowest since Feb. 14. After two straight days of gains, Brent crude settled 92 cents lower at $108.08.

U.S. ultra low-sulfur diesel futures, more commonly known as heating oil, fell 4.5 cents to settle at $2.9674 per gallon.

With heating season coming to an end and refiners in maintenance season, traders and analysts expect that oil leaving Cushing will pool along the coast, forcing a temporary glut and capping prices until stocks are drawn down to make gasoline for summer driving season. Oil stocks in the Gulf Coast have risen every week over the last 1-1/2 months.

“We will continue to see draws out of Cushing, but I think we will see much larger builds on the Gulf Coast,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member of commodity trading advisor Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.

In line with maintenance season, refinery utilization for the week ending March 7 was expected to have fallen, though by less than last week, the preliminary survey showed.

The API will release its data on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT).

China released weak data overnight that showed the No. 2 oil consumer’s exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier. Many risk assets and stock markets fell on the weak data even though it likely reflects a slowdown due to the Lunar New Year holidays. Copper prices hit an eight-month low.

Oil traders seemed to put tensions in Ukraine on the back burner, though Russia’s continued push to tighten its grip on Crimea was expected to keep markets volatile.

Brent oil was alternately supported and pressured by the ongoing crisis in Libya that has cut into oil output. Libya’s parliament has ordered that a special force be sent within one week to “liberate” all rebel-held ports in the volatile east, officials said on Monday, raising the stakes over a blockage that has cut off vital oil revenues.

Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and might reach full capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Stocks drifted to a slightly lower finish Monday as investors sifted through a blend of discouraging economic data from China and Japan as well as ongoing uncertainty over Russia's incursion into Ukraine.

Major market indexes pared their losses as the day drew to a close, aided by some high-flying stocks, including Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Chiquita Brands International and Southwest Airlines.

In the absence of U.S. economic data, investors focused on news that China's exports slumped 18 percent in February. The report reinforced fears about the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.

In addition, Japan reported a record current account deficit for January and lowered its economic growth estimate for the October-December quarter to 0.7 percent from 1 percent.

The reports made for a downbeat start for the market as investors seized the moment to recalibrate their stock holdings.

""It was a little bit of an excuse to take some money off the table,"" said Ron Florance, deputy chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""We have geopolitical uncertainty, so (it's) a good excuse to re-evaluate your risk exposure. It's going to be par for the course for this year.""

The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down 0.87 of a point to close at 1,877.17. It had been down 11 points earlier.

The Dow Jones industrial average lost 34.04 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,418.68. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.77 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,334.45.

The three major U.S. indexes are still up for the month, and only the Dow is down for the year. The S&P 500 ended Monday up 1.6 percent for the year, while the Nasdaq finished up 3.8 percent.

The downbeat economic report from China hurt several industry sectors heavily reliant on Chinese economic growth, in particular, materials, energy and industrials. Six of the 10 sectors of the S&P 500 index ended lower, led by industrials. Mining company Cliffs Natural Resources was among the biggest decliners in the S&P 500, shedding 70 cents, or 3.8 percent to $17.95.

""The market is growing more pessimistic around growth in China,"" said David Chalupnik, head of equities for Nuveen Asset Management. ""Expectations have been coming down, but the numbers have been disappointing even those reduced expectations.""

Despite the disappointing data from China, some market watchers anticipate that last week's gains will continue.

The S&P 500 index notched record highs three times last week as investors grew more confident that weak U.S. economic reports in recent weeks were a reflection of unusually severe winter weather, not a broad economic slowdown. Better-than-expected payroll numbers last week also helped encourage investors.

""In general, I think the market will move past the poor China export numbers fairly quickly,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. ""There's still a lot of fundamental support for the S&P at this particular range.""

Chalupnik also anticipates Monday's decline isn't telling of the market's trajectory for the week ahead, barring more fallout from Russia's deployment of troops in Ukraine.

""My guess is the market moves ever so slightly higher this week,"" he said. ""The trend is still up. We really haven't seen anything to break that trend.""

Monday marked the fifth anniversary of the current bull market in stocks. The S&P 500 index bottomed out on March 9, 2009, and is up about 177 percent since then. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.

This is a light week for market-moving economic data and corporate earnings. But investors will be watching the latest data on retail sales, due out Thursday, and a gauge of consumer confidence due out Friday.

""Those two sets of numbers will really tell us where the consumer is and whether or not the consumer will head out and spend when the weather warms up,"" Liu said.

Among the stocks bucking the slight downward turn Monday was Alexion Pharmaceuticals.

The company climbed the most of any stock in the S&P 500 index, vaulting $11.95, or 7.1 percent, to $180. The company raised its 2014 earnings forecast, saying the national health agency of France will reimburse it for past sales of its drug Soliris.

Chiquita was another gainer. It agreed to combine with Dublin-based Fyffes to become the world's top banana company. The stock-for-stock transaction announced Monday creates a global banana and fresh produce company with $4.6 billion in annual revenue. Chiquita rose $1.16, or 10.7 percent, to $12.

Southwest Airlines' stock touched a 52-week high of $23.67 early in the day before ending up 50 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $23.60. The carrier got a boost after it reported that passengers are flying more miles, a trend that helped send a key revenue figure higher last month.",

Investing.com - Crude oil prices lost more than 1% on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for riskier assets.

The Asian nation is the world's second largest oil consumer after the U.S. and has been the engine of strengthening demand.

On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in April fell to a session low of $100.86 a barrel, the lowest since March 6.

WTI crude prices last traded at $101.13 a barrel during U.S. morning hours, down 1.4%, or $1.45. The April contract rose 1%, or $1.02 a barrel, on Friday to settle at $102.58.

Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $100.13 a barrel, the low from March 6 and resistance at $102.91 a barrel, the high from March 7.

Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for April delivery slumped 1.05%, or $1.16, to trade at $107.84 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at $6.71 a barrel.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing expectations for a 6.8% increase.

Imports rose 10.1%, compared to forecasts for an 8% increase. According to customs data, China's February crude oil imports totaled 23.05 million metric tons, down 18.1% from January.

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.

A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations, while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts for a 1.9% drop.

The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy, and overshadowed last Friday's stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs report for February.

The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, the Labor Department reported, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.

The commodity traded at $108.01 at 6:00 GMT on Monday morning, as investors evaluated geopolitical tension in both Ukraine and Libya.

Bloomberg reported that China released data on Monday showing that the nation's exports unexpectedly fell 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier. The figure was far below economists' expectations of a 7.5 percent increase, though some are blaming the country's Lunar New Year holiday for the disparity. The data compounded the already growing worry that the Chinese economy is slowing down as it followed poor PMI data released last week.

However, the ongoing tension in Ukraine kept a floor under Brent prices as Russian forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula over the weekend. Russian forces seized another border post as well as a military airfield over the weekend as pro-Russian leaders moved forward with the country's planned referendum.

Western leaders have said they will not recognize Crimea's independence from Ukraine if the vote does take place on March 16, as it is a direct violation of Ukraine's treaty and international law.

However, the Ukrainian government has more pressing problems as its unpaid bills could leave the country without gas. Gazprom has said it may stop sending gas to Ukraine unless the government is able to pay its debts.

Tension in Libya also supported Brent prices as armed protesters clashed with the nation's government on Sunday over the sale of oil from a rebel held port. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan warned protesters that the military would bomb a North Korean tanker, which was loaded with $36 million of crude oil if it leaves the county's Es Sider port.",

A big drop in China exports has the commodity complex fearing demand destruction drops more than geo-political risk. Forget about Ukraine, Libya, a strong U.S. Jobs report or the possibility of a terrorist blowing up a Jet from Malaysia, it is about China in the early trade.

Chinese exports plunged tanked by a shocking 18.1% leading to a 23 billion dollar trade deficit. The markets are trying to adjust to a shaky new Lunar New Year. Oh, sure, some blame the holiday but after getting one China company default it is possible that China is headed towards a very hard landing.

The reason why this is so shocking is just one month ago China trade expanded by 10.6%. We saw copper imports were soaring. Still China Copper Imports were up January through February was up 41.2% but in February fell 29%.

China's consumer prices rose 2% in February at their slowest rate in 13 months. So it does give some room to stimulate if need be but one of the reason prices fell was pork prices fell by 9%. Pork prices are again on the rise as the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus is devastated the U.S. pig crop. Producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month by dropping 2%, slightly above forecasts for a 1.9% drop leading to more concerns that China is having a hard time keeping things together.

Add to that Japan revised down its growth estimate for the final three months of last year after announcing a record current account deficit for January. Japan's Cabinet Office said both private and public demand was lower than its earlier estimate.

Reuters is reporting that armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorized sale of oil from a rebel-held port. A North Korean-flagged tanker, the Morning Glory, docked on Saturday at the port of Es Sider and local daily al-Wasat said it had loaded $36 million of crude oil. Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the military will bomb the 37,000-tonne vessel if it tries to leave.

Officials said on Sunday that the navy and pro-government militias had dispatched boats to stop it from getting out. The rebels said any attack on the tanker would be ""a declaration of war."" The escalating conflict over the country's oil wealth is a sign of mounting chaos in Libya, where the government has failed to rein in fighters who helped oust veteran ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and who now defy state authority.

The protesters, who also include former soldiers and ex-oil guards led by a former anti-Gaddafi commander, Ibrahim Jathran, have seized three eastern ports in the OPEC member country. The Defense Ministry issued orders to the chief of staff, air force and navy to deal with the tanker.

""The order authorizes the use of force and puts the responsibility for any resulting damage on the ship owner,"" it said in a statement. ""Several navy boats have been dispatched. Now the tanker's movements are under complete control and nobody can move it,"" said Culture Minister Habib al-Amin, who acts as informal government spokesman. ""The tanker will stay where it is. ""All efforts are being undertaken to stop and seize the tanker, if necessary by a (military) strike, if it does not follow orders,"" he said, adding that state prosecutors would treat the loading of the crude as smuggling.

There was no sign of any immediate military action, but Libyan news websites showed some small boats close to a tanker which they said was the Morning Glory. Libya has been trying to rebuild its army since Gaddafi's overthrow, but analysts say it is not yet a match for battle-hardened militias that fought in the eight-month uprising that toppled him.",

International exports from China fell by more than 18 percent last month as compared with the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Customs. That represents the sharpest losses since August 2009.

""Today's stats have undermined the prices of commodities dependent on Chinese demand,"" senior broker Christopher Bellew with Jefferies Bache Ltd. in London told the news source on Monday. ""Still, the statistics that come from emerging markets tend to be a bit bumpy, with quite big swings, and the picture is still for higher growth than in mature economies.""

--Surprise drop in Chinese exports may signal declining demand

--Concerns about Ukraine and Libya seen supporting prices

--Reduction of Cushing, Okla., glut expected to persist

By Michael Calia

NEW YORK--Crude-oil futures fell Monday as China posted a bigger drop in exports than expected, a potential bearish sign for demand.

Light, sweet crude for April delivery was down $1.54, or 1.5%, to $101.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude on ICE Futures Europe was down $1.11, or 1%, at $107.89 a barrel.

China over the weekend said exports fell 18% compared with a year before, the first year-over-year drop since September. Some analysts cautioned that distortions related to the Lunar New Year holiday may account for a big part of the decline, but, as Energy Management Institute analyst Dominick Chirichella wrote, the disappointing export data coincided with a drop in oil imports into China for February.

""The data out of China have been consistently suggesting that China may not meet its growth objectives this year even though the leadership just projected a 7.5% (growth in) GDP for 2014,"" Mr. Chirichella said in a note, adding that he expects global demand forecasts to sink this week in a reflection of the weaker Chinese data.

The state of Chinese demand for oil is especially important for Russia if other nations impose economic sanctions related to the crisis in Crimea, said Carl Larry, an analyst at Oil Outlooks & Opinions. Russia is the world's second-largest crude exporter behind Saudi Arabia.

""If that market gets squeezed out of the West, it's going to go to the East,"" Mr. Larry said.

Futures have largely been higher lately as a supply glut at the storage hub in Cushing, Okla., has dwindled over the past five weeks and amid the escalation of tensions both in Ukraine and Libya. Observers see these factors providing support for prices.

""With mixed industrial production data out of Europe added in, oil would probably be even lower were it not for events in the Crimea and Libya,"" Tradition Energy analyst Addison Armstrong wrote in a comment Monday morning.

The Libyan government has threatened to attack a North Korean-flagged tanker off the Middle Eastern nation's coast, saying rebels are seeking to export oil, according to reports in the media.

As for Cushing, energy-advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates said in a note that the ongoing supply drain there ""appears sustainable for at least another month"" and is ""an important supportive influence.""

Additionally, the jobs report Friday supported the view that U.S. demand is increasing, Mr. Larry said. Rising oil prices aren't as worrisome in the U.S. as they were in the mid-2000s, he said.

""Everybody's used to $100 oil now,"" he said.

Reformulated gasoline blendstock, or RBOB, for April delivery was recently down 2.8 cents, or 1%, at $2.9458 a gallon. April diesel was down 4.02 cents, or 1.3%, at $2.9719 a gallon.

http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/markets-oil-idINDEEA290CA20140310,business,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil slipped below $108 a barrel on Monday as an unexpected fall in China’s exports stoked fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy, though geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya limited the decline.

The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.

Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.

“We’ve seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited,” said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.

“There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn’t happened.”

MARKET OUTLOOK

Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region’s future.

Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.

“We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine,” said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. “The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility.”

Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.

Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.

Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.

At the same time, Libya’s National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.

Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.

Prices were under pressure even though China’s crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.",

Focus remain on the geopolitical tension in Ukraine, as pro-Russian activists clashed with pro-Kiev supporters in mass rallies across the former Soviet state yesterday, although fears of a looming war over Ukraine has eased. However, oil prices were underpinned over concerns US and European sanction on Moscow could trigger jitters in markets.

As of 03:48 a.m. ET:

- WTI crude for April delivery fell 1.23% to $101.32 a barrel

- ICE Brent crude fell 0.87% to $108.05 a barrel

- NYMEX natural gas fell 0.84% to $4.579

The Chinese economic front was also back into focus after Chinese data released over the weekend showed the world`s largest second-largest economy recorded an unexpected $22.98 billion trade deficit in February.

On Saturday, preliminary data from the General Administration of Customs showed China imported 23.05 million metric tons of crude oil in February, equivalent to 6.03 million barrel a day.

Crude oil imports were 115 higher than a year earlier, and down 18.1% from January, data showed.

Worries over China`s growth following the downbeat numbers will continue to put downward pressure on the energy market.

On the other hand, any unexpected twist in Russia’s incursion into the Crimean peninsula in the coming days will likely add on the tension.

Russia is one of the world`s biggest energy producers and exporters of natural gas to Western Europe.",

Investing.com - Asian stock markets fell sharply on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for riskier assets.

During late Asian trade, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index plunged 1.8%, China's Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.86%, Australia's ASX/200 Index closed 0.93% lower, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index ended down 1.01%.

Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing expectations for a 6.8% increase.

The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.

A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations, while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts for a 1.9% drop.

Markets in mainland China and in Hong Kong came under heavy selling pressure as shares in the financial sector sold off amid worries about domestic bond defaults.

In Hong Kong, China Construction Bank lost 1.7%, China CITIC Bank shed 1.8%, while Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and China Minsheng Bank slumped 1.5% and 2.5%.

Meanwhile, in Tokyo, the Nikkei retreated after data showed that Japan's economy grew by 0.2% in the final three months of 2013, down from a preliminary estimate of 0.3%.

On an annualized basis, the country's gross domestic product rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter, down from an initial estimate of 1%.

The yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar, with USD/JPY falling to a daily low of 102.92, moving off the previous session's high of 103.75.

Automakers Toyota and Honda saw shares fall 1.15% and 2% respectively, while index heavyweights Fanuc and Fast Retailing dropped 2.6% and 1.85%.

Elsewhere, in Australia, the ASX/200 Index ended lower as miners came under pressure amid concerns over a slowdown in Chinese demand for raw materials.

Copper producers sold off as prices of the industrial metal fell to a seven-month low. Atlas Iron and Fortescue Metals Group plunged 10.15% and 9.4%, while BHP Billiton dropped 4.15%.

Australian commodity producers are heavily reliant on Chinese demand for raw materials.

Looking ahead, European stock market futures pointed to a mildly lower open. The EURO STOXX 50 futures pointed to a loss of 0.25% at the open, France's CAC 40 futures shed 0.1%, London's FTSE 100 futures indicated a decline of 0.3%, while Germany's DAX futures slumped 0.5%.

Across the Atlantic, U.S. equity markets also pointed to a weaker open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a fall of 0.3%, S&P 500 futures inched down 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a decline of 0.25%.

The Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 6.7% from 6.6% in January, as more people joined the workforce.

The upbeat jobs report eased concerns over soft U.S. economic data seen in the past few months and underlined the view that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to gradually taper its bond-buying program.

Investing.com - Shanghai and Hong Kong led Asian stocks markets lower on Monday, as weak trade data from China weighed on regional sentiment, while shares in Malaysia Airlines sank after one of its planes went missing over the weekend.



In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.6% while the Shanghai Composite in mainland China was 1.7% lower.



The Chinese currency and copper prices were also hit by the trade data. The yuan fell as low as 6.1594 to the dollar early in the session, compared with Friday's close of 6.1260 in New York, and was last trading at 6.1402 per dollar.



LME three-month copper prices fell to their lowest levels since June in Asia, and were last trading at $6,715.25 a metric ton, a 1% decline from Friday's closing price.



Along with weak manufacturing data so far this year, the trade figures became the latest poor economic number to come out of China. The resulting concerns over the economy have made Chinese stocks among the region's worst performers in 2014, with the Hang Seng Index down 4.3% year-to-date--second only to the Nikkei, which is 7% lower over the same period.



Elsewhere in Asia, the impact was felt most in Australia--a country with strong trade ties with China. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.8%. Mining stocks were badly hit, with Rio Tinto losing 5% and BHP Billiton 3.5% lower.



Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi lost 0.9% and Japan's Nikkei was 0.8% lower after the country posted a fourth straight month of current-account deficit in January. The yen strengthened against the U.S. dollar and was last trading at ¥103.12 to the dollar, compared with ¥103.26 late Friday in New York.



Last week, in U.S. trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.19%, the S&P 500 index rose 0.05%, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.37%.



European indices, meanwhile, finished lower.



After the close of European trade, the EURO STOXX 50 fell 1.50%, France's CAC 40 fell 1.15%, while Germany's DAX 30 fell 2.01%. In the U.K. the FTSE 100 fell 1.12%.

But worries over supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and north African exporter Libya limited falls.

U.S. oil dropped 20 cents to $102.35 a barrel by 0048, after touching a high of $102.82. It rose to an intra-day high of $102.91 a barrel on Friday before settling up $1.02.

Brent crude fell 37 cents to $108.63 a barrel, after ending 90 cents higher.

FUNDAMENTALS

* China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

* Armed protesters in eastern Libya traded threats with the government on Sunday in a tense stand-off over the unauthorised sale of oil from a rebel-held port.

* Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

* U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

MARKETS NEWS

According to a Forbes newsmagazine report, the fastfood restaurant chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in less than three years the company had filed for the first time. The company also showed trouble brewing this year when it announced on February that it will be shuttering 155 of its 400 restaurants across North America. Forbes said that the bankruptcy news will not affect the the 600 stores owned by franchisees.

Restaurant consultant and president Michael Whiteman of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York said that the latest development at the pizza chain was inevitable. He told Reuters, ""Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model. Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order. I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term. The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing.""

Founded by Italian immigrants Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro in 1956, Forbes said the company grew to a 799-store firm across 40 countries and employs over 2,700 people. Majority of its stores in the US are located in malls, where it has been observed that foot traffic and food court spending has slowed down.

In its court filing, Sbarro reported $175.4 million in assets and $165.2 million in liabilities, Reuters said. The pizza chain plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization, and has tapped advisers, which include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis to help them with the process.

Chief Executive David Karam had said about the bankruptcy filing, ""The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step.""

The news agency said that Sbarro filed for bankruptcy protection in April less than three years ago and emerged the following November.",

Sbarro's submittal to bankruptcy protection is the company's second time in the past three years.

Sbarro has $140 million in money owed it plans to get control on, which has been hurt by people not frequenting shopping malls as much as they've done in the past Reuters reported Monday.

Sbarro also has $175.4 million in company valuables and $165.2 million in legal responsibility costs Reuters reported.

The deal calls for bankers to grab hold the reigns of the company based on a chapter 11 reorganization plan, which enables Sbarro to rapidly come out of bankruptcy from the first time it went on it prior to a May 7th deadline Reuters reported.

Top management at the franchise restaurant company, which has locations in mall food courts are working to continue to make Sbarro a profitable company.

""The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step,"" David Karam CEO at Sbarro told Reuters.

Sbarro has 799 restaurants in more than 40 countries where 2,700 individuals make a living, The 582 locations owned by franchise owners are not affected.

February saw the company shutter 155 locations out of the 400 it possesses Reuters reported.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Sbarro’s lenders for a debt equity swap supported its intention to file for bankruptcy protection. The pizza restaurant chain operator submitted its chapter 11 bankruptcy application on Monday morning. This is the second bankruptcy protection filed by the company in less than three years.

Lenders support new management strategies

Sbarro indicated that 98% of its lenders voted in favor of the prepackaged plan, which allows them to exchange $140 million in debt to gain control of the reorganized company. Its CEO David Karam said the company’s agreement with lenders indicates their “support and confidence” to the growth strategies developed by the new management over the past nine months.

The group of lenders agreed to provide $20 million bankruptcy loan to Sbarro to finance its chapter 11 restructuring.

Sbarro’s pre-packaged plan

The pizza restaurant chain operator announced its plan to close 155 out of its 400 restaurants in North America last month as part of its initiative to reduce costs.

Sbarro’s prepackaged plan indicated that a combination of store closures and balance sheet restructuring will improve its profitability. The company also believed that the strategy will help reduces its outstanding debt by over 80%.

In addition, Sbarro will also put its business up for auction to test the debt-swap to ensure maximize recoveries for creditors. The company emphasized that it will immediately seek a confirmation for standalone reorganization if it does not receive better offers for its business.

Sbarro used its last stay in bankruptcy to reduce 70% of its liabilities. The company’s existing debt is $130 million, down from $400 million.

In the latter part of 2011, Sbarro emerged from its first chapter 11 bankruptcy after a debt-for-equity swap with lenders. It has 800 stores across 40 countries. Its current bankruptcy protection does not affect the 600 franchise locations worldwide. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.",

Lenders would take control of the Melville, New York-based company under a ""pre-packaged"" Chapter 11 reorganization, which Sbarro on Monday said could allow it to made a ""quick exit"" from bankruptcy before May 7. Sbarro expects to cut its debt load by more than 80 percent, and said nearly all its lenders support its restructuring, which requires court approval. The company will invite other buyers to submit better offers. Founded in 1956, Sbarro had tried to boost sales by revamping its recipes to entice diners who increasingly favor ""fast casual"" chains such as Chipotle and Panera Bread. But an ""unprecedented decline in mall traffic"" and an ""unsustainable"" balance sheet necessitated a restructuring, including the closure of hundreds of restaurants, Chief Financial Officer Carolyn Spatafora said in a court filing. ""Sbarro has been stuck with an outdated business model,"" said Michael Whiteman, a restaurant consultant and president of Baum & Whiteman LLC in Brooklyn, New York. ""Its biggest shortcoming is that it sells food that has been sitting out for a while, and more people want food made to order."" The company said it recently closed more than 180 money-losing restaurants, and expects to shed about 50 more locations. It said it now has 799 restaurants in over 40 countries, employing more than 2,700 people. Sbarro said the bankruptcy does not affect the 582 restaurants owned by franchisees. Last month, the company announced plans to close 155 of its 400 company-owned restaurants in North America. Sbarro was founded in Brooklyn by Gennaro and Carmela Sbarro, a married couple who had immigrated from Naples, Italy. It expanded in the New York City area before launching in 1967 its typical restaurant format, which includes an open kitchen and lets customers serve themselves. NECESSARY STEP Sbarro and 33 affiliates filed for protection from creditors with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. The company reported assets of $175.4 million and liabilities of $165.2 million. It plans to shed $140 million of secured debt in the reorganization. Advisers include Moelis & Co, Loughlin Management and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Sbarro previously filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2011, and emerged from Chapter 11 the following November. ""The board and senior management team are committed to ensuring Sbarro's future growth and success and today's filing is a necessary step,"" Chief Executive David Karam said. Karam joined Sbarro last March from the hamburger chain Wendy's Co, where he was a president. Whiteman said Sbarro may face an uphill struggle. ""I don't know that it has a sustainable business over the longer term,"" he said. ""The way to turn the company around in the short haul is to get out of money-losing leases and close stores, which it has been doing.""

The restructuring will affect about $140 million in Sbarro debt, according to report by rating agency Fitch.

Fitch also discussed a possible bankruptcy at Quizno’s, another medium-sized restaurant chain.

The Sbarro and Quizno’s troubles are “a warning sign of financial distress” confronting many brands in the restaurant industry, Fitch said.

“We do not view them as portending a widespread increase in bankruptcies of US restaurants, but a reflection of difficulties faced by brands that have lost their competitive position and relevancy with consumers.”

Both chains have suffered the growth of competitors like Subway, Little Caesars and Papa John’s. In Sbarro’s case, Fitch said the 68-year-old chain has also lost out from consumers moving away from shopping malls.

Sbarro last month said it was cutting 155 restaurants in North America to reduce costs.

The Sbarro pizza chain has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(Peter Foley/Bloomberg News)

Sbarro LLC, the 800-restaurant U.S. pizza chain, filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years as customer traffic slowed in the shopping-mall food courts where many of its stores do business.

The company listed assets and debt of as much as $500 million each in a Chapter 11 petition filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Melville, New York-based Sbarro said in a statement that it will use court protection to quickly reorganize and close many underperforming stores under a plan already supported by holders of most of its debt.

“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Karam said in the statement.

A group of lenders will provide $20 million in financing, and the reorganization plan will eliminate $140 million in debt, Sbarro said. The filing won’t affect its 600 franchises worldwide.

The Sbarro family started the company 58 years ago after moving to Brooklyn, New York, from Naples, Italy. MidOcean Partners LP acquired Sbarro in January 2007 for $417 million. The chain reported losses in 2008 on higher costs for ingredients such as cheese, flour and pasta and filed for bankruptcy in 2011.

Overseas Expansion

Karam, previously an executive at fast-food chain Wendy’s Co., led a comeback effort after joining Sbarro as CEO in 2013. To offset slow growth in the U.S., where muted consumer spending took a toll on Sbarro’s stores, the company opened 81 new locations overseas in 2013. In February, it closed 155 stores in North America.

Restaurant chains including Bennigan’s and Steak & Ale, both owned by Metromedia Restaurant Group, and Buffets Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy in the three years before Sbarro’s 2011 filing, hurt by the worst U.S. economic slump since the Great Depression.

Uno Restaurant Holdings Corp., also a pizza chain, entered bankruptcy in January 2010. Midland Food Services LLC, the operator of 92 Pizza Hut restaurants in six states, and Commissary Operations Inc., a distributor of food and supplies to chains, also sought court protection.

First Bankruptcy

Sbarro’s first trip through bankruptcy began in April 2011 and ended in November of that year. Under that reorganization, first-lien lenders gained ownership and the company eliminated 70 percent of its debt. The earlier Chapter 11 filing listed assets of $471 million and debt of $486.6 million.

Unsecured creditors with as much as $173 million in claims got nothing in the first bankruptcy, as an auction drew no bids and was canceled.

Standard & Poor’s said in July that Sbarro’s debt was unsustainable after it borrowed to fund cash operating losses. S&P called the pizza market fragmented and competitive. Sbarro is also vulnerable to declines in shopping-mall traffic and the volatility of ingredient prices, the ratings company said.

In a statement Monday the chain said the bankruptcy filing is a pre-packaged plan, which means that it has already agreed on a reorganization plan with creditors that hold 98% of the company’s debt. That should allow it to quickly shed an estimated $140 million in debt, and emerge from bankruptcy as a healthier company.

It is the second bankruptcy filing in less than three years by the chain, which previously filed for bankruptcy in April 2011.

Last month, the pizza chain said it will close 155 of its estimated 400 restaurants in North America, in a cost-cutting move. Bankruptcy court papers, quoted by Reuters, say the Melville, N.Y.-based company has between $100 million and $500 million in assets and liabilities.

But even with the closures, Sbarro would still have more than 800 outlets in over 40 countries.

The company previously filed for Chapter 11 in April of 2011, and emerged from bankruptcy in November of that year.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the company went ahead with its latest Chapter 11 filing after finding support for a debt-equity swap from its lenders. The WSJ also quotes a statement from Sbarro CEO David Karam – who described the deal as indicating the lenders' “support and confidence they have in the growth strategies"" developed by Sbarro's new management team.

Karam became Sbarro's chief executive last March – replacing James Greco, who resigned after a year as CEO.

Word about Sbarro comes on the heel of reports that another fast-food chain, Quiznos, is preparing to file for bankruptcy. In a recent commentary, Fitch Ratings said both Quiznos and Sbarro “reflect the difficulties faced by brands that have lost their competitive position and relevancy with consumers.”

It also noted there was a “repeated theme” when it comes to restaurant chain bankruptcies – of companies using the Chapter 11 process to restructure or reject their operating leases in an effort to trim costs, while at the same time being protected from their creditors.

“Restaurants often take the opportunity to close unprofitable locations and typically emerge as smaller chains,” the commentary continued. “Restaurants also try to improve profitability in bankruptcy through the sale or licensing of trademarks and other intellectual property”",

By Christian Abbatecola Published: March 10 2014

After closing 155 of its corporate-run locations, the Long Island-based pizza chain has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it tries to settle $500 million in debt.

Sbarro LLC, the Melville-headquartered pizza chain originally based out of Brooklyn has filed for bankruptcy for the second time in three years. A common sight in malls and airports across America, the chain closed down 155 of its corporate-owned US locations last month in an effort to return to profitability and has now petitioned a US Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for Chapter 11 in hopes that it will be able to quickly settle some of its $500 million debt; the company also listed its total assets around the $500 million mark.

Holders of the company’s debt have already expressed support for the filing, and a group of lenders will provide $20 million in financing as Sbarro attempts to reorganize and cut away at $140 million of the money it owes according to Bloomberg News.

“The agreement among the company’s lenders is an indication of the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies developed by the new management team over the past nine months,” said Chairman and CEO David Karam. Karam was previously an executive at Wendy’s before joining Sbarro in March of 2013.

The bankruptcy will not impact the pizza chain’s 600 global franchises, nor were any of the February closures stores run by franchise operators. Long Island saw three of its seven Sbarro locations shut down due to underperformance. Food court locations in Broadway Mall, Green Acres Mall, and Sunrise Mall were all shuttered; the Smithaven Mall location is still open, as are the two Mama Sbarro locations in Hauppauge and Deer Park, and the Sbarro-owned Umberto’s of Huntington. 220 company-run locations remain open in the US.

Sbarro previously filed for bankruptcy in April 2011 and began to report losses in 2008 due to the rising cost of ingredients such as flour, pasta, and cheese. During that first bankruptcy the chain was able to eliminate 70% of its debt and emerge from Chapter 11 by November of the same year. Despite the company’s troubles in the United States, it opened 81 new locations around the world last year.

http://consumerist.com/2014/03/10/sbarro-officially-files-for-bankruptcy-protection-for-second-time-since-2011/,business,"We told you last week that mediocre pizza-slinger and mall mainstay Sbarro would likely be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Today, it made that filing official, making this the second bankruptcy for Sbarro since the spring of 2011.

The pizza chain has some $140 million in debt to lenders. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bankruptcy plan would hand over control of the company to the creditors in exchange for wiping away that red ink. The lenders involved in the deal will also provide a $20 million bankruptcy loan to aid in restructuring the chain that has faltered in the face of increased competition and decreased foot traffic to the malls that have called Sbarro home for decades.

Sbarro’s, the pizza chain for hungry travelers and mall shoppers, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday, its second time in less than three years.

Sbarro’s and its affiliates have between $100 million and $500 million in debt, according to court filings. The company previously filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and was working its way out of debt.

In February, the New York-based pizza chain said it was closing more than 150 stores nationwide in a bid to improve its finances. The company faces a problem plaguing many retailers: dwindling mall traffic. Many of its stores are located in shopping-center food courts.

The number of people shopping at malls has dropped during the past decade as Americans increasingly shop online. Earlier this year, RadioShack, Staples, J.C. Penney and Macy’s announced that they were closing locations around the country.

For I.R.S. Chief, a Challenge Too Big to Pass Up [NYT]

In today’s bitterly polarized environment, the Internal Revenue Service has become even more of a whipping boy for United States politicians as it struggles with deep budget cuts and accusations of incompetence and, some say, illegal actions. It’s the ideal situation for John Koskinen. A year ago, the top White House aides Jeff Zients and Gene Sperling talked to Mr. Koskinen about a job in the Obama administration. He demurred, though he told them to call if they had something disastrous that no one else wanted to manage. They did; he says it took him “about 15 seconds” to accept the job of I.R.S. commissioner.

In IRS Scandal, Begging Is Not an Action Plan [American Thinker]

Yet the conservative response to the IRS scandal consists mainly of begging the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute and begging the IRS to start playing nice by releasing information implicating its own staff in wrongdoing and perhaps criminal violations. Like that’s gonna happen. Begging is not a plan of action. As a lawyer, the author must point out that lawyers leading conservative organizations are failing to implement the proven techniques already developed by Judicial Watch when Bill Clinton was president. The “whine and cheese party” is not the right way to achieve the results that justice demands. And all Americans are at risk from how this is being handled.

Most outlets jumped on the news without bothering to confirm the memo was real.

DAMO-AV

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

2 August 2017

SUBJECT: Discontinue Use of Dajiang Innovation (DJI) Corporation Unmanned Aircraft Systems

1. References:

a. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) report, “DJI UAS Technology Threat and User Vulnerabilities,” dated 25 May 2017 (Classified).

b. Navy memorandum, “Operational Risks with Regards to DJI Family of Products,” dated 24 May 2017.

2. Background: DJI Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) products are the most widely used non-program of record commercial off-the-shelf UAS employed by the Army. The Army Aviation Engineering Directorate has issued over 300 separate Airworthiness Releases for DJI products in support of multiple organizations with a variety of mission sets. Due to increased awareness of cyber vulnerabilities associated with DJI products, it is directed that the U.S. Army halt the use of all DJI products. This guidance applies to all DJI UAS and any system that employs DJI electrical components or software including, but not limited to, flight computers, cameras, radios, batteries, speed controllers, GPS units, handheld control stations, or devices with DJI software applications installed.

3. Direction: Cease all use, uninstall all DJI applications, remove all batteries/storage media from devices, and secure equipment for follow on direction.

4. Point of Contact: Headquarters, Department of the Army G-3/5/7 Aviation Directorate, 703-693-3552

JOSEPH ANDERSON

Lieutenant General, GS

Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3/5/7

All it took was a quick phone call to the Pentagon, and the rampant speculation falls apart into a CYA statement by an Army spokesperson:

We can confirm that guidance was issued; however, we are currently reviewing the guidance and cannot comment further at this time.

If you’re wondering what the hell that even says, it’s a basic the left hand didn’t know what the right hand was doing.

DJI’s Adam Lisberg on today’s events was the company was just as confused as the rest of us.

People, businesses, and governments around the world rely on DJI’s products and technology for a variety of uses including sensitive and mission critical operations. The Department of the Army memo even reports that they have “issued over 300 separate Airworthiness Releases for DJI products in support of multiple organizations with a variety of mission sets.”

We are surprised and disappointed to read reports of the U.S. Army’s unprompted restriction on DJI drones as we were not consulted during their decision. We are happy to work directly with any organization, including the U.S. Army, which has concerns about our management of cyber issues.

We’ll be reaching out to the U.S. Army to confirm the memo and to understand what is specifically meant by ‘cyber vulnerabilities.’

Until then, we ask everyone to refrain from undue speculation.

Yeah, it’s the Internet. Refrain from speculation? Say what?

Two paths here. The first is say there is a vulnerability of the DJI equipment. It would be a DOD-wide directive from the office of the Secretary of Defense, not the US Army.

The second path is this memo was written and accidentally released. It was never meant for public consumption. The Pentagon and DJI would work together to harden the systems for any classified or mission critical missions the products would be involved in.

It’s another lesson of asking basic questions. Don’t accept something as fact when a simple two-minute phone call gets you a confirmation and a whole lot of CYA. You can literally google the US Army’s Pentagon Public Affairs Office. Adding ‘Reportedly’ to headlines should not release outlets from basic reporting. If a two-man operation in Alabama can get answers, why can’t a VC-backed outlet get the same info?

Restaurant chain Sbarro LLC filed for bankruptcy protection Monday morning after winning support from its lenders for a debt-equity swap that is intended to speed the company through its second trip in Chapter 11 in less than three years.

Sbarro said that lenders holding 98% of the company's debt voted to support the so-called prepackaged plan that calls for lenders to exchange $140 million in debt for control of the reorganized business.

Sbarro Chief Executive David Karam said in a statement the deal with lenders is an indication of ""the support and confidence they have in the growth strategies"" developed by the chain's new management team over the past nine months.

Last month, Sbarro said it was closing 155 of the 400 restaurants it owns in North America to cut costs.

The lender group is providing Sbarro with a $20 million bankruptcy loan to fund the company's restructuring in Chapter 11.

The combination of the store closure strategy and the balance sheet restructuring contemplated by the prepackaged plan will improve the company's profitability and reduce its outstanding debt by more than 80%.

Sbarro said it would also test the debt-swap by putting the business up for auction to ensure creditor recoveries are maximized. If no better offers are forthcoming Sbarro said it would seek to promptly confirm the stand-alone reorganization.

The privately held Sbarro filed for Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.

The Melville, N.Y.-based company used its last stay in bankruptcy to slash 70% of its debt load, leaving the chain with less than $130 million in debt compared with the $400 million that weighed it down upon its filing.

Sbarro emerged from its last bankruptcy case in late 2011 following a debt-for-equity swap with lenders. The chain has 800 stores in more than 40 countries. The filing doesn't affect the 600 franchise locations world-wide.

The law firm of Kirkland & Ellis is handling the latest Chapter 11 case. Judge Martin Glenn has been assigned the case. The case number is 14-10557.

* Bulgaria says South Stream still needs to be built

* Permission to feed more Nord Stream gas into EU also delayed

* Europe seeks long-term alternatives to Russian gas (Adds detail throughout)

By Vera Eckert and Barbara Lewis

FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - Brussels dealt a blow on Monday to two major Russian pipeline projects to supply natural gas to Europe, in the latest sign of strains in the energy links between Moscow and the European Union.

Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region has already shaken political relations between Russia and the European Union.

In Brussels, the crisis is likely to intensify efforts to reduce energy dependence on Russia, while Moscow has long sought to curb its reliance on Ukraine as the main pipeline route for shipping Russian gas to Europe, its biggest market.

Russia has begun building the South Stream pipeline project to carry up to 15 percent of Europe’s annual gas demand via the Black Sea by 2018.

But the pipeline still lacks important approvals to comply with EU legislation, including obtaining exemptions from rules that limit pipeline ownership and require access be provided to other gas firms or utilities.

The European Commissioner for Energy, Guenther Oettinger, told German newspaper Die Welt on Monday that discussions with Russia on the link were suspended.

“I won’t accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being; they will be delayed,” Oettinger, a German national, was quoted as saying.

Commission spokeswoman Sabine Berger said he was referring only to political talks but said he had made clear that South Stream faces a long wait for legal clearance.

The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies warned on Monday that there was “a strong possibility” of a reduction of EU-Russian energy cooperation, which would have substantial economic costs for Europe.

If that happens, the institute said that “the military and political crisis over Crimea and the change of Ukrainian government had catalysed an additional crisis in EU-Russia relations, in the gas sphere”.

Bulgaria, one of the European nations almost totally dependent on Russian gas, said on Monday that South Stream remained of “substantial significance” to Europe and therefore should be built despite the current crisis.

BLOW TO EXISTING PIPELINE

One of Russia’s existing alternative routes to supply western Europe without passing Ukraine, the Nord Stream Pipeline, was also hit on Monday.

Introduced in 2011, Nord Stream pumps gas from Russia via the Baltic Sea into Germany.

But the pipeline is underused, and Russia’s Gazprom says it could pump more if EU rules allowed it full access to the Opal pipeline project, which aims to link northeastern Germany, where Nord Stream makes landfall, to the Czech Republic.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in January the Commission had agreed to allow Russia 100 percent access.

But an EU spokeswoman said the executive had delayed a decision on this access, which was initially expected on Monday, citing a need for technical clarification.

“The Commission aims for rapid clarification of the remaining issues and will work on this together with the relevant authorities,” she said.

Opal has capacity of 36 billion cubic metres, but it has been operating at half that for the last three years.

ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIES

Russia and the Commission also are at odds over an inquiry into alleged anti-competitive behaviour by Gazprom, including overcharging customers and blocking rivals.

A Commission spokesman said the Ukraine crisis would have no impact on this inquiry.

While Europe lacks immediate alternatives to replace Russian supplies, long-term efforts are in place to reduce Moscow’s dominance in the sector.

In an event that was not directly related but of significance to Russia’s future role in European gas markets, Greece launched an international tender on Monday for a study on the feasibility of a proposed pipeline to access large, recently discovered East Mediterranean reserves from Israel and Cyprus.

There are also hopes that North American shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) could come to Europe and help reduce Russia’s influence.

Following a shale gas production boom, the United States is expected to begin exporting LNG from 2015, although analysts say that U.S. exporters would prefer selling to Asia, where prices are twice as high as in Europe.

Spokeswoman Sabine Berger said today the commission, the 28-country bloc's executive arm, will continue talks at a technical level but suspend planned political negotiations in light ""of the broader developments"" in the European Union's relations with Russia.

The European Union last week suspended talks on visa liberalization and an economic pact with Moscow to protest against Russia's incursion into Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

The South Stream pipeline, in which Russia's Gazprom holds a 50 percent stake, would provide an alternative supply route for Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria and Italy. It's expected to ship as much as 63 billion cubic meters of gas from 2018.",

Ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic made their appeal Friday in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. A similar letter was expected to be sent to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.

The letter from the four nations, known as the Visegrad Group, asks for Congress to support speedier approval of natural gas exports, noting that the ""presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in Central and Eastern Europe.""

The ambassadors warn that the unrest in Ukraine has brought back Cold War memories and that energy security threatens the region's residents on a daily basis.

""Gas-to-gas competition in our region is a vital aspect of national security and a key U.S. interest in the region,"" the ambassadors wrote in a letter.

Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes between Ukraine and Russia have led to gas supply cuts. Russian state gas company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government, which now owes $1.89 billion for Russian natural gas, by warning that if Ukraine doesn't pay off its debt, there could be a repeat of 2009, when Russia cut off supplies to Europe because of a pricing dispute with Ukraine.

Recent advancements have made it possible for gas that normally flows through Ukraine to the European Union to instead flow the other direction so that nations such as Poland and Hungary can supply gas to Ukraine if Russia were to cut off its supply. But with gas supplies limited, the region is still vulnerable unless the United States makes it easier to import American natural gas, the ambassadors argued.

Boehner and Republicans have been urging the Obama administration to clear the way for more exports amid a natural gas boom in the United States. The Department of Energy has only approved six export licenses in recent years out of about two dozen pending.

In a statement Saturday, Boehner called on Obama to ""heed this call from our allies"" and ""do everything possible to use American energy to reduce the dependency on Russia for our friends in Europe and around the globe.""

""I hope President Obama will heed this call from our allies to use his 'pen and phone' to direct the secretary of energy to immediately approve pending natural gas export requests and do everything possible to use American energy to reduce the dependency on Russia for our friends in Europe and around the globe.""

The White House has argued that Russia's dependence on gas revenue makes it unlikely that the country will cut off supplies to Europe despite the ongoing crisis in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, where the Russian military has intervened in what the United States regards as a violation of international law.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that because Europe has had a relatively mild winter, gas supplies are at or above normal levels. He said even if the United States did approve more export licenses, it would take until the end of 2015 for gas to be delivered. ""Proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect,"" Earnest said.",

Russia's bloodless seizure of border posts in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula threatens to derail hydrocarbon deliveries bound for Europe. In particular, with about a third of the continent's natural gas supply coming from Russia - most of it via pipelines passing through Ukraine - any escalation of the conflict there will severely disrupt natural gas availability to downstream customers in Europe, sending prices soaring.

Following two prior supply cuts in 2006 and 2009 and a possible third anytime, Europe is on the lookout for other sources that can reduce its dependence on Russian gas. The most viable alternative seems to be the U.S., which, thanks to the shale revolution, is flush with the commodity.

With the success of 'shale gas' - the kind trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations - and the advent of sophisticated drilling techniques, natural gas is now available in abundance, while domestic prices have fallen by two thirds. This gives the U.S. leeway to export some of the excess and cheap gas through sea - in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) - to the European markets.

Let's look at some companies that are likely to benefit a great deal from the growth and development of the LNG markets.

Houston, Texas-based Cheniere Energy Inc. ( LNG ) is the first name that comes to mind. The only Federal Energy Regulatory Commission/FERC -approved operator in this space with the 2.6 billion cubic feet per day Sabine Pass terminal in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has got the first mover advantage. Cheniere is expected to witness earnings growth of 14% in 2014 and 33% in 2015, when first commercial production from the Sabine Pass facility is expected.

While Cheniere Energy is clearly ahead of the pack when it comes to natural gas export, there are certain other players that are in line to get federal approval for their terminals. These include Dominion Resources Inc 's ( D ) Cove Point facility in Maryland, Sempra Energy 's ( SRE ) Cameron terminal in Louisiana and Energy Transfer Equity L.P. ( ETE )/BG Group Plc's Lake Charles facility, also in Louisiana.

As natural gas production in the U.S. soars, domestic prices remain constrained, and the Obama administration speeds up LNG approvals, more and more companies will be eyeing European markets through export. Importantly, this will loosen Russia's energy squeeze on Europe and provide the region with long-term energy security.

http://www.troymedia.com/2014/03/10/canadas-lng-export-industry-could-benefit-from-the-ukrainian-crisis/,business,"EDMONTON, AB, Mar 10, 2014/ Troy Media/ – The “Ukrainian Crisis” could be a game changer for the Canadian and global energy industry.

While the direct impact on Canada from the crisis is negligible, the fallout could be immense. The crisis has affected Ukraine’s nascent natural gas industry as well as the pipelines used to transport Russian gas, but more importantly it has shown the importance of a safe, secure, politically-neutral source of energy for Europe and questions the EU’s reliance on Russian gas.

The latest “Ukrainian Crisis” began with protests over EU integration and was fuelled by the Yanukovych government’s corruption, kleptocracy, and determination to quash any dissension. The protests have been bloodier and have lasted longer than any since the Orange Revolution and reignited long-smouldering geographic and ethnic divides. Yanukovych and his inner cabal have fled the country with billions of dollars, which has left Ukraine on the verge of bankruptcy. Ukraine now flounders precariously as a pawn in a game of realpolitik between Russia and the West which no one other than the Kremlin was prepared for.

International companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron, both of which are willing to accept the risks associated with a poor business environment, have maintained their shale gas exploration programs in Ukraine, while ExxonMobil plans on reopening negotiations to explore the Black Sea once a new government has been elected. But in terms of the global gas industry, these are minor plays and do not impact anyone outside of Ukraine.

Ukraine’s importance in the world energy market is at a transit point for Russian gas. The Russian pipelines which run through Ukraine supply 14 per cent of Europe’s total gas imports, and Russia’s threat to reduce the gas to Ukraine would affect all of Europe. However, the affect will be less than in previous disputes due to Gazprom’s new Nord Stream pipeline, new storage facilities in Europe, and high levels of gas in storage.

If this crisis had happened during a cold January, the contagion within Europe could have been a disaster for EU consumers and businesses. Russia knows this and is using petro-politics to influence decisions in Brussels and throughout the EU.

With more than 25 per cent of gas consumed in Europe coming from Russia, and countries such as Germany importing the majority of its gas from Russia, Europe has little choice but to placate Russia, at least in the short term. This is a wake-up call for the EU: unless it is willing to have Russia as the hegemonic power in Europe, it must diversify its energy supplies to include new supplies from Australia, the U.S., and Canada. This will change the entire world gas industry.

Prior to the “crisis”, the U.S. was planning to export large amounts of gas to Asia, but delays in the widening of the Panama Canal have meant that the large LNG super tankers, designed to ship LNG to Asia, will not be able to travel through the canal until at least 2016. This means that there is extra shipping capacity from North America to anywhere – including Europe – that can handle the large LNG super tankers. It makes political, economic and logistical sense to move gas from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Europe. The “Ukraine Crisis”, as bloody as it is, provides opportunities for the Canadian industry, which, until now, has lagged behind the U.S. in development due to a lack of export infrastructure.

Lessening the supply of U.S. LNG exports to Asia gives Canadian exporters a competitive and comparative advantage over other suppliers. The price difference, or arbitrage, between North American and Asian prices is as high as $12, meaning the price could be adjusted, benefitting both buyers and sellers, while still being competitive. Tankers from Canada’s West Coast can reach Asian customers in 11 to 15 days, much shorter than vessels from the Middle East. Most important, however, Canadian supply is not subject to the same level of political and security uncertainty that affect Russian and Middle East suppliers and the “Ukrainian Crisis” has shown security does matter.

The future of Ukraine energy is as uncertain as ever. The realpolitik moves by Russia have changed the game and sparked a conversation on the future of not only Ukraine but European energy integration in its entirety. This is a conversation that is good for Canada’s LNG export industry and shows the importance of a secure and safe supply of LNG. One that Canada can supply.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/10/ukraine-crisis-could-be-good-news-for-american-nat.aspx,business,"The CEO of OAO Gazprom (OTC:OGZPY) has warned of a possible withholding of natural gas supplies to Ukraine, citing nearly $2 billion in unpaid bills amid the economic turmoil in the country.

The ongoing diplomatic crisis between Ukraine and Russia, along with Gazprom's status as an enormous Russian company, have made this billing dispute more critical. Several U.S. officials, including House Speaker John Boehner, are pushing for the U.S. to increase natural gas exports to blunt the influence of Gazprom.

A long, winding road to market

Getting U.S. natural gas on the international market has been a major struggle for producers for years. The Department of Energy has to approve every export, and the White House downplayed the chances of any major move, saying they don't see exports having much impact.

As a practical matter, that's probably true. Ukraine's non-payment is a bigger issue than anything, and U.S. producers aren't going to be any more willing to give them free gas than Gazprom is. Still, there's a silver lining to all of this.

Gas export complexities aren't a brand new problem, but they're something that has rarely gotten any political attention. The Ukraine situation may be just the excuse needed to get some much-needed attention for this problem, and even if the administration is unwilling to change policies now, with upcoming elections there could be a shift toward more action on freeing the market.

Who benefits?

With a lot of excess production available, the domestic price of natural gas is not expected to see a major impact from the exports. Prices are higher overseas, however, and having access to those markets at all could be a windfall for major producers, who can more easily grab some of that market share in Europe and Asia.

The biggest potential winner is Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), the largest gas-focused producer in the U.S. The company is trading at a modest price right now with plenty of room to run, though with a current ratio of only 0.66 and a lot of debt there is more risk there than most.

Canadian-based Encana (NYSE:ECA) is a somewhat safer choice, though it is also higher priced. It is also growing somewhat slower than the industry average, so it's tough to consider it a bargain at these prices.

The safest by far, in my opinion, is Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC), which has been putting a lot of money into expanding its natural gas business in recent years. The company has higher margins than the other two producers mentioned, and it has the lucrative oil business to fall back on if the natural gas boom doesn't materialize. It stands as a responsibly priced company that is growing natural gas production at just the right time.

And then there's Gazprom

After looking at those figures, this is another excellent time to look at the numbers on Gazprom itself, which dropped with the rest of the Russian stock market on the Ukraine crisis, and is trading at a criminally low price.

While the other companies are looking at P/Es in the teens, Gazprom's P/E is hovering around 2, and trading at roughly a quarter of its book value. The company has much higher margins than other natural gas-centric plays, and is a market leader.

Rather, Gazprom is the market leader, by far the largest natural gas company in the world. The company sees ten times the revenue of Chesapeake, and despite the panic selling over Ukraine, the company is irreplaceable to Europe, and that's true no matter how quickly the U.S. majors can start getting more exports to market.

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/10/wh-exporting-natural-gas-europe-ukraine-not-answer/,business,"The Obama administration on Monday downplayed the notion that American natural gas exports could immediately lessen Russian leverage over Ukraine and Europe, but the idea is very much alive and gaining momentum on Capitol Hill.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to fast-track legislation expediting the federal approval process for liquefied natural gas export terminals, two dozen of which remain trapped in lengthy reviews inside the Energy Department. A hearing on the measure, introduced just last week, will be held later this month, committee sources said.

Republicans long have prodded the White House to speed up the process and take advantage of America’s abundance of natural gas by selling to allies in Europe and elsewhere. The issue has come into the spotlight in recent weeks as Russia strengthens its grip on the strategic Crimean peninsula, which will vote Sunday on seceding from Ukraine.

Russia provides more than half of Ukraine’s natural gas and about 30 percent of Europe’s supply, giving it key power over both its neighbor and nations such as Germany that the U.S. must have on board to enact meaningful economic sanctions against Moscow.

But the White House brushed off the notion that U.S. gas exports could have any impact on the current crisis in Ukraine.

“Any actions the United States can take with our own exports and how that would affect markets — that’s a complicated process and more of a long-term proposition,” White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. “But we certainly take the energy security of our friends in Europe very seriously.”

Mr. Carney also disputed the notion that Russia would cut off gas to Ukraine or Europe, saying Moscow must retain them as customers.

While it’s true that changing the global energy landscape would take years, the promise of American natural gas, even if its delivery is years off, would be reassuring, said Steven Bucci, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation.

“They wouldn’t have to be worried about Vladimir Putin turning the spigot the wrong way and cutting them off,” he said. “It would tell all these European countries we’re going to help you not be dependent on Russia, so they can’t hold this big stick over you anymore.”

A coalition of nations in central and eastern Europe, eager to end reliance on Russian fuel, is urging the U.S. to send a signal to Moscow that its days of using fuel as leverage are numbered.

“Our dependence on natural gas imports from a single supplier is still anywhere between 70 percent to 100 percent in the region … it is not hard to see that energy security remains to be a critical aspect of the region’s geostrategic stability and independence,” reads a joint letter that the ambassadors of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent last week to House Speaker John A. Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

“The presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in central and eastern Europe, and congressional action to expedite LNG exports to American’s allies would come at a critically important time for the region,” the ambassadors wrote.

The House legislation — the Domestic Prosperity and Global Freedom Act — would eliminate America’s “self-imposed restrictions” on exporting natural gas, now in abundance thanks to the perfection of the drilling technique known as fracking and the discoveries of vast fuel deposits in places such as the Marcellus Shale.

Energy companies have expressed a keen interest in selling the fuel to Europe and elsewhere, but federal rules and regulations require that any gas export project must be found to be in the nation’s best interest. The key component of that equation is whether exports would lower domestic supply and, in turn, raise prices in the U.S.

The administration thus far has approved six export terminals; 24 remain under consideration.

The House bill states that “any application for authorization to export natural gas … shall be granted without modification or delay.”

As Russia tightened its grip on Ukraine's Crimea region this month, U.S. and European Union officials were urging the Obama Administration to speed up approvals of more liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals.



Yet Russian exporter Gazprom's ability to swamp European natural gas markets with supply while depressing prices will make it difficult for as-yet unavailable U.S. supplies to displace Russian gas in Europe.



The EU is keen to diversify away from Russian gas imports, a stance hardened by Gazprom's decision to switch off supply to Ukraine during a pricing dispute in 2009 which curtailed supplies to EU member states, as well.



Yet U.S. LNG, exports of which are expected to ramp up beginning next year, are not a silver bullet in supply diversification for Europe.



State-controlled Gazprom sells most of its gas to Europe in long-term deals that are partly linked to the price of oil.



It has recently agreed major price reductions with most of its European customers, including Germany's E.ON and RWE, France's GDF Suez and Italy's ENI and Edison.



The move has helped defend its leading position in Europe, including from potential U.S. shipments, and industry sources say that Russia may agree to further discounts.



U.S. exports to Europe would barely break even at current spot market prices, as operating costs, fees and shipping rates would push the price of U.S. cargoes above European spot levels.



""Prices don't need to go down further to cap new 2020 supply,"" said Thierry Bros, senior gas analyst at Societe Generale, adding that such a fall would effectively rule out any significant role for American LNG in Europe.



Only a slight drop in Russian long-term prices or a rise in U.S. gas prices would see North American LNG cargoes to Europe pushed out of the market by Russian gas pipelines as well, Reuters research shows.



Asia is Better for LNG

European spot gas prices currently stand at around $10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), half of what Asian buyers pay. Because U.S. prices are below $5 per mmBtu due to the shale gas production boom, U.S. LNG exports have become attractive.



Although U.S. spot gas prices are low, however, forward curves show prices rising in North America while Europe's contracts come down.



That means even just slight further rebates by Russia or a move towards more EU spot market indexation would effectively push U.S. LNG out of the market in Europe.



""Lower European prices could make U.S. LNG profitable for the Asian market alone,"" said Thierry Bros.



Political Gas

Although the United States has overtaken Russia as the world's biggest gas producer, there's an important difference in the politics of energy between Washington and Moscow.



Private companies and market mechanisms determine U.S. trade flows, which make it difficult for the United States to wield energy as a tool to punish Moscow. That points to LNG cargoes steering away from Europe towards higher-value Asian and Latin American markets given current price trends.



Not so in Russia, where state-controlled Gazprom granted heavy price discounts to reclaim lost market share.



That policy allowed Russian gas exports to Europe last year to rise to record levels, while LNG suppliers or pipeline competitors like Norway's Statoil saw their European market shares shrink.

http://euobserver.com/foreign/123410,business,"Polish leader Donald Tusk has said Germany should reduce its gas dependence on Russia for the sake of EU foreign policy.

Speaking to press on Monday (10 March) at a military base in Siemirowice, on Poland’s Baltic Sea coast, he said: “In future, we will not be able to successfully resist against aggressive or expansionist steps by Russia if so many European countries will be dependent on [Russian] gas and will go even further down the road of dependence.”

Tusk (c) visited the military base in Siemirowice ahead of an anniversary of Poland's entry into Nato (Photo: premier.gov.pl)

He singled out Germany ahead of a visit by Chancellor Angela Merkel to Poland on Wednesday.

“German dependence on Russian gas could effectively limit European sovereignty,” Tusk said.

“I will speak about this with Chancellor Merkel above all else, in what way Germany could correct its economic behaviour so that dependence on Russian gas does not paralyse Europe when it needs to act quickly and unambiguously,” he added.

“It’s not just about Germany, but Germany is a good example of this phenomenon [growing dependence] in recent years.”

Tusk spoke after EU leaders last week considered a broad range of sanctions - including on Russian gas and oil - in reaction to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula.

Russian state firm Gazprom has also threatened to stop deliveries to Ukraine, which transits Russian gas to Europe, over unpaid bills.

According to the Paris-based International Energy Agency, Russia last year supplied 167 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Europe’s 270 bcm gas imports.

Some EU countries - such as Bulgaria, Finland, and Lithuania - get all their gas from Russia, while Germany relies on Russia for about 40 percent of its supplies.

It also buys large amounts of Russian oil and coal, but it is easier to switch oil and coal providers, unlike gas, which is delivered mainly by fixed pipelines.

In a sign of Germany and Russia’s ever-closer energy relations, Merkel in 2011 turned on the taps at Nord Stream, a €7.4 billion pipeline to bring Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.

The man who orchestrated the project, former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, now works for Gazprom and speaks out on Russia’s side.

He told German daily Die Zeit on Monday that while Russia’s intervention in Crimea is illegal, Germany should not point fingers because it took part in Nato bombings of Serbia in 1999 without a UN mandate.

He also blamed the EU for causing the crisis by giving Ukraine an either/or choice on free trade ties with the EU or Russia. “That was the EU’s first mistake, which led to the conflict between Kiev and Moscow,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Ukraine crisis has already impacted EU-Russia energy ties.

EU energy commissioner Gunther Oettinger told German daily Die Welt on Monday he has suspended talks with Russia on a legal conflict over the South Stream pipeline, a project to pump more gas from Russia to Europe under the Black Sea.

""I won't accelerate talks about pipelines such as South Stream for the time being, they will be delayed,"" he said.

A spokeswoman for the EU foreign service noted the same day that EU institutions have begun “preparatory work” on potential visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials, which could trigger a Russian retaliation.

Ukraine itself gets 90 percent of its gas imports from Russia.

But the EU is working on new arrangements to pump up to 8 bcm a year of gas in a “reverse flow” from Germany, Poland, or Slovakia to Ukraine to cut Russian dependence to 60 percent.

EU officials told EUobserver the reverse gas could start flowing in six months’ time.

It would come from a mixture of sources in Europe’s integrated pipeline network. But in the long term, EU countries are increasingly looking to shale gas, from inside Europe and from the US, as an alternative to Russian imports.",
http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/03/10/London-warns-utilities-against-exploiting-Ukrainian-crisis/UPI-12981394454874/,business,"LONDON, March 10 (UPI) -- British utility companies shouldn't use the crisis over Ukraine as an excuse to raise consumer energy prices, British Energy Secretary Ed Davey said.

European consumers are wary of a repeat of a 2009 gas contract dispute between Ukraine and Russian energy company Gazprom that resulted in a brief supply disruption. With Russia frustrated with recent political developments in Ukraine, Davey warned utility companies against raising prices in response to the crisis.

""Companies tend to buy their gas forwardly, 18 months in advance,"" he was quoted by the British newspaper the Daily Telegraph as saying Sunday. ""So they shouldn't be using [the Ukrainian crisis] as an excuse to put up people's prices.""

European consumers get about a quarter of their gas needs met by Russia. Most of that runs through the Soviet-era transit network in Ukraine.

Davey said there was an increase in oil and gas prices on the international market in response to the row, which erupted in November when ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych backed out of a trade deal with the European Union.

""They've now come down, but if there was an escalation, if there was a military conflict that went on for months and months, there could be an impact on prices,"" he said.",

The biggest victim of the Ukraine crisis – other than the Ukrainians themselves, of course – may be Rand Paul. Since bursting onto the national scene four years ago, he has labored steadily and shrewdly first to shed his kook label, to make himself acceptable to the Party’s establishment, and then to steadily tug its policy agenda in his direction. His high-profile attacks on the Obama administration’s foreign policy agenda have excited conservatives and made traditional hawks do a slow boil.

But the return of a classic Cold War scenario has awkwardly exposed the dissonance between conservatives’ still-strong nationalist impulses and Paul’s isolationism. Paul has an op-ed in Breitbart’s “Big Peace” weakly making the case that Ronald Reagan was more dovish than you think, and pleading against his critics, “splintering the party is not the route to victory.” Concurrently, he has an op-ed in Time laying out his plan of action in Ukraine. The Time op-ed is where Paul truly lets loose his long-suppressed inner kook.

Everything about Paul’s argument is weird. Part of the weirdness is conveyed by the prose, which is bereft of specific facts, repetitive, and reads as if it were run through a foreign-language translation program (“This does not and should not require military action. No one in the U.S. is calling for this … I have said, and some have taken exception, that too many U.S. leaders still think in Cold War terms and are quick to ‘tweak’ the international community. This is true.”)

The most uncomfortable thing about it is watching Paul attempt to steer the Ukraine debate toward appropriately Paul-esque solutions. He begins by endorsing the basic Republican talking points, which revolve around (1) general calls for more tough leadership by Obama; and (2) exporting more natural gas to western Europe. (Steve Mufson explains why the latter would have at best a delayed, very marginal effect.) But Paul adds other ideas, too. Some of them reflect an apparent inability to follow the news, like his ringing call for a boycott of the next G-8 summit in Russia:

The U.S. should suspend its participation in this summer’s G-8 summit and take the lead in boycotting the event in Sochi.

Yeah, this already happened.

Paul goes on to argue, “America is a world leader, but we should not be its policemen or ATM.” So he’s saying the United States should lead the world, but this leadership should not entail any new financial or military commitment? Actually, he’s going farther than that. He’s arguing that American leadership should involve less financial and military commitment. Paul’s plan entails stiffing the Ukrainians:

We should also suspend American loans and aid to Ukraine because currently these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia.

Yes, you read that right – in the face of a massive threat from Russia, the United States should impose financial penalties on Ukraine.

We’re going to help you moochers the same way we help moochers right here at home – by teaching you self-reliance. Photo: Brendan Hoffman/2014 Getty Images

Likewise, Paul demands that Obama “lead” our allies in Western Europe, but proposes we stiff them, too:

I would reinstitute the missile-defense shields President Obama abandoned in 2009 in Poland and the Czech Republic, only this time, I would make sure the Europeans pay for it.

You may be wondering just where this plan to lead our allies by treating them like ungrateful punks is going to work. Let Paul explain:

Russia, the Middle East or any other troubled part of the world should never make us forget that the U.S. is broke.

FYI, we’re not broke, we were never broke, and we’re getting farther away from being broke every year.

If you haven’t figured out where Paul is going with this, the next sentence lays it out:

We weaken our security and defenses when we print money out of thin air or borrow from other countries to allegedly support our own.

Yes, the solution to Ukraine’s trouble is for the United States to adopt the gold standard. Of course.

The painful ideological gyrations on display here show that the much-hyped libertarian resurgence within the Republican Party was never as solid as it appeared. Paul was able to rally Republicans to his side because he could position his anti-drone, anti-surveillance policies as the strongest opposition to Barack Obama. Now Vladimir Putin has created a situation where the most obvious line of attack sits to Obama’s right. News analyses in the New York Times (“Ukraine offers a moment for hawks like Mr. Rubio to reassert themselves”) and the Wall Street Journal (“The Ukraine crisis has given GOP foreign policy hawks a fresh opportunity to reassert themselves”) both reaffirm the hawks-strike-back narrative.

Left unsaid is that the rise of Republican anti-interventionism was a partisan phenomenon, not an intellectual one. During the 1990s, Republicans in Congress assailed the Clinton administration’s military interventions in the Balkans, and George W. Bush ran promising a more “humble” foreign policy. The same dynamic works on Democrats, whose civil libertarian impulses spike during Republican presidencies and recede when a friendly Democrat occupies the White House.

Paul’s foreign policy ideas worked for him when he could exploit partisan fear of Barack Obama. Now his intra-party rivals are exploiting the more obvious line of attack on Obama as a wimp in mom jeans. So Paul is stuck trying to peddle isolationism, the gold standard and telling Europe to pound sand as solutions.",

Talks had already begun to take place between European politicians and the US over the potential of increasing US natural gas imports, Britain’s foreign secretary William Hague said at the weekend. “I believe that there will be a recasting of the European approach,” Hague told the BBC, warning of the “inadvertent” and “unintended” consequences of the tensions between the West and Russia.

US ambassadors to the Visegrad 4, a group made up of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, have called on US Congress to ease the regulations for shipping US natural gas in a bid to reduce dependence, reported website EurActive on Monday.

Meanwhile Europe’s Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger told Germany’s Die Bilt newspaper that negotiations over the South Stream pipeline -- one of several efforts to increase the number of transit routes for Russian gas to Europe – would be delayed.

Russia currently accounts for around a third of Europe’s natural gas imports. Past disputes between Ukraine and Russia – including in 2006 and 2009 when Russia temporarily cut supplies through Ukraine during the crucial winter months impacting European supplies – have brought this dependence into the spotlight.

There have been a number of initiatives to cut dependence on Russian gas: for example, BP is involved in a project in Azerbaijan that will bring Caspian Sea gas reserves directly to Europe, bypassing Russia. However to date little has been done to change the overall balance, with policy varying from one country to the next.

“I would say there has been diversification from Russia but it’s a slow process, and the determination of some countries to do so is somewhat stronger than others,” says Andrew Neff of IHS Global Insight. He points to the fact that there has been a resurgence in demand for Russian gas, over North African (Libyan) and Norwegian sources. “Russia has been seen as more reliable.”

Initiatives such as the Nord Stream Baltic pipeline running to northern Germany, has meant that last year “we saw more Russian gas to Europe last year, and less through Ukraine,” he adds.

Moving away from Russian gas presents a number of problems for Europe, and particularly for landlocked countries, which are dependent on the policies of neighbouring states. Alternatives such as shale gas are also limited given the reluctance of many European governments to get involved.

The current tensions over Crimea have the potential to instigate a change in energy policy towards shale gas in Europe, in much the same way that the Fukushima disaster in Japan led Germany to move completely away from nuclear power but only if they lead to a major supply disruption to Europe, argues Neff.",

""Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt,"" Tusk told reporters on Monday, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to its east.

Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia.

""The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union,"" Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the NATO defence alliance.

The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Merkel's Wednesday visit.

""I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole,"" he said.

""I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money,"" Tusk said.

""This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon,"" he added.

Tusk said talks with Merkel would also focus on ""how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance"".

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Monday the issue of Europe's reliance on Russian energy should be discussed, after talks with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski in London.

""Long term ... the European Union needs to talk about how we recast our approach including on energy policy, to change the balance of leverage between Russia and the EU,"" Hague said.

Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.

Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev.",

http://www.business2community.com/finance/ukrainerussia-situation-misleading-investors-0805045,business,"Sometimes, what seems obvious on the surface isn’t necessarily the best way of looking at a situation. The recent crisis between Ukraine and Russia is a perfect example.

A very basic fundamental analysis of the situation would lead one to conclude that if hostilities were to break out, one of the results would be a disruption to the oil and natural gas supplied to Europe. This makes sense, since many pipelines and oil/gas fields are located in Ukraine and Russia.

What most people don’t realize is that stocks traded here in America could be negatively impacted and could perhaps have their earnings outlook downgraded due to such an event, even though the price of oil and gas might rise.

One point to make is that natural gas is more of a local commodity, so fundamental analysis cannot be extrapolated on a global basis, since transportation is far more difficult than oil.

The earnings outlook for some non-Russian companies could have issues, since many firms have agreements or outright equity stakes in Russian companies.

A perfect example is BP p.l.c. (NYSE/BP), which has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, a giant Russian energy company. Approximately one-third of BP’s production comes from this stake in Rosneft, which could impact the earnings outlook for the company if tensions rise. Of course, BP does have other assets, including a pipeline that does not go through Ukraine, which could see an increase in demand partially offsetting any decrease in the earnings outlook from their stake in Rosneft.

This is a situation where the fundamental analysis might seem simple, but the reality is that understanding the interlinked nature of global business these days makes the calculation far more difficult.

While many people might look to an increase in the earnings outlook for oil companies based on a spike in the price of commodities, one does need to be careful in determining which firms offer upside potential without downside risks from ties to that region.

Clearly, the recent events have added a boost to the price of oil; it doesn’t take much fundamental analysis to realize that’s the case. I think a geopolitical situation such as this won’t end quickly, and even if it does, the easy monetary policies globally will continue to provide a bid for the price of oil going forward, improving the earnings outlooks for companies in this sector.

Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com

One stock that I have liked for a long time is Buckeye Partners, L.P. (NYSE/BPL). Buckeye owns more than 6,000 miles of oil pipeline systems in America with 55 million barrels of liquid petroleum storage capacity. Internationally, the company also has six liquid petroleum terminals in various ports, such as St. Lucia, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas. (Source: Buckeye Partners, L.P. web site, last accessed March 5, 2014.)

The earnings outlook still remains very strong for this company. A quick fundamental analysis of the fourth-quarter 2013 financial results shows that the firm reported $87.5 million in net income from continuing operations, up significantly from the $32.5 million during the same quarter in 2012.

There clearly isn’t enough room in this article to go into an in-depth fundamental analysis report on Buckeye, but my point is that an investor needs to take into account many factors before determining the earnings outlook of the company.

Don’t make the mistake of rushing into a position due to a recent geopolitical event. As an investor, your goal is to own a solid business for the long term. Focus on the fundamental analysis of the business, and the market will reward you over time.

This article How the Ukraine/Russia Situation Is Misleading Investors was originally published at Daily Gains Letter",
http://www.ibtimes.com/russias-political-tool-gazprom-threatens-increase-gas-prices-37-percent-ukraine-1560384,business,"Just days after the head of the Russian state-owned company Gazprom threatened to cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine, officials say the energy company is likely to increase prices by about 37 percent.

Prices could rise from $268.50 to $368.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of the fuel in the second quarter, Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Prodan said on Sunday, as reported by Interfax news agency.

Since ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia in late February, Ukraine hasn't paid its gas bill that the company said is worth $2 billion.

“Either Ukraine makes good on its debt and pays for current supplies, or there is risk of returning to the situation of early 2009,” Gazprom’s CEO Alexei Miller threatened on Friday. Gazprom in 2009 cut gas supplies to Ukraine over price disputes.

In light of the recent threats, Ukraine has remained silent especially as Russian troops threaten military force on Ukraine’s autonomous region of Crimea.

Yanukovych agreed in December to a $15 billion Russian aid package, which included a 30 percent discount on natural gas. Many Ukrainians saw this as an exchange for backing out of a deal that would integrate Ukraine more closely with the European Union. With Yanukovych out, the deal with Moscow was left in doubt.

Interestingly enough, some energy security experts believe that Russia’s threats may be empty as it may lose money if it follows up on cutting supplies. It's also one reason why experts believe Russia will deescalate the conflict.

If gas supplies are disrupted or if tensions escalate further, it could cost OAO Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) $20 billion and eliminate $6 billion worth of customs duties for Russia, possibly bankrupting the company, Mikhail Korchemkin, the executive director of East European Gas Analysis, told International Business Times.

That means there will be less revenue for a company that makes up nearly 8 percent of Russia’s gross domestic product as well as a significant portion of the state's budget revenues, and that’s why Russia believes “Gazprom is more valuable than Crimea,” Korchemkin said.

But if Russia did decided to shut off gas supplies, the European Union's executive arm said it would assist Ukraine by reversing existing flows back to Kiev.

“In the short term, the [European] Commission is ready to assist Ukraine in diversifying its gas supply routes, notably by ensuring that reverse flows with the EU, notably via Slovakia [in addition to Poland and Hungary, as is currently the case], can be operationalized as soon as possible,” the commission said.

Gazprom (OTC:OGZPY) stated on March 7 that Ukraine has failed to pay for its natural gas deliveries in February. The failure to pay, the Russian gas giant notes, may result in a disruption in service. Gazprom went to lengths to reassure the world that it would continue to ship gas to Europe regardless of the Ukrainian conflict. ""There are no issues with transit shipments. Transit is paid and continues,"" a Gazprom spokesman said, referring to deliveries to Europe.

Ukraine, on the other hand, is a different story. ""Today, March 7, was the deadline for payments for gas supplies to Ukraine in February. Gazprom has not received payments for the debt,"" Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said."" We cannot supply gas for free. Either Ukraine redeems debt and pays for the current deliveries, or there is a risk to return to the situation of early 2009.""

The March 7 deadline for payments of $440 million came and went, and Moscow will have to decide what next steps to take. Ukraine now owes a total of $1.89 billion to Gazprom. Even if Gazprom decides to stop delivery of natural gas to Ukraine, it is far from clear that it can be done cleanly without disrupting service to the rest of Europe. Much of Russian gas sold to Europe must traverse Ukraine through a web of pipelines. Ukraine could theoretically tamper with, or divert, natural gas intended for Europe.

Moreover, cutting off gas to Ukraine, even if service to Europe is not disrupted, would escalate a conflict that has already reached crisis proportions. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a few days ago that Gazprom would end price discounts to Ukraine after they expire on April 1. Ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych agreed to accept a 33% price discount last December.

Four Central European nations are urging the United States to boost natural gas exports to Europe as a hedge against the risk that Russia could cut its supply of gas to Ukraine.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Four Central European nations are urging the United States to boost natural gas exports to Europe as a hedge against the risk that Russia could cut its supply of gas to Ukraine, but the White House says such a move would take more than a year.

Ambassadors from Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic made their appeal Friday in a letter to John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. A similar letter was expected to be sent to Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the Senate.

The letter from the four nations, known as the Visegrad Group, asks for Congress to support speedier approval of natural gas exports. It notes that the ""presence of U.S. natural gas would be much welcome in Central and Eastern Europe.""

The ambassadors say the unrest in Ukraine has revived Cold War memories, and energy security threatens the region's residents daily.

""Gas-to-gas competition in our region is a vital aspect of national security and a keyU.S. interest in the region,"" the ambassadors wrote in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.

Ukraine is heavily dependent on Russian natural gas, and previous disputes betweenUkraine and Russia have led to supply cuts. Russian state company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government — which already owes $1.89 billion (1.36 billion euros) for past deliveries — by warning that if Ukraine doesn't pay its debts, Russia could retaliate by cutting off wider supplies to Europe, as happened in 2009.

Recent advancements have made it possible for Russian gas that normally flows to European Union customers through Ukraine to flow in the other direction, so Poland and Hungary could supply gas to Ukraine if Russian supplies halted. But with gassupplies limited, the region remains vulnerable unless the U.S. makes it easier to import American natural gas, the ambassadors argued.

"http://www.investing.com/analysis/ukraine,-russia-and-the-nonexistent-us-oil-and-natural-gas-205356",business,"Commentators were falling all over themselves last week to announce that far from being impotent in the Ukraine crisis, the United States had a very important weapon: growing oil and natural gas production which could compete on the world market and challenge Russian dominance over Ukrainian and European energy supplies--if only the U.S. government would change the laws and allow this bounty to be exported.

But, there's one very big problem with this view. The United States is still a net importer of both oil and natural gas. The economics of natural gas exports beyond Mexico and Canada--which are both integrated into a North American pipeline system--suggest that such exports will be very limited if they ever come at all. And, there is no reasonable prospect that the United States will ever become a net exporter of oil.

U.S. net imports of crude oil and petroleum products are approximately 6.4 million barrels per day (mbpd). (This estimate sits between the official U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) numbers of 5.5 mbpd of net petroleum liquids imports and 7.5 mbpd of net crude oil imports. And so, to understand my calculations, please see two comments I made in a previous piece here and here. My number is for December 2013, the latest month for which the complete statistics needed to make my more accurate calculation are available.)

The EIA in its own forecast predicts that U.S. crude oil production (defined as crude including lease condensate) will experience a tertiary peak in 2016 around 9.5 mbpd just below the all-time 1970 peak and then decline starting in 2020. This level is far below 2013 U.S. consumption of about 13.2 mbpd of actual petroleum-derived liquid fuels. (This number excludes natural gas-derived liquids which can only be substituted for petroleum-derived liquids on a very limited basis.)

So, when exactly is the United States going to drown the world market in oil and thereby challenge the Russian oil export machine? The most plausible answer is never. And, the expected 2016 peak in U.S. production is only about 1.5 mbpd higher than production today. That's really quite small compared to worldwide oil production of about 76 mbpd. And, there's no guarantee that the rest of the world isn't going to see a decline in oil production between now and then. So much for the supposed U.S. oil ""weapon"" taming the Russian bear.

But what about natural gas? Surely, America's great bounty of natural gas from shale could challenge the Russians. Well, not really. It's true that U.S. natural gas production trended up significantly from its post-Katrina nadir in 2005. But the trend has now stalled. U.S. dry natural gas production has been almost flat since January 2012. The EIA reports total production of 24.06 trillion cubic feet (tcf) for 2012 and 24.28 tcf for 2013, a rise of only 0.9 percent year over year.

Not mentioned by any of the commentators touting the U.S. natural gas ""weapon"" is that U.S. natural gas imports for 2013 were about 2.88 tcf or about 11 percent of U.S. consumption. So, let me see if I understand this: The plan seems to be to import more so we can export more. And this would change exactly what in the worldwide supply picture?

Certainly, it is true that low U.S. natural gas prices have reduced drilling and exploration dramatically. But prices will likely have to rise above $6 and trend higher as time passes as the easy-to-get shale gas is used up and only the more costly and difficult reservoirs remain. Drillers don't keep drilling unless they can make money and that will require significantly higher prices.

And, here's the kicker. In order to ship U.S. natural gas to Europe or Asia, it has to be liquefied at -260 degrees F, shipped on special tankers and then regasified. The cost of doing this is about $6 per thousand cubic feet (mcf). So, the total cost of delivering $6 U.S. natural gas to Europe is around $12 per mcf. With European liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices mostly below this level for the last five years, it's hard to see Europe as a logical market. Japan would be a better target for such exports with prices moving between $15 and $18 per mcf in the last five years. But a U.S. entry into the LNG market could conceivably depress world prices and make even Japan a doubtful destination for U.S. LNG. And, what if U.S. prices rise significantly above $6?

But all this presupposes that the United States will have excess natural gas to export. As my colleague Jeffrey Brown has pointed out, ""Citi Research [an arm of Citigroup] puts the decline rate for existing U.S. natural gas production at about 24%/year, which would require the industry to replace about 100% of current U.S. natural gas production in four years, just to maintain current production.""

It seems that U.S. drillers are going to be very, very busy just keeping domestic natural gas production from dipping, let alone expanding it to allow exports. And remember, we are still importing the stuff today!

How many companies will actually risk the billions needed to build U.S. natural gas export terminals to liquefy and load exports that may never appear? I doubt that very many will actually go through with their plans.

What is truly puzzling is that all the information I've just adduced--except the cost of liquefying, transporting and regasifying natural gas--is available with a few clicks of a mouse and a little arithmetic performed on tables of data. I got the cost information on LNG from a money manager specializing in energy investments. And yet, commentators, reporters, and editorial writers don't even bother to check the internet or call their sources in the investment business.

Perhaps the facts have become irrelevant. Only that would explain the current hoopla over the nonexistent U.S. oil and natural gas ""weapon"" in the face of the all-too-obvious and readily available evidence.",

Experts offer their insights into future geopolitical trends as the CERAWeek Conference wraps in Houston.

Both the United States and Europe are united in seeing the need for international monitors in the Crimea and maintaining a dialogue with Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine, but Europe’s close economic ties with Russia and dependence on Russian gas will make European leaders more reluctant to impose sanctions.

Angela Stent, professor at Georgetown University and author of The Limits of Partnership: U.S.-Russian Relations in the Twenty-First Century, told IHS CERAWeek attendees that it’s unlikely Crimea will be a part of a territorially intact Ukraine if residents in Crimea vote for independence in the March 16 referendum. Stent and other international policy experts discussed geopolitical trends and the role of oil and gas in those trends – and the implications that geopolitics might have on oil and gas -- as the conference wrapped up on March 7.

“The recent Ukrainian crisis feels like a cold war if you listen to the rhetoric of both sides, but it’s not the cold war,” said Stent. “We’re not ideological antagonists trying to carve up world between socialism and capitalism, our nuclear weapons are not pointedly targeted at each other anymore – and they could be.”

In the Cold War era, Communist Russia wasn’t integrated into the global economy, so a Russian invasion of a country didn’t have much economic impact. But Russia’s recent move into the Ukraine is impacting Russia by depressing its stock market and value of the ruble. “This global integration works both ways,” said Stent. “While it can work against Russia, it also constrains European countries from the extent they can impose sanctions.”

Differences have always existed within Ukraine, whose current borders were established following World War II. People from Western Ukraine, formerly part of Poland, speak Ukrainian and identify with Eastern Europe and don’t like the Russians, while those who live in eastern Ukraine speak Russian and identify with the former Soviet Union.

In 1991, Ukraine voted to separate from Russia to become a sovereign country, and it was assumed that Ukraine would continue to exist as a nation with internal differences. However, existing weakness in Ukraine’s existing government structures in the past two decades, the government’s inability to create a functioning state and to create a national identity on which everyone agreed, gave Russian President Vladimir Putin an opportunity to invade Crimea, said Stent. Disgust over Ukraine’s previous government also has had some groups seeing an alignment with Russia as a better solution.

Putin, who told former U.S. President George W. Bush in 2008 that he didn’t see Ukraine as a country, has invaded Crimea to prevent a territorially intact Ukraine from moving closer to the European Union’s orbit.

Germany has been one of the strongest proponents of increasing the share of renewable energy sources in Europe. Poland gets nearly all its energy from domestically produced coal and has opposed these efforts in the past.

""The question of Ukraine is a question of EU's future, EU's safety, and a correction of EU's energy policy,"" Tusk said.

If presidential straw poll winner and CPAC rock star Rand Paul were actually president, the senator told Fox News Sunday, his response to the current crisis in Ukraine would be to order up some drilling -- and lots of it.

“I would do something differently from the president,” Paul said. “I would immediately get every obstacle out of the way for our export of oil and gas, and I would begin drilling in every possible conceivable place within our territories in order to have production we can supply Europe with if it’s interrupted from Ukraine.”

Paul joins the growing contingent of Republicans using the crisis as an excuse to push an agenda of increased oil and gas production, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who declared last Wednesday that the best way to “support the Ukrainian people and confront Russian aggression"" is to speed up the approval of natural gas exports from U.S. fracking operations.

The New York Times editorial board conceded in an Op-Ed that ""increasing natural gas exports could serve American foreign-policy interests in Europe, which gets about 30 percent of its gas from Russia."" However, the Times was quick to caution, ""even if the government approved more exports, setting up more facilities to liquefy and ship gas would take years and cost billions of dollars,"" while Putin ""would not stand idly by.""

Paul, for his part, pushed even harder for fossil fuels in an Op-Ed for Time, in which he again emphasized what he sees as the role of oil and gas in addressing the crisis:

http://www.newser.com/story/183529/272-protesters-have-vanished-in-ukraine.html,business,"(Newser) – Since protests started in Ukraine last December, 661 people have been reported missing—and 272 are still unaccounted for as of last week. This even after opposition members have been given the go-ahead to look for them in prisons, morgues, and hospitals. The figure comes courtesy of Euromaidan SOS, whose coordinator predicts that most of those still missing will resurface. But the New York Times reports that the fear that some, or perhaps many, of the missing could have vanished at the hands of the brutal Berkut riot police, or pro-Russian or pro-Yanukovich forces, still persists, and it cites two cases as contributing to that fear.

One opposition activist was abducted from a Kiev hospital and later found dead in a forest; a man abducted with him says their kidnappers spoke Russian and seemed like police officers. Another opposition organizer was abducted in late January, and though he turned up alive, he said he had been tortured by people he thought were members of Russia's special services. The Euromaidan SOS coordinator insists that rumors of authorities burning bodies of dozens they killed are likely false, yet he notes that bloodstains were found at some police stations where protesters were held. DNA tests are needed, he says, but ""this is a huge amount of work, and there is some chance that the police will not do it."" (Read more Viktor Yanukovich stories.)

http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/world/story/german-reliance-russian-gas-threatens-europe-says-poland-20140310,business,"WARSAW (AFP) - Germany's reliance on Russian natural gas poses a threat to European sovereignty, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned Monday amid rising East-West tensions over Ukraine.

""Germany's reliance on Russian gas can effectively limit European sovereignty. I have no doubt,"" Mr Tusk told reporters, days ahead of a Warsaw visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

The top European economy buys around one third of its oil and gas from Russia and has extensive trade and investment links with the vast country to the east.

Germany has tried to defuse the Western standoff with Moscow over Ukraine, but analysts say its voice is muted by fears of endangering its economic ties with Russia.

""The Ukraine issue is a matter of the future security of the European Union,"" Mr Tusk said on a visit to a military base in northern Poland to mark 15 years since his ex-communist nation joined the Nato defence alliance.

The 28-member EU needs to review its energy policy, he added, ahead of Ms Merkel's Wednesday visit.

""I'll be speaking very openly with Merkel, making it clear that the existing climate and natural gas policies risk posing a threat to the security and sovereignty of Europe as a whole,"" he said.

""I'll present our views on the political threats tied to dependence on Russian gas and money,"" Mr Tusk said. ""This, of course, applies not just to Germany, but in recent years Germany has been a strong example of this phenomenon,"" he added.

Mr Tusk said talks with Ms Merkel would also focus on ""how Germany could revise certain economic decisions, to avoid the paralysis of Europe at a time when it must act quickly and adopt a clear stance"".

Washington on Friday played down the risk posed to the European economy by Russia's threat to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, insisting the region had adequate stocks.

Russia is Europe's biggest single energy supplier and its natural gas pipelines mainly run through Ukraine, where some is used and some passes through to major Western economies such as Germany.

Washington, which backs Ukraine's interim government and opposes Moscow's moves to seize the Crimean peninsula, said any gas embargo would hurt Moscow as much as Kiev.",

http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/is-washington-using-the-ukraine-crisis-to-push-natural-gas-exports-to-asia-140310\?news=852645,business,"Since Russia began flexing its muscles in the Crimea and threatening Ukrainian sovereignty, policymakers in Washington, D.C., have called for some kind of action to punish President Vladimir Putin’s power grab.

There’s been talk of imposing economic sanctions against Russia, providing Ukraine with financial help, and even going after the foreign assets of Russian officials.

More recently, many Republicans have argued that one way to blunt Russia’s strength in the region, if not also Europe, would be to use gas—not the kind used in warfare, but the kind that supplies heat.

Natural gas is a major export of Russia’s, which was the world’s No. 1 producer of this natural resource until recently. It provides Ukraine with 60% of its natural gas supplies, and in a country where the winters are freezing, the importance of this trade relationship cannot be understated.

The Kremlin has been happy to use its natural gas exports to Ukraine as leverage whenever the former Soviet republic has gotten out of line in the eyes of Russian officials. Russia has even threatened to cut off this supply altogether during previous troubles between the two countries.

Russia also sells a lot of natural gas to Europe. In fact, its biggest customer is Germany, which buys more Russian natural gas than any other nation. Other European powers also purchase substantial amounts of the resource, including Italy, France and the United Kingdom.

This fact helps to explain why most European leaders have been muted in their discussion of the Ukrainian crisis. British Prime Minister David Cameron publicly stated that his government would not back the U.S. in imposing trade sanctions against Russia, possibly out of concern for how such a move would impact his country’s natural resource needs.

Nevertheless, Republicans on Capitol Hill have been hotly pushing the natural gas debate, arguing it is time for the U.S. to flex its own export muscles.

Thanks to the development of hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking), the U.S. these days is producing more natural gas than ever before—and has eclipsed Russia as the top producer globally.

This abundance has American companies wanting to sell their surpluses overseas. But because the U.S. has never before exported this resource, special plants and facilities need to be constructed at ports along the Gulf of Mexico, which require licenses from the federal government.

That’s why House Speaker John Boehner has been calling on the Obama administration to expedite the approval of said licenses. Doing so would put the U.S. in a position to start selling natural gas to Ukraine and Europe and cut into Russia’s power position vis-à-vis this vital trade, according to Boehner and other GOP lawmakers.

House Republicans aren’t the only ones talking gas in Washington. The Obama administration also has jumped on the bandwagon, according to Coral Davenport and Steven Erlanger of The New York Times, who wrote: “The crisis in Crimea is heralding the rise of a new era of American energy diplomacy, as the Obama administration tries to deploy the vast new supply of natural gas in the United States as a weapon to undercut the influence of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, over Ukraine and Europe.”

However, neither Republicans nor the administration have said exactly how this export strategy would work. And that’s because it can’t.

It’s not like the U.S. has a trans-Atlantic pipeline ready to go for shipping natural gas to the other side of the world.

Or as Max Ehrenfreund noted at The Washington Post’s Wonkblog: The “gas would presumably get to Europe via the White House’s secret magical natural-gas teleportation machine, which can transport billions of cubic feet per day across the Atlantic using nothing but fairy dust and smiles.”

There is a way to sell and ship natural gas from U.S. drilling fields to other nations. But the process is expensive, complex and time-consuming—and in no way can it be done in a matter of weeks or even months to help Ukrainians.

Here’s why:

To export natural gas, companies first have to convert it into a liquid to facilitate transporting it. Once it becomes Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), it can be loaded onto special tankers and shipped across the Atlantic (or the Pacific, more on this in a moment).

But once it gets delivered to some far-flung port, LNG has to be reconverted into a gas to make it usable. That means the country receiving American LNG exports has to have a regasification plant.

Ukraine currently has zero regasification terminals (there’s talk of building one in the port city of Yuzhny, near Odessa, but it’s just talk).

So even if the U.S. had ships loaded with LNG ready to depart, which it doesn’t, there wouldn’t be any point in sending it to Ukraine because it couldn’t do anything with it.

So why is Boehner, not to mention Exxon Mobil, bringing up LNG export licenses in the Ukraine debate? Because there’s money to be made in Asia, where demand for LNG is very high.

Currently, five of the six largest importers of LNG are in Asia. They are (in order): Japan, South Korea, China, India and Taiwan.

Japan has been especially hungry for LNG since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated its nuclear power industry, forcing it to rely more on natural gas imports.

Asia’s demand for LNG is the real reason why Washington wants to ramp up U.S. exports, leaving Ukraine still at the mercy of Russia’s natural gas powerhouse, Gazprom.

Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulSunday shows — New impeachment phase dominates Rand Paul says Trump has 'every right' to withhold Ukraine aid over corruption Paul dismisses Bevin loss, touts 'red wave' in other Kentucky races MORE (R-Ky.) said that, if he were president, he would not let Russian President Vladimir Putin get away with his incursion into Ukraine.

Paul on Monday described the movement of Russian troops into the Crimean Peninsula as a gross violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and argued it is the United States’ responsibility to take the lead in condemning it.

He also criticized President Obama's policies toward Russia, arguing they have emboldened Putin.

“The real problem is that Russia’s president is not currently fearful or threatened in any way by America’s president, despite his country’s blatant aggression,” Paul wrote in a Time magazine op-ed. “But let me be clear: If I were president, I wouldn’t let Vladimir Putin get away with it.”

Paul, fresh off a straw poll victory at the Conservative Political Action Conference, called on the administration to suspend all U.S. aid and loans to Ukraine. He argued that money would just end up in Russia's hands, given Ukraine's gas bill to Russian-owned Gazprom.

Paul did not mention the House's passage last week of $1 billion loan guarantees to Ukraine.

“Currently, these could have the counterproductive effect of rewarding Russia,” he said. “Ukraine owes so much money to Russia that America would essentially be borrowing from China to give to Ukraine.”

Paul argued the U.S. should immediately remove any obstacle preventing the U.S. from exporting natural gas to Europe. He argued that step would make Europe less dependent on Russian natural gas.

""Because of so many of our current needless laws and regulations, President Obama has left Europe completely vulnerable because of its dependence on Russian oil and gas,"" Paul said.

He also called for the immediate approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.

He said he would also reinstate missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republican but would make sure European allies pay for it. Paul said turmoil around the world cannot let the United States forget it is “broke.”

Paul also offered backing for economic sanctions and blocking Russian officials' visas, saying they should be imposed without delay. The White House announced sanctions last week but has yet to impose them on specific Russian entities or officials.

He said the U.S. should take the lead in boycotting the G-8 summit in Sochi later this summer and remove Russia from the group if its troops still occupy Crimea at the time of the meeting.

“This does not and should not require military action,” he said. “No one in the U.S. is calling for this. But it will require other actions and leadership, both of which President Obama unfortunately lacks.”

Finally, Paul argued that the biggest threat to U.S. security is its debt.

“Like Dwight Eisenhower, I believe the U.S. can actually be stronger by doing less,” he said. “Like Ronald Reagan, particularly regarding Russia, I also believe, ‘Don’t mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve.’ ”",

Russia supplies the majority of Ukraine’s natural gas and Ukraine serves as a critical transit route for sending Russian natural gas via pipeline into Europe.

Aware of its reliance on Russia, and seeking energy independence, Ukraine has taken several steps to move away from the grip Moscow holds over its energy supplies. In addition to reducing its use, Ukraine — which pays some of the highest natural gas prices in Europe — is seeking supplies from other sources and has signed deals to develop its own resources.

In November, weeks before Kiev was due to sign a free-trade agreement with the European Union (EU), then-President Yanukovich backed away from the European integration deal in favor of repairing economic ties with Russia. Putin threatened trade measures against Ukraine if it signed the EU deal as planned in late November.

Exercising a form of energy blackmail, Russia offered cheaper gas if Ukraine would join Putin’s Eurasian Customs Union. Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov told Bloomberg: “No one other than Russia can provide Ukraine with the necessary funds so quickly and in such a quantity. A gas agreement could help relieve Ukraine of a huge problem. We can also give them a loan, but we will not help them without commitments on their part.” The Bloomberg report continues, “Joining Russia’s customs union would shrink its current account gap by cutting energy costs.” Armenia joined the Eurasian Customs Union in September and, according to Shuvalov, is now getting “a specific price for gas because they’re signing the whole package of agreements on the customs union.”

Moscow sees that its natural gas supplies are a weapon it can wield against Ukraine. The Christian Science Monitor states: “By cutting a deal for discount gas with Russian President Vladimir Putin last November, Ukraine infuriated its pro-Europe contingent and entrusted its energy security to a fickle ally.” Former U.S. Ambassador to Poland Lee Feinstein adds: “It was at its most a short-term benefit, but in the long run served only to deepen Ukraine’s reliance on Russia.”

Because of Ukraine’s “reliance on Russia,” Moscow was able to exert diplomatic pressure that forced Yanukovych to back out of the trade agreement with the EU and accept terms that thwarted Ukraine’s independence and sparked the protests.

Other Eastern European countries have been watching and are taking steps to reduce their dependence on Russia and they see LNG as their salvation.

Poland is due to complete a large LNG import terminal on the Baltic this year — and Poland is already supplying some of Ukraine’s natural gas needs.

If President Obama truly wants to help our allies, he could have done so without firing a shot. Now that U.S. natural gas supplies are so abundant, he can expedite the permitting of U.S. LNG export terminals and encourage Congress to overturn the restrictions that prevent exporting natural gas to any country without a trade agreement.

The FT reports: “The EU’s access to American LNG exports is one of the most critical questions in determining Europe’s energy security and industrial competiveness.”

Ukraine knows that developing its own resources is imperative to its energy security. Being dependent on Russia for its natural gas has forced Ukraine to abandon a trade agreement with the EU—lessening its independence and renewing ties with its former master.

As this current conflict highlights, he who controls the energy controls the people — and this is exactly why America’s continued energy abundance is important for our own energy security and that of our friends.",

“We expect Russia to export gas to us at $368.5 per 1,000 cubic meters,” he told reporters in Kyiv on Sunday.

Ukraine continues repaying debts for gas, and there are no reasons to halt gas exports, he said.

“Gazprom has not been taking any steps of late. Our last year’s debt amounts to $1.5 billion. We managed to transfer about $100 million to Gazprom last week in repayment of our debt for January, and we have started repaying the debt for February which amounts to around $440 million,” Prodan said.

Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller told the press on March 7 that Ukraine’s growing debts for Russian gas were generating a new transit crisis.

“March 7 was the deadline for February payments. Gazprom had not received any debt payments by that time. Taking the discount for the first quarter into account, the overdue debt had increased to $1.89 billion” Miller said.

“In fact, this means that Ukraine has stopped making payments for Russian gas, which is absolutely at odds with the contract and with international trade practice. We, on our part, have always honored our contract obligations and will continue doing so. But we cannot export gas for free. Ukraine will have to repay the debt and make regular payments for the current gas shipments, or face the risk of retuning to the situation that emerged at the start of 2009. We will keep the Russian government updated on the situation,” Miller said.

The early 2009 transit crisis, when Europe remained cut from Russian gas supplies for 20 days, could re-emerge for the first time over the past five years.",

Over the weekend, Russian state-owned company Gazprom increased the pressure on Ukraine's new government by threatening to cut off gas supplies.

Mr Spivak said the Australian dollar should be well supported this week after last week's raft of positive economic data.

He said that data increased the likelihood of a period of interest rate stability and decreased the chances of another cash rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia.

""Meanwhile, retail sales unexpectedly jumped 1.2 per cent in January to yield the largest increase in 11 months.

Events this week sparked plenty of commentary on the United States using its vast natural gas resources as a diplomatic weapon to soften Russia's hand.

While the United States is currently sitting on an ocean of inexpensive natural gas, exporting the fuel will not weaken Russia's resource control over Europe for three reasons. First, the U.S. government could cut all the red tape in exporting LNG, but commercial interests are not going to ship to Europe when much healthier margins are made by exporting to Asia. Even if prices skyrocketed in Europe, LNG regasification and natural gas storage is severely inadequacy. Finally, Russian natural gas is produced from conventional wells, making it the cost leader, effectively giving Russia command over market share and holding the winning hand.

Boehner said Saturday he hopes President Barack Obama will direct the secretary of energy to immediately approve pending na tural gas export requests so America's friends in Europe and around the world can reduce their dependency on Russia.

The White House has said that a mild European winter has created above average gas supplies and that any new exports would be unlikely to reach Europe before the end of 2015.

At 0700 AEDT on Monday, the local unit was trading at 90.36 US cents, down from 90.90 cents on Friday.

Russian state company Gazprom has increased the pressure on Ukraine’s new government by warning that if Ukraine doesn’t pay its debts, Russia could cut off wider supplies to Europe.

BK Asset Management managing director Kathy Lien said markets were initially positive about data showing that 175,000 jobs were added to the US economy in February but that changed after Russia made its threat.

“Equities traded sharply higher on the relief that non-farm payrolls did not miss expectations for the third month in a row,” she said.

“The sell-off was triggered by the one major uncertainty that has been hanging over the markets for the past few weeks and that is Ukraine.

“Considering that the Russian government owns a controlling interest in Gazprom, the world’s largest single gas producer, this threat is clearly representative of political posturing.” Ms Lien said the strong US employment data increases expectation that the US Federal Reserve will continue winding back its economic stimulus programs, which will further boost the US dollar and put downward pressure on the Australian dollar.

http://www.dw.de/making-sense-of-sanctions/a-17484608,business,"The European Union has said it is halting visa talks with Russia following an emergency summit of the bloc's leaders where they discussed ways to punish Russia for its recent exploits on the Crimean Peninsula. If Russia continues to reject negotiations, further measures are to be taken, which could entail economic sanctions.

It didn't take long for the Kremlin to respond. Any sanction will be met with countermeasures from Moscow, an official government statement declared. The United States has already imposed visa bans on targeted Russians and warned of freezing their assets. In response, Russia has threatened to stop reciprocal weapons inspections.

The chimes of boycotts flashin'

According to news magazine Der Spiegel, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her attendance at the upcoming G8 summit in Sochi depends on developments in Crimea. If the Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia, which Merkel has openly called ""illegal"" and in ""violation of Ukraine's constitution,"" goes ahead, the chancellor won't be in Sochi in June.

Emergency summits have thus far produced only watered down sanctions

Michael Fuchs, conservative politician and deputy parliamentary head of Merkel's CDU, has suggested another form of sanction to force Putin's hand: take away, or at least call into question, Russia's hosting of the 2018 Soccer World Cup. That suggestion has been criticized by left-leaning Social Democrat and Left Party politicians as ""soccer diplomacy.""

But calls for some kind of sanctions are growing ever louder; at the same time, criticism is also reverberating that this form of conflict resolution is simply wrong. Even EU Parliament President Martin Schulz, himself a German Social Democrat, has expressed doubt as to whether such words will ultimately bring Putin to the negotiating table.

Watered down sanctions?

Be that as it may, the sanctions that have been addressed are seen by many as rather mild. In a commentary in the Swiss daily Neue Zürcher Zeitung, one journalist remarked that the proposed measures are weaker than those hurled at Switzerland following its referendum on capping immigration.

Some German politicians have said that any sanctions at all would miss the mark, resulting merely in further dividing the two sides. Gregor Gysi, parliamentary head of the Left Party, rejects imposing sanctions against Russia altogether: ""You can perhaps impress a weak partner with sanctions, but not Russia. It has China on its side, and we must not underestimate this,"" Gysi told German public radio.

Martin Wansleben is happy about Germany's careful course

""Such a situation lends itself to saber rattling, and as soon as we shout 'sanctions' then Putin will make his own threat,"" Gysi added, pointing out that the EU should also keep in mind its dependency on Russian gas.

The EU's careful stance on the accelerating Ukraine crisis has garnered praise from German economic representatives. ""It's quite right to promote de-escalation,"" said Martin Wansleben, head of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

""We are communicating not only with Putin but with all of Russia,"" he added. ""I think it's smart to say that we're in a position to talk, but at the end of the day we are willing to compromise."" Wansleben also pointed out that the dive taken by the rouble since the outbreak of the crisis can be seen as an indirect effect of the sanctions already pledged.

Close economic ties

Economic sanctions would be senseless for Germany, because they would endanger billions in investments. Trade volumes between Germany and Russia in 2013 were over 75 billion euros ($104 billion). Around 6,000 German companies currently do business in Russia, and around 300,000 jobs could be jeopardized. And then there is the financial sector: European banks have around 180 billion euros in Russia at the moment.

Germany currently gets 35 percent of its oil and gas imports from Russia

EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger's concerns of a potential escalation between Russia and Europe are perhaps the most acute. Sanctions, he said, ""would negatively affect Europe's fragile economic renewal,"" adding that Europe needed to find alternatives to Russian gas. As far as Germany's transition to renewable energy is concerned, Oettinger said it would be impossible without Russian gas. At the moment, Germany receives 35 percent of its oil and gas imports from Russia.

Germany is divided as to whether the West should impose sanctions on Russia. A recent Emnid survey indicates that 45 percent of Germans are against the sanctions, with 44 percent in support. The results were significantly different when the question was put differently: 54 percent of Germans said they wouldn't be willing to help Ukraine if sanctions led to higher gas bills.",

CHICAGO, Ill. – While the world’s airlines continue to adjust their schedules and capacity daily to meet fluctuating demand in the wake of Japan’s devastating earthquakes and tsunami, OAG’s latest monthly snapshot of airline activity reveals unprecedented capacity levels planned for April.

The world’s airlines are scheduled to offer 317.4 million seats this month, according to OAG, a UBM Aviation company, in its April OAG Frequency and Capacity Trend Statistics (FACTS) report. This figure, the highest ever airline capacity for April, is 5% more than the same month in 2010, or 13.9 million more seats, and represents a 1.25% rise in the average number of seats per flight schedule. Frequencies, too, are showing significant growth with a 3% rise, or 80,653 more flights scheduled to operate worldwide in April 2011 compared to April 2010.

The fastest growing market by volume of seats is to and from the Middle East, with an 11% increase in capacity year on year. However, political events in the region will likely have an effect on sustaining this level of scheduled capacity.

In terms of absolute growth, the intra-Asia Pacific region is the clear leader with more than 6.2 million additional seats and 40,203 more published flights this month against April 2010. Over the last five years, figures within the Asia Pacific region have shown average capacity growth of 7% compared to the global average of 4%.

“Japan is such a major influence on the world stage and no region will be immune from the effects of the devastation. That, along with the prevailing economic pressures and concerns about rising oil prices, are certain to impact ongoing demand,” said Peter von Moltke, Chief Executive Officer, UBM Aviation.

The only regional market showing a reduction in overall frequency this month is for flights to and from Central & South America, although this drop is less than 1% and an improvement on March figures when the reduction was 2.7% year on year. In sharp contrast, the low cost sector is bucking this trend. Growth in frequencies and available seats on low cost carriers is higher to and from Central & South America than for any other region this month, up by 28% and 27% respectively.

Analysis of the European market reveals marginal growth of 0.3% in frequencies and just 2% in capacity for services within the region. Even the low cost sector shows modest growth this month with 3% more seats available year on year, compared to a 7% year on year increase in March. Madrid, Cologne, Athens and Stansted all showed a large absolute decline in capacity this month compared to April 2010 with -3%, -15%, -12% and -14% respectively.

“European aviation has been relatively robust in meeting the industry-wide challenges of the last decade, however increased competition from rail operators and a variety of taxation changes in major EU markets are starting to take their toll,” continued von Moltke.

April figures from OAG show UK domestic services are taking a big hit with a 14% drop in overall capacity and an 18% drop in available seats on low cost carriers. Germany, too, shows a significant reduction in capacity this month, with 5% less domestic capacity overall and 11% fewer low cost seats available.

“UK Air Passenger Duty, although frozen until 2012, continues to have an impact on business and leisure air travel demand, and we expect to see further reductions in UK domestic services in our May figures,” von Moltke added.

While North America’s domestic air service has grown at 2% for the month, it is the only region to record a drop in numbers against April 2002, with both frequency and capacity figures down compared to a decade ago. Additionally, for the first time, low cost carriers (LCCs) now represent over 30% of available capacity of the domestic US market.",

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/09/there-is-1-clear-loser-between-russia-and-ukraine.aspx,business,"Russian gas giant Gazprom (OTC:OGZPY) said in an annual meeting with investors in London this week that Europe will become even more dependent on the company's gas supplies in years to come. Gazprom's comments came as tensions over the crisis in Ukraine continue. While tensions have eased slightly this week, there are concerns over Gazprom's gas supplies to Europe that flow through Ukraine. However, any potential cut in gas supply will hurt Gazprom more than Europe, both in the near term and the long term.

Europe more secure

In 2009, following contract disputes, Russia shut gas supplies to Ukraine, which ultimately affected downstream customers in Europe. Earlier this week, Gazprom said that gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine were normal. However, gas supplies could be affected after the company said that it will raise gas prices for Ukraine from the start of April as the country has failed to pay its debts.

Any disputes between Gazprom and Ukraine could lead to a shutdown of gas supplies to Ukraine, which will have an impact on supplies to downstream customers in Europe. But can Europe cope with that? Although some 15% of Europe's total gas imports come through Ukraine, the continent is lot more secured this time than 2009.

In 2009, the gas supplies were cut in January, the coldest month in Europe. Additionally, Europe wasn't prepared for such a cut at the time. However, this time things are very different. The cuts to gas supplies, if they happen, will be in spring this time. Also, this spring season in Europe follows on the heels of an unusually mild winter. As a result, Europe's natural gas inventories are at their highest levels. According to Reuters, central Europe, which relies heavily on Russian gas supplies, has sufficient inventories. It is the same case with Germany, Europe's biggest gas consumer.

In addition, the shale boom in the U.S. has meant that the country now has record natural gas production. This has freed up LNG shipments on the global market, which could end up in Europe in case there is a shortage due to Russian supply cuts.

Gazprom believes otherwise

Although the latest crisis has once again raised questions over Russian gas supplies to Europe, Gazprom believes that the continent will become even more dependent on its gas supplies in the next few years. Speaking at an annual meeting with investors in London earlier this week, Gazprom's deputy head Alexander Medvedev said that the company has increased its share in European markets because Europe's domestic production has fallen in countries such as Britain and Norway.

In 2013, Gazprom accounted for 30% of Europe's total gas imports, compared to 25.6% in 2012. While Europe heavily relies on Russian gas at the moment, events such as those in the Ukraine will likely prompt the continent to start looking at alternative sources for its gas supplies.

As I noted in a previous article, the U.S. should take this opportunity to further its geopolitical interests by removing restrictions on natural gas exports to its allies in Europe. The shale boom, as I noted before, has also freed up LNG shipments from Qatar and Australia, which could end up in Europe. While Europe might be relying on Gazprom right now for its gas supplies, the situation will change dramatically if Russia continues to use the company to further its geopolitical interests.

Additionally, Gazprom is not in a position to lose revenue from Europe. Gazprom relies on Europe even more than Europe does on the company. Europe accounts for about three-quarters of Gazprom's export sales, and Gazprom therefore stands to lose more in the long term.

The company will also lose in the near-term if there are any supply cuts to Ukraine. According to Natural Gas Europe, 55% of gas exports to Europe were shipped via Ukraine. If Ukraine's gas supplies are disrupted, Gazprom and Europe have the option to reduce Ukrainian share to a third and fully load the Nord Stream pipeline. But Natural Gas Europe notes that in such a case, Gazprom will only fulfill two-thirds of its contractual obligations. In other words, Gazprom stands to lose a third of its revenue in the near term if supplies to Ukraine are cut.

Leveraging state-run companies

State-run natural resource companies have always been used for political gains. However, invariably, such moves have ended in a disaster for the company. Remember PDVSA of Venezuela and Pemex of Mexico?

More recently, the Brazilian government has used Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) for subsidizing fuel in the country. The result has been a weakening Petrobras. The company is the world's most indebted oil and gas company. Only a few years ago, Petrobras was seen as the next big thing in the oil and gas sector. However, the company has failed to live up to the expectations, thanks to some disastrous energy policy. Contrast this with BP Plc (NYSE:BP), which was written off after Gulf of Mexico oil spill but has managed to make a strong comeback in the past year.

Europe may be relying heavily on Gazprom at the moment, but the shale boom has changed the dynamics of the global energy market. Europe now has alternative sources for its gas supplies and can secure its energy needs even more if the U.S. removes restrictions on gas imports. Gazprom, therefore, stands to lose more if Russia continues to use the company to serve its geopolitical interests. The conflict in Ukraine will hurt Gazprom in the long-term, as well as potentially in the near term.

""There are vulnerabilities within Russia that [Russian President Vladimir Putin] has politically that can be exploited,"" the Wisconsin Republican told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. ""I think we should consider targeting some of the oligarchs around him that are his enablers and he is their enablers.""

Ryan suggested imposing travel bans and economic sanctions against Putin's wealthy domestic allies, including targeting overseas holdings ""that are illicitly gained through this kleptocracy of the Russian economy.""

Ryan also urged the Obama administration to expand natural gas exports to Europe to help the continent become less dependent on Russian gas and oil -- a significant part of Russia's economy.

""We are a nation with vast energy reserves and potential, but with a government that is seen as hostile toward developing those energy reserves, let alone exporting those energy reserves,"" Ryan said.

""If our government changed its tune on that, if we told Europe we are going to green-light these languishing [natural gas] permit applications for exporting … to Europe, that could do a lot to send the signals that we are intent on loosening Russian's grip on its energy to Europe and that we're going to be a reliable ally to loosen their grip.""

Dow Jones Global Indexes | Global Stock Markets

Political crisis in Ukraine cast a shadow over markets in Western Europe last week and could spark more upheaval if tensions continue to escalate.

Fallout in Western financial markets so far has been largely muted, but any sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and the European Union could elicit a response from Moscow. A deepening rift between Russia and the West could undermine Europe's fragile economic recovery, with investors paying a heavy price. ""With the recent rally in global stocks showing signs of fatigue, the Ukraine crisis could prove the trigger for a market correction,"" says Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.

But depending on how events unfold, the cost could be even higher for Russia, forcing it to think twice before engaging in a punitive game of tit for tat.

EUROPEAN STOCK MARKETS were mostly calm last week, despite heated rhetoric and moves by the Crimea region to secede from Ukraine and join the Russian Federation. Prices on agricultural commodities spiked higher, and gold climbed as investors fled to safe harbors.

Amid saber-rattling, German equities suffered the biggest losses in Western Europe, with the benchmark DAX index slipping 3.5%. There are fears that Russian energy could be used as a political lever, and Germany is one of Europe's biggest oil-and-gas importers.

Those worries may prove to be unfounded. It seems unlikely that Russia would turn off the taps that supply oil and gas to Western Europe for fear of damaging future trading prospects. After a mild winter, Western Europe has accumulated energy reserves, so any squeeze would have little immediate effect. And any disruption in energy flows from Russia would allow European countries to seek alternative suppliers, reducing their reliance on a volatile neighbor.

Russia's Gazprom (ticker: OGZPY), the state-run natural-gas giant, is particularly exposed. Its American depositary receipts dropped 10% in New York last week. Ordinarily, a selloff of that magnitude might look like an opportunity, but it is difficult to recommend Russian equities—even ADRs—when the country's laws offer investors little or no protection.

Turning off the gas to the West is in nobody's best interest. Supplies to Ukraine may be less secure. Natural-gas prices were roughly flat, although they are up about 10% since the start of 2014. Fears over the security of food supplies sent wheat prices soaring 9% last week and corn up more than 7%. Ukraine is a major producer and exporter of both crops. Exports continue, but doubts linger over shipments in the near term.

There was more pain for Russians at home. Investors responded to events in Crimea by pulling money out of the country. Russian stocks fell 11%, but retraced some of those losses and ended the week down 8.6%. The withdrawals saw the ruble plummet against the euro and the dollar, prompting the Russian central bank to raise interest rates by 150 basis points (1.5 percentage points).

Michael Marrese, a strategist at JPMorgan, told a conference call organized by the Atlantic Council that he wasn't sure that was going to be enough. Russia has too many weak banks, he said, and after selling dollars, liquidity was tighter than usual. ""The financial sector is the biggest vulnerability of Russia,"" he says. JPMorgan has downgraded estimates for Russian economic growth this year from 1.8% to 0.8%.

The standoff is likely to persist, so volatility will remain heightened while the crisis plays out.

SHARES OF BRITISH AIRWAYS owner International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.U.K.) have steadily gained altitude in the past couple of years, but they can go higher still.

Its American depository receipts ( ICAGY ) can add 20% in value in the next 12 months, as a restructuring program moves forward, passenger revenue continues to increase, and cost-cutting boosts profits.

IAG, created in 2011 by the merger of the British and Spanish flag carriers, BA and Iberia, is targeting 1.8 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in operating profits in 2015. That is more than double the €770 million the company reported in 2013.

However, IAG should reach this financial destination on schedule. British Airways is profiting from additional takeoff and landing slots at London's busy Heathrow Airport that were acquired with British Midland International in 2012. A revamp at Iberia sharply reduced losses last year.

After doubling in value in the past 12 months, IAG's ADRs were trading on Friday at $37.35, or less than 10 times estimated 2015 earnings of $3.88 a share. IAG is expected to earn $2.70 this year, up from $1.31 in 2013. In comparison, Delta Air Lines (DAL) trades at almost 12 times forecast 2015 earnings.

IAG could be a first-class addition to investors' portfolios.

http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/08/ukraine-crisis-energy-eni-idINL6N0M506W20140308,business,"MILAN, March 8 (Reuters) - The crisis in Ukraine does not yet pose a threat to gas supplies but it is a wake up call for Europe to rethink its energy strategy, the head of Italian oil and gas group Eni said on Saturday.

In an interview with Italian daily La Stampa, Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said the standoff between Ukraine and Russia would not have an impact on gas supplies thanks partly to mild weather across Europe.

“But certainly if the tension continues I do have a few worries for next year,” he said.

On Friday, Russian gas giant Gazprom warned it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on Ukraine’s supporters in Europe, which gets half its Russian gas through the country.

“In any case, precisely in light of this crisis, Europe needs to rethink its energy strategy,” he said.

Gazprom halted gas supplies to Ukraine over unpaid bills at the beginning of 2009 prompting cuts to supplies of Russian gas to Europe during a cold winter.

Scaroni said that Italy’s gas supply structure meant it was in a position to overcome any crisis involving a single supplier, albeit at an extra cost.

“But if another one (supplier) went down the problems would be serious,” he said.

Italy, which imports around 90 percent of its gas needs, has long-term supply agreements in place with Russia, Algeria, Libya and the Netherlands.

In 2012 Russia accounted for around a third of overall imports but data from gas transport grid operator Snam on Friday showed Russian volumes were more than half of daily flows.

Violence in Libya has reduced supplies into Italy and last year Eni agreed to take less gas from Algeria as part of a renegotiation of its long-term gas contracts with the country.

Eni, Italy’s biggest listed company, is one of Europe’s biggest gas wholesalers.

Scaroni said it was improbable Russia would suspend its gas supplies through Ukraine unless there was the threat of actual war between the two countries, which he believed unlikely.

“The Ukrainians make $3 billion a year for the transit of Russian gas through their country. For them that’s a large amount,” he said.

Scaroni, who will be meeting with Gazprom’s head on Tuesday, said it was crucial for Russia to be reliable as a supplier to its Western clients.",

http://www.newsday.com/opinion/columnists/ted-r-bromund/bromund-europe-must-wake-up-to-new-danger-1.7321942,business,"If you looked out from Europe in the 1990s, you could see sunshine on the horizon. With the end of the Cold War, NATO appeared to be on the road to irrelevancy. But the sunshine has faded. Russia's dismemberment of Ukraine should remind Americans and Europeans that European security, for which all of us paid a high price over the past hundred years, is not assured.

For Europe, the decade before 9/11 was hardly perfect. There were wars in the Balkans, and a civil war against Islamists in Algeria, across the Mediterranean. But Russia appeared to be democratizing. Turkey was moving toward Europe. The Israel-Palestinian peace process seemed to be working. Above all, Eastern Europe was secure and free.

Today, few of those hopes remain. Russia is an authoritarian menace. Turkey is unsure of its regional role. Palestinians have never unambiguously accepted Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The Arab Spring has toppled old autocrats, and replaced them with new ones, or with violent radicalism.

All of that is bad. But worse, Americans and Europeans alike are operating on the strategy born in the sunny 1990s. We act as though Europe has solved its security problem, as though it has stable and increasingly friendly borders. It does not.

NATO still exists, but a military alliance without a military is a contradiction in terms. European defense budgets have shrunk, reflecting the broader European public distaste for anything that reeks of hard power. Regrettably, most of the world feels differently.

And since the United States no longer has a single Army brigade permanently deployed in Europe, our own commitment has melted away. This is not because of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia. It's because of the gradual U.S. acceptance after 1989 that most of Europe's problems had been solved, and the European Union could be trusted to handle what was left.

The EU's approach was to employ soft power. North Africa would be slowly pushed toward reform by investment and diplomacy, Turkey would be strung along in negotiations about EU membership, and Ukraine would be pulled westward by support for civil society.

Sign up for The Point Go inside New York politics. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.

But in most cases, the EU's approach didn't work. Turkey tired of the EU's road to nowhere. North Africa didn't reform; it revolted. Ukraine was pulled toward Europe, but the EU's soft power strategy has been crushed by Russia's hard power hammer.

Russia's Vladimir Putin doesn't want to recreate the Soviet empire. He's learned the lesson of its fall: Don't occupy big places, like Poland, that hate your guts. His strategy is subtle: Use a Russian population, or create it by distributing passports, to manufacture grievances, then occupy a little chunk of territory and intimidate the rest. He still has vulnerable neighbors, including the Baltic republics.

This week, the crisis is in Ukraine. But Crimea looks likely to join Kaliningrad, Belarus, Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia and Chechnya, all of which are either occupied in whole or in part by Russia, or are pseudo states recognized primarily by Russia and its cronies. These conflicts are frozen by Russian power, and too often ignored by the West, which encourages Putin to try again.

So the first job for the United States and Europe is not responding to the Ukrainian crisis, per se. It is to recognize that our strategy for securing Europe from the troubled periphery is broken. These threats do not stem only from Putin, though he creates more than his fair share. Contrary to our hopes, Europe still has a security problem, one that cannot be met by the EU. As in the Cold War, it will take American leadership in NATO, and American recommitment to the security of Europe.",
http://www.thestar.com.my/News/World/2014/03/08/White-House-downplays-role-of-natural-gas-policy-in-Ukraine-crisis/,business,"ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

""There is no indication currently that there's much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region,"" he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

""So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect,"" Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine's dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

""Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well,"" he said.

By Roberta Rampton

ON BOARD AIR FORCE ONE, March 7 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday appeared to play down the possibility of changing U.S. policy on exporting natural gas to address the situation in Ukraine.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Air Force One that policy changes would not have an immediate effect and noted that natural gas stocks in Europe were above normal levels because of a mild winter.

“There is no indication currently that there’s much risk of a natural gas shortage in the region,” he said.

Europe and Ukraine are key export markets for natural gas from Russia, which has historically shut down pipelines as a pressure tactic. As Russia took control of the Crimean peninsula this week, its state-owned energy company Gazprom said it will stop discounting natural gas for Ukraine.

But widespread shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) are still several years away.

The Department of Energy is working its way down a list of more than 20 applications for LNG export licenses. It has approved six licenses since 2011 and the first project is not expected to begin exporting until late next year. The other five still need approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which can be a lengthy process.

“So proposals to try to respond to the situation in Ukraine that are related to our policy on exporting natural gas would not have an immediate effect,” Earnest said.

Several lawmakers, including Rep. Cory Gardner, a Republican from natural gas-rich Colorado, introduced bills this week to try to speed up the DOE approvals, but they face an uphill battle in the Senate.

NO TERMINALS

Ukraine has no terminals to receive LNG shipments, so even if U.S. cargoes were ready soon it is uncertain when the fuel could be delivered.

Washington instead is working to reduce Ukraine’s dependence on any single source of natural gas.

Ukraine and Eastern Europe could get more gas from Northern Africa, including Libya and Algeria, and from East Africa or the Mediterranean in the next couple of years.

Washington is also hoping Croatia will build an LNG receiving terminal, which could help Hungary, Slovenia and perhaps Ukraine.

Once U.S. LNG exports start they likely will first head to Japan, India and other Asian countries that have little access to gas sent via pipeline and are willing to pay more for the fuel than Europe does.

As more U.S. projects are approved and investors spend billions of dollars to build them, U.S. LNG could play a bigger role after 2017 in reducing global prices for the commodity, analysts said.

Earnest noted that Russia prides itself on being a reliable supplier of natural gas to other countries. That reputation would be jeopardized if it turned off the taps during the Ukraine crisis.

“Russia currently yields about $50 billion a year in revenue from exporting natural gas, so ending that kind of relationship with Europe would have significant financial consequences for Russia as well,” he said.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/07/heres-why-what-happens-with-russia-and-ukraine-mat.aspx,business,"The situation in Ukraine and Crimea is ugly, complicated, and disturbing. It's moving to see the Ukrainian people fight for a more free and open society, even as Russia looks to be breaking international laws and muscling in on Crimea -- which has been part of Ukraine for more than 60 years. While I don't think it's fair for me -- or 99% of Americans -- to weigh in on what should happen, beyond letting the people of Crimea -- all of them, not just ethnic Russians -- have a voice in their destiny, the fact is, whatever happens will probably have far-reaching implications even here in America.

One only has to look at two companies tied to the natural gas transportation business to see the potential for harm. Both Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS) and Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) are set up to lose if Russia keeps down a path that leads to international sanctions.

Just getting traction in a huge market

Last May, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev issued a decree to convert 50% of public transit and fleet vehicles in cities of more than 1 million people to natural gas by 2020. This amounts to potentially hundreds of thousands of natural-gas vehicles, including taxis, buses, and other support vehicles used in fleets. Not only does Russia hold some of the world's largest natural-gas reserves, it has very few natural gas refueling stations -- only around 200 or so -- in place to support new vehicles.

Clean Energy Fuels announced a partnership with Russian Machines Corp just last month, naming the company as exclusive distributor and service provider of its IMW brand of compressors and compressor-filling systems in Russia. The two companies already work together in six other countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

For Chart Industries, the company has just attained GOST R certification (a Russian government standard) for its LNG vehicle-fuel systems, meaning it would have access to this massive market as well. In addition to vehicle-fuel systems, Chart has plans to sell its permanent and mobile refueling stations as well as its L/CNG refueling systems in Russia in the near future.

Sanctions coming?



The risk, of course, is potential economic sanctions. If the situation around Crimea and Ukraine continues, economic sanctions would likely exclude or limit American businesses from doing business in Russia. The anti-U.S. backlash from Russians, if indeed sanctions of any kind to occur, could very well limit business dealings -- no matter what the eventual outcome is. The thing is, Russia has Europe over a barrel -- or more accurately, over a natural-gas pipeline, so it's really hard to say what, exactly, will happen. But the risk is very real.

What's the opportunity?

One only has to look at Chart's strong business growth in China in recent years to see the potential for the Russian market. In 2013, Chart signed one deal with PetroChina alone that was worth $50 million and announced an $80 million expansion of its manufacturing facility in the country that will double production capacity when complete. The Asian market is simply massive; Chart's Distribution and Storage business grew 66% in Asia last year. Russia should be a significant part of Chart's growth in Asia for years to come.





For Clean Energy Fuels, CEO Andrew Littlefair wouldn't project any numbers for the deal with Russian Machines. But the IMW deal in 2013 with China Gas should give some indication: That deal called for as many as 416 compressors at 310 stations and could amount to $150 million in revenue over three years. Considering Clean Energy did around $350 million in total sales in 2013, $50 million per year is a significant amount of upside. The deal with Russian Machines could offer similar potential. The possibility of sanctions alters that potential in a real way.

Final thoughts: Human lives are at stake and this matters more right now

Let me be clear about one thing: The loss of any upside for these companies pales in comparison to the potential for armed conflict and loss of lives should this situation escalate. But investors should at least keep an eye on this and be aware that there could be impacts -- if not to the near-term potential -- to the opportunity for these companies to expand into the Russian market. While it will have limited impact in 2014 no matter what happens, it's a reminder how conflicts a world away can impact us in ways we don't expect.",

VIENNA (Reuters) - The Council of Europe, the pan-European human rights watchdog, is offering to investigate violence and the treatment of minorities in Ukraine to try to defuse mounting tensions between Kiev and Russia, Austria said.

Sebastian Kurz, the foreign minister of Austria, which holds the revolving chair of the 47-member Council until May, told Reuters on Friday that he and the Council's secretary general would visit Kiev on Monday to offer its services in the conflict.

Moscow has cited the need to protect the rights of the ethnic Russian minority in Ukraine as the official reason for its military intervention that has put pro-Russia forces in control of the Crimea region, where ethnic Russians are in the majority.

President Vladimir Putin underscored that on Friday, rebuffing a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over Moscow's intervention and saying that Russia could not ignore calls for help from Russian speakers in Ukraine.

""We know the ethnic Russians in Crimea are anything but a minority but nevertheless for peaceful co-existence in Crimea it is decisive how people treat each other in Ukraine, how human rights are respected and how minorities are protected and supported,"" Kurz said.

Both Russia and Ukraine are members of the Council of Europe, which Kurz said had credibility and expertise in supporting minority rights. He called the Ukrainian parliament's repeal of a law making Russia a recognized language in some regions ""an absolute mistake"".

The Council of Europe is best known for drawing up the European Convention on Human Rights, which entered into force in 1953 and established the European Court of Human Rights.

Asked how Russia had reacted so far to the mediation offer, Kurz said: ""At least there have been no negative voices in the Council of Europe from the Russian side.""

The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is also trying to mediate in Ukraine.

However, dozens of military observers from OSCE members invited by Ukraine to monitor the situation in Crimea had to turn back on Thursday after failing to get past roadblocks.

The OSCE, a pan-European forum for security issues that was set up during the Cold War, is also trying to put together a ""contact group"" of leading players in the Ukraine crisis and to arrange a broader monitoring mission for Ukraine.

OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities Astrid Thors expressed alarm on Thursday about the situation in Crimea, citing ""a real risk of bloodshed"".

During her visit to Kiev and Crimea, she ""found no evidence of violations or threats to the rights of Russian speakers"", her office said in a statement.

The transaction will create a combined company valued at $US1.07 billion ($A1.19 billion) named ChiquitaFyffes, a fresh produce company with annual revenue of $US4.6 billion, the companies said in a joint statement.

The all-stock deal values the Irish company at $US526 million. The combined company will become the leading global banana and other fresh produce company, with sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas a year, they said.

The deal puts together two storied banana companies that began in the 19th century as modest suppliers and grew into global powerhouses.

Chiquita was founded by Captain Lorenzo Dow Baker, who in 1870 bought bunches of bananas in Jamaica and sold them for a profit in New Jersey.

Fyffes, founded in 1888 as EW Fyffe, Son and Co, launched the first fruit brand in the world in 1929 with its “Fyffes Blue Label” sticker on bananas.

“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,” said Ed Lonergan, Chiquita's chief executive.

Chiquita is a leading global marketer and distributor of fresh food products, including bananas and packaged salads. Fyffes is one of Europe's largest tropical produce distributors, mainly bananas, pineapples and melons.

Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 per cent of the new company, with Fyffes shareholders owning the rest. The value of the transaction was based on the companies' closing share prices on Friday and an exchange rate of one euro to $US1.39. ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and a workforce of some 32,000 people.

Lonergan will serve as chairman of ChiquitaFyffes and David McCann, Fyffes executive chairman, will be chief executive.

“We are looking forward to working with the Chiquita team to build a combined company which is well positioned to succeed in our highly competitive marketplace and which will create significant value for our shareholders,” McCann said.

The merger is subject to shareholder and regulator approvals. The companies expect it to close by the end of the year.

Chiquita and Fyffes predicted the tie-up of their complementary business would produce operational efficiencies and pre-tax cost savings of at least $US40 million a year by the end of 2016. The combined company will have more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America.

They pledged to continue their commitment to sustainability and pro-environment concerns.

“ChiquitaFyffes will continue its environmental and social responsibility commitments, including adding additional organic, Fairtrade, GlobalGAP and Rainforest Alliance certified capacity,” they said.

The merged company will maintain the brands of each company. Generations of Americans know Chiquita brand bananas, brought to life in 1944 by the glamorous Miss Chiquita animated banana and portrayed live by models and personalities.

Fyffes has extended its groundbreaking oval Blue Label banana brand to Blue Label Pineapples and winter season melons.

The combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and based in Ireland.

Chiquita, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, posted a loss of $US16 million for 2013, a sharp improvement after losing $US405 million in 2012.

On Monday, Fyffes announced preliminary results for 2013 showing a profit of $US26.1 million euros ($A28.96 million), up almost 10 per cent from the prior year.

Chiquita shares jumped 12.1 per cent to $US12.15 in late-morning trade in New York. Fyffes soared 42 per cent to 106.50 pence in London.",

http://qz.com/185873/the-big-banana-merger-might-be-more-about-melons-pineapples-and-irish-taxes-than-bananas/,business,"On the face of it, Chiquita’s proposed merger with fellow banana giant, Fyffes, makes sense a lot of sense. Since he took over as Chiquita’s CEO in October 2012, Ed Longergan has aggressively reversed the company’s money-losing diversification strategy, vowing instead to concentrate on bananas and salads. The merger seems to help with that; some 71% of the new company’s sales will come from bananas, compared with 65% of Chiquita’s.

But look at it another way, and you see the deal boosting its “other produce category” from the current 4% to 9%—a funny move for a company dead-set on un-diversifying. Assuming the new company passes antitrust muster, a lot of ChiquitaFyffes’ new non-banana business will come from melons and pineapples, in which Fyffes has been investing pretty heavily (pdf, p.19).

Fyffes ​

Why would Chiquita be reversing course, abandoning the diversification strategy that saw it shed grape and avocado production?

For one thing, both melons and pineapples are proving promising for Fyffes. The company’s melon business focuses on the US, where sales have more than doubled since 2008, and it became the top melon-seller in 2011. As for pineapples, while its sales trail those of Fresh Del Monte and Dole in both Europe and the US, Fyffes’ share has been steadily increasing. Neither division would be easily sold off. Fyffes has invested heavily in expanding cultivation of both types of fruit in Latin America; its now grows all of its melons and 56% of its pineapples there.

But another reason might be the rising risk that banana diseases pose to the industry. We recently discussed how an invincible fungus called Panama disease will inevitably threaten banana plantations in Latin America, where the vast majority of export bananas are grown. A more immediate menace is Black Sigatoka, a disease that typically causes losses of 50%-80% of any crop it strikes and is already a severe problem in a slew of Latin American countries. That disease and others force growers to use more pesticides, causing a sharp spike in costs. The growing torrents of chemicals that farmers have to pour on their banana crops is also upping concerns about environmental destruction and harm to workers.

One other thing to note is that Chiquita is not in great financial shape; as of Aug. 2013, its $602 million in total debt was the second-highest relative to earnings among 32 similar packaged-food and meat companies in the US, reports Bloomberg. Which is why it’s interesting that, despite the fact that Chiquita is much bigger than Fyffes, the new company will be based in Ireland, Fyffes’ home country, rather than Chiquita’s home, the US. As Quartz’s Tim Fernholz recently noted, Ireland has an incredibly low corporate tax rate. And for Chiquita, a company struggling to up its cash flow, that certainly can’t hurt.",

Produce giant Chiquita Brands International said Monday that it will buy Irish rival Fyffes in an all-stock deal valued at $526 million, making the Charlotte-based company the world’s largest banana supplier.

The merger is sure to raise a stink in an industry dominated by a small bunch of suppliers. Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole Food and Fresh Del Monte control more than 80 percent of the world’s banana trade, according to the United Nations.

Chiquita estimates that the acquisition will result in annual revenue of $4.6 billion and produce operational savings of about $40 million by the end of 2016. The deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2014, has been approved by both boards. It is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.

The combined company will be known as ChiquitaFyffes, with 50.7 percent of the firm owned by Chiquita shareholders and the remaining 49.3 percent held by Fyffes shareholders. ChiquitaFyffes, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, will be incorporated in Ireland and have an estimated value of $1.07 billion, according to the company.

“This is a natural strategic partnership,” Ed Lonergan, Chiquita’s chief executive, said in a statement. “The combined company will also be able to provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.”

Lonergan will become chairman of the new company, while Fyffes’s executive chairman, David McCann, will become chief executive. ChiquitaFyffes will have a combined workforce of 32,000 employees in nearly 70 countries. It also will have a strong position in pineapples, melons and packaged salads, according to the company.

“This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business,” McCann said in a statement.

It is a difficult time to be in the banana business.

Exports of the fruit rose by 7.3 percent in 2012 to an all-time high of 16.5 million tons, according to the most recent data from the U.N. Innovations. Refrigeration of bananas in transport has extended their shelf life and bolstered demand.

Yet pricing pressures from supermarkets are hurting producer profits, while growers battle higher production costs in the face of rising levels of disease, analysts say.

“Two big fruit companies have felt the downward pressure of the big retail buyers on their margins, and consolidation appears to them to be a strategy for survival,” said Alistair Smith, international coordinator for Banana Link, a British nonprofit group fighting for fair banana trade. “Small farmers are under pressure from all sides, and big mergers like this can only make them more nervous about the future of their livelihoods.”

An unexpected oversupply of bananas in Guatemala and Ecuador created a soft market for Chiquita in the last three months of 2013, according to the company.

It lost $31 million during the fourth quarter, down from a $333 million loss for the same period a year earlier. Chiquita also was rocked by a persistent drought in the West that led to a shortage of iceberg lettuce and other ingredients needed for its Fresh Express-brand bagged salads.

The merger will unite two of the world’s oldest fruit distributors.

Chiquita began in 1870, when Capt. Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica and sailed them to Jersey City. The company made a name for itself in 1944 by introducing the world to “Miss Chiquita,” a cartoon banana that extolled the virtues of eating the fruit.

Not all of Chiquita’s history is as bright. The company, under the name United Fruit, forced regime change throughout the Caribbean and Central America during the 1950s and ’60s to protect its interests.

Chiquita filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001, crippled by trade restrictions imposed by the European Union. That year, it paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $100,000 to resolve allegations that employees concealed a bribe paid to Colombian officials for a customs license.

Payoffs in Colombia got Chiquita in trouble again in 2007, when the company handed the Justice Department $25 million for paying paramilitary groups $1.7 million for protection in the northern Uraba region. U.S. officials got involved because the groups were on the State Department’s terrorist watch list.

Dublin-based Fyffes has been distributing bananas since founder Edward Wathen Fyffe shipped his first bunch in 1888 from the Canary Islands to London. The McCann family has run the company since the 1950s.

Shares of Fyffes rose more than 40 percent on news of the merger, while Chiquita’s shares surged more than 10 percent.",

In a $1.07 billion all-stock deal, the combined company would have an estimated $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas.

The merger should help the companies more efficiently supply the planet’s biggest banana republic: namely, the U.S. “The No. 1 fruit Americans eat is bananas,” says Harry Balzer, chief industry analyst with NPD Group. Indeed, while in 1970, Americans ate just about seven pounds of bananas per person (and more than 10 pounds of apples, which were at that time our favorite fruit), by 2010, they were eating more than 10 pounds of bananas per person, and only around 9.5 pounds of apples, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Global consumers love bananas too. According to the United Nations, global banana exports in 2012 climbed more than 7% from 2011 to a record high of 16.5 million tons; the U.S. and Europe accounted for more than half of banana imports.

The Chiquita-Fyffes merger will generate an annual cost savings of $40 million by 2016, according to the companies. And that savings might mean slightly lower prices for consumers, says IBISWorld analyst Antal Neville, who says that ChiquitaFyffes may want to gain market share by offering up the best banana prices for consumers. Currently, bananas cost roughly $0.60 per pound — significantly less on a per-pound basis than apples, oranges, grapefruits, tomatoes and more, according to government data. “Because it’s one of the most consumed fruits, prices really matter,” says Neville. “So the merger could mean cost savings for consumers.”

Indeed, grocers are often reluctant to pass along price increases. According to a United Nations report, wholesale banana prices increased 6.5% in 2012 compared with 2011, while retail prices actually decreased 1.3%. “This apparent contradiction could be explained by the fact that supermarkets spread temporary losses from higher wholesale prices across other products that they sell,” while keeping the prices of bananas low for their customers, the report concludes.

Still, if the deadly banana plague that has hit Asia and parts of Australia hits Latin America and the Caribbean, which produce roughly three-fourths of the world’s bananas, prices could jump, says Neville. The disease, which scientists say is caused by a soil fungus, attacks the popular Cavendish variety of bananas (which makes up about 80% of all banana exports) and rots the banana plants, turning the normally yellowish banana a rancid-smelling brownish color, and rendering the fruit inedible. The disease is especially troubling because it ruins large numbers of bananas (a variant of today’s fungus virtually killed off the Gros Michel banana variety) and recently made the jump from Asia to Mozambique and Jordan.

Experts say that if the banana plague takes a particularly heavy toll, consumers may feel the impact on their wallets — and not just from the price of buying a banana at the grocery store. Neville says that if prices climb high enough, some businesses will choose to raise prices on things like smoothies and muffins that contain bananas. Still, he adds, a much more likely scenario is that — unless prices skyrocket — companies will eat a potential uptick in banana prices.

Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they have agreed to merge, creating the world's biggest banana supplier.

The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.

The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.

Current Fyffes and Chiquita shareholders each would own half of a combined operation expected to generate $4.6 billion in annual sales.

The two companies said the merger would create a banana behemoth that ships more than 160 million crates worldwide, about a quarter more than either of their main rivals, Dole and Del Monte.

ChiquitaFyffes also would become the world's No. 3 distributor of pineapples and melons.

Fyffes is Europe's biggest banana importer and the oldest industry brand, dating to 1929; Irish wits have long cited the company's presence here as proof that Ireland really is a banana republic. The company enjoys exclusive export rights for the Central American country of Belize.

David McCann, Fyffes' chair, will become chief executive officer of the combined company, while the chief executive of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita, Ed Lonergan, will become its chair.

Lonergan said their ""natural strategic partnership"" would ""provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.""",

Chiquita Brands International has agreed to buy Fyffes Plc, a Dublin-based fruit distributor, for about $565 million, according to a Chiquita and Fyffes joint company statement released Monday. The merger will bring together two of the world’s oldest fruit importers.

Pending approval, the deal will be a boon for investors as well: Fyffes shareholders will get 0.1567 shares of the new company for every one share they own of Fyffles, and Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each Chiquita share. Shares of both companies surged: Fyffes rose 44 percent in Dublin trading, while shares for Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita jumped 14 percent in the morning before leveling off later Monday. It closed up 10.7 percent at $12 a share.

The new company will be called ChiquitaFyffes and be worth an estimated $1.7 billion. It will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but operations will be based in Ireland. Chiquita shareholders will own 50.7 percent of the new company, with Fyffes shareholders owning the remaining 49.3 percent.

""This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business. We are looking forward to working with the Chiquita team to build a combined company which is well positioned to succeed in our highly competitive marketplace and which will create significant value for our shareholders,"" Fyffes Executive Chairman David Cann said in the companies’ joint press statement. “We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.""

Chiquita employs approximately 20,000 workers; Fyffes has about 12,000 workers.

According to the two companies, the merger will create a company grossing $4.6 billion in annual revenue. The merger should be completed by the end of 2014. The deal puts ChiquitaFyffes well ahead of Dole and Del Monte, its chief competitors in the banana distribution market. The new company moves a combined 180 million boxes of bananas per year, while Del Monte and Dole sell 117 million and 110 million, respectively.

Chiquita and Fyffes are both very well-known brands, albeit to different groups of people. Chiquita, formerly known as the United Fruit Company, was founded in 1863 and is the chief banana distributor for the United States. It has a checkered history, fraught with accusations of human rights violations and bribery scandals. In 2010, the company reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the US federal government over allegations that it had financial ties to Colombian paramilitary groups.

Fyffes also began in the 1870s, as a group of banana plantations in the Virgin Islands, and is one of the largest tropical fruit importers in Europe. The company was linked to an insider trading scandal in 2008.",

When four plan to become three, alarm bells should sound at the competition authorities. The plan by Chiquita and Fyffes to become top bananas in their world, creating distance from global rivals Dole and Del Monte, is no exception.

A combined ChiquitaFyffes might control only about 15% of the global banana market but that could still be enough to change the structure of the market. True, Chiquita serves mostly the US market, whereas Irish-based Fyffes concentrates on Europe, but there is some crossover that can't be ignored. Nor, too, can the impact on smaller producers' attempts to find a viable foothold in a tough market where the pressures at the growers' end of the chain are notoriously intense.

ChiquitaFyffes' best argument is that nobody in the banana-distribution game is making fat profit margins and that supermarkets everywhere are quite capable of protecting consumers' interests. It's not an unreasonable argument – but it should be tested.

As for the deal itself, the financial logic is obvious. Chiquita and Fyffes say they could save $40m a year from ""efficiencies in the areas of logistics and procurement"". That's a chunky sum in the context of current aggregate top-line earnings of $175m – thus the strong share price reaction, particularly at Fyffes, whose owners would get 49.3% of the combo. The bigger question, though, is whether there's also something in this deal for consumers and banana-growers. The merger will probably happen but let's see it examined properly.",

American fruit firm Chiquita and Irish fruit distributor Fyffes have agreed to merge, creating the world's largest banana company. The all-stock deal, valued at $1.07 billion, will create a new company ChiquitaFyffes that will soon control about a third percent of the world's export banana market. Chiquita pretty much dominates North American while Fyffes rules in Europe.

Here are some major takeaways from the deal that makes ChiquitaFyffes the world's top, uh ... banana.

A heavily-concentrated banana industry

Four companies — Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Del Monto — control more than 80 percent of the world's banana sales, according to the UN. Once this merger deal goes through, that number will decrease by one.

This concentration is noticeable not just in the business ranks, but in the actual species of bananas grown. The banana industry largely relies on one single species called the Cavendish, the long yellow offering you know well from trips to the grocery store. While other fruits are diversified — apples, for example, come in granny smith, red delicious, fuji, and many more — the banana industry's reliance on one type leaves the industry vulnerable to certain shocks... like a banana-killing fungus moving to Latin America, where most of the world's banana exports are grown. ""Panama Disease"" has hurt Asian exports the past few years and is just now spreading to the top banana of Latin American exports. It's a risk for not just the corporation, but also their competitors.",

If approved by regulators by the end of the year, the resulting entity will have $1.07 billion in combined value, the companies said.

Chiquita, known for the blue label on its bananas, is buying its Irish rival Fyffes to become the world's top banana supplier.

(PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images)

A pair of banana fans.

Chiquita Brands International Inc., owner of the namesake banana label, agreed to buy Ireland’s Fyffes Plc to create the world’s biggest supplier of the fruit for about 407 million euros ($565 million).

The combined company will be called ChiquitaFyffes Plc, Chiquita and Fyffes said today in a joint statement. The all- stock offer represents a bid premium of 35 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Shares of Chiquita and Fyffes rose.

The deal brings together two of the world’s oldest fruit importers, who between them have operations spanning the Americas, Europe and Asia. Chiquita Chief Executive Officer Ed Lonergan, who will become chairman of ChiquitaFyffes, has sought to reshape his Charlotte, North Carolina-based company as a high-volume seller of bananas and salads while winding down and abandoning other product lines.

“The deal is logical and will be a good fit going forward for both parties,” said David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Capital in Dublin. “This is an excellent result for Fyffes.”

Investors will get 0.1567 of a share in ChiquitaFyffes for each Fyffes share, while Chiquita holders will receive one share in the new company for each one of the existing company.

Fyffes Chairman David McCann will become CEO of the combined company, which will be domiciled in Ireland, trade in New York and have annual sales of about $4.6 billion. The transaction is expected to close this year, pending approval by shareholders and the Irish High Court.

Minimal Overlap

Chiquita investors will own about 50.7 percent of the combined entity, with Fyffes shareholders holding the remainder. As well as bananas, ChiquitaFyffes will supply melons, pineapples and packaged salads. The new business will target at least $40 million of annual cost savings by the end of 2016 through more efficient purchasing.

Fyffes shares rose 45 percent to 1.29 euros at 3:21 p.m. in Dublin. Chiquita climbed 12 percent to $12.15 in New York.

Lonergan, who will become chairman of ChiquitaFyffes, said today on a conference call that he doesn’t think there will be any regulatory issues arising from the deal that can’t be addressed.

He also said there’s minimal overlap of both companies geographically. Chiquita operates in 70 countries including the U.S., with brands such as Chiquita Bananas and Fresh Express. Fyffes operates in Europe, Central and South America, and Asia.

Conference Meeting

Chiquita started more than 140 years ago when Captain Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica, sailed to Jersey City in 11 days and sold them for a profit. The company is still incorporated in New Jersey, according to corporate filings.

Fyffes says it has distributed the fruit since the 19th century, when it made a shipment to London from the Canary Islands.

McCann and his family have led Fyffes since the 1950s when his father Neil joined the business, according to company statements.

Lonergan first suggested the deal when he met the Fyffes Chairman at a fruit conference in New Orleans in October, McCann said in today in an interview.

“Between us, we can provide any type of banana that a retailer wants,” Lonergan said in the same interview.

Balkan Investment Co., an entity run by the McCanns, controls about 13 percent of Fyffes and intends to vote for the deal. The Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust, which controls about 13 percent of Fyffes, also has committed to backing the merger. Other shareholders include Fidelity Investment funds, which control about 20 percent.

The biggest holders in Chiquita include Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc., who control almost 20 percent combined.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is acting as lead financial adviser to Chiquita, and Wells Fargo Securities LLC as financial adviser to the Chiquita board of directors. Lazard Ltd. is lead financial adviser to Fyffes.

An extended geographic presence, a wider product portfolio and a broader supply base are among the benefits from the merger of Chiquita Brands International and Fyffes, the produce giants said today (10 March).

The two companies this morning set out a deal to create ChiquitaFyffes, a business that will become the largest supplier of bananas worldwide.

Speaking to analysts on a conference call after the proposed merger was announced, Ed Lonergan, the Chiquita CEO set to be the chairman of the combined company, said the three factors were ""critically important"" to the new group.

""We don't tend to operate on top of one another with our brands. There's a de minimis overlap of the Fyffes brand and the Chiquita brand. The combination of Fyffes' geographies and Chiquita's geographies was truly compelling,"" Lonergan said.

Chiquita and Fyffes are, with Dole Food Co. and Fresh Del Monte Produce, four suppliers that account for 80% of the banana market. However, Lonergan said Chiquita and Fyffes did not expect to encounter concerns from market regulators, particularly in parts of Europe where both companies have notable positions.

""We don't think there are any issues we can't address in the regulatory process,"" Lonergan said.

The Chiquita boss, meanwhile, said the combined business, which would have annual sales of around US$4.6bn, would benefit from an expanded product range. ""The opportunity to have brands, organic, Fairtrade, private label all from one company is quite compelling for our customer base,"" he said. The companies insisted they would keep both of their namesake brands.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who is set to be the new CEO of ChiquitaFyffes, told analysts the larger business would be better able to counter volatility in the banana market caused by external factors.

""Tog, our supply operations will benefit from the broadest geographical diversity in the industry, enabling the company to better meet customer and consumer needs for variety and better insulate the company from weather and other disruptions in any given area,"" he said.

The companies also see financial benefits from the transaction, including cost savings. They have set a target of ""annualised pre-tax cost synergies"" of US$40m by the end of 2016.

""We are very confident in the $40m of synergies we've identified, primarily in operations - growing, procuring and shipping our product. There are simple choices around the number of vessels we can run, comb the streams of product flow we have acr the oceans,"" Lonergan said. ""We are also quite confident that as we continue to work together over the course of the coming years we'll find ways to operate more efficiently as we proceed.""

The stock-for-stock transaction will see investors in US-based Chiquita own around 50.7% of what will be called ChiquitaFyffes. Shareholders in Ireland's Fyffes will own the other 49.3%.

Under the terms of the deal, Fyffes shareholders will receive 0.1567 ChiquitaFyffes shares for each share they hold in the Ireland-based firm. Chiquita investors will receive one ChiquitaFyffes share for each share they own in the US group.

The transaction values Fyffes at approximately US$526m and each Fyffes share at EUR1.22, which represents a premium of approximately 36% compared to the company's volume-weighted average trading price for the 30 trading days up until 7 March and a 38% premium to the Fyffes closing share price that day.

On that basis, the transaction will result in a combined equity value of approximately $1.07bn.",

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes, have its listing in New York and generate annual revenues of almost £3 billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide. Chiquita is the larger of the two firms with annual revenues of $3bn (£1.8bn) and some 20,000 staff.

The all-share tie-up will be subject to review by competition authorities but analysts believe it is unlikely to prompt major regulatory demands because the two businesses operate mainly inseparate North American and European markets.

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced in the Tropics from countries such as Colombia, Costa Rica and Guatemala.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including in Livingston, Portsmouth and Wakefield.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the merged firm, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business.”",

What: Shares of Chiquita Brands International, Inc. (UNKNOWN:CQB.DL) were looking ripe today, climbing as much as 19% after announcing a merger with Fyffes, a produce company based in Ireland.

So what: The merger will create a new company known as ChiquitaFyffes, 50.7% of which will be owned by Chiquita shareholders and the remaining 49.3% to be owned by Fyffes shareholders, though the two brands will continue to operate separately. The companies said the combination would create the No. 1 banana company globally, with a 14% market share, and would lead to $40 million in annual cost savings and synergies and allow further opportunities to improve operational leverage.

Now what: The deal will be subject to the usual regulatory scrutiny, but analysts expect the merger to go through as the companies primarily deal in different parts of the world, Chiquita in North America and Fyffes in Europe. Investors on both sides clearly seem to approve of the merger as Fyffes' shares jumped 44% on the news, but several analysts said the deal is reflective of weakness in the industry and could prompt further consolidation. Merging two corporate cultures is also sometimes rougher than expected. Chiquita and Fyffes expect the deal to close by the end of the year.",

Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38% over its Friday's closing price. Fyffes shares jumped 29% to 1.15 euros by 0710 GMT.

The deal could raise antitrust issues, given that more than 80% of the global banana market is controlled by four multinationals Chiquita, Fyffes, Fresh Del Monte and Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company according to the United Nations.

Fruit supply companies Chiquita of the United States and Fyffes of Ireland said Monday they had agreed to merge to create the world”s biggest banana supplier.

The all-shares agreement means the two companies will become ChiquitaFyffes PLC, be traded on the New York Stock Exchange and be headquartered in Dublin, a more tax-efficient corporate base.

The companies said the deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval in Ireland and the United States, would generate $40 million in pre-tax savings through more efficient operations.

Shares in both companies surged, particularly Dublin-based Fyffes, because Monday”s deal valued Fyffes shares at $1.66.

Fyffes rose 46 percent to $1.80 on the Irish Stock Exchange. Chiquita rose nearly 13 percent to $12.20 in New York.

By Sam Cage

DUBLIN, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. fruit firm Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe’s largest distributor, have struck an all-stock deal to create the world’s biggest banana supplier.

With the $526 million tie-up, the new firm will grab some 14 percent of the global banana market, and considerable negotiating power at a time when supermarkets are cutting prices for their product owing to an economic downturn.

“Two big fruit companies have felt the downward pressure of the big retail buyers on their margins and consolidation appears to them to be a strategy for survival,” said Bananalink, a British-based group which works for more sustainable trade in bananas and pineapples.

The global banana market, worth $7 billion, is currently controlled by four multinationals, according to the United Nations: Chiquita, Fresh Del Monte, Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company and Fyffes.

Chiquita and Fyffes sell 180 million boxes of bananas a year between them, versus 117 million for Del Monte and 110 for Dole. The combined ChiquitaFyffes will have $4.6 billion in annual revenues and expects to make operational pre-tax savings of at least $40 million by the end of 2016.

“The first three (companies) on a global scale are not too far away from each other, whereas Fyffes was a good deal smaller. Now a firm number one has been created, there will be some impetus for further consolidation in the sector,” said David Holohan, an analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin.

The new firm will be listed in New York - though domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes - and have a market value of $1.1 billion. Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the combined company and Fyffes shareholders the remaining 49.3 percent, the companies said.

REGULATORY HURDLES

The deal will be subject to review by competition authorities but, Holohan added, is unlikely to prompt burdensome regulatory demands because the two companies operate mainly in separate North American and European markets.

Chiquita Chief Executive Ed Lonergan, who will be chairman of the combined company, was confident the match of the businesses would persuade regulators to give it the green light, with most of the savings expected in logistics.

“We looked at it and thought we could create a much stronger competitor,” Lonergan told Reuters. “The overlap between the businesses is de minimis.”

Fyffes shares leaped 44 percent on Monday, bringing the stock, which had traded at about 10 times earnings prior to the announcement, roughly into line with its peers

Chiquita shareholders will get one share of the new company for each share held. Fyffes investors will get 0.1567 of a share in the new group for each existing share, which values it at a premium of 38 percent over its Friday’s closing price.

Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as financial advisers for Chiquita and its board and Lazard for Fyffes.

FAIR TRADE

Most bananas are grown for export on large plantations in Latin America and Africa and are from a single variety. This standardises taste and brings economies of scale but leaves the bananas vulnerable to diseases which can require extensive fungicide treatment, a potential hazard to local ecosystems.

Campaigners for sustainable farming expressed concern that the ChiquitaFyffes tie-up could intensify the economic pressure on small-scale banana producers, as well as environmental hazards.

“The banana market is dysfunctional and this merger feels like further proof,” said Michael Gidney, chief executive of British charity The Fairtrade Foundation.

“There’s downward pressure that’s creating a race for the bottom. The big producers are under pressure too - the banana business is not working for anybody.”",

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/commodities/10688380/Chiquita-and-Fyffes-to-create-worlds-biggest-banana-group.html,business,"Two of the world’s oldest fruit suppliers are joining forces via a $1.1bn (£660m) all-share merger to create the biggest banana business on the planet.

North Carolina-based Chiquita Brands and Dublin-headquartered Fyffes said they were creating a fresh produce company employing 32,000 people in more than 70 countries, with $4.6bn of annual sales.

The enlarged group, 50.7pc-owned by Chiquita shareholders and 49.3pc by Fyffes, will sell more than 160m boxes of bananas a year as well as having significant clout in the world of melons, pineapples and packaged salads.

The new group aims, it said, to capitalise on “the growing fresh food business and health and wellness trends by more effectively utilising its geographical footprint and expanded distribution channels”.

“This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes,” said Ed Lonergan, Chiquita’s chief executive, who will chair the new ChiquitaFyffes business. It will be listed on the New York stock exchange and domiciled in Ireland.

News of the deal sent shares in Fyffes rocketing 40 cents to €1.29 in Dublin, its highest level since 2000, with the transaction valuing the company at €1.22 a share, a 38pc premium to Friday’s closing price.

Shares in Chiquita also jumped, rising more than 12pc to $12.15, as the market warmed to a mooted $40m of annual synergies by the end of 2016, not from job cuts but savings on shipping, packaging and procurement.

The merger combines two groups steeped in history. Fyffes dates back to the 1880s when EW Fyffe Son & Co took its first delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands.

Its more recent history has seen the involvement of three generations of the family of executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the combined group.

His grandfather, Charles McCann, started a green grocer’s shop in Dundalk in the early 1900s, becoming the first agent for Fyffes bananas in Ireland. His son, Neil McCann, subsequently built the fruit import business that acquired Fyffes in 1986.

Hailing the deal as “transformative”, David McCann said the “larger, more diverse business” offered more “opportunities for growth”. Balkan Investment Company, the vehicle for the McCann family’s 12.5pc stake, has given irrevocable undertakings to vote for the deal.

Another Fyffes investor, the Jerry Zucker Revocable Trust with 13.1pc of the shares, is also expected to back the merger.

Chiquita started importing fruit more than 140 years ago, when Captain Lorenzo Dow Barker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica, sailed to Jersey City in 11 days and sold them for a profit.

One potential banana skin remains in the shape of the competition authorities as only four companies – Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Fresh Del Monte Produce – control more than 80pc of the global banana trade.",

The new deal creates an entity with revenues annually of more than $4.6 billion, the two companies announced in a joint statement. Shareholders at Chiquita will own 50.7% of the new entity with investors at Fyffes holding the rest.

The deal, said one analyst based in Dublin, is logical and a good fit for both companies going forward.

The new transaction forms the biggest banana company in the world, which will also be the producer of packaged salads, pineapples and melons.

The new company, named ChiquitaFyffes Plc, will target a minimum of $40 million in cost savings annually by the start of 2017 through purchasing that is more efficient.

The deal gives the share price of Fyffe at $1.69, which is 37% higher than the company’s close of business stock price as of March 7. That is nearly double the value of the stock one year ago.

Shares of Fyffes were up 36% at noon in Dublin on Monday. That is the highest the stock has been priced in over seven years. The stock price gives the company a market capitalization of close to 354 million euros.

On March 7, Chiquita dropped by 0.2% to close at $10.84 valuing the company in Charlotte, North Carolina at $508 million.

Chiquita at this time has operations in 70 countries that include the U.S. with brands likes Fresh Express and Chiquita Bananas. Fyffes operates in Asia, Europe and South and Central America.

The companies are planning to complete this transaction during 2014 pending the approval of shareholders as well as the Irish High Court.

The combined entity will target a fresh food business that is growing and trends health and wellness.

Irish based fruit supplier Fyffes is merging with rival Chiquita to create the world’s largest banana company.

The two firms are joining forces to form a monster fruit firm that will dwarf their rivals in the banana distribution market.

The proposed new business will be called ChiquitaFyffes and generate revenues of e3.3. billion from the sale of more than 160 million banana boxes a year, as well as melons and pineapples.

Dublin-based Fyffes, which also sells products under the Sol brand, employs more than 12,000 people worldwide.

Chiquita is the larger of the two company with annual revenues of €2.6billion and 20,000 staff.

Shareholders in the firm based in North

Carolina will own 50.7% of the combined business following the merger, which values Fyffes at €380million.

The two companies confirmed the existing brands will be kept but customers will have access to a wider choice of products.

Fyffes executive chairman David McCann, who will become chief executive of the new business, said: “Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth.

“We believe we can use our complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.”

Fyffes began trading in the 1880s when the first commercial delivery of bananas from the Canary Islands arrived in London for EW Fyffe, Son & Co.

The world’s oldest fruit brand came into being in 1929 with the famous blue label and its bananas are sourced from countries including Costa Rica, Guatemala and Colombia.

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including Dublin Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

Chiquita boss Ed Lonergan said the deal was a “milestone transaction” which “brings together the best of both companies”.

He added: “The combined company will provide customers with a more diverse product mix and choice.

“We know Fyffes well and our shared heritage will ensure a smooth integration as we work to bring best practices across geographies and business units to achieve substantial operating efficiencies.”

http://247wallst.com/commodities-metals/2014/03/10/meet-the-new-1-billion-banana-empire/,business,"Ask yourself one question: How much should a banana empire be worth? It is a very legitimate question, and the answer is simply “less than you might think.” News broke on Monday that Chiquita Brands International Inc. (NYSE: CQB) is merging with Fyffes PLC.

The news might not sound like much on the surface, but this goes beyond bananas. It also goes beyond borders. Both of the boards of directors unanimously approved the definitive merger agreement.

As far as how this will work out, Chiquita will combine with Fyffes in a stock-for-stock transaction that gives Chiquita’s shareholders an ownership stake of 50.7% of the new company, which will be named ChiquitaFyffes.

Monday’s statement said, “The agreement creates a global banana and other fresh produce company with approximately $4.6 billion in annual revenues. Chiquita and Fyffes plan to complete the transaction before the end of 2014.”

Here are some of the details of a post-merger review:

The NewCo will have a combined equity value of approximately $1.07 billion, and it will be the number one banana company globally. The move also expands its branding in packaged salads, as well as in melons and pineapples. There is a tax angle here as well — The combined ChiquitaFyffes plc will continue to be Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but the NewCo will be domiciled in Ireland. It is also targeting $40 million in pre-tax cost synergies by the end of 2016.

Ed Lonergan, CEO of the current Chiquita Brands, will serve as chairman. David McCann, Fyffe’s executive chairman, will become CEO of the combined company. Monday’s release also confirmed that ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and will employ close to 32,000 people around the world.

The new company is projected to have an aggregate EBITDA in 2013 of approximately $214 million on a pro forma basis, with a pro forma combined synergy adjusted net debt to EBITDA of 2.7 times. It will also have more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America.

Chiquita Brands saw its shares rise 12% to $12.15, against a 52-week range of $6.04 to $13.68. Fyffes saw its shares up more than 40% in London trading and in Dublin trading. Any time you see both companies trading handily higher after merger news, it generally means that they are viewed as being “pro-investor.”

Chiquita’s $573 million seems low for being the top global banana brand in the world, particularly when you add in the Fresh Express salad brands along with its other products. Maybe this is just how the math works out, but an empire of this size would just seem to be worth more on the surface when you consider the might of the world’s food companies and how many billionaires and private equity giants are out there right now.",

Chiquita Brands International. Inc. , with headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., is already one of the world's top banana distributors. It announced Monday it is buying Irish-based Fyffes, another global kingpin in the fruit distribution business, in a $1.07 billion, all-stock deal. The deal creates the world's biggest banana business, with sales of about $4.6 billion.

By joining forces, the combined ChiquitaFyffes claims it will knock down operating costs by about $40 million a year.

But the move also knocks down Chiquita's taxes, since it's hitching itself to a company domiciled in Dublin.

Ireland isn't exactly a tax shelter, but it's close. Companies based there pay a 12.5% corporate tax rate compared with the (official) rate of up to 35% in the United States.

Several U.S. companies have already figured out the Ireland advantage. Drug maker Perrigo offshored itself to Ireland last year when it bought its Irish rival Elan Corp. (ELN). Industrial parts manufacturer Eaton Corp. is another one. It made the move in 2012 when it bought Ireland's Cooper Industries Plc. It's also why Apple Inc. maintains a network of unlimited Irish entities to avoid higher corporate taxes on billions of dollars of revenue it earns abroad. (Read more about it in this article in the Irish Times.)

In 2012, Chiquita's income taxes resulted in a net expense of $105 million, reversing a net tax benefit the year before of $82 million. Much of the reversal had to do with establishing valuation allowances against U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. It's complicated stuff. But the company was clearly not pleased with the outcome, and said so in its annual report. So moving its corporate accounts to Ireland might actually simplify the taxation process as well as lighten the burden.

With operations in over 70 countries, Chiquita is no stranger to doing business abroad. The only problem it might have with its new Dublin address is convincing international regulators that the deal with Fyffes doesn't put too many of the world's bananas in the hands of one company.

Strategic and Financial Benefits of Transaction

The combination of Chiquita and Fyffes is consistent with the strategic goals of both businesses, including increasing shareholder value by:

Combining complementary businesses that provide substantial operational efficiencies and cost savings: Chiquita and Fyffes anticipate that the transaction will potentially provide annualized recurring before tax overhead and operational synergies of at least $40 million by the end of 2016. These recurring annual synergies are anticipated to be comprised of efficiencies in the areas of logistics and procurement, among others.

Uniting two leading companies in the produce industry enhances scale, scope and portfolio diversity: Upon completion of the transaction, the combined company will become the leading global banana and other fresh produce company with greater scale and efficiency. As part of a larger, more diversified organization, on the basis of current volumes, ChiquitaFyffes will become the largest global entity in the banana category with sales of more than 160 million boxes annually. The company will maintain its significant presence in the packaged salads and healthy snacks category. The company will also have stronger positions in the melon and pineapple market segments as the number one importer in the United States and number three distributor globally, respectively.

Leveraging greater global scale to better serve customers and reach new markets: The combined company will be able to broaden its geographic footprint and distribution channels to access new market opportunities. It will be well-positioned to expand its global supply chain to improve product availability; build on each company's well-established presence in developed economies and further the progress both companies have made in expanding into high growth emerging markets worldwide.

Generating significant cash flow and a more efficient capital structure: With the full benefit of the anticipated synergies, the combined company would have had an aggregate EBITDA in 2013 of approximately $214 million on a pro forma basis, implying pro forma combined synergy adjusted Net Debt to EBITDA of 2.7 times.3 Moving forward, the combined company will also have the potential for further reductions in leverage.

Expanding sourcing ability in key production areas: With more than 24,000 hectares of owned or leased operations in Central America , the combined company is expected to be able to more efficiently manage its sourcing portfolio.

Commitment to shared purpose and sustainability: ChiquitaFyffes will continue its environmental and social responsibility commitments, including adding additional organic, Fairtrade, GlobalGAP and Rainforest Alliance certified capacity.

The deal once complete is expected to result in total annual revenues of $4.6 billion. Chiquita shareholders will own 50.7% shares of the combined entity with the remaining percentage going to Fyffes investors.

The merger is expected to create the world’s largest banana company which will be more than capable to produce packaged salads, melons and pineapples known as Chiquita Fyffes Plc. The new business is expected to target annual cost savings amounting to $40 million as of the end of 2016.

The agreed price currently values Fyffes shares at $1.69 which is 37% more than the company’s March 7 market closing price. Fyffes stock rose by 36% after the news of the impending acquisition with the company currently commanding a market value of 353.9 million euros. The merger will be of most benefit to Chiquita as it strives to be a key player in the banana market that is estimated to be worth $7 billion.

Key players in the banana market

The global banana market is mainly controlled by Chiquita, fresh Del Monte Hawaii-founded Dole Food Company and Fyffes. Chiquita and Fyffes currently sell between them 180 million boxes of bananas against second placed Del Monte 117 boxes and third placed Dole 110. The merger is sure to make Chiquita the biggest player in the industry.

There will be no regulatory hurdles for the passing of the merger considering both companies operate in completely different markets of North America and Europe.

Chiquita ratings in the market

Chiquita stock has been the subject of recent research ratings in which analysts at Zacks downgraded the company’s stock from a neutral to an “underperform”. The firm has placed a price target of $10.30 on the company’s stock.

Chiquita last updated its stock on February 27 in which the company reported earnings per share of $0.67 for the fourth quarter. Revenue for the quarter came in at $748 million above consensus estimates of $723.7 million. The fourth quarter revenue was an increase of 1.4% compared to the same quarter a year ago.

Irish fruit distributor Fyffes and US rival Chiquita have agreed to merge in an all-stock deal, which is expected to be completed before the end of the year.

According to the companies, the combined entity – named ChiquitaFyffes – would have revenue of around $4.6bn and will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

On completion, Chiquita’s shareholders will own around 50.7% of ChiquitaFyffes, with Fyffes’ shareholders owning around 49.3%. Additionally, the companies expect to achieve around $40m in pre-tax cost savings by the end of 2016.

The move seems sensible enough

With a market capitalisation of around €260m, Fyffes distributes bananas (its largest product category), pineapples and melons.

With revenue predominantly from Europe, Fyffes lags competitors in terms of scale – reporting revenue of around €1.1bn and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of €40m in fiscal 2013.

Being part of a much larger entity with broader reach and products makes sense for Fyffes.

As for Chiquita, which has a market capitalisation of some $500m, its product base consists of bananas (also its largest product category) as well as salads and healthy snacks (that includes Chiquita bites).

Although with a broad geographic reach, a large proportion of the company’s revenue – which came in at some $3bn in 2013, EBITDA of $117m – is derived from North America.

But Chiquita, whose turnaround efforts have just started to bear fruit, has been faced with declining revenue over recent years. That’s aside from a stretched balance sheet (as at December 2013, net debt was $576m), which has weighed on the company.

The merger should create a more financially flexible company, the companies reckon the combined entity’s pro-forma net debt to EBITDA would be 2.7x – Chiquita was 4.9x as at December 2013.

The combined entity looks set to be positioned well, competitively

The larger combo would be better positioned to face off against other global players in the sector, Fresh Del Monte for example, which boasts a relatively decent balance sheet and made EBITDA of $185m on revenue of around $3.7bn last year.

The move certainly bodes well for both companies, although expectations here are that rivals are unlikely to sit idly by.",

Chiquita and Irish fruit firm Fyffes agreed to merge Monday, forming the world's largest banana company.

The $1.07 billion all-stock deal would result in the creation of ChiquitaFyffes, a company expected to sell about 160 million boxes of bananas annually, ousting No. 1 banana supplier Dole Food Co. from the top spot. The new company would have 32,000 employees and $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales.

""Our outstanding employees will benefit from working for a larger, more diverse business which offers opportunities for growth,"" said Fyffes Executive Chairman David McCann in a statement. ""We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers.""

The merged company will be listed in New York but domiciled in Ireland, a move that will result in tax savings for the company. Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 percent of ChiquitaFyffes.

Both Chiquita and Fyffes have historic backgrounds in the banana market. Chiquita, founded in 1870, was one of the first companies to market branded bananas and helped the fruit gain popularity in the U.S. following World War II. Fyffes, which began shipping bananas in 1888, claims to be the world's oldest fruit brand as it started sticking blue labels on all its produce in 1929.

The modern banana market is at a point of flux, as new innovations and challenges transform the industry. Recent improvements in shipping technology has allowed bananas' life span to more than double, with exports of bananas increasing by 7.3 percent in 2012 to an all-time high of 16.5 million tons. At the same time, new fungi may threaten the global industry as we know it.

It said results in its banana division were ""broadly satisfactory"", although profits in that division were slightly down compared with 2012's strong performance.

Chiquita Brands International Inc., the 144-year-old fruit supplier that extolled the health benefits of bananas to postwar America, Monday agreed to merge with Irish tropical-fruit firm Fyffes PLC to create the world's largest banana company.

In a $1.07 billion all-stock deal, the new company--known as ChiquitaFyffes--would have 32,000 employees and $4.6 billion in annual revenue from sales of more than 160 million boxes of bananas. Shareholders of Charlotte, N.C.-based Chiquita would own 50.7% of the stock, which is to be listed in New York, the companies said in a joint statement.

The merger would make ChiquitaFyffes the world's No. 1 supplier of bananas, catapulting it past Dole Food Co. David McCann, currently Fyffes's executive chairman, will become chief executive of the new company, while Chiquita's chief executive, Ed Lonergan, will be chairman.

""This is a milestone transaction for Chiquita and Fyffes that brings together the best of both companies,"" Mr. Lonergan said.

The new company is positioned to exploit growing global demand for bananas, supported by improvements to shipping which allow the yellow fruit to stay fresh for longer. Exports of bananas increased by 7.3% in 2012 to an all-time high of 16.5 million tons, according to the United Nations.

But the proposed merger could raise competition issues ahead of its expected completion date later this year. More than 80% of the global banana trade is currently controlled by four companies--Chiquita, Fyffes, Dole and Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc.--according to the U.N.

Tracing its roots back to 1870, when Lorenzo Dow Baker bought 160 bunches of bananas in Jamaica and sailed them back to Jersey City, N.J., Chiquita has a varied history. The company's ships were used by the U.S. government during World War II, nearly causing the business to shut down.

But it was after the war that Chiquita made its mark. It was among the first companies to brand a banana, spotting an opportunity to sell to consumers with rising incomes who were eager to try ""exotic"" fruits like bananas and pineapples. In 1944, Chiquita introduced "" Miss Chiquita,"" a cartoon banana who sang about the myriad benefits of bananas, both as a tasty treat and healthy option. The character and jingle remained on screen for the next 50 years.

Chiquita's past isn't without controversy. In 2007, the company paid a $25 million fine to resolve U.S. Justice Department charges after it admitted to paying protection money to armies fighting a guerrilla war in Colombia, where one of Chiquita's most-profitable subsidiaries operated. The payments were illegal because the groups that Chiquita paid were on the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist groups.

Dublin-based Fyffes has its own storied history. Edward Wathen Fyffe took his first shipment of bananas from the Canary Islands in 1888 and sold them across London. In 1929, the company started sticking blue labels on all its produce, staking its own claim as the world's oldest fruit brand.

The companies said the merger would bring annual cost savings of at least $40 million by 2016. As well as trading in bananas, ChiquitaFyffes will have strong positions in melons, pineapples and packaged salads, the companies said.

""This deal will be transformative and offer exciting opportunities for the new business,"" Mr. McCann said.

Improvements in shipping are aiding the growth in demand for bananas. Bananas are mainly transported on container ships in special refrigerators. In the past they would stay fresh for up to 20 days, but recent innovations mean that life span has more than doubled.

New technology means ""the banana trade is fast expanding,"" said Erik Hogh-Sorensen, a spokesman for Maersk Container Industry, an arm of A.P. M?ller Maersk A/S, the world's biggest container shipper.

US-based Chiquita Brands and Ireland's Fyffes Plc said Monday that they are merging, a deal that would create the world's biggest banana supplier with annual revenue of $4.6 billion.

In the stock-for-stock transaction Chiquita shareholders will own approximately 50.7 percent of the new company, named ChiquitaFyffes Plc, and Fyffes shareholders owning the remainder, the companies announced in a joint statement.

The combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and based in Ireland. The Chiquita and Fyffes brands will also continue, the statement read.

The agreement ""creates a global banana and other fresh produce company with approximately $4.6 billion in annual revenues.""

Chiquita is one of the top global marketer and distributors of fresh food products, including bananas and packaged salads. Fyffes, though not quite as big, is also a major global player.

""This is a natural strategic partnership that combines two complementary companies of long history,"" said Chiquita chief executive Ed Lonergan.

As well as bananas, the new company will have a ""significant presence"" in the sale of packaged salads, melons and pineapples.

Chiquita, Dole Food and Fresh Del Monte Produce -- controlled about two-thirds of the global banana market, according to 2007 UN figures.

Fyffes and Ecuador's Exportadora Bananera Noboa rounded off the list of top five banana companies, according to the figures.

The merged ChiquitaFyffes will have an operating presence in more than 70 countries and a workforce of some 32,000 people.

""Chiquita and Fyffes anticipate that the transaction will potentially provide annualized recurring before tax overhead and operational synergies of at least $40 million by the end of 2016,"" said the statement, adding that the transaction is expected to be complete this year.

Lonergan will serve as chairman, while Fyffes executive chairman David McCann will become the combined company's chief executive officer.

McCann described the deal as ""transformative"".

""We believe we will be able to use our joint expertise, complementary assets and geographic coverage to develop a business that can run smoothly and efficiently to better partner with our customers and suppliers,"" he said.

Patrick Higgins, an analyst at Goodbody said the debt of the merged company would be at a more manageable level.

Chiquita posted a loss of $16 million for 2013, a sharp improvement after losing $405 million in 2012.

Fyffes however announced preliminary results for 2013 showing a profit of 26.1 million euros ($34.87 million), up 9.8 percent, while sales rose 6.3 percent to 1.08 billion euros.

According to figures from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), as of 80 percent of all bananas come from Latin America, with Ecuador Costa Rica and Colombia as the main exporters.",

It currently employs about 4,000 people in the UK and Ireland, including in Portsmouth, Livingston and Wakefield.

February’s shock fall in exports from the Asian behemoth has cast a shadow over the global outlook, even as analysts blamed much of the drop on the Lunar New Year holidays.

Oil and industrial commodities bore the brunt of the sell-off. Copper futures shed almost 2 percent on Monday, while spot prices for iron ore .IO62-CNI=SI tumbled over 8 percent.

Brent crude lost 92 cents to $108.08, while U.S. oil extended its decline to $100.94 a barrel.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor unease. In Crimea, unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post. Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis. <TOP/NEWS>

Yet, after an initial spill, Wall Street did manage to pare losses. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended off 0.21 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost just 0.05 percent.

That resilience might help steady nerves in Asia, and it was notable that Nikkei futures were only down slightly.

In early trade, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was holding steady, after shedding 1.3 percent on Monday.

Other popular indicators of risk were also muted. The stock market’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX, ended little changed after an early spike, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased a single basis point to 2.78 percent.

Forex markets were surprisingly calm with the U.S. dollar barely changed against a basket of major currencies .DXY.

Even currencies from major resource exporters incurred only modest losses. The Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for Chinese risk, came off half a U.S. cent but found solid support around $0.9025.

The euro held steady at $1.3876, as was the dollar at 103.26 yen.

Later on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan is expected to reaffirm its commitment to massive monetary stimulus. Nothing new is expected at the policy meeting, but markets suspect the BOJ could be pushed into action once a sales tax increase goes through in April.

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - Global stock indexes slipped and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 percent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.

Prices on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 percent. The Chinese data also provided some support to gold.

Chinese gloom added to strain in emerging markets, compounding worries the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

The data hit commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars , both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the exports plunge.

Tensions between Russia and Ukraine added to investor unease. In Crimea, unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.

Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis.

In the U.S. stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.04 points or 0.21 percent, to 16,418.68, the S&P 500 lost 0.87 points or 0.05 percent, to 1,877.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.775 points or 0.04 percent, to 4,334.448.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.5 percent to $31.38 as the China data sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.1 percent.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 percent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.4 percent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.2 percent.

German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3 percent, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in the world’s top commodity buyer.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.

On Wall Street, Boeing Co shares lost 1.3 percent to $126.89 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet.

Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.3 percent at $23.09. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice president, global communications and investor relations.

CHINESE DATA WEIGHS ON AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR

The Aussie last traded 0.6 percent weaker at $0.9017 , while the loonie bounced back at C$1.1101 after hitting a low of C$1.1073 in Asian trading.

The Australian dollar had been tracking higher towards the end of last week, boosted by signs of improvement in its own economy. But like fellow commodity producer Canada, it depends heavily on China extending a decade of robust expansion.

Authorities in Beijing continued a campaign to halt any further appreciation of the yuan by setting its daily guidance for the currency at the highest since mid-December.

The U.S. dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that U.S. job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was up 0.06 percent at 79.767.

In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25 and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.

Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels.

The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude fell 92 cents to settle at $108.08. U.S. oil dropped $1.246 to $101.12 a barrel.

Gold prices were little changed, though disappointing data helped underpin the market.

Spot gold inched down 5 cents to $1,339.80 an ounce.

Chinese gold prices were trading at a discount of $5-$6 an ounce to spot prices, traders said, in a sign of weak demand. Prices were at a premium of more than $20 at the beginning of the year.",

China's central bank weakened the daily reference rate for its currency by the largest percentage in more than a year and a half, continuing a push to drive the yuan lower.



As sluggish economic news sent jitters through the market, the People's Bank of China set the daily reference rate Monday at 6.1312 to the US dollar, compared with 6.1201 to the US dollar on Friday. The 0.18 per cent change represented the largest one-day move in the rate since July 2012.



The central bank determines the rate each day, and then allows the currency to trade as much as 1 per cent higher or lower. Since 2005, it has gradually moved the rate up, allowing the yuan to strengthen 33 per cent, but in the last month has pushed it lower, seeking to discourage speculators who have channeled money into the economy in hopes of benefiting from the currency's rise.



The US dollar-Chinese yuan pair was fixed ""much higher than what the market environment would have otherwise suggested,"" said Sacha Tihanyi, a senior currency strategist at Scotiabank in Hong Kong. This suggests, he said, that the yuan is heading back to weaker levels it hit against the greenback a few weeks ago.



Mr Tihanyi says the move to set the yuan weaker isn't a reaction by policy makers to news Saturday that China recorded a rare trade deficit in February, but is an element of a broader effort by the central bank to overhaul the financial system. Beijing is seeking to make it clear to investors that the yuan isn't a one-way bet, laying the groundwork for allowing the currency to trade more freely.



Premier Li Keqiang said last week at the National People's Congress, China's annual legislative session, that Beijing would expand the currency-trading band.



The trade figures, as well as disappointing news about inflation released over the weekend, weren't surprising and reflect seasonal factors, analysts and strategists said. Exports plummeted, leaving the world's second-largest economy with a $US22.9 billion ($A25.2bn) monthly trade deficit, its first since early last year. Imports, however, were up 10.1 per cent from a year earlier, pointing to undamaged Chinese demand.



""We aren't surprised by the trade deficit in February, as China used to record a deficit in February or March in recent years and we don't think there is a big chance China will post a deficit again in March,"" said Huang Yi, head of currencies and commodities of China Guangfa Bank.



Mr Huang said that while the deficit has changed some investors' and institutions' short-term expectations, the selloff in the yuan wasn't overwhelming. The ""two-way"" movement will persist in the short run, he said.



Analysts note that volatility in the currency has risen dramatically over the past few weeks from record lows, after the yuan spooked market participants with an unexpected 1.3 per cent tumble in late February and early March. The yuan usually barely budges; it gained 2.9 per cent in all of 2013.



On Monday, the yuan touched 6.1458 against the dollar, compared with 6.1260 late Friday in New York. The offshore yuan, which is freely traded outside China, fell as low as 6.1309 from 6.1095 on Friday.



Some say while the weekend's economic news was a factor behind the decision to change the reference rate, Chinese policy makers have taken the news as an opportunity to prompt caution in the market and shake out speculators who have driven money into China.



""We expect that the trade figures will be more real in the coming months as the [yuan] has become much more volatile and less predictable than before,"" economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. wrote in a note on March 8. The gap, or spread, between interest rates in the onshore and offshore markets is narrowing, potentially deterring people from pumping money into mainland China to take advantage of high yields in the onshore market, they said.",

While you were sleeping: China hits stocks, copper

March 11 (BusinessDesk) – Stocks and commodities including copper and iron ore fell after a surprise drop in China’s exports bolstered concern about the slowing growth in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports sank 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, according to General Administration of Customs data on the weekend. As a result, copper futures for May delivery shed 1.5 percent to US$3.0355 a pound in afternoon trading on the Comex in New York, extending Friday’s slide of about 4 percent.

In afternoon trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.35 percent, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.14 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.13 percent lower.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” IPR Capital director Steven Mayne told Reuters.

Slides in shares of Boeing, last down 2.3 percent, and those of Verizon, last down 0.9 percent, led declines in the Dow.

Boeing was dragged lower after saying it would inspect wings for cracks on undelivered 787s, and after a 777 flown by Malaysian Airline System disappeared over the ocean three days ago.

“News of the wing and inspections likely lower first quarter deliveries, plus the 777 aircraft incident in Asia will likely weigh on the Boeing stock this week,” Peter Arment, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach, told Bloomberg News.

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.5 percent drop from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX gave up 0.9 percent. France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent.

Concern about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine keeps weighing on markets worldwide.

Meanwhile, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser reiterated his concern that the US economy might be stronger than policy makers anticipate and suggested the Fed should accelerate the tapering of its monthly bond-buying programme.

On Friday, a report showed American employers added a higher-than-expected 175,000 jobs, while January’s jobs gain was revised up. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, from 6.6 percent.

“I expect that the unemployment rate will reach about 6.2 percent by the end of 2014, and, if anything, that may prove too pessimistic,” Plosser said in a speech in Paris. “Given the recent trends, an unemployment rate below 6 percent is certainly plausible.”

“Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts,” Plosser said.

* Copper hits eight-month low

* Mining stocks hit by Chinese trade data

By Caroline Valetkevitch

NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - World stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1 percent from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China’s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the U.S. Federal Reserve’s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.

“The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,” said Jeffrey Young, interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.

Prices on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78 percent.

The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 70.26 points or 0.43 percent, to 16,382.46, the S&P 500 lost 5.11 points or 0.27 percent, to 1,872.93 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.229 points or 0.26 percent, to 4,324.994.

Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.3 percent to $31.14 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6 percent.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5 percent, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.6 percent and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3 percent.

German steel maker ThyssenKrupp, down 3 percent, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world’s top commodity buyer.

“Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,” said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.

Despite weakness in Asian markets, a sense of relief in Europe that tensions between Russia and the West over Crimea had not escalated buoyed shares in early trading, though there was no escape from the undercurrent of unease.

On Wall Street, Boeing Co shares lost 2.5 percent to $125.31 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet.

Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday.

Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 2 percent at $22.92. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company’s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws, vice president, global communications and investor relations.

CHINESE DATA WEIGHS ON AUSTRALIAN, CANADIAN DOLLARS

The Aussie traded 0.4 percent lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2 percent at $1.1104.

“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tann, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.

The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.

The U.S. dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that U.S. job growth would pick up in the wake of last week’s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.743.

In the metals markets, London copper hit an eight-month low. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange traded down 1.36 percent to $6,690 a tonne. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest level since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows.

Adding to the pressure was China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels.

The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 97 cents down at $108.03. U.S. oil fell $1.33 to $101.25 a barrel.",

http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/10/disappointing-china-exports-halt-stocks-hammer-commodities/,business,"LONDON — World stocks edged off a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude oil tumbled on Monday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine.

Despite weakness in Asian markets, a sense of relief in Europe that tensions between Russia and the West over Crimea had not escalated buoyed shares in early trading, though there was no escape from the undercurrent of unease.

European shares faded through the morning and were back in the red as U.S. trading loomed, and the continued weakness in the DAX and big German firms that sell to Russia offset gains by Portuguese, Italian and Spanish stocks.

Merger activity in France helped the CAC 40, but mining firms sensitive to China’s ferocious appetite for raw materials weighed on London’s FTSE 100 as commodities and related currencies lost altitude.

“People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilized now so it’s tempting to buy the dip,” said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris.

China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18% year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s No. 2 economy.

It put an immediate dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday’s stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report.

China’s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper – of which China is the biggest consumer — hit an eight-month low, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars also suffered.

For emerging markets Chinese gloom added more strain, compounding worries over the U.S. turning off the taps on the cheap money that has been flowing to them.

Emerging stocks fell 1% and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan posted its biggest fall in more than a month as it lost 1.4%. Tokyo’s Nikkei shed 1% as Japanese GDP figures also disappointed.

UKRAINE

Wall Street was expected to dip about 0.2% when trading resumes. The S&P 500 hit its latest all-time high on Friday, underscoring how recent market jitters have driven investors back into more predictable economies.

Part of the attraction is that central banks such as the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England have promised to keep interest rates down for as long as they can.

There was a shot across the bows for that tactic over the weekend, however, from the central bank of central banks, the Bank of International Settlements, warning it raised “the risk of an unhealthy accumulation of financial imbalances”.

China’s export woes also cast a cloud over currency markets.

The yuan fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China’s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.

The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China’s fortunes, lost as much as half a percent, while the dollar and Russia’s rouble were both steady amid the lull in Ukraine.

The euro was steady at $1.3882 after hitting a 2-1/2 year high peak on Friday. Rate cut bets have been significantly scaled back since the ECB suggested last week that the eurozone recovery was on track.

Focus was turning to a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday in Brussels over plans to wind down troubled banks. It will comes alongside more details on the ECB’s stress tests of the banking sector.

COPPER SUFFERS

Gold edged lower for a second straight session after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal’s safe-haven appeal.

However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a crucial factor. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week to their highest in more than a year.

The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude oil down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains.

The biggest blow came in copper, however, as it hit an eight-month low of $6,608 a tonne and Shanghai contracts dropped by the 5% daily limit. As well as the weak export data, there were also fears about copper finance deals after China’s first domestic bond default last week.

“Clearly there’s an unwind of positioning in the credit markets in China, and as a result of that, copper which was being held as collateral against that credit is no longer required,” Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron, said.

China's February exports contracted sharply by 18% from a year before, much weaker than the 7.5% increase expected by Bloomberg. Financial markets did not read this kindly, sending the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index down 1.7%. The Shanghai Composite Stock Market Index slumped 2.9%.

China surprised the market last month too, posting a 10.6% year-on-year increase in January exports, whereas the market had expected a 0.1% rise.

Taken together, both pieces of data were distorted by the timing of the Lunar Chinese New Year, which occurred early in January this year. Therefore, analyst urge us to combine the two months of data and read them as one data point. Combined, January and February's exports declined by 2% y/y.

But China has another distortion. This time last year, the exports data were artificially inflated by hot money inflow in the disguise of ""exports"". This year, the hot money flow is a lot smaller, as evidenced by a 21% year-on-year drop in exports to Hong Kong, where such fake cross-border trades are often initiated.

Adjusting for all the data anomalies, UBS estimates the true growth rate was about 5% in dollar terms. Comparing to December's 7.5% adjusted growth reading, the new data, without down, is a signal that China's exports sector has slowed. UBS urges us to be patient and wait for the March data to come out, but the market is never patient. This morning, the iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI) is down 2%, so is the iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI).

The weak export data this year is not unique to China. The other Asian export powerhouses - South Korea and Taiwan - saw a similar slowdown. In Taiwan, for instance, by combining the January and February data together, export growth moderated to 0.4% from 1.8% in the fourth-quarter of 2013.

UBS analysts Tao Wang, Donna Kwok, Harrison Hu and Ning Zhang offered an explanation - bad weather:

The softening of China's export growth since late 2013 is consistent with recent developments in both Korea and Taiwan's export sector. Both economies saw a modest export moderation in January-February. Possible reasons for this include weaker US activity weighed down by unusually bad weather conditions (e.g., ISM manufacturing index dipped from 56.5 last December to an average of 52.3 in January-February) and slightly cooler growth momentum in Europe (e.g., Germany's IFO expectations index edged down in February).

The Chinese Yuan sold off aggressively, experiencing one of the largest one-day declines since December. Chinese stocks were hit hard with the Shanghai Composite dropping more than 2.8%. Although a significantly weaker trade balance triggered the selling, China's central bank has been actively allowing the Chinese Yuan to weaken. After selling off throughout 2011, 2012 and 2013, CNY is down over 10% from its 2014 high as shown in the chart below. With no U.S. data scheduled for release at the front of this week, Chinese data and FX policy is driving currencies and equities around the world. Over the past two months, the market has been focused on the unexpected weather induced weakness in the U.S. data but slowing Chinese growth is one of main themes of 2014 and one with global ramifications.



The Yuan

Countries heavily reliant on Chinese growth such as Australia and Japan will be hit the hardest but the U.S. is also not immune to problems in Asia. A large part of the reason why U.S. stocks opened lower for trading this morning is because of the weakness in Asian equities. Many U.S. companies are also reliant on demand from China and their earnings could be negatively affected by slowing Chinese growth. The decline in the value of the Yuan also reduces the purchasing power of the Chinese. Both and have been affected by the weakness in Chinese assets. The following chart of the Shanghai Composite Index (white line) and the Nikkei (green line) shows that oftentimes, the movements in Chinese equities lead the movements in Japanese stocks. Since has a strong correlation with the Nikkei, this suggests that Japanese assets are also poised for further losses if Chinese equities continue to move lower.



Shanghai Composite vs. The Nikkei





The Yuan could not be moving this aggressively without the ok from the central bank. The rapid turnaround in the currency pair suggests that the People's Bank of China is shifting away from a policy of Yuan appreciation. Their motivation is simple - to use the exchange rate as a means to provide support for the export sector and in turn the overall economy. This morning's Chinese trade numbers show the severity of the problems in exports. The Chinese trade balance plunged into a deficit in the month of February due to a surprise 18% yoy decline in exports (economists had been looking for a 7.5% rise). China has accepted that growth will slow this year but they want it to happen gradually. Since it is a busy week for Chinese data and a quiet week for U.S. data, we expect G10 currencies along with global equities to take their cue from the East.

China's CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent on Monday to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper, of which China is a major consumer, hit a four-year low in Shanghai, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars also suffered.



MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) posted its biggest fall in over a month as it lost 1.4 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average shed 1 percent, as disappointing Japanese GDP data compounded the woes.



UKRAINE



Russian forces tightened their grip on Crimea over the weekend, seizing another border post and a military airfield, ahead of a planned Moscow-backed referendum on Sunday on whether the Black Sea peninsula should join Russia.



But diplomatic efforts to cool the crisis continued to calm markets as all sides expressed unease but a general desire to prevent the tensions escalating.



The Chinese trade data weighed on currency markets.



The Chinese yuan opened down 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates fell amid speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth.



The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China's appetite for their raw materials, lost as much as half a percent against a broadly steady U.S. dollar



""The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,"" said Alvin Tan, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.



The euro, in contrast, stayed within striking distance of Friday's 2-1/2 year high peak at $1.3875, touched after the European Central Bank suggested last week that the euro zone recovery was on track with no need for an extra policy push for now. That has pushed rate cut bets back.



COPPER SUFFERS



Gold edged lower for a second straight session on Monday after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal.







However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a key theme for the precious metal. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to its highest in more than a year.



The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya capped the falls.



""The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility,"" said Victor Shum, vice president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight.



The drop in China's exports pushed three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange down 1.7 percent to $6,663.75 a metric ton (7345.5 tons). It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a ton, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.

The Stoxx Europe 600 was trading 0.22% lower against a backdrop of downbeat Chinese export numbers and general global uncertainty.

Merger activity in France spurred the CAC 40 but mining firms sensitive to China's demand for raw materials weighed on the UK's FTSE 100. Elsewhere, German firms' exposure to Russia saw the Dax underperform again.

Data from China showed that exports surprisingly dropped 18% year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit, triggering fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy. Market players in Asia exercised caution.

Copper and Crude

Chinese data pulled three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange down 1.7% to $6,663.75 a metric ton (7345.5 tons). It earlier slid to $6,608 a ton, its weakest since June 2013, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010, reported Reuters.

Chinese data also forced Brent and US crude down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two consecutive days of gains. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya contained the falls.

Meanwhile, spot gold shed 0.4% to $1,334.50 an ounce at 10:35GMT, while US gold futures for delivery in April dropped $3.20 an ounce to $1,335.00.

""The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,"" Alvin Tan, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London told Reuters.

Standard Chartered said in a note to clients: ""We believe China's official import data is partly inflated by commodity-financing activity. There is a sharp difference between strong imports of copper and China's moderating PMI over the past three months.

""This divergence is explained by trading companies importing copper (and some other commodities such as iron ore and coal) using letters of credit (LCs) issued by onshore banks.""

""The commodities may then be sold in the domestic market (with the proceeds lent in the informal credit markets) or used as collateral to borrow more bank funding,"" Standard Chartered added.

Barclays Capital said in a note to clients: ""We expect the China's trade balance to turn positive in the coming months although the monthly surplus will come down from the average of $30bn in Q4 2013 (Jan-Feb: 4.4bn, Q1 2013: 14bn), as 'hot money' inflows disguised in the trade flows being are squeezed out.

""Overall, we expect continued trade and current account surplus and net inflows under the capital account with the latter being controlled by the PBoC with its capital account opening measures. We believe this should support a modest appreciation of the CNY against the USD although at a slower pace than the 2.8% in 2013.""

Standard Chartered said in a separate note: ""We maintain our China's GDP growth forecast for 2014 unchanged at 7.4%. Q1 GDP is likely to come in at 7.6%. Premier Li has made it clear that some economic growth is necessary for carrying out reforms and that Beijing will support growth when needed, but mentioned that the trade data was not so bad as to trigger a shift in policy.""

""The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility,"" Victor Shum, vice president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight told the news agency.

Asian markets slumped today, after China reported over the weekend weaker-than-expected February exports data. February exports slumped 18% from a year ago, surprising the market which had expected a 5% increase.

In addition, Beijingweakened its daily reference rate against the dollar by the largest since 2012, in another attempt to break the one-way bet of yuan and halt the hot flow of offshore money into China. The offshore yuan dropped to 6.13 per dollar from 6.10 on Friday.

Asia equities slumped today on renewed concerns over a China slowdown. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index was down 1.7%, the Shanghai Composite Stock Market Index slumped 2.9%. Taiwan and South Korea followed China lower as well. The Taiwan TAIEX Index lost 0.6%. The KOSPI Composite Index retreated 1%.",

“Given how share prices have corrected and given where the valuations are, from a risk-reward standpoint we still think we can make a positive case on Chinese equities,” Kinger Lau, a strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview in Hong Kong on March 4. He predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index will climb to 12,000 in the next 12 months, a 24 percent advance from last week’s close, versus the brokerage’s December forecast for the measure to reach 13,600 by the end of 2014.

The index of Chinese shares in Hong Kong lost 10 percent this year through last week, the most among 93 global benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as factory gauges pointed to a slowdown in the economy and concern grew that more companies will struggle to repay debt after the nation’s first onshore corporate bond default on March 7. The gauge trades at a 45 percent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index, the most in a decade.

China’s leaders are trying to balance clampdowns on the shadow-banking industry and local-government debt with measures to support growth in the world’s second-largest economy. Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. became the first company to default in China after failing to pay full interest due last week on onshore bonds.

Relative Value

The Hang Seng China index is valued at 1.1 times net assets, the biggest discount since September 2003 to MSCI’s global index, which has a multiple of 2. The H-share measure slid 1.7 percent to 9,540.10 as of 1:41 p.m. in Hong Kong.

BlackRock Inc. named Helen Zhu as head of China equities, luring the New York bank’s chief China equity strategist away from Goldman Sachs. The appointment takes effect on April 7 and Zhu may start managing funds later this year, BlackRock said in a statement. The New York-based firm is the world’s largest money manager, overseeing about $4.3 trillion.

Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. all trade at about the same level as their net assets, while Bank of China Ltd. has a price-to-book ratio of 0.8. The four lenders are the nation’s biggest by market value.

“Any clear and concrete policy measures in terms of dealing with shadow banking loans and local government debt would likely be positive catalysts for banks,” Lau said. “Valuations for Chinese banks have already priced in a very significant crisis scenario.”

Regulated Borrowing

Premier Li Keqiang told the National People’s Congress last week that China will develop a regulated regional borrowing mechanism, after local-government liabilities surged to 17.9 trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion yuan at the end of 2010. Authorities have also started a cleanup of the $6 trillion shadow-banking industry and identified sectors of the economy in need of consolidation.

While Chinese banks’ non-performing loans rose by 28.5 billion yuan in the last quarter of 2013 to 592.1 billion yuan, the highest since September 2008, bad loans only accounted for 1 percent of total lending, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said Feb. 13.

Bank valuations currently imply a non-performing loan ratio of about 7 percent, Lau said.

Global Outlook

An improving global economic outlook may also be a catalyst for a rally in Chinese shares, Lau said, declining to name specific stocks.

The World Bank raised its 2014 growth forecasts for advanced nations in January to 2.2 percent from 2 percent, while cutting its estimates for developing nations to 5.3 percent from 5.6 percent. China is the world’s biggest exporter.

China last week retained a target for 7.5 percent growth in 2014 for the $9 trillion economy. Gross domestic product expanded 7.7 percent in 2013, the same pace as in 2012.

A purchasing managers’ index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics dropped to a seven-month low of 48.5, the companies said March 3. A similar gauge from the government with a larger sample size fell to 50.2, the lowest since June, a report showed March 1. Numbers above 50 signal expansion.

Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, customs data showed March 8, compared with analysts’ median estimate for a 7.5 percent increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July, according to a statistics bureau report, extending the longest decline since 1999.

Share Slump

The Hang Seng China gauge has tumbled 16 percent since Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, predicted on Dec. 2 that the H-share measure would rally 18 percent by the end of 2014.

Goldman Sachs’s forecast formed part of a trade recommendation in which the bank told investors to buy Chinese stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities would lag the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade its fourth top recommendation for 2014.",
http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/10/bond-default-crisis-in-china-unlikely-this-year/,business,"Investors might be nervous about worrying data out of China this morning, but research from Bank of America Merrill Lynch argues a Chinese financial crisis is unlikely.

China’s exports unexpectedly fell 18% in February, which led to a plunge in commodity prices Monday and worries that the country’s economy is struggling more than expected. But Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the risk of a financial crisis in China remains slim.

“A big concern in the markets in recent months is that defaults in the Chinese bond market could be an early signal of a much bigger financial crisis,” he said. “However, in our view, China’s experience is different than past financial crises in several key respects.”

Mr. Harris points out bond defaults have been “widely anticipated” from struggling companies such as solar-cell maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co. and that bonds remain a “modest part of China’s capital markets.”

China experienced its first onshore bond market default last week when Shanghai Chaori missed an interest payment on its bonds.

“A major crisis would require a string of bad outcomes: first the defaults would have to have big contagion effects and second, government efforts to stem the crisis would have to be ineffective,” Mr. Harris said.

The latter part is especially important, because the Chinese government has formidable ammunition to fend off a financial crisis, including the largest foreign reserves in the world.

“The Chinese government has both the resources and the will to forcefully intervene if contagion kicks in,” he said. “They have a relatively modest budget deficit and huge foreign exchange reserves. Inflation is contained so that will not constrain policy. And we would expect the Chinese authorities to act forcefully, and set aside moral hazard concerns, if a systemic crisis emerges.”",

Chinese investors marked an important milestone last week when they rejected a bond offer by Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels Development Co, one of the nation's leading hotel operators, reflecting their growing understanding of risk in China's young financial markets. Chinese investors often blindly pile into nearly any product offered by the latest hot company, bank, fund manager or Internet firm, falsely believing they are guaranteed big returns on their money.



But as several recent cases show, big returns are never guaranteed and sometimes investors can even lose all their money on the riskiest products. More sophisticated Western investors are already well-aware of these risks, and seldom complain when high-yield products sometimes fail to deliver promised returns. Central authorities in China need to accelerate efforts to educate Chinese investors about these risks, both through better disclosures and also by letting financial products occasionally fail to teach buyers that no investment is risk-free.



Jin Jiang first announced its plan to raise up to 1.6 billion yuan ($260 million) through a corporate bond issue in June, to help fund its expansion at home and also as it seeks to become China's first major hotel brand to go abroad. In January, the company made a tentative first step outside its home market when it formed a partnership with a local company to enter Indonesia.



Jin Jiang received necessary approvals to raise the funds, a relatively large sum for a company of its size and also a relatively risky bet due to its dependence on the volatile hotel market to repay the money. But after conducting a roadshow to test market sentiment, Jin Jiang announced late last week it decided to scrap the offer due to ""economic conditions"" - a veiled way of saying that investors weren't interested in the bonds.



In the past, domestic investors almost certainly would have given a company like Jin Jiang as much money as it wanted regardless of the return rate. That willingness was based on the underlying assumption that such bonds were risk-free, because either a State-run parent or local government entity would assist with repayment if the company ever ran into financial difficulties. But rejection of the Jin Jiang bond shows investors increasingly realizing they must be responsible for their own decisions, and that they can't depend on State bailouts when problems emerge.



Another group of wealthy private investors ran into similar problems last year when a product sold through Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China's largest commercial bank, defaulted on its promise of high returns. In that case, the product was backed by a Shanxi coal mining company that ultimately failed, resulting in the default. But investors complained that they should have been protected from any risk since ICBC marketed the product.



An unnamed third party, almost certainly acting under government orders, ultimately stepped in to repay the debt and end the controversy. But even then the investors - who should have lost everything - weren't satisfied, saying they deserved not only to get their money back but also to receive the promised high rate of return. When such defaults happen in the West, buyers often consider themselves lucky to recoup as little as 10 to 20 percent of their original investment.



Just last week, Chinese investors got another lesson in risk when solar panel maker Chaori Solar failed to make an interest payment for a domestic bond, becoming the first-ever such default since Chinese authorities first implemented market reforms 25 years ago. The company is just one of many solar firms facing such difficulty, following a two-year downturn for the sector due to construction of massive overcapacity in China. It's still unclear what will happen in that instance, though so far no government entity has come forward to say it will help cover Chaori's 90 million yuan shortfall.



Central authorities should resist any urge to come to Chaori's rescue, and also the pressure it is feeling to placate investors in the ICBC case. It should also encourage widespread publicizing of the two cases to show investors they need to take responsibility for all their decisions, including putting money into the many new Internet investment products now springing up such as Yu'ebao.



Regulators should also launch a broader campaign to require better disclosure by issuers of these investment products, which often boast high rates of return and hide the risk potential in the fine print. Such a two-pronged approach will benefit not only investors but also the entire Chinese financial sector by building trust and accountability throughout the system.

* Bonded Shanghai copper premiums drop $20/T from late Feb (Updates with closing prices)

By Maytaal Angel

LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - London copper hit an eight-month low on Monday and Shanghai contracts dropped by their 5 percent daily limit, fanned by fears over the unwinding of copper finance deals in China after its first domestic bond default last week.

Adding to the downward pressure, China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.

A further hit came from China’s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30 percent in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27 percent from last year’s levels, however.

“Clearly there’s an unwind of positioning in the credit markets in China, and as a result of that, copper which was being held as collateral against that credit is no longer required,” said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex Spectron.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from i$6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25 and within a whisker off nearly three-year lows.

The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent to 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne, its lowest in more than four years.

ALL EYES ON COPPER FINANCING

China is the world’s top user of copper, accounting for 40 percent of global demand. But much of its imports are used as collateral to raise funds, which are then loaned out in China’s shadow banking sector.

Worries that these financing deals could unravel have intensified since China recorded its first domestic bond default on Friday, when loss-making solar equipment producer Chaori Solar missed an interest payment.

“The loan default by a small Chinese company shows that the not everything gets bailed out, and that’s enough to make people nervous. I haven’t seen for 10 years that LME goes down and Shanghai goes down even further,” Herwig Schmidt, head of sales at Triland, said.

Reflecting ample supply in China, copper premiums in Shanghai bond have fallen by $20 to $140-$160 from late January, according to China price provider Shmet. (www.shmet.com/)

Also Chinese short-term rates and the yuan fell on Monday following the surprisingly weak data on exports, fuelling expectations Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth.

Elsewhere, U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in February despite the icy weather that gripped much of the nation, easing fears of an abrupt economic slowdown and keeping the Federal Reserve on track to continue reducing its monetary stimulus.

Hedge funds and money managers turned copper markets into a net short in the week to March 4, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday.

Also curtailing risk appetite were worries about escalating tensions in Ukraine.

Germany’s Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

Aluminium closed at $1,775.50 a tonne from $1,764 at the close on Friday, while zinc ended at $2,040 from $2,059 and lead at $2,084 from $2,096.50.

http://www.ifre.com/china-defaulter-chaori-has-four-or-five-trust-loans-outstanding/21135578.article,business,"Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology has at least four outstanding trust loans due this year, the source said. The loss-making solar manufacturer failed to pay a coupon on a Rmb1bn (US$163m) bond last Friday, raising questions over its ability to meet its other obligations.

Chaori issued six trust loans in 2011, the source said. The first one, the Rmb80m China Industrial International Trust, was issued on April 21 2011 and matured on October 20 2012. This trust was backed by 5 million Chaori shares held by the company’s chairman Ni Kailu.

The other five financings were arranged by Zhongrong International Trust, with an annual interest rate at about 8.6% and a tenor of three years. The third trust loan comes due on July 31 this year, the fourth on September 5, the fifth on October 19 and the sixth on October 12, the source said, adding the information about the due date on the second trust loan was missing.

There was a cap of Rmb50m on each of the Zhongrong-arranged trust loans, which means the total of outstanding trust loans could amount to as much as Rmb250m. Those loans are most likely backed by shares, sources said.

A failure to honour any of those obligations could trigger a rare default in China’s booming trust market, broadening the impact of Chaori’s situation. A number of trust companies have struggled to repay investors – often including high-net-worth individuals – in recent months, including Jilin Trust, which failed to redeem at maturity in early February.

Chaori also owes 18 banks including China Construction Bank, Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China about Rmb1.7bn. These banks have been pressuring the Fengxian government – where Chaori is based – to help with a debt restructuring, according to a research report published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on March 5.

China Securities, the arranger of the Rmb1bn five-year bond issued by Chaori in 2012, will send out a notice later today or tomorrow calling bondholders to a meeting where they will discuss proposals to resolve the default, according to a source from China Securities.

The Shenzhen-listed Chinese solar equipment producer was unable to make an interest payment on March 7 on the 8.98% bond due 2017, marking the first default on a public bond in China.

The Financial Times reported last week that Shanghai-based solar panel manufacturer Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology was on the verge of failing to make RMB89.8m (£8.8m) worth of interest payments on a bond issued two years ago.

The payment was due on March 7 but in a stockmarket notice on March 4 the company said it had raised only 5 per cent of the amount necessary.

Concerns have grown in recent months about the stability of China’s $12trn (£7.2trn) corporate bond market in recent weeks as rumours of potential defaults have spread. In January the Chinese government bailed out a high-yield loan product sold to private investors.

Lu Yu, manager on Allianz Global Investors’ emerging markets equity team, warned that the Chaori Solar bond default could be the catalyst for a short-term equity market crash in China.

“China’s credit bubble is worrisome,” Ms Yu said. “A default would be a wake up call for Chinese banks, but I don’t think Chinese credit is going to have a big crisis like we saw in Europe and the US.

“The Chinese government knows what is going on and the signals are strong that they are taking this very seriously.”

But David Cui, China strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, last week likened the potential default by Chaori Solar to the bailout of Bear Stearns in the US in 2007, a move which Mr Cui said forced investors to rethink their attitude towards corporate debt.

Jupiter’s John Chatfeild-Roberts, head of the group’s Merlin multi-manager team, said China was likely to see further bailouts from the state as the government comes to terms with the private sector’s debt issues.

“The first signs that many of these loans are at risk of default are now appearing and there are a huge number that will need re-financing this year alone,” Mr Chatfeild-Roberts said.

“The most likely outcome is that the central authorities in Beijing will find a way of sweeping these bad loans under the carpet, in order to avoid China suffering from a crisis of confidence.

“The $500m bailout of the Credit Equals Gold No1 Trust is a good example of what we could expect to see more of in the future.”

Yang Kun, a Shanghai-based bond analyst at Guotai Junan Securities, told the Bloomberg news agency: “It shows regulators’ attitude toward defaults has changed and they’re silently permitting defaults. Risk appetite will slump substantially.”

But James Ind, manager of the GLG Total Return fund, said he felt that China had “strong control over its financial system”.

He added: “We don’t see a disorderly bank collapse or local government default as being yet on the cards. Their reform agenda is bold, with far-reaching plans to liberalise the economy.”",

File photo: Bertrand Guay London - World stocks paused near a six-year peak and commodities from copper to crude tumbled on Monday as surprisingly weak Chinese trade data rattled investors already on edge over the crisis in Ukraine. Relief that Crimea remained largely calm over the weekend helped European shares recover 0.2 percent after Friday's sharp sell-off, though the poor Chinese export numbers and general global uncertainty provided a subdued backdrop. Merger activity in France spurred the CAC 40 but mining firms sensitive to China's appetite for raw materials weighed on Britain's FTSE 100 and German firms' exposure to Russia saw the Dax underperform again. “People sold on Friday on fear of an escalation in Crimea, but things seem to have stabilised now so it's tempting to buy the dip,” said David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris. Investors in Asia started the new week on a cautious note as China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18 percent year-on-year in February, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

The soft data put a damper on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday's stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls report that had provided a welcome respite from a run of disappointing data.

China's CSI300 share index plunged 3.3 percent on Monday to its lowest in nearly nine months, copper, of which China is a major consumer, hit a four-year low in Shanghai, while the commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars also suffered.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan posted its biggest fall in over a month as it lost 1.4 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average shed 1 percent, as disappointing Japanese GDP data compounded the woes.

UKRAINE

Russian forces tightened their grip on Crimea over the weekend, seizing another border post and a military airfield, ahead of a planned Moscow-backed referendum on Sunday on whether the Black Sea peninsula should join Russia.

But diplomatic efforts to cool the crisis continued to calm markets as all sides expressed unease but a general desire to prevent the tensions escalating.

The Chinese trade data weighed on currency markets.

The Chinese yuan opened down 0.5 percent and Chinese short-term rates fell amid speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly economic growth.

The Australian and Canadian dollars, which are highly sensitive to China's appetite for their raw materials, lost as much as half a percent against a broadly steady U.S. dollar .

“The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning - you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,” said Alvin Tan, strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.

The euro, in contrast, stayed within striking distance of Friday's 2-1/2 year high peak at $1.3875, touched after the European Central Bank suggested last week that the euro zone recovery was on track with no need for an extra policy push for now. That has pushed rate cut bets back.

COPPER SUFFERS

Gold edged lower for a second straight session on Monday after the strong U.S. jobs data on Friday eased fears of an economic slowdown and dimmed the metal's safe-haven appeal.

However, the crisis in Ukraine was likely to remain a key theme for the precious metal. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading showed that hedge funds and money managers raised their bullish bets in gold futures and options for a fourth consecutive week as geopolitical tensions boosted speculative interest to its highest in more than a year.

The Chinese data helped send Brent and U.S. crude down 84 cents and $1.25 to $108.15 and $101.31 a barrel respectively, ending two straight days of gains. Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya capped the falls.

“The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility,” said Victor Shum, vice president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight.

The drop in China's exports pushed three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange down 1.7 percent to $6,663.75 a tonne. It earlier slid as far as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since June 25, when it stopped at $6,602, the lowest since July 2010.

LONDON--The price of copper, which has fallen 10% in 2014, sank again Monday to its lowest price in over eight months amid concerns about demand from top consumer China.

The red metal shed nearly 4% Friday after the first default in China's corporate-bond market. This was compounded by weekend data that showed China's exports in February fell 18.1% from a year earlier, far below expectations for a 5.0% increase.

Some analysts reasoned that distortions due to the Lunar New Year holidays could have affected export volume. Nonetheless, the figures had important implications for economic growth in the nation, which accounts for 40% of the global demand for copper.

""Concerns over China and the high levels of stocks in the country seem to be behind the weakness,"" said William Adams, head of research at FastMarkets.

""The rout...has flowed into the other base metals including the likes of nickel and aluminium, which were being boosted by concerns over the potential for disruption to Russian supply should sanctions be imposed,"" he said.

Three-month copper was 1.7% down from Friday's closing price, at $6,669.25 per metric tonne, having earlier hit its lowest price since June 2013 at $6,608 per tonne.

Three-month zinc fell 2% to $2,016.75 per tonne, while aluminum fell 1.4% to $15,078 per tonne. Lead prices gave up 1.6%, trading at $2,063.50, while tin was the only metal to rise, climbing 0.2% to $22,915 per tonne.

Market watchers debated whether copper's losses had further to go. FastMarkets and Newedge both said the rout had left the red metal looking oversold.

""From a technical perspective, the copper price looks in poor shape following its price slide - were it to dip below last June's low [$6,602/tonne], follow-up selling could be the result,"" said Commerzbank in a note to clients. ""In fundamental terms, on the other hand, the global copper market is fairly tight, meaning there is no long-term justification for low prices.""

Copper cathode inventories at China's Shanghai Futures Stock Exchange warehouses rose for the eight straight week to 207,320 mt as of March 7, up 4.6% week on week, according to SHFE data released late Friday.

SHFE copper cathode stocks have been rising steadily since January 10, surging 70% from 122,189 mt at the time.

The SHFE warehouses are located in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Guangdong. They have a combined capacity to store 1.13 million mt of copper cathode, according to information on the SHFE website.

Chinese industry analysts attributed the growing stockpiles to weak domestic consumption, pointing out that product from warehouses in the US and Europe were being shipped to China.



""Copper inventories at overseas warehouses have been falling as they have been sent to China,"" Yang Jinjian, a commodity analyst with Northern Futures, said Monday.

""Current copper consumption in China isn't good. We expect that by end March or early April, market players in the domestic downstream copper processing will start buying. But their purchase volume would be limited as they set their buying plans based on their products output, which is not so good,"" he said.

March-June is the peak buying season for copper cathode in China, during which the downstream copper processing sector typically replenishes stock.

Jack Yeung, a business professor at Hong Kong's City University, said: ""Copper inventories at both Comex and London Metal Exchange warehouses have been falling in the past weeks, so contributing to the growing SHFE stocks.""

Chinese industry observers also pointed to a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, and tighter monetary policy which has spurred some state-owned enterprises to turn to collateralized borrowing, using copper as collateral.

""Some of the loans are granted by non-bank financial companies, owing to the government's tightening on banks' lending. If this kind of shadow banking collapses in future, we don't rule out that copper inventories in China could keep growing,"" he said.

In a commodity report issued Friday, Chinese metals consultancy Beijing Antaike said that copper trading companies were apathetic in trading, with consumption by the downstream copper processing sector remaining lackluster for the whole week.

HONG KONG--Hong Kong stocks closed sharply lower on Monday, with disappointing Chinese trade data dashing hopes for a rebound in the city's beleaguered stock market.

The blue chip Hang Seng Index declined 395.56 points, or 1.8%, to 22,264.93, bringing its losses so far this year to 4.5%.

A total of HK$68.04 billion (US$8.78 billion) traded on the Hong Kong main board versus HK$69.5 billion on Friday.

China's exports sank 18.1% from a year earlier in February, according to official data reported over the weekend, a stark contrast to the 5% rise predicted by economists.

Analysts widely noted the impact of the Lunar New Year holiday on activity for the month. The poor report came alongside a series of worrisome events, however, including Saturday's jetliner disappearance over the South China Sea.

Malaysian authorities said Monday that no debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines jet had been recovered, despite a massive air and sea search.

Airline shares fell on fears of a possible terrorist role in the disappearance. The flight was operating as a code-share with China Southern, which saw its shares fall 3.9% to HK$2.50.

HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Monday, tracking mainland losses as the mainland's weaker-than- expected export data in February fueled worries over its economic growth.

The benchmark Hang Seng index fell 395.56 points, or 1.75 percent, to close at 22,264.93, after trading between 22,388 and 22,206. Turnover totaled 62.01 billion HK dollars (7.99 billion U. S. dollars).

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 172.64 points, or 1. 78 percent, to close at 9,536.85.

All the four sub-indices lost ground. The Commerce & Industry sub-index lost 2.3 percent; the Properties moved down 1.69 percent; the Finance lowered 1.34 percent; the Utilities dipped 0.76 percent.

Banking giant HSBC, which accounts for the largest weighting of the Hang Seng Index, edged down 1.05 percent to 80.45 HK dollars. Its local unit Hang Seng Bank closed down 0.66 percent at 121.40 HK dollars. Bank of East Asia, another Hong Kong's major bank, fell 0.33 percent to 30.6 HK dollars. Local bourse operator HKEX edged down 0.42 percent to 119 HK dollars.

Local developers fell across the board. Hang Lung Properties ended 2.12 percent lower at 20.8 HK dollars. Henderson Land, another major developer in Hong Kong, shed 3.21 percent to 42.2 HK dollars. Cheung Kong Holding, a powerful HK-based developer controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing, lost 1.19 percent to 124.8 HK dollars.

http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/markets-commodities-idUSL3N0M72BN20140310,business,"SINGAPORE, March 10 (Reuters) - Copper sank to 8-1/2 month lows on Monday, dropping steeply for a second session, while oil lost more than a dollar and Shanghai-traded commodities slumped after a surprise fall in China's exports heightened fears of an economic slowdown.

China's exports fell 18.1 percent in February from a year ago, confounding market expectations for an increase and adding to a series of weak factory surveys from the start of 2014 that point to weakness in economic activity at the world's top consumer of most commodities.

Chinese commodities bore the brunt of the sell-off, with Shanghai copper sliding 5 percent, rubber down more than 4 percent and Dalian iron ore futures slumping nearly 6 percent. China’s equities sank to a five-year low.

“The China data shows there will be more difficult times ahead,” an iron ore trader in Shanghai said.

Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange hit a session low of $6,608 a tonne, its cheapest since June 25.

The metal was down 1.4 percent at $6,690 by 0842 GMT, adding to a 3.8 percent loss on Friday which was its steepest decline since April 2012.

Copper in Shanghai fell by its daily downside limit of 5 percent to close at 46,670 yuan ($7,600) a tonne.

Despite a drop in overall exports, China’s imports of most commodities from copper to crude oil and iron ore rose in February from a year ago. The weak exports suggest China’s commodity import demand could weaken in the coming months as end-users draw down swollen inventories.

But China’s imports of oil, copper and iron ore all fell from levels in January.

“Fundamental demand has not resumed to normal levels yet,” said analyst Chunlan Li of minerals consultancy CRU in Beijing.

Brent crude declined $1.13 to $107.87 a barrel, snapping a two-day rise fuelled by tensions between Russia and Ukraine that could potentially disrupt oil supplies.

U.S. oil fell $1.25 to $101.33, after touching a high of $102.82.

Russian forces tightened their grip on Moscow-backed Crimea by seizing another border and a military airfield as German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Russian President Vladimir Putin that a planned referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine’s constitution.

Shanghai steel futures dropped 4 percent to a contract low of 3,221 yuan a tonne, and Dalian’s iron ore slid 5.9 percent to 728 yuan a tonne, its weakest since the bourse introduced iron ore futures on Oct. 18.

Steel demand in China, the world’s biggest consumer and producer, has been weak since the start of the year as a slowing economy curbs demand for the building material.

Construction activity, which typically picks up from March, is unlikely to spur a strong recovery in demand for steel as Beijing pursues economic expansion that is less driven by investment and more fuelled by domestic consumption.

Spot gold fell for a second session and hit a one-week low of $1,328.86 an ounce, largely due to the strong U.S. employment data released on Friday that suggested the Federal Reserve’s stimulus tapering efforts will stay on course.

But some traders say the disappointing Chinese trade data also weighed as investors in Shanghai futures and spot contracts sold bullion. China is the world’s top gold consumer.

“We can see liquidation from the Shanghai futures exchange and there is no fresh buying interest on the physical side,” said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Hong Kong’s Wing Fung Precious Metals.

(Read More: What that China debt default means to the market )

The most heavily traded copper futures contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 5 percent - its daily limit - to 46,670 yuan (USD 7618) a tonne.

The move followed a steep fall in the price of copper futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange on Friday. May futures tumbled 4.2 percent to USD 3.0825 a pound, the heftiest one-day drop since December 2011, and the lowest level since July.

Analysts closely watch copper prices as a barometer for global risk appetite, as it is sensitive to macro-economic developments.

""I am a little bit concerned by it [copper`s fall],"" Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance, told CNBC Asia`s Squawk Box on Monday.

""The [China] data wasn`t that impressive, and when you combine that with [last week`s bond] default, it presents a weak picture in terms of demand and ongoing ripples that that will cause. So copper did fall out of bed, which I think was something that was expected,"" he added.

Copper contracts for delivery May 14, on the Commodities Exchange Centre (CEC), over the past five days.

Copper`s swoon comes against a backdrop of worry about slowing Chinese demand, which has seen prices slump 9.2 percent year to date. China, the world`s largest copper importer, accounts for around 40 percent of global demand.

According to the Shanghai Futures Exchange, copper stockpiles increased for an eighth straight week last week, their longest rising streak in two years.

""Any kind of weakness in demand is going to highlight the fact that the market is potentially reaching a tipping point between supply and demand,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst for CMC Markets in Australia.

""Broadly speaking, leaving out the global financial crisis, a shortage of copper caused by the growth of China has kept prices strong. Now as copper production is growing faster than demand, the market`s slight deficit could turn into a slight surplus - which will have a big impact on prices,"" he said, adding that in his view copper`s fair value sits between USD 2.75 and USD 3 a pound.

""Copper prices normally see strong technical support at USD 3, if we break below that it could move lower,"" Spooner added.

Official data released over the weekend showed China moved into a trade deficit for the first time in 11 months after exports fell 18.1 percent on year in February, provoking concern over the health of the world`s second largest economy.

Adding to the pain was benign inflation data showing consumer prices rose 2 percent in February, the slowest rate in 13 months. News last week of China`s first corporate bond default in at least 17 years delivered another hefty blow.

http://www.travelweekly.com/Arnie-Weissmann/Identity-crisis-No-standards-crisis/,business,"Marriott International opened its first hotel in China, a JW Marriott in Hong Kong, in 1989. The company now has 74 hotels across six brands in China.

Starwood, whose Sheraton Great Wall opened in Beijing in 1985, had 140 hotels in China across nine brands at the end of 2013, and there are at least 80 more Chinese properties in its pipeline.

InterContinental Hotels Group opened the Holiday Inn Lido in Beijing in 1984. It now has more than 200 hotels across five brands in China and 150 more under development.

The oldest international hospitality group operating in China, Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd., better known by its sole brand, Peninsula, opened its first property in China in 1868. Today it has a grand total of three hotels in the country, in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing.

One could see this as a repudiation of the ""first mover"" advantage, but that would be a very Western way of looking at it: By almost any measure -- scale being the notable exception -- Peninsula is very successful. And from its own corporate perspective, it is in the midst of a warp-speed expansion program, with three hotels in development (Paris, London and Yangon), representing an almost 30% increase in its global portfolio.

I've always found Peninsula to be an interesting collection, in part because its reputation is outsized relative to its footprint. I think its strength is that it knows better than any other hospitality brand the difference between identity and standards, and it's a difference with which other, much larger companies struggle.

Consistency of delivery is regarded as a fundamental element of brand strength by most Western hotel companies.

""In hospitality, we like standards,"" said Nicolas Beliard, general manager of the Paris Peninsula, which is scheduled to open Aug. 1. ""Use the guest's name a certain number of times. Answer the phone within three rings. But why? Does that matter more than what you say when you do answer the phone? Or whether you actually get to know the guests well enough to remember their names? ""

Beliard recalls once going over standards with the staff when he worked at another brand. ""The staff thought we were a [cult],"" he said.

And he sympathized.

A discussion of the division between identity and standards is particularly relevant now. Consumer demand for authenticity continues to rise just as the corporate owners of iconic brands expand them as quickly as possible.

When I toured the St. Regis in Shanghai, I found a great business hotel that didn't remind me in the least of the original St. Regis in midtown Manhattan. The Orlando Waldorf Astoria is a fine, five-star hotel, but had it been labeled with any of several other luxury brands, I wouldn't have once thought, ""This feels like a Waldorf Astoria.""

But when I'm in a Peninsula, I know I'm in a Peninsula, whether in Beverly Hills, Bangkok, Hong Kong or New York. The age, height and layout of the properties can (and do) vary tremendously. Its rooms can have high-tech touches, its restaurants can embrace modern culinary trends, it can innovate with flexible check-in/checkout times, but in other respects it is superglued to its traditional, conservative, service-focused identity.

The Paris property will open 10 years after it was acquired. In part, that's because it's in a historical building, and the French are extremely particular about how old properties are restored, but also because Peninsula is going to great lengths to ensure that the property is worthy of the brand.

And the unusually long gestation is not solely due to physical preparation; part of the advance work involves staff training that is at once rigorous and unusually flexible, exacting and nuanced.

The problem with standards, Beliard believes, is that they often try to reduce the thorniest and satisfying aspects of hospitality into cookie-cutter shortcuts. ""Dealing with other humans,"" he said, ""is the most rewarding, but also the most difficult, part of running a hotel.""

""In Asia, it's important to smile as a means to reduce tension,"" he said. And while that might seem a good and authentic ""standard"" to adopt, he understands that even something as simple as a smile can't be standardized.

""In some cultures, eye contact is important. In others, it would be inappropriate. Trying to understand the different markets in which we operate, but still act authentically, is the challenge,"" he said.

The Chinese famously bring a long-view approach to challenges; the West moves quickly. Pressures related to ownership expectations tend to influence the Western corporate view, while experience over extended periods is perhaps the dominant factor for the Chinese.

We're in a particularly interesting place in history, where technology enables change at an extraordinary pace and Chinese global influence has never been greater. When it comes to speed and tradition, it's not necessarily an either/or situation, and it strikes me that the tradition-bound Peninsula might have unusual advantages during this time of great change and disrupting influences.

The consumer price index rose 2 percent from a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, compared with the 2.1 percent median estimate in a survey of analysts.

Photo: Reuters Hong Kong and Beijing - China’s exports fell last month by the most since the global financial crisis, dealing another blow to confidence as Communist Party leaders meeting in Beijing assess the risk from the nation’s first onshore bond default. Shipments abroad dropped 18.1 percent from a year earlier in February, the customs administration said at the weekend, trailing the median estimate for a 7.5 percent rise in a survey of 45 economists. Distortions in the data from the Lunar New Year holiday and fake invoicing that inflated data last year make it harder to assess the true picture. As China chases a 7.5 percent annual growth target, set at last week’s meeting of the National People’s Congress, officials need to contain stresses in the financial system from the credit boom that began with stimulus measures in 2008. “People see a lot of negative news coming out of China: growth momentum is slowing and when there is a default of one company they tend to think it’s going to be a systemic problem and spill over into the rest of the economy,” said Ding Shuang, a senior China economist at Citigroup in Hong Kong. “These numbers may support their negative views, that even external demand may not be that strong.” Even so, the drop in exports was not as bad as it appeared when taking into account the holiday, the inflated base of last year’s numbers, as well as a weather-related “soft patch” in the US economy, said Ding, whose forecast of an 8.5 percent decline in sales was closest to the customs figure.

Imports rose 10.1 percent, more than projected.

Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology, a maker of solar cells, on Friday became the first company to default in China’s onshore bond market after failing to pay full interest due.

The number of publicly traded non-financial Chinese firms whose debt-to-equity ratios exceed 200 percent has jumped 57 percent since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite index had its first gain in three weeks last week, rising 0.1 percent after a 2.7 percent drop the previous week. The yuan posted its biggest weekly increase since October last year, following a record decline of 1.4 percent last month, on speculation the central bank ceased engineering a decline in the currency to discourage appreciation bets.

Trade would be a “clear drag” on growth in the first quarter and the yuan should weaken this week, said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist and strategist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.

“The trade data explain some of the downward pressure on the yuan in February – it can be justified not only by central bank guidance but by actual deterioration of demand and supply in the forex market,” he said.

Analysts’ estimates for last month’s exports ranged from a drop of 8.5 percent to a 14.4 percent increase. The decline, after a 10.6 percent gain in January, was the biggest since August 2009.

Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Company has failed to make an interest payment on its corporate bonds in the first corporate bond default in China. This default has caused quite a stir among analysts, many of whom view this as an opportunity for China’s corporate bond market to enhance its risk pricing mechanism.

This highlights some issues with China’s corporate bond market. First, the excessively optimistic bond rating assigned to corporations like Chaori, which had experienced financial distress for months preceding the default, needs to be checked with more realistic ratings. Second, while the Chaori default may promote better risk pricing, it may also cause a bifurcation of bond rating and pricing between state-owned companies and their subsidiaries, which have the implicit backing of the government, and non-state ownership types. This would reinforce the financing bias against non-state firms, and not truly reflect creditworthiness. Third, while the corporate bond market in China for bonds with AA- ratings or above is relatively liquid, the market for bonds with ratings below this mark is relatively illiquid, further reinforcing the bond market bifurcation. Fourth, as the corporate bond market is expected to expand to include more local government financing vehicle bonds, there is a question of how these bonds will be viewed by the market; i.e., will they be viewed as government backed or not, and will the bond rating take precedence over the fact that they represent local government debt?

In other words, China continues to lag behind in risk rating and pricing of the corporate bond market and until these issues are addressed, it will continue to do so. Although some analysts believed bonds were making strides in pricing risk before the Chaori failure, the fact that many bonds are rated as AA- or above even though the interest coverage ratio (using EBITDA) is negative or less than one, revealing a weakness in ability to pay the bond coupon, shows that China’s corporate bond market is less resilient than it appears.

What does this mean for the rest of the financial economy? While some have predicted that the Chaori event will result in a revelation of risk exposure and correction across the board, it seems unlikely that this will be the case, in part due to the issues presented above. Other financial sectors of the economy have responded to risks in different ways, some with local government bailouts, as in the case of trusts, some with central government bailouts, as in the case of banks, and some with failures, as in the case of private finance. This can be attributed to the high degree of segmentation in China’s financial economy, in which the activities of financial instruments may not move in tandem, and to a lack of financial marketization, in which financial activity is not governed by interest rates or other strong market forces.

Without some fundamental, institutional changes in China’s financial economy, “market forces” will continue to be prevented from taking shape. While the Chaori incident may improve risk signaling in the non-state owned portion of the corporate bond market, it will by no means be a catalyst for positive change in the rest of the financial economy. Major reform must take place before Chinese finance relies on the natural forces of exchange rather than artificial forces posed by state owned institutions, regulated interest rates, and automatic bailout mechanisms.

HONG KONG, March 10 (Reuters) - China’s CSI300 index slid to its lowest in nearly nine months early Monday, weighing on Hong Kong markets, after data showed exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, reigniting some fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.

Data over the weekend also showed inflation remained benign, but some investors were more concerned that producer prices fell for the 24th consecutive month, as the lack of pricing power suggested China is still struggling with excess capacity.

At midday, the CSI300 of the largest Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings was down 1.9 percent at its lowest since June 25. The Shanghai Composite Index sank 1.7 percent.

The Hang Seng Index shed 1.6 percent to 22,294.9 points, its lowest since Feb. 26. The China Enterprises Index of the leading offshore Chinese listings in Hong Kong also sank 1.6 percent to its lowest in a month.

“Markets are over-reacting a little today, nobody’s caring too much about the data skew from the different timing of the Chinese New Year this year from last year,” said Alex Wong, director of asset management at Ample Finance.

“That said, my longer-term prognosis on China remains pessimistic. Unless you see a turnaround in producer prices, which would suggest they are getting excess capacity under control, it’s not possible to play the China macro game,” Wong added.

Cyclical counters Anhui Conch Cement fell 4.7 percent in Hong Kong and 3.8 percent in Shanghai. Jiangxi Copper tumbled 4.5 percent to an eight-month low in Hong Kong and 4.8 percent in Shanghai.

China’s consumer prices rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, their slowest rate in 13 months as pork prices fell by their most in over a year, a sign that slowing growth rather than rising prices poses a bigger risk.

Exports in February fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier, following a 10.6 percent rise in January, the General Administration of Customs said on Saturday. Imports rose 10.1 percent, yielding a trade deficit of $23 billion for the month versus a surplus of $32 billion in January.

Markets failed to take any cheer from an official China Securities Journal commentary on Monday, which highlighted the difficulty of hitting this year’s 7.5 percent growth target, while suggesting policies aimed at balancing overall reform with stable growth are likely due in the second quarter.

In Hong Kong, China Construction Bank sank 1.9 percent, as did China Cinda Asset Management, which was created to manage bad debts.

Nomura banking analyst Lucy Feng on Monday recommended a long Cinda and short CCB trade. She downgraded CCB to neutral on rising concerns of property-related loans.

A plunging yuan further weighed on airlines, port operators, shippers and exporters. China’s yuan opened trade at 6.1554 per dollar on Monday, down 0.5 percent from Friday’s close of 6.1260. If losses hold, this would be the currency’s biggest one-day loss since December 2008.

China Southern Airlines underperformed the airlines sector in Hong Kong, sinking 3.5 percent. Further hurting the stock was news that two passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines flight had bought tickets using stolen passports through the Chinese carrier on a code-share basis.

“That incident will inevitably weigh on sentiment on its stock,” said Ample Finance’s Wong.

Shanghai copper has dropped by its 5 per cent daily limit to its lowest in more than four years after weak Chinese trade data fanned concerns over its metals industry following the country’s first domestic bond default last week.

On the Comex in New York, copper futures for delivery in May slid as much as 2.8 per cent to $US2.9955 a pound, the lowest intraday level since June 25, and last traded at $US3.0205 in Tokyo. The metal fell 4.2 per cent on Friday, the biggest drop since December 2011, and dropped 3.3 per cent last week.

The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.

Reuters



China's carbon prices surged this week as demand firmed ahead of an upcoming deadline to report 2013 emissions data, indicating the markets may be less over-allocated than feared.



Spot permits in four of China's regional pilot emissions trading schemes rose between 5 and 12 per cent this week, although market participants cautioned against reading too much into the numbers as liquidity remained low.



""More companies are now coming to the market knowing their positions after calculating their 2013 emissions. This has pushed up the prices,"" a market participant told Reuters.



Companies in the markets must report their 2013 carbon dioxide emissions to local regulators by the end of March or April, and then surrender the equivalent number of permits to governments by the end of May or June.



In the Shanghai market, permits rose 8.9 per cent over the week to 40.30 yuan ($6.59). Demand mostly came from oil and chemical companies, while major manufacturers and power generators remained on the sidelines, the participant said.



In Tianjin, prices shot up by 11.7 per cent to 33.20 yuan, Shenzhen saw a 6.1 per cent rise to 85.80 yuan, while in Beijing, spot permits were at 55.18 yuan, up 5 per cent for the week. The Guangdong market was untraded, as it has been since Dec. 20.



This week's price hikes follow stable rates in all regions since the turn of the year.



Analysts had feared permit prices would drop due to over-allocation in China's new carbon markets that rely heavily on companies' own emissions data.



But volumes traded remained low as many firms have yet to allocate funds to participate in the markets.



The Shanghai price rise came on the back of 38,000 permits being traded, while none of the other markets saw more than 6,000 permits change hands on the official exchanges.



However, the Beijing Energy and Environment Exchange said on Friday that three deals totalling 42,000 permits at undisclosed prices had been negotiated off the exchange. Companies involved in larger bilateral deals are not required to publish prices.



One source said the Shanghai volume was helped by a conference this week where high-level officials urged companies to start trading.



The Shenzhen market was launched last June, with the other schemes following in November and December. According to industry analysts, many of the covered companies are yet to come up with strategies on how to deal with climate regulations.",

Simon Henry is the co-CEO of Juwai.com, a real-estate portal that features world-wide property listings for Chinese home buyers.

The Shanghai-based Australian talks to the Journal about pounding the pavement, polite immigration officers, and enduring food poisoning on a 15-hour flight.

How often do you travel?

Probably once every two weeks.

Where do you go most often?

Hong Kong, Shanghai, San Francisco, Sydney and London.

Preferred airline?

Generally Cathay Pacific [Airways] because our head office is in Hong Kong and it has the best connectivity to everywhere else in the world.

Favorite airport?

Hong Kong, because it has great food, great services and great staff. Shanghai would be a close second because Chinese immigration is probably second to none. They’re friendly and welcoming. After getting off a long flight, it’s nice to get people who actually smile and say, “Hello, how are you, good morning.”

Favorite hotel?

The Dusit Thani in Bangkok. It’s classic old-world service, great location and good food. The rooms have a colonial feel with timber walls, timber floors, comfortable couches and lounge areas. They’ve got a garden oasis in the middle of the hotel where you sit and hear the water and see the carp, and nine or 10 restaurants on site. It’s a place you can go and just not leave.

Packing essentials?

Multi-power adapter, iPhone cord and my computer. They’re with me everywhere. I also bring a travel pillow and La Mer moisturizer.

Packing strategy?

It takes me 10 minutes to pack for a trip whether it’s for a week or 10 weeks. I just start at my feet and work my way up: socks, slacks, underwear and shirts. The main thing is not to overpack and the most important thing is money, passport and wallet. Everything else you can buy.

Travel tips?

Book early and upgrade using airline points if you have them. That extra 2 inches makes a big difference.

Tips to avoid jet lag?

Be so exhausted before you get on the plane that you sleep the whole way. The best thing is to stay as natural as you can—lots of water. Set your clock to the time of your destination as quickly as possible and try to get into that time zone as soon as you get on the plane.

How do you stay in shape on the road?

I walk a lot. And most importantly watch what you eat.

Favorite city to visit?

London. It’s the only truly world city. You can be in London for three days and not hear any English spoken. There are so many international people. It’s a mixture of villages, a delight to be in, and everything you want is there.

Favorite restaurants in London?

Costa Coffee. You don’t tend to get really good coffee in Shanghai, and London has some really good coffee.

Which Asian city has the best food?

Bangkok, closely followed by Tokyo. They tend to base their meals on incredibly fresh products that are very high quality and have a lot of different, diverse flavors. I always get street-side noodles in Bangkok and barbecue in Japan. Usually the smaller the barbecue restaurants, the better.

Best travel experience?

A five-week holiday 10 years ago where we spent the whole time between London and Paris with family and friends walking the cities all day every day. It was the first time I’d ever been to London or Paris, so everything was new.

Worst travel experience?

Getting food poisoning from a meal on an airline on a 15-hour flight to New York. Apparently it’s supposed to be almost impossible to get [food poisoning on planes] because they radiate the food to such a level. But I hadn’t eaten anything for 24 hours beforehand, so it was the only thing that made sense. [The flight attendants] were apologetic but they couldn’t really do anything.

So do you stay away from airline food now?

Yes, I try to avoid it. I now make sure I eat before I get on the plane and have only a few snacks on board.

Chinese solar-equipment maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co became the first Chinese company to default on a bond traded in the mainland on Friday, rattling investor confidence. The default comes amid broader fears about the impact of slowing Chinese economic growth on demand for base metals, which are used in everything from smartphones to household plumbing. China is the world's top metals consumer, accounting for about 40 per cent of global copper demand.

""Metals were rocked by the Chinese corporate default,"" said Michael Turek, director of metals trading with futures brokerage Newedge.

""This underscores not only the systemic structural debt issue there but also the Chinese central government's apparent willingness to forgo short-term gross domestic product (GDP) growth to skim speculative excesses for longer-term benefit.""

The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, from 6.6 percent, as more people began looking for work.

The data cemented expectations that Federal Reserve policy makers will keep reducing the pace of monthly bond purchases, decreased by US$10 billion increments in the most recent two meetings to US$65 billion currently. The Federal Open Market Committee begins its next two-day meeting on March 18.

Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.8 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 1 percent to close at a record on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.65 percent. So far in 2014, the S&P 500 has gained 2 percent, while the Nasdaq has advanced 4.1 percent. The Dow has slipped 0.2 percent.

Evidence of resilience in the US jobs market reduced the appeal of Treasuries. Bonds fell for the week, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year note 14 basis points higher to 2.79 percent.

The latest US economic data will arrive in the form of the NFIB small business optimism index and whole sale trade, due Tuesday; weekly jobless claims, retail sales, import and export prices, and business inventories, due Thursday; and consumer sentiment, due Friday.

Today, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser will speak on monetary policy, banks and protectionism in Paris, while Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will talk on the economy and monetary policy in Columbus, Georgia.

While investors opted to focus on good news from the US economy last week, concern about the latest developments of the Ukraine crisis and their consequences on financial markets will stay on everyone's radar.

""Ukraine was a very big deal and created a ton of market volatility and had a huge impact on the stock market,"" Richard Slinn, a San Francisco-based investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank, told Bloomberg News. ""We're watching that closely, but you can't manage portfolios on geopolitical issues.""

In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index shed 1.5 percent last week. The UK's FTSE 100 dropped 1.1 percent, France's CAC 40 fell 1.2 percent, while Germany's DAX slumped 2 percent.

Here, economic reports due in the coming days include euro-zone Sentix investor confidence, due today; Germany's trade balance, due Tuesday; euro-industrial production, due Wednesday; and German CPI and euro-zone employment, due Friday.

Investors remain concerned about a slowdown in the pace of growth in the world's second-largest economy, China. As a result, copper prices have slumped 9 percent this year, the most among 34 commodities tracked by Bloomberg. On Friday, copper futures for delivery in May dropped 4.2 percent to settle at US$3.0825 a pound.

""Copper is particularly exposed to Chinese issues due to palpably high local stocks and associated financing deals,"" BNP Paribas strategists including Stephen Briggs, said in a report, according to Bloomberg News.

There was more evidence to support that concern over the weekend. China's exports unexpectedly sank in February, plunging 18.1 percent from a year earlier, according to General Administration of Customs data.

""February export numbers were a surprise on the downside, and even combined January-February numbers were below market expectations,"" Li Heng, an economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing, told Reuters. ""The data shows that the economy faces relatively big downward pressures and macro-policies need to be loosened a bit.""

http://www.moneynews.com/StreetTalk/China-Exports-Factory-Prices/2014/03/09/id/556902,business,"China’s biggest drop in exports since 2009 and deepening factory-gate deflation highlight the challenges for Premier Li Keqiang in achieving this year’s economic-growth target of 7.5 percent.

Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier, customs data showed Saturday, compared with analysts’ median estimate for a 7.5 percent increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July, according to a statistics bureau report Sunday, extending the longest decline since 1999.

Distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday and false invoices that inflated trade numbers last year, along with a larger-than-projected increase in imports, make it harder to assess the true picture of global and domestic demand for Chinese goods. Slowing consumer-price gains may give leaders more space to support growth if needed as they gauge the effects of the nation’s first onshore corporate-bond default.

“There is an intrinsic inconsistency in their policy target and the reality of the economy,” Liu Li-Gang, head of Greater China economics at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, said in a phone interview. Growth below 7.5 percent in the first half may spur the government to use fiscal stimulus, and “they do have room to do that but by doing so it will compromise China’s economic reform agenda,” he said.

Inflation Target

Premier Li announced the goal for 2014 gross domestic product growth last week at the opening of the annual meeting of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, a pace unchanged from last year. He also set a target for consumer inflation of about 3.5 percent this year, the same as in 2013, and a goal of 7.5 percent for growth in foreign trade.

The consumer price index rose 2 percent in February from a year earlier, a 13-month low, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Sunday.

China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which last week had its first gain in three weeks, has dropped about 11 percent in the past year. The yuan posted its largest weekly increase since October, following the biggest monthly decline since the government unified official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.

The yuan’s 1.4 percent drop in February may have helped spur the disappearance of over-invoicing, a practice used to disguise capital inflows that plagued trade data in the first four months of last year. Under-invoicing of exports may have occurred in the second half of February to facilitate money outflows, Louis Kuijs, chief China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Hong Kong, said in a note.

Complicate Plans

Imports rose 10.1 percent in February from a year earlier, more than projected, leaving a trade deficit of $23 billion, the biggest in two years, according to customs data.

Any weakening of global demand as well as falling prices for manufacturers may complicate plans by Li and President Xi Jinping to carry out the broadest economic-policy shifts since the 1990s while clamping down on debt risks and pollution.

Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology Co., a maker of solar cells, on Friday became the first company to default in China’s onshore bond market after failing to pay full interest due.

The coal industry in northern Shanxi province suffered gravely because of a slump in prices last year, Governor Li Xiaopeng said March 6 in Beijing.

Beverage Sales

In a more positive sign, growth this year at Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co., the largest Chinese beverage maker, is “not too bad” and sales are likely to increase about 20 percent, Chairman Zong Qinghou said Sunday at the NPC meeting.

Customs data showed overseas shipments fell 1.6 percent in the first two months from a year earlier. China’s exports to Hong Kong, which diverged last year from the city’s data on imports from the mainland, fell 21 percent, compared with a 61 percent increase in the January-February period of 2013. Chinese regulators in May started a crackdown on practices that inflated trade data.

Economists from UBS AG, RBS and Bank of America Corp. estimate exports for January and February combined did expand after taking into account inflated data last year.

UBS sees underlying export growth of about 6 percent, while RBS estimates 3.1 percent and Bank of America put the figure at around 7 percent to 8 percent.

Disappointments Possible

“In terms of the underlying momentum, we expect export growth in 2014 to continue to develop favorably,” wrote RBS’s Kuijs, a former World Bank economist. At the same time, the “global recovery is not a steep one and disappointments are possible,” he said.

Investors this week will get more details on the economy’s performance as well as the outlook from senior leaders. The statistics bureau will provide data on January-February industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment on March 13. The central bank will publish figures for February credit and money supply by March 15.

People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan will give a briefing on March 11 and Premier Li will hold a press conference on March 13.

Subdued inflation below the government’s 2014 target will give the central bank more room to ease liquidity and maintain lower money-market interest rates, said Lu Ting, head of Greater China economics at Bank of America in Hong Kong.

China’s seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding availability in the banking system, averaged 3 percent last week, down from 4.98 percent at the end of January.

“The low CPI inflation could be good news for markets as monetary tightening is definitely not justified,” Lu said in a note Sunday. “Lower and more stable interbank rates should be supportive of delivering a stable GDP growth.”",

http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/Chinas-rising-demand-for-expats-30228779.html,business,"China (and in particular Shanghai and Beijing) is the most popular Asian destination for expats, and despite a slowing economy it is likely to remain so.

The promise of better salaries and promotion opportunities so far outweighs the negative factor of rising air pollution, although some companiesare finding they have to offer higher salaries to compensate.

In Shanghai, which is aiming to become a global financial hub by 2020, salary growth among professionals is expected to be higher this year than in Singapore and Hong Kong, and the absolute gap in remuneration between Shanghai and its competitor cities is narrowing rapidly.

According to British recruitment agency Hays, almost two-thirds of mainland employers increased salaries by at least 6 percent last year, compared with just 17 percent in Hong Kong and 29 percent in Asia overall. And the same percentages apply to employers who intend to increase salaries in 2014.

Although executive pay in Hong Kong is generally higher than in Shanghai, the gap is narrowing quickly, and in some areas Shanghai has moved ahead. And while Hong Kong has the advantage of lower personal income tax rates, Shanghai is seen to offer greater opportunities for career advancement.

There is still a perceived skills shortage on the mainland, which is feeding the demand and rising salaries on the mainland.The most in-demand areas are understandably those seen as vital to China’s future economic development.

These include the services sector in which demand for skilled accounting and financial personnel is outpacing supply. Salaries at commercial banks are rising by 10-15% as lenders compete to open new markets.

But the demand for expats extends well beyond the financial sector. Experienced specialists in geology and exploration, for example, are highly sought-after to help China extract the last drops from its ageing oilfields as well as to develop new unconventional sources.

More international firms are offering their employees benefits such as health insurance and car and housing allowances, and more than half of all employers include bonuses in their packages.

But it’s not all upside for expats. As well as the downside of rising pollution in major Chinese cities, Hays notes the increasing importance of Chinese language skills alongside increasing competition from bilingual Chinese with international experience, meaning that all but the most senior expat executives will find it harder to get ahead in the future. Demand for places in good international schools for the children of expats is high. Another downside is that many jobs in the oil and gas industries are dependent to varying degrees on the government’s energy policy, which can be unpredictable and subject to significant change.

Still, as a Thai expat living in Shanghai, I can vouch for the attractions of this vibrant city, with its alluring mix of ancient culture and the best the 21st century has to offer. Clean air would be a great bonus, but perhaps that would only make the city too attractive, and too crowded with expats!

Another aspect of expat life in China is the relative lack of Thais, compared with expats from our Asian counterparts such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. Indeed, many Thais seem to lack the adventurous gene that encourages people to become expats. Maybe we’re too contented with the great lifestyle we can enjoy in Thailand, but whatever the reasons, I would encourage more Thais to live and work overseas. Apart from the benefits of higher salary and career progression, being an expat gives you an invaluable opportunity to explore the outside world, and – in most cases – the ability to bring home the value of that experience for the overall benefit of Thailand.

The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index nudged down by 1.67 points or 0.08 percent to 2,057.91 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 0.08 percent from the previous Friday, February 28.



The Shenzhen Component Index slid by 23.55 points or 0.32 percent to 7,328.48 points on Friday. It saw a weekly decline of 0.51 percent from the previous Friday.



Combined turnover on the two bourses on Friday was 215.84 billion yuan ($35.23 billion), down from Thursday's 222.26 billion yuan.



On Friday, oil and nonferrous companies were among the biggest gainers while banks, brokerages, and property developers performed poorly.



Shares in Shanxi Securities Co fell by 1.88 percent to 6.77 yuan, and the overall brokerage sector fell by 1.12 percent.



The property sector declined by 1.24 percent, led by a fall in the country's two leading real estate companies, China Vanke Co and Poly Real Estate Group Co.



News of the default by Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology worried investors last week.



The loss-making solar cell and panel producer announced Wednesday that it would not be able to pay the interest on a loan. The interest payment of 89.8 million yuan was due on Friday.



The company became the first domestic company in the corporate bond market to default. It was seen as an indicator that more similar defaults may follow.



Despite the potential boost for stock markets from policy announcements at the ongoing annual two sessions - the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference - investors remained cautious last week.



""Investors may be concerned about economic data, property and credit risks,"" said a research note sent by Shenyin & Wanguo Securities on Friday.



ChiNext, China's NASDAQ-style board for high-tech and fast-growing start-ups listed in Shenzhen, declined by 1.92 points or 0.13 percent to 1,460.61 points on Friday. The index saw a weekly gain of 1.79 percent from the previous Friday.",
http://shanghaiist.com/2014/03/09/more_chinese_women_marrying_elderly.php,business,"

Hong Kong has experienced a notable increase in the number of young mainland Chinese women marrying elderly Hong Kong men to obtain residency, and in many cases, housing.

The South China Morning Post cites the Hong Kong Social Welfare Department reporting an increase in the number of documented elderly abuse cases, from 589 in 2013, 408 in 2012, and a mere 368 from 2011-2010. More specifically, Against Elderly Abuse, a Hong Kong welfare agency, noted a trend of Chinese women in their thirties from Hubei and Hunan provinces marrying public tenants “over 60 years old living on welfare,” and cautioned such men to “use caution” as such marriages often turn out “too good to be true.”

The eagerness of some elderly Hong Kong men to walk down the aisle with much younger Chinese women seems to be against the grain in terms of overall Hong Kongers’ distaste for Chinese, but in line with cross-border male preferences for younger female partners.

WASHINGTON — The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday launched an effort to encourage issuers and underwriters of municipal securities to self-report certain violations of the federal securities laws rather than wait for their violations to be detected.

Under the Municipalities Continuing Disclosure Cooperation Initiative, the SEC's Enforcement Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pension unit will recommend favorable settlement terms for muni issuers and underwriters who voluntarily report that there were inaccurate statements in bond documents about their prior compliance with continuing disclosure obligations. Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires underwriters to reasonably determine that an issuer will comply with its continuing disclosure agreement before underwriting any new municipal securities. The rule also requires new offering documents to include descriptions of any continuing disclosure violations in the past five years.

""The Enforcement Division is committed to using innovative methods to uncover securities law violations and improve transparency in the municipal markets,"" said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the Enforcement Division. ""We encourage eligible parties to take advantage of the favorable terms we are offering under this initiative. Those who do not self-report and instead decide to take their chances can expect to face increased sanctions for violations.""

The SEC has repeatedly indicated it is paying stricter attention to whether issuers are living up to their disclosure agreements and whether underwriters are doing their due diligence in making sure of that. Last year an SEC probe examined underwriters in California, and a July 2013 enforcement action targeted both West Clark Community Schools in Clark County, Ind. and Indianapolis-based City Securities Corp. with falsely claiming in bond documents that the issuer was meeting its secondary market disclosure obligations when it was not.

""Continuing disclosures are a critical source of information for investors in municipal securities, and offering documents should accurately disclose issuers' prior compliance with their disclosure obligations,"" said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, chief of the Enforcement Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. ""This initiative is designed to promote improved compliance by encouraging responsible behavior by market participants who have failed to meet their obligations in the past.""

Bond Dealers of America president and chief executive officer Mike Nicholas said the SEC goal is sound but the details of the new program will have to be carefully examined.

""The BDA supports the SEC's goal toward self-reporting of violations to the extent an obvious violation of the securities law has occurred,"" Nicholas said. ""We caution that there may be disproportionate administrative, reporting and other burdens on underwriters via the settlement obligation requirements and we will be examining those in more detail in the coming days.""

Ben Watkins, Florida's bond finance director and the chair of the Government Finance Officers Association's debt management committee, said the new program isn't likely to provide much incentive for issuers to step forward.

""I don't see it,"" Watkins said, adding that issuers would probably end up with a cease-and-desist order whether they self-report or get caught by SEC investigators.

John McNally, a lawyer at Hawkins, Delafield & Wood LLP, said the SEC's announcement underscores a point the commission has already made. McNally said that the investigations currently being done by underwriters of an issuer's filing history are very comprehensive, and pointed out that the SEC issued a release in June 2010 warning underwriters that they should be diligent about looking into an issuer's filing history. The West Clark case made issuers sit up and take notice as well, McNally said.

""The SEC has already advised issuers and underwriters of their concerns, and all parties are paying careful attention to such advice,"" he said.",

http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/10/usa-municipals-sec-idINL2N0M715420140310,business,"WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Federal regulators on Monday said U.S. municipal issuers and underwriters who self-report inaccurate statements they have made in bond documents will likely receive standardized, favorable settlement terms under a new initiative.

“We encourage eligible parties to take advantage of the favorable terms we are offering under this initiative,” Andrew Ceresney, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enforcement Division, said in a statement. “Those who do not self-report and instead decide to take their chances can expect to face increased sanctions for violations.”

Under the initiative an issuer such as a city or an underwriter could come forward to say it had put wrong information in continuing disclosures, or failed to include important information about its financial condition and operations.

When issuers sell new bonds, they are supposed to describe in sale documents any instances within the previous five years when they did not comply with federal requirements to give material information to investors. Underwriters are supposed to ensure that they follow through.

The Tower Amendment, which prevents the SEC from requiring issuers to file bond sale documents with it before bringing the securities to market, limits the SEC’s ability to enforce securities law in the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market.

But it can rap underwriters and issuers for committing fraud in their bond documents.

In the last year and a half, the commission has ramped up its efforts and charged cities, school districts and even a state for not disclosing important information.

“Continuing disclosures are a critical source of information for investors in municipal securities, and offering documents should accurately disclose issuers’ prior compliance with their disclosure obligations,” LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit, said in the same statement.",

Yes, said Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen, who upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on Tuesday and raised his price target to $11 from $7.50. The move sent Penney shares up as much as 10.2% in early trading.

Chen said the company may be successful in getting back the shoppers lost during former CEO Ron Johnson's failed reign. Penney has brought back its key private-label products including St. John's Bay, Worthington and Ambrielle taken out under Johnson as Chief Executive Mike Ullman has said he aims to increase store brands, which are more profitable than national brands, to a level of about 50% of sales from 30% under Johnson. Meanwhile, a better assortment of national labels including Levi's, Nike and Carter's also are helping to bring customers back, the analyst noted.

He also applauded the company's ""taking the pain now to go narrow and deep"" with its move to remove merchandise including Justin Timberlake's William Rast label as well as JCP Everyday, the home furnishings line designed by home maven Martha Stewart that had been at the center of controversy with Penney's key rival Macy's Inc.. While exiting those merchandise has hurt gross margin in the fourth quarter, Chen said he doesn't expect discontinued labels to continue to hurt first-quarter margin. He sees ""significant"" improvement in margin this year.

Meanwhile, the company's home merchandise, the worst performing section under Johnson that had declined to 12% of sales in 2012 from nearly 20% in 2008, may also get a boost as Penney overhauls the segment. The analyst said merchandising changes in the kids' department also will be a boost.

Penney ""isn't taking substantial fashion risk but just going back to what worked before and marketing to drive prudent traffic,"" Chen said, adding investors' fears on the company's liquidity position ""are overdone."" He said he sees the company to end the year with $2 billion liquidity, in line with company projection. ""Achieving (first quarter) and (fiscal year) guidance will mitigate investor fear on liquidity concerns and drive profitability and the stock higher.""

http://www.moneynews.com/companies/jc-penney-citigroup-stock-shares/2014/03/11/id/558803/,business,"J.C. Penney Co., the retailer that’s posted three straight annual losses, rose as much as 8.9 percent in early trading after a Citigroup Inc. analyst recommended buying the shares because of its nascent turnaround.

The stock climbed as high as $9.17 as 8:15 a.m. in New York. Shares of Plano, Texas-based J.C. Penney had dropped 8 percent this year through Monday, compared with a 1.6 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.

The department-store chain’s 2 percent gain in fourth- quarter comparable-store sales “bodes well” for continued sales momentum, Citigroup’s Oliver Chen said in a note raising his rating to buy. If J.C. Penney can meet first-quarter and full-year forecasts, that would reduce concerns that the company doesn’t have sufficient liquidity and would drive the stock higher, he said.

J.C. Penney “is early in this go-forward phase but we like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014,”the New York- based analyst said in the note.",
http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/j-c-penney-stock-soars-on-citi-upgrade/,business,"Convinced that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) has already turned a corner under the improved management of CEO Myron Ullman, Citi analyst Oliver Chen upgraded the company from Neutral/High Risk to Buy/High Risk and pushed his price target to $11 from $7.50 with an implied 30% upside. The markets responded immediately, and JCP stock was up 9.6% after just a few hours of trading.

Chen’s thesis rests on the idea that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s recent pain is a result of poor decisions made by former CEO Ron Johnson who was pushed out last April, and that weak comps for the rest of 2013 were caused by Ullman accepting the short-term pain necessary to make long-term changes.

“Not so good decisions made under former CEO Ron Johnson, considerably impacted performance in 2013. The Home department was the major tailwind in 1H of the year, while trouble in Kids from a merchandise point of view was the tailwind in 2H,” writes Chen.

J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) has been struggling for years, and short interest hit 30% of total float earlier this year, so the upgrade goes strongly against what most investors expect and seems to have triggered a serious reassessment.

Growth driven by home, kids

Changes to the home division, which had been underperforming for years, cut J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s floor space by about 10% nationwide during 1H13 and impacted sales in other departments as construction drove people away. But the changes seem to have worked, and Home finally increased during 4Q13. During 2H13 the Kids department was forced to make do with less floor space as management tried new ideas that didn’t pan out. Chen believes that simply reallocating more resources to Kids and solid follow through will be enough to meet 2014 guidance if other departments hold steady.

J.C. Penney returns to historic mix of private brands

Additionally, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) is returning to its historic mix of private labels (50% versus 30% under Johnson) whose margins can be as much as 500 bps higher than comparable national brands. At the same time, J.C. Penney has eliminated a number of private brands that were underperforming (JCP Men’s, Stafford Prep, JOE by Joseph Abboud, William Rast, Joe Fresh Kids and JCP Everyday) and reduced a few others so that it can focus on the private brands that have proven to attract customers. Eliminating those brands forced J.C. Penney to take a one-off 190 bp gross margin hit (though it still improved 460 bps overall), but Chen expects to see strong margin improvement this year.",

http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/j-c-penney-company-inc-jcp-home-department-sales/,business,"J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) is still struggling, and losing market share to rivals. Imperial Capital analysts Mary Ross-Gilbert and Seweryn Sztalkoper said that the company’s remerchandised home department sales should rise this year. J.C. Penney’s revenues from home merchandise have declined from $3.19 billion in 2010 to about $950 million in 2013. That’s because the home departments in most of the big stores were closed. Even when the departments were reopened, they were poorly merchandised.

J.C. Penney’s guidance appears conservative

Imperial Capital analysts estimate J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s first quarter sales to rise 4.3%, and second quarter revenues to jump 6.4%. After recent discussions with the company management, Ross-Gilbert and Sztalkoper said that J.C. Penney’s incremental revenue opportunity could be as high as $400-$500 million this year. So, the comparable sales momentum is likely to improve in 2014 due to a jump in sales of home merchandise. Even a modest increase in sales across the rest of the store should offset the decline in revenue due to closure of 33 stores.

J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) forecasts its first quarter sales to grow between 3-5%, and full year revenues to increase in mid-single digits. That’s well below Imperial Capital’s estimate of 8.7% and 6.6% respectively. Lower Q1 guidance could be because of two reasons. One, harsh winter weather and storms caused temporary store closures, and kept consumers away. Two, not-so-high expectations from the home department. The analysts expect gross margins to rise 268 basis points to 34.5% in Q1. They forecast Q2 and Q3 gross margins to improve to 37.5% and 36.5% respectively.

J.C. Penney to survive in the long-term

Modestly positive comparable sales during the fourth quarter last year suggest that J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s turnaround is gaining traction. The Plano, Texas-based company’s current cash position of $1.25 billion in cash and $500 million of revolver availability are sufficient to fund its turnaround plan. J.C. Penney also has the ability to tap into secured financing of $500 million. The research firm says that it expects J.C. Penney to survive in the long-term as a “value-priced’ department store chain serving low-income consumers.

Imperial Capital has a Buy rating on J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP)’s longer-dated senior notes that mature between 2020 and 2097. But the research firm maintains Hold rating on shorter-dated senior notes that mature between 2015 and 2018. It has an Underperform rating on the company’s shares with $2.50 price target.

http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2014/03/11/jc-penney-what-liquidity-problem/,business,"JC Penney (JCP) has been down so long it's finally looking up, especially after a Citigroup upgrade today.

Citigroup's Oliver Chen and team explain why they raised their rating on JC Penney's shares:

We're upgrading [JC Penney] to Buy based on our conviction that [JC Penney] can continue to deliver positive comp store sales in-line with FY14 guidance (+MSD). We believe this can happen as [JC Penney] fixes home, focuses on restocking basics & private branded product, and edits out inappropriate merchandise. Achieving 1Q & FY guidance will mitigate investor fear on liquidity concerns and drive profitability and the stock higher. We acknowledge that [JC Penney] is early in this go-forward phase but we like the risk/reward given our conviction that just making basic changes will support guidance for growth in 2014. We believe 4Q's +2% comps on better conversion, transaction size, & units w/ high levels of customer service bodes well for con't momentum and share gains.

JC Penney wasn't the only retailer getting some love today: Macy's (M), was raised to Outperform from Market Perform at Wells Fargo, while Aeropostale (ARO) was started as a Buy at Buckingham Research. Urban Outfitters (URBN), however, has dropped after making downbeat comments about the first quarter, while American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) has fallen after it offered disappointing guidance.

Shares of JC Penney have gained 8.5% to $9.13 at 10:22 a.m. today, while Macy's has risen 2.3% to $59.46 and Aeropostale is up 2.3% at $7.16. Urban Outfitters has fallen 4.3% to $35.88 and American Eagle Outfitters has dropped 6.5% to $13.27.",

(NYSE: JCP) is usually pounded in the news, so it tends to stand out any time you see any analyst upgrade in this battered retail stock. And it really stands out when that upgrade to is to a Buy rating.

Citigroup raised J.C. Penney to Buy from Neutral, and the price target was raised to $11 from $7.50 in the call. That puts the implied upside at 30% from the $8.42 prior closing price.

The driving force behind Tuesday’s upgrade is a belief that the troubled department store can continue generating same-store sales. Part of those gains is simply because of a very low base. Still, Citigroup also said that this will lower fears of a liquidity crunch if it reaches its first quarter guidance. Citigroup’s report indicated that the company will not need to raise additional capital, which is in contrast to many other reports.

Keep in mind that the upgrade may not be the only positive call out there. Standard & Poor’s just raised the corporate credit rating recently. Wells Fargo also recently raised its rating to Market Perform from a prior Underperform rating. Still, Sterne Agee maintained its Neutral rating but said that it could not even get to a $3 valuation, based on fears of a capital raise.

This is called a battleground stock, and for a reason.

J.C. Penney shares were up almost 8% at $9.09 in active trading Tuesday morning. This is close to double from the 52-week low of $4.90, yet it is still down more than half from the $19.63 high over the past year.",

Analysts at Citigroup (C) raised their rating on JCP stock to “Buy.” Citigroup also increased its price target for JCP stock to $11, citing the retailer’s renewed focus on children’s and home products, Seeking Alpha notes.

Last month, JCP stock climbed after the company reported an adjusted fourth-quarter loss of 68 cents per share. That surprised analysts who had predicted a loss of 85 cents per share of JCP stock.

However, JCP’s fourth-quarter sales of $3.78 billion fell short of the $3.85 billion that Wall Street had expected.

JCP stock closed at $8.42 on Monday. Over the past year, JCP stock has dropped more than 40%.",

Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP). The report highlights both the stock and debt offerings of the venerable and currently beleaguered retailer, rating the stock as a Market Perform and the senior unsecured notes as a Buy.

J.C. Penney common stock rating

While not overly sanguine on the short-term prospects of J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) stock, Ruggiero does see longer-term potential in the equity. “We believe that the JCP Common Stock trades full relative to its key department store competitors given its continued earnings risk at this stage of its turnaround. Notwithstanding our continued “Market Perform” Common Stock rating, some metrics relative to future expected sales indicate that there may be more upside to the Common Stock from today’s levels.”

J.C. Penney senior unsecured notes a Buy

The report is largely focused on the positive prospects for J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) debt offerings. Ruggiero highlights several positive developments in the companies recent and near-future financial numbers. “We reiterate our “BUY” recommendation for the JCP senior unsecured notes. We have increased our FY14 and FY15 estimated adjusted EBITDA to $112 million and $476 million, respectively.”

The R.W. Pressprich & Co. reports projects the firm will be “modestly Free Cash Flow negative in fiscal 2014 and 2015, but see upside potential in our earnings/cash flow model. Free Cash Flow is projected at ($57) million and ($124) million in FY14 and FY15, respectively.” Ruggiero also notes that these projections do not include asset sales.

Refinancing likely by 2015

Last but not least, Ruggiero also focuses on the possibility, or from his perspective, the likelihood, of J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (NYSE:JCP) undertaking debt refinancing within a year or so. “We continue to expect that JCP will have sufficient financial flexibility to refinance its 6.875% Senior Notes due 10/15/15. Further, we would not be surprised if the Company refinances its 7.65% Debentures due 8/15/16 at the same time as it takes out its 2015 maturity. We think that a first half 2015 refinancing is possible.”",

Penney (NYSE: JCP) may need to “issue additional equity to pay down debt or eventually restructure.” Analyst Mary Ross-Gilbert maintains an Underperform rating and $2.50 price target on the shares, but also maintained a Buy rating on J.C. Penney bonds maturing 2020-2097.

Ross-Gilbert recommends that investors “hedge a long [bond ] position by shorting the shares and/or the shorter-dated bonds.” Longer-dated bonds “create the company at 33% of revenues (43% excluding excess cash), which compares favorably to other major departments store retailers trading in the 43%-92% range,” says the analyst.

The Imperial analyst believes “debt leverage would be nearly 10x, potentially requiring a restructuring unless JCP raises additional equity.” Ross-Gilbert views this as a possibility based on “anticipated positive operating momentum.”

Shares of J.C. Penney were up 0.69 percent in premarket trading to $8.74. Shares are up 72 percent since February 4.",

DigitalGlobe is participating in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared Saturday while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing. The Boeing 777 jetliner was carrying 239 people.

For the search, DigitalGlobe is using its Tomnod platform, which crowdsources the analysis of satellite photos. Tomnod posts images and allows users to scan and tag features and landmarks. In this case, users would be looking for debris.

Xconomy ran a story on Tomnod in November, when the company used it to evaluate damage in the Philippines in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan.

According to the company’s blog, two of Digital Globe’s satellites on Sunday collected images of a 3,200-square-kilometer area in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea where the plane may have disappeared. The company has since expanded its search area as Malaysian authorities widen their search.

The story about DigitalGlobe’s involvement in the search was first reported in the Denver Post.

The Longmont-based earth-imagery company deployed its FirstLook service on Sunday, directing two of its five satellites to snap photos of the area in the Gulf of Thailand, where investigators suspected the plane may have crashed, and then activated its crowdsourcing platform, Tomnod, on Monday afternoon.

Flight MH370, with 239 people on board, lost communication while on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. The missing plane continued to perplex investigators from around the globe three days later.

“If there is something to see on the surface (of the water), we will see it. But the question is if we are looking in the right area,” said Luke Barrington, DigitalGlobe’s senior manager of geospatial big data.

As each new theory led to a new dead end, the company recalibrated its action plan based on the Malaysian government’s new area of focus, north and east of oil slicks reported soon after the plane went missing.

DigitalGlobe activates FirstLook — used by emergency-response agencies in natural disasters, manmade crises and human interest scenarios — about twice a week, while Tomnod is used more selectively and for different reasons, Barrington said.

“We try to use the crowd wisely and not tire them out,” he said. “The story here is much more about the search than it is about the response. This whole feeling of not knowing, the lack of information or ability to do anything, we have seen time and again, is why people want to get involved.”

Within the first hour Monday afternoon, the Tomnod map had 60,000 page views with more than a thousand tags. Ten minutes later, that was up to nearly 2,000.

Barrington said that the crowd actually directed the company on this particular crisis, asking for them to deploy Tomnod.

“The people who come to Tomnod are very motivated to solve problems,” Barrington said. “I would say we will have up to 10,000 contributors on this one.”

DigitalGlobe is not the only earth-imagery company capable of delivering high-resolution images, but is arguably the U.S. industry leader.

“There are an awful lot of assets up in orbit,” said Marco Caceres, senior space analyst at The Teal Group. “There’s dozens of earth observation satellites and all of them are very, very capable. If they are taking images, then there’s no lack of imagery. And if you haven’t been able to spot something by now, then I don’t know. It has been three days.”

Viewers can review images at Tomnod.com and mark areas that should be reviewed.

“This is a real needle in the hack stack problem. Except the haystack is in the middle of the ocean,” Luke Barrington of DigitalGlobe told KMGH. “We’ll ask you to mark anything that looks interesting, any signs of wreckage or life rafts.

Thousands of people are already scanning the images, Barrington said.

The technology has been used to track damage from disasters, including the Moore, Okla. tornado. The technology was also credit with helping locate the remains of two missing hikers in Peru.

DigitalGlobe (NYSE: DGI) has launched a program with its Tomnod crowdsourcing platform to help in the search of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 jetliner that went missing on Saturday.

The FirstLook subscription service works to compate pre- and post-event satellite imagery for emergency management functions, the company said Monday.

Two DigitalGlobe satellites have collected images of the search area, which includes the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea.

Volunteer Tomnod users then analyze the images for clues to the possible location of the missing aircraft.

Acquired by DigitalGlobe in 2013, Tomnod has previously helped response and recovery activities in the aftermath of natural and man-made disasters such as Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.",

http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/missing-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-satellite-firm-digitalglobe-crowdsources-search-plane-1439716,business,"As the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 remains untraceable even four days after it went missing, the US-based satellite imaging firm DigitalGlobe has crowdsourced search for the jet.

The Colorado satellite imaging company's initiative will allow the public to analyse high-resolution images to look for any sign of the missing plane, a move which may prove highly crucial in finding the passenger jet.

DigitalGlobe, which owns and operates five private satellites, will provide images taken from positions that are nearly 400 miles above earth. The pictures of the region will be available to users for free at the website Tomnod.

The public can scan the images and tag suspicious regions for any debris.

""For people who aren't able to drive a boat through the Pacific Ocean to get to the Malaysian peninsula, or who can't fly airplanes to look there, this is a way that they can contribute and try to help out,"" Luke Barrington, senior manager of Geospatial Big Data for DigitalGlobe, told ABC News.

The aim of the initiative, known as crowdsourcing, is to have as many eyes on the region as possible increasing the probability of acquiring clues.

Barrington adds: ""Anyone can click on the link and begin searching the images, tagging anything that looks suspicious. Each pixel on a computer screen represents 0.5m on the ocean's surface. We'll say, 'here are our 10 top suspicious or interesting locations'. Is it really an aircraft wing that's been chopped in half or is this some other debris floating on the ocean?""

""We may not be 100 percent sure, but if this is where I had to go pick a location to go looking for needles in this big haystack, this is where I'd start.""

On previous occasions, images from the same company, whose clients include the US government and others across the world, had helped in disasters like floods and typhoons, and to locate missing hikers.",
