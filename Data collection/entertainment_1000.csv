http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/zimmerman-signs-autographs-gun-show,entertainment,"A last-minute venue change didn’t stop George Zimmerman from greeting supporters over the weekend at a Florida gun show.

The 30-year-old shook hands and signed his autograph on photos of himself posing with his dog at the New Orlando Gun Show.

Organizers of the event invited “George Z” as a featured guest, a move that sparked outrage among area residents.

“We all know that our decision to support Mr. Zimmerman has generated some controversy and we expected that,” the Arms Room said Monday in a statement posted to its Facebook page.

The original venue space for the event pulled out of participating Thursday after learning about Zimmerman’s appearance, according to NBC’s Orlando affiliate WESH TV.

“They told us they canceled for community pressure,” said show organizer Mike Piwowarski. He said the venue received phone calls and backlash from residents who said they did not want Zimmerman there.

Piwowarski, who supported Zimmerman throughout his trial, told the NBC station he plans to sue the venue for an estimated $300,000 in lost gun sales because he had to use a smaller space.

Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder in July in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager. A civil rights investigation is being pursued by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Meanwhile Zimmerman has been keeping busy trying to sell own paintings. He was also scheduled to appear in a “celebrity” boxing match for charity, but the event was cancelled over Zimmerman’s controversial participation.",

Video of Zimmerman signing autographs:

According to The New York Daily News:

Only a few handfuls of people showed up Saturday to meet a Florida gun show’s special guest of dishonor — George Zimmerman. Over the course of six hours, fewer than 20 people at the New Orlando Gun Show asked for a free autograph or photo with Trayvon Martin’s reclusive killer, who was hanging out in a rear office of The Arms Room gun store in Orlando. A sign directs people to the Zimmerman meet-and-greet, where fewer than 20 people asked for an autograph or photo over the course of six hours. One couple who met the former neighborhood watchman and wanna-be cop, who gave their names as Melissa and Matt, said they were the only people waiting in line to meet him. …. “He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said Melissa. “It was pretty weird to meet him in person — and wow, he has gained a lot of weight!”

Zimmerman has been doing everything that he can think of to build on the infamy that he gained from killing Trayvon Martin. Public outrage forced the cancelation of the celebrity boxing match that Zimmerman was scheduled to participate in. Almost no one showed up at his autograph signing. The message being sent is clear. Society is not going to let George Zimmerman build a career out of being famous for killing an unarmed teenager.

Most people if they were involved in an incident where they took the life of another human being would have the decency to express remorse. Most people would keep a low profile. Only the most sociopathic of individuals would look to take advantage of their notoriety. George Zimmerman is a killer without a conscience. He isn’t content with beating a murder charge.

Zimmerman expects to be treated like a hero. He is desperately trying to cash in on the innocent life that he took. The good news is that America isn’t going to give George Zimmerman the wealth and fame that he so desperately craves.

George Zimmerman wants to be praised and worshipped so badly that he was supposed to be a paying vendor at the gun show. He was going to give away autographs because according to the show’s organizer, he wanted to do an event with less negativity around him.

What a fitting blow to this killer’s ego that so few people want his autograph.

Zimmerman is not a hero, or a victim, he is a cold blooded killer who deserves every failure that comes his way.",

A Florida gun show had a well-known figure signing autographs on Saturday: George Zimmerman.The presence of Zimmerman, who was acquitted in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, forced the New Orlando Gun Show to switch venues at the last minute. Organizers said the original location canceled two days before the show because of a community backlash.In a paired-down version of the show at the Arms Room, a gun store in Orlando, Zimmerman shook hands and signed autographs for about 200 customers.Zimmerman told My Fox Orlando that he is in constant fear for his safety and always wears a bulletproof vest and carries a gun.A Fox reporter questioned his presence at the high-profile event, his first announced public appearance since his trial ended last July.""The Arms Room family has gone through a tremendous amount of work to secure the location,"" Zimmerman said. ""Of course I always stay cognizant of the fact that there are threats. The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn't pass up.""In the wide-ranging interview, Zimmerman said he is homeless — he hops from hotel to hotel. He also suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, and recently sold a painting of an American flag for $100,000. He recently finished another painting, this one of Florida State Attorney Angela Corey, who argued he should be convicted during his trial.""I learned through the first few paintings [that] it was a therapeutic release for me,"" Zimmerman said.When asked why he chose to paint a picture of Corey, he replied: ""Why not? ... It's just an expression, that's all my paintings are. Same way with the flag…. Just an expression of my feelings.""As for why he is always armed, Zimmerman said it’s not necessarily for his safety.""It’s not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me,"" he said. ""I can be around my family and something might happen to them. There's children around me, etc. Those threats…. I have to be able to defend myself like any American.""Fox also asked Zimmerman about a celebrity boxing match in which he was scheduled to appear. Zimmerman said it was supposed to benefit a local animal shelter, but the promoter hyped up the event — and his presence — so much that it got out of control.The event was eventually canceled.""It was a small venue, and it was giving me the opportunity to provide them with much-needed funds,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it turned into something that it was never intended to be. It was supposed to be a friendly charity event to raise money for a local dog shelter.""Zimmerman would not comment on the legal troubles he’s faced since the trial, which include traffic stops in Florida and Texas along with two domestic violence cases.",

According to The New York Daily News, only 20 people sought his autograph during the 6-hour period he was there. (Fox 35 reported that it was closer to 200 people.) Among the small group were couple Melissa and Matt (they did not give a last name) who received a signed photo of Zimmerman, which they will likely display proudly on some wall in their piece of shit, racist home.

In an interview with Fox 35's Valerie Boey, Zimmerman said he is always worried about his safety when in public, but couldn't miss the opportunity to mingle with his supporters face-to-face:

Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""You have said you still walk around armed, why is that?"" George Zimmerman: ""I walk around armed; I walk around with a bullet proof vest; it's not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me. I can be around my family and something might happen to them. There's children around me, etc. Those threats… I have to be able to defend myself like any American. Fox 35's Valerie Boey: ""Do you think it's appropriate to be here, some may say it's antagonistic?"" George Zimmerman: ""I don't worry about people that say it's antagonistic. To be honest with you, like I said, the importance was support the people that supported me.""

Zimmerman greeted people and autographed photos of him posing with his dog. He appeared at a scaled-down version of the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store on East Colonial Drive.

The show was originally set to be held at the Majestic on John Young Parkway, but organizers said the venue canceled late Thursday after getting negative feedback about Zimmerman’s planned appearance.

“They told us they canceled for community pressure,” said Mike Piwowarski, a show organizer. “They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”

http://www.guns.com/2014/03/10/gun-show-switches-venues-george-zimmerman-controversy/,entertainment,"A Florida gun dealer was forced to switch the site of a scheduled gun show in Orlando after the venue manager learned that George Zimmerman would be attending.

The Arms Room in Orlando last weekend relocated the New Orlando Gun Show from its planned site at the Majestic Event Center, to its own showroom after the venue canceled the booking over Zimmerman’s planned attendance at the show.

“We were their first trade show, but when it came out that George was going to be making an appearance, they canceled,” Mike Piwowarski, owner of the Arms Room and the show’s organizer told Guns.com.

Zimmerman was to be a paying vendor at the show and was giving out free autographs and posing for photographs in a ‘meet and greet’ type of environment.

The controversial figure’s intent, according to Piwowarski, was to be able to attend an event where he would be freer to be himself, where there would be less negativity than he has encountered in other settings.

This comes on the heels of Zimmerman’s recent visit to local gunmaker Kel-Tec, getting arrested for domestic abuse, his forays into therapeutic art and failing to organize a celebrity boxing match.

The Majestic pulled the plug on the gun show’s location after it learned of Zimmerman’s planned appearance.

Majestic’s General Manager, Vikash Mahadeowrite, told the MailOnline that, “It was very detrimental to Majestic’s image as a local business for Arms Room to post on Twitter saying that George Zimmerman would be a guest of honor without confirming that with Majestic and without getting prior approval from Majestic management.”

Piwowarski took exception to the statement from Mahadeowrite, noting that the store doesn’t even have a twitter account.

After the cancellation from the Majestic, the event scaled down and hurriedly moved to the Arms Room’s retail location on East Colonial Drive.

“I’m a huge gun guy, huge Second Amendment guy,” Piwowarski said, “And this really didn’t start off that way. It’s about somebody telling George he couldn’t be there. We’re not going to be told we can’t have him or have someone tell us he can’t be here.”

At the smaller show this weekend Zimmerman conducted his meet and greet where he handed out autographed pictures of him and his dog relaxing on a beachfront. Except for taking a break to go for a ride in the store’s 5-ton truck, he stayed on site with his girlfriend Samantha Scheibe.

Piwowarski told Guns.com that over 200 came for the event Saturday and another 100 on Sunday. Contrary to threats made of protests and even of the Black Panthers appearing at the event, “We had zero troublemakers show up.”

“He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” recounted one event attendee that met Zimmerman.

Piwowarski, citing the last minute change in venue caused by the Majestic, plans to sue the center for $300,000 in lost gun sales.

“It was a good event,” Piwowarski told Guns.com in reference to the Majestic, “just not a good event center.”",

Will you excuse us for one quick sec? We just need to vomit after hearing this latest update on George Zimmerman.

The man who shot and killed unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin was the featured guest at a Central Florida gun show over the weekend.

Fans – he has FANS?! – of the 30-year-old stood their own ground while they LINED UP to meet him and get an autograph!

Bluuuugh├óΓé¼┬ª

Keep in mind, the ONLY reason Zimmerman is a celebrity is because he killed someone. And people actually want a signed photo of this guy?

Why? WHY?! A million times, WHY?!

According to George, this was his way of returning a favor to an Orlando gun store that supported him during his murder trial. He explained:

“The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn├óΓé¼Γäót pass up.├óΓé¼┬¥

What a piece of work.

While we wish this guy would just GO AWAY already, he continues to stay in the headlines. Since hearing his not guilty verdict last year, Zimmerman has had two dropped charges of domestic abuse and agreed to compete in a celebrity boxing match.

Violence on top of violence on top of violence.

You├óΓé¼Γäóre the worst, buddy. Just the worst.

We hope your fans enjoy what they paid for – a picture of a killer with his signature on top.

http://blogs.browardpalmbeach.com/pulp/2014/03/george_zimmerman_signed_autogr.php,entertainment,"George Zimmerman squeezed out the rest of what remains in his 15 minutes of relevancy over the weekend when he showed up to a Florida gun show to pose for pictures and sign autographs.

Zimmerman and his dog were special guests at the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store on Saturday.

The gun show had originally been slated to be held at a bigger venue -- the Majestic banquet hall -- but was forced to move to the gun store after the venue canceled the show late last week.

Apparently people complained to the Majestic that they didn't like the idea of a guy who once killed an unarmed black kid and got away with it appearing at a gun show in their town, or some such thing.

Gun show organizer Mike Piwowarski said he plans on suing the Majestic for what he's calling about $300,000 in lost gun sales.

Having a guy who got away with killing a black teen armed only with a bag of Skittles could have inspired so many people to show up at this thing and buy themselves lots and lots of guns! But, alas, the show was forced to move to a store that sells guns. It's a conspiracy!

Still, Piwowarski knew exactly why the Majestic canceled the show.

""They told us they canceled for community pressure,"" he said. ""They were getting phone calls and backlash and didn't want that kind of person there.""

The main reason Piwowarski invited Zimmerman to his show -- apart from hoping it would kick up gun sales -- was because he was an avid supporter of George's during his time of need.

Piwowarski says he supported Zimmerman during his trial for shooting and killing Trayvon Martin. In return for his support, Zimmerman accepted the invitation to appear at the gun show.

""The Arms Room family has gone through a tremendous amount of work to secure the location,"" Zimmerman told Orlando's Fox 35. ""Of course, I always stay cognizant of the fact that there are threats. The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn't pass up.""

As for the gun show, about 200 people showed up on Saturday, which is below the number of people you would expect to show up to a gun show. Especially in Florida.

Of those 200, only 20 actually asked for his autograph.

So, to recap: The guy who is famous only because he shot and killed an unarmed black teen and got away with it managed to draw only 20 people to ask for his autograph. At a gun show. In Florida.

What a gorgeous day to meet my friends! Thank you all for coming down to show your support I am so fortunate for each and everyone of you! — George Zimmerman (@TherealGeorgeZ) March 9, 2014

That he is in demand and actually shows up at something like this is an outrage.

Last month, Zimmerman granted interviews to CNN, Univision and Fusion Univision to bemoan his life of bulletproof vests and fear that someone will harm him or his family. Throw in his lament about unemployment and homelessness and the pity-party orchestra’s violin section is in full crescendo. Remember, this is the same guy who was reportedly about to get in the boxing ring for a “celebrity” boxing match with the rapper DMX. The gun-show event wasn’t the first time Zimmerman smiled and posed for a photo. Last August, he did that while he toured the Florida factory of the manufacturer of the gun he used to shoot and kill Trayvon with a single bullet to the chest at close range.

This leads to what should be an inevitable question: Who are these people glorifying the killer of an unarmed teenager in one of the most racially polarized incidents in recent history? Why are these autograph hounds going out of their way to shake Zimmerman’s hand? What they could possibly say to him in those few moments is enough to make me fear for humanity’s soul. For if they say to Zimmerman what his most ardent supporters have said to me over the last two years it will offend your sense of decency. At least it should.

George Zimmerman signed autographs at the New Orlando Gun Show. He was the featured guest of The Arms Room, a gun shop that supported him through his trial. Apparently this is his way of giving back. ""The concept of being able to pay them back for what they did for me and seeing my supporters face to face was something I just couldn't pass up,"" Zimmerman told Fox 35.

So how did the giving-back public appearance go? Not quite as well as the planners probably hoped. It kind of makes you wonder, with friends like Zimmerman, does the gun industry really need any enemies?

Apparently the backlash almost forced organizers to cancel Zimmerman's appearance. Instead, they moved it to a smaller venue. And when that happens, you know your honored guest is actually more of a liability. I mean, however you feel about the Trayvon Martin case, I can't imagine very many people consider Zimmerman much of a hero.

The event was supposed to raise funds for a local dog shelter, Zimmerman says. (Wha--??) About 200 people showed up. I guess that means there are 200 people in Florida and its environs who like Zimmerman enough to show up for his autograph. I'm a little worried about those 200 people. I hope they have other, more worthy heroes.

Zimmerman also says he's still carrying a gun and wearing a bullet-proof vest for safety. But not for his own personal safety! He's thinking about the people around him.

I walk around armed; I walk around with a bullet proof vest; it's not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me. I can be around my family and something might happen to them. There's children around me, etc. Those threats… I have to be able to defend myself like any American.

Right, if there's one thing that will protect the children who stand near Zimmerman, it's a bullet-proof vest around Zimmerman's body. There are so many children around Zimmerman, living in fear for their lives. Thank goodness Zimmerman is protecting them. With his bullet-proof vest.

Did I mention he still doesn't understand why people are still so mad at him? ""No I don't, but I'm willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and [have] them realize there's no need to be angry."" Okay, sure George. We should sit down for some coffee and crazy pills and talk about why there's ABSOLUTELY no reason for anyone to be angry with you. Sure.

There's another part in the interview where Zimmerman talks about the portrait of State Attorney Angela Corey. And you know what? I give up. There is too much George Zimmerman in George Zimmerman.

Honestly, we could spend all day talking about the loony/dumb things Zimmerman says. The point is, I have no idea why anyone in the gun industry would want him anywhere near their event. He doesn't make gun ownership look good -- at all. When is he going away, finally?

This time, the beleaguered former volunteer night watchman appeared in a Florida gun show over the weekend as its special guest of honor.

Zimmerman, who complained of wanting normalcy after being acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin, didn’t heed his words after appearing at the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store last Saturday. Zimmerman’s appearance at the gun show was supposed to be a much larger affair but was moved to the smaller Arms Room venue after protests ensued.

WESH-TV has more:

Zimmerman greeted people and autographed photos of him posing with his dog. He appeared at a scaled-down version of the New Orlando Gun Show at the Arms Room store on East Colonial Drive. The show was originally set to be held at the Majestic on John Young Parkway, but organizers said the venue canceled late Thursday after getting negative feedback about Zimmerman’s planned appearance. “They told us they canceled for community pressure,” said Mike Piwowarski, a show organizer. “They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”

Piwowarski added that he intends to sue the Majestic venue after losing $300,000 in gun sales due to his estimates. The New York Daily News also covered the story, speaking with a person in attendance at the gun show who described Zimmerman’s mannerisms.

“He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said the attendee.

To make the event even more bizarre, Samantha Scheibe, Zimmerman’s girlfriend, also appeared at the event with him. As some will recall, Zimmerman allegedly pointed a firearm at Scheibe during an argument last year.

The struggle for Zimmerman charges on.

This time, George Zimmerman was signing autographs at a gun show. Zimmerman is best known for killing Trayvon Martin and then being acquitted.

On Saturday, accompanied by his dog, Zimmerman posed for photos and gave out autographs. Zimmerman’s appearance was controversial even before the event started. Originally planned to take place at the Majestic, the venue cancelled last Thursday in response to negative feedback it received because of Zimmerman’s appearance.

The smaller show was instead held at the Arms Room store.

Zimmerman’s appearance at the gun show was repayment for support during his trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin. According to wesh.com, the event’s organizer, Mike Piwowarski, supported Zimmerman during his trial and now, Zimmerman is returning the favor.

Zimmerman’s only claim to fame is having benefited from a law that is open to outrageous interpretations and then exploiting his position as a controversial character. Can we just forget him already?

The original site of the event, The Majestic, backed out due to ""community pressure,"" New Orlando Gun Show organizer Mike Piwowarski told local reporters.

Zimmerman has doubled down on carrying firearms since being acquitted in the Trayvon Martin shooting. In November 2013, police found 5 guns—including an ""AR-15 type rifle""—and 127 rounds of ammunition when they arrested him for allegedly pointing a gun at girlfriend Samantha Scheibe.

The organizers of the New Orlando Gun Show had to move their event after announcing that Zimmerman would be the guest of honor, but he still showed up to shake hands and help boost gun sales.

The show was held at the Arms Room store in Orlando instead of at the Majestic. “They told us they canceled for community pressure,” show organizer told Mike Piwowarski told WESH. “They were getting phone calls and backlash, and didn’t want that kind of person there.”

The New York Daily News reported that fewer than 20 people got an autograph from Zimmerman during the six hours that he was at the show.

“He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said a woman who only wanted to be identified as Melissa. “It was pretty weird to meet him in person -- and wow, he has gained a lot of weight!”

Samantha Scheibe joined Zimmerman, 30, at the event.

“Come on out and meet George Z! He's here a few more hours. And no matter what you read, there are no protestors, lunatics or other varieties of ass clowns,” the store wrote on Facebook. “And don't forget we have free burgers and dogs!”

George Zimmerman, who killed an unarmed black teenager, was the guest of honor at a Florida gun show this weekend, continuing his campaign to become the ultimate troll.

The show almost didn't happen, as its original venue cancelled when it found out that George Zimmerman would be there. A gun store called the Arms Room bravely stepped in to host it instead. The show organizers plan to sue the original venue for $300,000, or three George Zimmerman paintings.

Zimmerman signed autographs for the kinds of people who think a man who is famous for nothing more than killing an unarmed 17-year-old should be celebrated. It seems there weren't too many of them: the New York Daily News reported ""fewer than 20 people"" waited in line to talk to Zimmerman over the course of six hours. Fox 35 reported that there were about 200.

One of them, ""Melissa"" (who refused to give her last names for some reason), said Zimmerman ""seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him.""

""And wow, he has gained a lot of weight!"" she added.

Zimmerman's girlfriend, who once accused him of pointing a gun at her before dropping the charges, was also there.",

Over the course of six hours, fewer than 20 people at the gun show asked for a free autographed photo of Zimmerman, who was situated in a rear office of The Arms Room gun store in Orlando.

The gun show, originally booked at Orlando’s Majestic Events Center, had been cancelled after word that Zimmerman would appear, however the promoters were able to secure another venue.

One couple who showed up to meet Zimmerman, identified as Melissa and Matt, said they were the only people waiting in line to meet him.

'The New Orlando Gun Show' was cancelled after organizers announced George Zimmerman would be in attendance

Zimmerman was a paying vendor whose attendance did not need to be cleared with the event space's owners, organizers claim



They are planning to sue to recoup losses, and Zimmerman is welcome at any of their future events as long as he is legally able

Organizer Mike Piwowarski, who owns local gun shop The Arms Room, says Zimmerman will make an appearance Saturday at the store



A Florida gun show was cancelled after organizers publicly announced Trayvon Martin killer George Zimmerman would be a guest at the event - but Zimmerman will still make a public appearance.



‘The New Orlando Gun Show,’ scheduled for this weekend at Orlando’s Majestic Events Center, was cancelled Thursday despite more than 100 vendors threatening to take the owners to court if the show did not go on.



Organizer Mike Piwowarski, who also owns a local gun store, told ClickOrlando that the show was cancelled because of the announced Zimmerman appearance, and Zimmerman posted emails to his Twitter account backing up that claim.

The guest of honor: George Zimmerman, pictured with Mike Piwowarski and two other individuals, caused a gun show to be cancelled after he was named the 'featured guest'

‘We've had discussions with The Majestic and they decided to cancel the event because George Zimmerman was making an appearance,’ said Piwowarski.

When contacted by MailOnline, Piwowarski clarified that Zimmerman was to be a paying vendor who wanted to attend for a meet and greet - he would not have charged for any autographs.

Zimmerman's intent was to be able to attend an event where he would be more free to be himself, where there would be less negativity than he has encountered in other settings, according to Piwowarski.

When asked if organizers had considered possible backlash to Zimmerman's attendance, Piwowarski replied 'I’m not sure that we were gauging reaction at all.. it was someone who was legally able to have a table.'

Not allowed: Majestic's owners said in an email posted online by Zimmerman that the gun aficionado is not allowed on their property

Piwowarski was notified of the event's cancellation via email, but the Majestic's owners are not returning any of his messages.

'it was very detrimental to Majestic's image as a local business for Arms Room to post on Twitter saying that George Zimmerman would be a guest of honor without confirming that with Majestic and without getting prior approval from Majestic management,' general manager Vikash Mahadeowrite in an email provided to MailOnline.



Piwowarski was also quick to point out that, per the terms of their contract with the Majestic's owners, they were not required to clear any vendors with management ahead of time.

He also refuted claims the announcement was posted on Twitter and said the backlash was generated by Majestic management's reaction, not by the Arms Room post on Facebook.

A picture posted to the Facebook page for The Arms Room, Piwowarski’s gun shop, shows Zimmerman recently visiting the store with the caption ‘we had a friend stop by recently.’

Comments on the picture ranged from surprise to outrage, and that is what led Majestic’s owners to call off the whole thing, according to the station.

‘The event center asked us to do a few things when they found out Mr. Zimmerman was present; pull down posts, pull down announcement that he was going to be there.,’ Piwowarski recalled during a ClickOrlando interview.

‘We did all of that when they asked us to do it,’ Piwowarski continued. ‘They rescheduled the event. Then they later went on to cancel it again, after we complied with all of their requests.’

The organizers and more than 100 gun vendors had a year-long contract with the Majestic and plan to go to court if the show does not go on as scheduled, Piwowarski told the station.

The show will not go on: The gun show's organizers have confirmed the show has been cancelled and have plans to take the Majestic's owners to court

The show’s cancellation will cost the vendors a combined $100,000, Piwowarski claims, and organizers plan to move forward with a lawsuit to recoup that money.

'The attorneys are down at the courthouse right now,' he said while speaking to MailOnline.

‘Mr Zimmerman will not be permitted on Majestic’s property for the gun show,’ manager Vikash Mahadeo wrote in an email posted online by Zimmerman.

Zimmerman also tweeted ‘another company bowing to threats of being labeled racist’ in response to the show’s cancellation.

Messages left with Majestic’s owner by MailOnline seeking further comment have not yet been returned.

The quarterly gun shows will need to find a new home, Piwowarski explained, and Zimmerman is free to attend and will make an appearance Saturday morning at 10.00am at a mini event at the store featuring a few of the other vendors slated to attend the bigger show.

Sansa Stark, sister of the rebellious Robb Stark and now wife to court plotter Tyrion Lannister, is still inconsolable over the death of her brother and mother.

“Do you know what they did to my brother and my mother?” she asks Tyrion. “I lie awake all night thinking about how they died.”

Meanwhile, Queen Regent Cersei talks with the newly arrived member of the ruling house of Dorn, Oberyn Martell.

“What good is power if you can’t protect the ones you love?” she asks.

“We can avenge them,” Oberyn tells her.

Meanwhile, it looks like aspiring queen Daenerys Targaryen is under attack from outside forces. “I will answer injustice with justice,” she declares.

And wannabe king Stannis Baratheon is getting discouraged, saying, “We’re running out of time. I will not become a page in someone else’s history book.”

And both Jon Snow, a member of the military group the Night’s Watch, and his romantic interest Ygritte, who is one of the wildlings that war with the Night’s Watch, seem troubled over their last encounter, when Jon fled from her and her group of wildlings.

Louis Kahn Mar 10, 2014 10:22 PM EDT

The new trailer for ""Game of Thrones"" Season 4 has been released. The trailer is nicknamed Vengeance and features a series of characters speaking about justice and avenging the deaths of lost loved ones. What are the clues we can gather about the story-lines in Season 4? And who will be going after who?

The trailer begins with Arya Stark relaying a list of characters she harbors a death vendetta against. We already know she harbors a grudge against Cercei and Geoffrey Lanister, but she's now added the names of Tywin, Cercei's father, and the ""Red Woman"" otherwise known as Melisandre. How does her new companion, the Hound, relate to her quest to annihilate his former masters?

We know all of the Stark family is seeking revenge for the brutal scourge of their bloodline acted out in the last three seasons. So few remain, and it seems unlikely there will be any justice for their family's plight. Sansa speaks to Tyrion about being haunted by her family's death. Jon Snow expresses some desire for justice, although it's not made clear whether it will be against the murderers of Robb Stark or attempted mutineers in the army of Mormont.

Daenarys Targeres still wants justice for the great outrage of her family members exile after their father was dethroned. As she is of the original bloodline that sat on the iron throne, she is thirstily building a more and more impressive army to take over Westeros. Appatrently, she also has a jumbo-sized dragon now. But besides all that, there is a clip where a man talks to her about repaying injustice with mercy, intercut with scenes of the siege of a city. What is the specific injustice they are talking about?

The Red Viper is a new character in this season and makes appearance here alongside Cercei. He himself talks about vengeance to her. He is also seen fighting in an arena. It appears that he has aligned himself with the Lannisters fully. But what are his motives and what does he hope to achieve? Fans of the book say that it will be hard to know what the reasons behind his actions are and what he will wind up doing next.

With each new season four trailer, April and Game of Thrones feels further away. Luckily for us, it’s actually the opposite. With less than a month until the season premiere, HBO has released another trailer and this one is full of the character’s darkest fears and regrets.

For Ygritte that means letting Jon go, for Cersei it’s not being able to protect those she loves and for Dany it is the confession that being the Mother of Dragons alone is not enough to win her the Iron Throne. Each scene teases a provocative story to come. Tyrion steals the whole trailer with one line though: “We musn’t disappoint father.”

Sansa Stark is also seen emotionally recollecting the events the Red Wedding in which her mother and brother were killed.

Dubbed “secrets,” the trailer promises vengeance, action, and some seriously larger dragons.

Revenge is on the mind of the Starks after the events of the red wedding in the penultimate episode of Season 3. Cersei knows this and senses everyone is ready to strike at the Lannisters, and Tywin advises his daughter that no one outside the family circle can be trusted.

Sansa Stark gives King Joffrey the evil eye and admits that she lays awake at night, thinking about how her mother and brother were done in. What else can be possibly go through? Or perhaps, what can she do to strike back at the Lannisters and get the heck out of King’s Landing.

Oberyn Martell drops his own little line about vengeance to Cersei, and if Cersei is wise, she would take the advice of her father and keep Martell at a distance.

We also get a new look at Daenerys Targaryen’s three dragons that are noticeably larger than when we last saw them. They’re playing in a field while their proud mother (of dragons) looks on.

Yes, now that HBO has wound up its surprise hit and cultural phenomenon True Detective, another HBO hit series and cultural phenomenon steps into the Sunday night spotlight. But before the April 6 premiere of Game of Thrones Season Four, HBO has unleashed another teaser to get fans all worked up.

This Game of Thrones Season Four trailer, the third official preview for the new season, hit YouTube Sunday night and had already registered over 900,000 views by Monday.

The trailer, titled “Secrets,” packs a startling amount of Game of Thrones action into its 92 second running time.

Just a few of the highlights:

Cersei Lannister wonders, “What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?” Good question. But it raises another question. Who has the scheming Cersei been unable to protect? Up until now, she’s been someone that other characters needed protection from.

Tywin Lannister is sitting on the Iron Throne. What’s that all about? The Lannister patriarch always functioned best as the power behind the throne and never showed any desire to hold the title of king. We knew that the wretched little weasel Joffrey never really held any significant power, beyond the power to chop off a few heads and torture women to get his rocks off. But is he no longer even a figurehead? Do tell, Tywin?

Daenerys Targaryen has really big dragons. The Game of Thrones trailer wraps up with a shot of one of her pets — or children as the case may be — rising up and spreading its wings. And those are some wings. The kids sure have grown since the last time we saw them.

The Red Viper is here to help. Cersei Lannister is seen in the trailer confiding in this new character, Oberyn Martell. But what is his agenda? From the trailer, it appears that he’s taking the Lannister side, or at least Cersei’s. But things are rarely as they seem in Game of Thrones.

With the season premiere now under a month away, HBO has released another new Game of Thrones season 4 trailer to inflame the fannish passions – and boy, were they ever enflamed.

Two other full-length trailers have been released in January and February, setting the scene for the epic conflicts that are certain to come in Game of Thrones season 4. The newest trailer aired just before the blood-curdling finale of the freshman mystery series True Detective.

The new Game of Thrones season 4 trailer focuses on loss, and the consequences that echo with the living. Though the Stark family is certainly at the forefront of this suffering (many thanks to the Boltons and Freys!), it doesn’t look like any major house will escape the dark hand of punishment by the season’s end.

As readers of the Song of Ice and Fire series by George RR Martin will know, the new Game of Thrones season 4 trailer focuses on the events of the second half of A Storm of Swords, the third book in the ongoing fantasy saga.

The official synopsis for the new season, recently released by HBO, promises vibrant new characters, struggles for families who appear triumphant, and unexpected victories for the vanquished. And as always, danger looms in the icy threat of White Walkers to the north – and now grows in the fiery form of dragons in the distant east.

The summary for the first episode of Game of Thrones season 4, titled “Two Swords,” avoids the mention of weapons while implying ample treachery.

Tyrion welcomes a guest to King’s Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow finds himself unwelcome. Dany is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya runs into an old friend.

Still, by Game of Thrones standards, the synopsis sounds almost cheerful. We are accordingly suspicious.

http://www.slashfilm.com/game-of-thrones-season-4-trailer/,entertainment,"Even as HBO viewers the world over try to recover from last night’s True Detective finale, the network would like to remind you that there’s another acclaimed, buzzworthy HBO drama coming back up on the horizon. The new Game of Thrones Season 4 trailer opens on a fairly melancholy tone, as Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) bitterly recounts the horrors that have been visited upon her and her family.

Unfortunately for her but fortunately for us, the rest of the promo — along with some newly released plot synopses — suggest that Westeros’ troubles are far from over. Watch the Game of Thrones Season 4 trailer and get some new plot details after the jump.

First, here’s the promo, which features some juicy new footage.

And here’s the synopsis for the season as a whole (via Winter Is Coming).

Encouraged by the Red Wedding slaughter in the Riverlands that wiped out many of their Stark nemeses, the Lannisters’ hold on the Iron Throne remains intact … but can they survive their own egos, as well as new and ongoing threats from the south, north and east? While an unbowed Stannis Baratheon continues to rebuild his army in Dragonstone, a more immediate danger comes from the south, as Oberyn Martell, the Lannister-loathing “Red Viper of Dorne,” arrives at King’s Landing to attend Joffrey’s wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and perhaps act on an ulterior agenda. In the north, a depleted Night’s Watch seems overmatched against the inexorable Wall advances of Mance Rayder’s army of wildlings, which in turn is being trailed by an even more formidable foe: the undead White Walkers. As if that weren’t enough, Daenerys Targaryen, accompanied by her menacing trio of dragons and army of Unsullied, is poised to liberate Meereen, the largest city in Slaver’s Bay, which could ultimately provide her with enough ships to sail to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne.

HBO has also released shorter synopses for the first four episodes:

Episode #31: “Two Swords”

Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 6 (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET/PT)

Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King’s Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) finds himself unwelcome. Dany (Emilia Clarke) is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya (Maisie Williams) runs into an old friend.

Written by David Benioff & D. B. Weiss; directed by D. B. Weiss. Episode #32: “The Lion and the Rose”

Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 13 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)

Tyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand. Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery (Natalie Dormer) host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) loses patience with Davos (Liam Cunningham). Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) finds a purpose for his pet. North of the Wall, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) sees where they must go.

Written by George R.R. Martin; directed by Alex Graves. Episode #33: “Breaker of Chains”

Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 20 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)

Tyrion ponders his options. Tywin (Charles Dance) extends an olive branch. Sam (John Bradley) realizes Castle Black isn’t safe, and Jon proposes a bold plan. The Hound (Rory McCann) teaches Arya the way things are. Dany chooses her champion.

Written by David Benioff & D. B. Weiss; directed by Alex Graves. Episode #34: “Oathkeeper”

Debut: SUNDAY, APRIL 27 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)

Dany balances justice and mercy. Jaime tasks Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) with his honor. Jon secures volunteers while Bran, Jojen (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Meera (Ellie Kendrick) and Hodor (Kristian Nairn) stumble on shelter.

Written by Bryan Cogman; directed by Michelle MacLaren.

Let’s all pause a moment to appreciate HBO’s knack for understatement. “Joffrey and Margaery host a breakfast” sounds like the most boring plotline in the world, but this being Game of Thrones you know there’s going to be crazy amounts of drama (and possibly even some bloodshed) involved.

Game of Thrones Season 4 premieres April 6.",
http://www.latinpost.com/articles/8638/20140310/game-thrones-season-4-start-date-premiere-release-new-trailer.htm,entertainment,"The anticipation for Game of Thrones' fourth season just keeps building. With the premiere date less than a month away, HBO has decided to tease fans even further with the release of a third trailer.

The new promo, titled ""Secrets,"" opens up with a grief stricken Sansa Stark, sharing her woes about The Red Wedding.

""Do you know what they did to my mother and my brother?"" she says to future husband, Tyrion. ""I lie awake all night thinking about how they died.""

Viewers are then treated to a scene of new character, Oberyn Martell, seemingly plotting something with the calculating Cersei.

""What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?"" Cersei asks.

""We can avenge them,"" Martell replies.

There is also a great scene of Tywin sitting on the Iron Throne. ""We mustn't disappoint father,"" says Tyrion as he looks on bitterly.

Daenerys, mother of dragons, manages to steal most of the spotlight. Her dragons have clearly grown, and so has Dany's drive to take the Iron Throne.

""Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy,"" Ser Barristan Selmy advises her.

""I will answer injustice with justice,"" Daenerys replies resolutely.

As a further tease, HBO has also released summaries for the first four episodes of season 4.

Episode 1, ""The Two Swords"":

""Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King's Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) finds himself unwelcome. Dany (Emilia Clarke) is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya (Maisie Williams) runs into an old friend.""

Episode 2, ""The Lion and the Rose"":

""Tyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand. Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery (Natalie Dormer) host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) loses patience with Davos (Liam Cunningham). Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) finds a purpose for his pet. North of the Wall, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) sees where they must go.""

Episode 3, ""Breaker of Chains"":

""Tyrion ponders his options. Tywin (Charles Dance) extends an olive branch. Sam (John Bradley) realizes Castle Black isn't safe, and Jon proposes a bold plan. The Hound (Rory McCann) teaches Arya the way things are. Dany chooses her champion.""

Episode 4, ""Oathkeeper"":

Just a few months after the “Red Wedding” fans now can expect more death and destruction with the new season of “Game of Thrones,” set to premiere this Spring.



In the latest trailer, named “Secrets,” there are a lot of teasers and insights to be shared from the first episode. The trailer is a bit of a clip-show, with Sansa Stark and Tyrion Lannister sharing a conversation regarding moments of last year’s season. “I lie awake all night thinking about how they died,” she says, as viewers are forced to relive the horrific demise of the Stark family.



With the tragedy behind us, a new set of dangers and achievements await for the remaining players. Dragons are getting bigger, the air is getting colder and the veracity of the remaining families is growing more and more apparent with each new trailer the series releases. All of this tension is prepping for the show’s season premiere, set for April 6, 2014.",

Who is ready to see the arrival of more awesomeness on HBO? Sunday, April 6 is not so far away anymore, and that is when the latest season of “Game of Thrones” shall arrive for your viewing pleasure.

So just what will unfold across Westeros and beyond this time around? If you’ve seen some of the trailers that are out there already, then odds are, you already have a pretty good idea. There will be violence, there will be destruction, and above all, there will be reasons to stand up and celebrate so long as you love the stakes being raised to another level.

For us, the winner of the “most intriguing moment” from the trailer comes just after the midway point, mostly because that is where you get a quick glimpse of Tywin Lannister sitting on the Iron Throne. What does this really mean? Maybe this is a dream sequence, but we cannot imagine someone with no ties at all to the Baratheon family being particularly embraced by most of the subjects of King’s Landing. At least the general sentiment here is that Tywin is in control, and that much is very much true. Joffrey may have his moments of defiance, but as a whole he is just another puppet to the kingdom.

While there are times that we wish there was a little more light and shade in the Danaerys storyline, at least you know from this that her dragons are no longer the small, cute creatures that they once were. Instead, they are getting closer to becoming actual dragons, and that is a tremendous sight to see.

Start counting down the days; after all, it’s really only going to be a matter of time before HBO releases another trailer for this season, and gives us yet another reason to start getting excited.

http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/03/10/game-of-thrones-new-trailer-season-4-spoilers/,entertainment,"We’re now only weeks away from the April 6 premiere of Season 4 of ‘Game of Thrones’ — and HBO’s latest trailer is its most tantalizing offering yet. From the debut of the mysterious new character Oberyn Martell to some pretty gigantic dragons, check out all of the heart-pumping action below!

Game of Thrones is always thrilling, but the show’s latest trailer promises a world of hell breaking loose come April 6. Jon Snow (Kit Harington) isn’t exaggerating when he says that the entire world fell apart during his time north of The Wall — and from the looks of things, it won’t be glued back together anytime soon.

‘Game Of Thrones’: New Trailer Revealed

Westeros — particularly King’s Landing — is a giant pressure cooker right now, and this latest trailer makes it clear that the boiling point is well on its way.

“Do you know what they did to my brother?” the still-captive Sansa (Sophie Turner) asks an understandably guilty-looking Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) at the beginning of the trailer. “I lie awake all night thinking about how they died.”

Sansa’s family was ripped to shreds at the end of Season 3 — and her sister Arya (Maisie Williams) is still surveying the wreckage with The Hound (Rory McCann) when things pick up — but at least the Lannisters are having some issues, too. All Tyrell distrust aside, the reigning family will experience a whole new level of threat when newcomer Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal) shows up with a pretty wicked score to settle.

And there’s also the permanently treacherous Littlefinger, who shows up in the trailer with this gem:

“Always keep your foes confused,” he says. “If they don’t know who you are or what you want, they can’t know what you plan to do next.”

Ooh, I wonder what he’s talking about! (Fellow book readers beware — spoiler-y comments WILL be deleted!)

Of course, this being Game of Thrones, the show’s de facto star Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) also appears in the trailer — with some seriously ginormous dragons and a giant chip on her shoulder when it comes to her status as a leader.

“I will answer injustice with justice,” she growls at her companion Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen), when he dares to suggest some leniency.

Saucy!

Game of Thrones premieres Sunday, April 6 on HBO. In the meantime, check out the new trailer, freak out accordingly, and leave your thoughts and theories in the comments!

To herald the return, the cable network has released yet another trailer filled with new and epic footage for fans to drool over.

There’s a lot packed in this minute and a half trailer. We see Jon Snow finally learning about what happened to his family, Sansa still grieving and emotional from the Red Wedding (aren’t we all?), Tywin on the throne (had to do a double take on that one!) and Daenerys still on the warpath with lines like ‘I will answer injustice with justice!” The highlight of the trailer, however, has to be seeing how much her three dragon babies, Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal have grown!

One thing we do know for certain: No one is safe on ‘Game of Thrones’!

Check out the trailer below and let us know if you agree that this is the best trailer so far for Season 4:

In the wake of the Red Wedding, how does the North pick up the pieces and with their greatest enemy seemingly crushed, where does that leave the Lannisters. Daenerys Targaryen now has an army but is she ready to take back her homeland. Does Jon Snow turn south to seek revenge or remember his duty along the Wall?

This preview does give us more time with Daenerys Targaryen and her very-grown-up dragons as she battles “injustice.” We also get a glimpse of a conversation between Cersei Lannister and Oberyn Martell.

“What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?” Cersei questions.

Lena Headey, who plays Cersei, did reveal to Vulture that the reunion between her and her brother/lover Jaime Lannister will be a particularly gripping moment this season.

It’s horrendous. It’s kind of crazy. Interesting to film, because we were … she’s in deep pain, and he wants her, because he missed her, and he needs to know she wants him. It’s just a weird, fucked-up moment. It’s quite mad!

Meanwhile, Sansa is haunted by the Red Wedding and Jon Snow’s world has fallen apart. Will he turn back to the Wall or finally seek justice for the Starks?

But the biggest question remains: Will we all last until April 6, when winter finally returns on HBO?

NEW YORK, March 10 (UPI) -- HBO has released a new trailer for the upcoming fourth season of Game of Thrones.

The trailer features a distraught Sansa Stark (Sophia Turner) in King's Landing with Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), a troubled Jon Snow (Kit Harington) still in the company of Ygritte (Rose Leslie) and the wildlings, and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) on the warpath accompanied by her dragons.

The fourth season is roughly based on the second half of the novel A Storm of Swords in George R.R. Martin fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire, and will pick up where the third season left off. The trailer reveals that themes of revenge and justice will dominate this season's plot lines.

According to Entertainment Wise, the network decided to debut the preview just before the finale of Matthew McConaughey's ""True Detective.""

The teaser entitled ""Secrets"" features a bunch of fan favorite characters but opens up to Sansa Stark sitting with her new husband Tyrion Lannister sharing her emotional distress following the massacre of her family.

Sansa tells Tyrion, ""Do you know what they did to my mother and my brother? I lie awake all night thinking about how they died.""

The clip then cuts to Cersei walking through the gardens with a new character, Oberyn Martell, where the two may be possibly forming an alliance for the Lannisters.

She asks the man, ""What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?""

To which he replies, ""We can avenge them.""

Daenerys Targaryen is also seen throughout the promo ruling her new and increasingly large army of former slaves however, it looks like there may be a change in her relationship with her dragons.

When Ser Jorah tells the Khaleesi, ""You're Daenerys. You're the mother of dragons."" She explains, ""I need to be more than that.""

The producers of the show also decided to release the titles of the first four episodes of the new season. In order of debut the titles are ""Two Swords,"" ""The Lion and the Rose,"" ""Breaker of Chains"" and ""Oathkeeper.""

The Starks are dwindling in their numbers, Littlefinger is more devious than ever before, Daenerys Targaryen is being questioned by her most loyal of subjects and the Lannisters appear to be destroying themselves from within.

At least one thing is consistent: The seasons may be changing, bit Jon Snow — the prettiest, poutiest bastard son to ever come out of Winterfell — is still pretty and pouty. Lighten up, Silky Locks! Spring is coming (as is the April 6 premiere date of Game of Thrones).",

Just recently, David Benioff and his team released a dark trailer that surprisingly revealed more information about the upcoming season than we had ever anticipated.

The clip began with a scene between Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) and Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) as she opens up about the death of her family members.

“You know what they did to my brother and my mother,” she said referring to the bloody Red Wedding where Catelyn and Robb were unexpectedly murdered. Ironically, it’s Tyrion’s family who was behind the massacre. Tywin gave Lord Walder Frey his word that if he was to deceive the Starks after breaking bread (guest right) that he would protect the treacherous royal.

“I lie awake all night thinking about how they died,” she continued. Tyrion looked empathetic as he listened to Sansa pour her heart out. But don’t expect Turner’s character to bawl her eyes out during Season 4. According to the “GoT” actress, Sansa will be cracking skulls and taking names in the upcoming season.

“There’s a kind of a big evolution [for Sansa in Season 4],” Turner told Wet Paint about the development of her character. “She begins to kind of manipulate the people who have done wrong to her in her past. She becomes a good powerhouse character but in a very subtle way. It’s really good.”

""I feel like I've been waiting for a moment where I can manipulate the people that have come before me, so it was like I had been waiting for it for so long. It was a release,” Turner said.

But Sansa won’t be the only female character from “Game of Thrones” to be sharpening her sword. According to the promo, Cersei Baratheon (Lena Headey) will also be preparing for vengeance.

“What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?” Cersei says. “We can avenge them,” she’s told.

Jon Snow (Kit Harington) then makes his way into the trailer on horseback.

“All that time I was gone the world’s fallen apart,” he said. He’s right, things have gotten a bit crazy in the world of the Westeros. From undead icemen to territorial dragons, “Game of Thrones” is picking up the pace rapidly when it comes to drama.

“Always keep your foes confused. If they don’t know who you are or what you want they can’t know what you plan to do next,” Little Finger advised in the Season 4 promo.

One of the most exciting scenes in the promo deals with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) who will be attempting to take on another slave city—Meereen. In Episode 1, “Two Swords,” the Mother of Dragons will be attempting take overrun Meereen, which would bring her one step closer to reclaiming the Iron Throne.

“Sometimes it’s better to answer injustice with mercy,” Daenerys is counseled.

“I will answer injustice with justice,” she responds.

It looks like the blond haired beauty will be even a bigger force during Season 4 as she tries to become more than the just the mother of dragons.

Other scenes from the promo include Ygritte getting reprimanded for letting Snow ride off, Cersei locking lips with Oberyn and Bran attempts to survive north of the wall.

""In the books, the Lannisters add one final insult to the late Ned Stark when they melt down his sword 'Ice' and forge two new ones for Jamie and Joffrey. It's likely this ep. focuses on the very different man Jamie has become, especially in contrast to his psychotic nephew son.""

2. Season 4, Episode 2: The Lion and the Rose.

""The lion is the symbol of house Lannister, the rose house Tyrell - so we can assume this is the episode in which Joffrey and Margery tie the knot. Their nuptials have been dubbed 'he purple wedding' by fans, but you'll have to watch events unfold to find out why! ""

3. Season 4, Episode 3: Breaker of Chains.

""'Breaker Of Chains' is yet another moniker for Daenerys Targaryen, so we can assume this ep will be focused on her. What she'll be doing is debatable, as Dany and her pals are some of the characters that most liberties seem to have been taken with in season 4, due to the fact that they're actually not featured that much in the books at this point.""

4. Season 4, Episode 4: Oathkeeper.

""Back to those swords again. Joffrey names his 'Widow Maker'...while Jamie names his, you guessed it, 'Oathkeeper'. In the books he actually gives the sword to Brienne and instructs her to keep her word to Caitlen Stark by seeking out and protecting her remaining children.""",

The last time we had a new trailer for the highly anticipated fourth season of Game of Thrones, it aired on HBO in the US before a then little know series making its debut called True Detective. That has since gone on to be a huge hit as part of Matthew McConaughey’s “McConaissance”, so it seems fitting that a third trailer would air ahead of its season finale.

Secrets

This trailer is titled “Secrets”, and the focus of the teaser does seem to be our favourite characters either discovering or hiding something from those around them.

The preview kicks off with the ever despicable Joffrey unveiling his new sword; a sword which is forged [Minor Spoiler Alert] from “Ice”, the weapon once held by Ned Stark. In the George R.R. Martin books that the series is based on, the Lannisters melt it down in order to forge new blades for Joffrey and his uncle/father, Jamie. Talk about adding insult to injury, especially after they used it to behead the heroic leader of House Stark back in season one! The season premiere of Game of Thrones is actually titled “Two Swords”, so it’s likely that this will be a big focus of the episode.

We're testing a new site: This content is coming soon

Mysterious Red Viper

Following glimpses of Sansa adjusting to her miserable new life as Tyrion’s wife and Arya with her new guardian The Hound, the trailer teases the arrival of the mysterious Red Viper in King’s Landing, before picking up with Jon Stark. Having returned from beyond the wall, it appears as if he quickly learns about the fate of his half-brother and the mess that Westeros currently finds itself in. Of course, Jon has his own problems to deal with as The Wildlings continue to plan their attack against the men of the Night’s Watch.

Watch the throne

“Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy,” says Ser Barristan Selmy before Daenerys replies with the rather ominous, “I will answer injustice with justice.” It is then that we get a glimpse of her huge army (consisting of the slaves of Yunkai), as they attack a city she clearly means to take as part of her plan to return to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne. Of course, Daenery isn’t the only one who has her sights set on taking it, and Stannis Baratheon can be seen still plotting how he will rise to power despite his crushing defeat during one of season three’s best episodes.

Lights, camera, ACTION!

Talking of action, the trailer also emphasises just how much of that we’ll see in the fourth season of Game of Thrones, and after rapid shots of battles taking place all over Westeros, we’re left with the really quite disconcerting image of Tywin Lannister sitting atop the Iron Throne. That spells trouble for Tyrion (who unfortunately doesn’t get an awful lot of the spotlight here, but can seemingly once again be seen imprisoned), although it clearly isn’t worrying Jamie and Cersai as they can be seen wasting no time in reigniting their incestuous relationship.

Did someone order a CGI dragon?

We're testing a new site: This content is coming soon

Perhaps the most notable new snippets of footage however are those which focus on Daenerys’ dragons, and it’s clear that they’ve grown considerably since we last saw them. Fans of the books were concerned that a TV budget wouldn’t be able to ever do them justice, but HBO have clearly gone all out to make them look as real as possible, and their presence in the series moving forwards promises to be one of the most intriguing elements of season four.

Yet again, this is a trailer which has offered up only 90 seconds of footage, but still more than enough to get both the diehard fans of George R.R. Martin’s novels and causal viewers talking. In what might just be the most shocking and violent season of Game of Thrones yet (yes, even more so than the Red Wedding…just wait until the Purple Wedding!), there really are plenty of “Secrets” left to be uncovered.

Game of Thrones' third season featured a whole lot of treachery, back-stabbing, and duplicitous action that gave rise to bloody murder, even by the ultra-popular HBO medieval fantasy/intrigue drama's standards. It's no wonder then that nearly everyone in Westeros is looking for some kind of vengeance, retribution or similar form of payback as season 4 picks up. (Well, unless you're King Joffrey, in which case you're waving around unearned bragging rights about having already won the war for the Iron Throne.)

Of course, Tyrion Lannister has shared a few key words of wisdom on that subject: ""If you want justice, you're come to the wrong place,"" which is a hard lesson that remains to be learned by the remaining Starks, even as events conspire to reveal the true allegiances among King's Landing's residents - meaning that Joffrey could soon get the punishment he deserves, though it won't necessarily be for reasons that have anything to do with moral righteousness.

The list of those still playing the game grows shorter every season, though we still count Peter Dinklage (X-Men: Days of Future Past), Lena Headey (Dredd), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Oblivion), Emilia Clarke (Terminator: Genesis), Kit Harington (Pompeii), and Maisie Williams (Gold) among its contestants.

No one is truly safe on Game of Thrones this season, as even those who don't wind up kicking the bucket can suffer in other ways. For evidence of that, see the mounting emotional trauma that's been inflicted upon Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), or the permanent debilitating physical injuries that Jaime Lannister (Waldau) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) were dealt last season.

Meanwhile, as the latest trailer and past-unveiled previews for season 4 alike have reminded us, there are far greater developments unfolding in the southern and northern portions of the Game of Thrones universe. Dany's habit of conquering every kingdom that crosses her path - coupled with her increasingly large (and uncontrollable) dragons - will eventually make the various machinations at King's Landing seem rather trivial. On the other side of the world, though, there's not just an army of Wildlings ready to storm The Wall, but also a legion of White Walkers lurking out in the bitter cold.

Question is, by the time that winter does finally arrive (figuratively and literally), will there be so many players left standing? If not, well, at least all those invaders from the North and South will have all that lovely countryside to appreciate by themselves - and then fight each other to death while claiming it for themselves, naturally.

While the first four episode synopses gave us a good idea of what's to expect when 'Game of Thrones' season 4 premieres on April 6, the latest trailer for the new season sees poor Sansa Stark lying awake in thought of what happened to her mother and brother, also affording speaking roles for Littlefinger and the Red Viper. Dany's dragons have grown too big to be controlled, as she sets her army on the largest slave-operated city Mereen, while Jon Snow wonders how much has changed since his time with the Wildlings.

Meet Pedro Pascal, aka Oberyn Martell.

The clip is mostly put together to get fans even more amped up for the upcoming season, rather than to reveal any actual plotlines. Daenerys and her dragons are gaining power, while the power struggle between the Lannisters continues (with Tyrion mostly losing). But most fans knew all that already.

For any actual plotlines, the statement that HBO released along with the trailer was much more helpful. Mild spoilers to follow. Major spoilers for those not up to date on season 3. According to the statement, shared by the Guardian, the Lannisters continue their power struggles in the midst of approaching threats from all sides, while Stannis sits safely back at Dragonstone, “rebuilding his army.”

Watch the new trailer, courtesy of HBO - unless you're watching out for spoilers.



The biggest twist this season will come in the face of Oberyn Martell – book fans have been expecting this for an entire season now. Like everyone else in the series, he has complex political ambitions, but is mostly there to mess with the Lannisters, which is always appreciated. Meanwhile Westeros is also threatened from the North – between the wildlings and the White Walkers, this season will have antagonists galore. In short, big things are about to go down.

To make that wait all the more agonising, HBO have released yet another superb trailer for season 4, packed with swordplay, secrets, deception and, of course, dragons.

Here’s the highlights from the latest trailer, as we don our armour (figuratively) in preparation for the return to Westeros…

1. Boltons loom large

Ramsay Bolton (Picture: YouTube)

Sansa’s often been a frustrating character, but with her family brutally murdered at the Red Wedding, she’s got just cause to be a bit upset. And as a shot of Roose Bolton and his Theon-tormenting son Ramsay confirms, evil endures in Westeros while honourable families like the Starks are eliminated.

2. A new ally for Cersei?

Oberyn alongside Cersei (Picture: YouTube)

It’s not novel to see Cersei scheming – Lena Headey could do herself an injury with such frequent scowling – but it’s certainly interesting to see Oberyn Martell conniving alongside her. It makes sense for the prince from Dorne to align with the powerful Lannisters, but who’s Cersei hoping to avenge?

3. Daario 4 Daenerys…

Daario, the swaggering hero (Picture: YouTube)

Nashville’s Michiel Huisman has replaced British actor Ed Skein in the role of mercenary Daario Naharis and he’s clearly being positioned as a swaggering hero. Well, we viewers are fond of Daenerys, so we need to root for any man trying to win her heart. Though it means poor Ser Jorah remains firmly rooted in the friendzone.

MORE: Game of Thrones season 4 trailer promises vengeance and justice

4. Big battles, big budgets

Big scenes await (Picture: YouTube)

Season 2’s climactic Blackwater episode famously cost HBO millions and judging by this thrillingly large shot of Daenerys’ Unsullied firing on a city, the network’s more than happy to pump cash into Game of Thrones. A later aerial shot of a statue above a settlement echoes the Argonath sculptures in The Fellowship of the Ring; showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss have lofty ambitions.

5. Dany’s children get hungry

Grown up dragons (Picture: YouTube)

Well, haven’t they grown? Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal – though their names haven’t actually been used in the show – have tended to behave, unless told otherwise by their ‘mother’. But judging by the savagery the dragons display in the new trailer, Daenerys will soon struggle to keep a leash on her boys. Fiery death from above could be imminent in the Seven Kingdoms.

6. Tywin v Tyrion

The Iron Throne (Picture: YouTube)

‘We mustn’t disappoint father,’ says The Imp, bitterly, as his father mysteriously sits on the Iron Throne. The elder Lannister has always been the power behind his grandson Joffrey’s reign as king, but has he now appointed himself as de facto ruler? And where’s Joffrey?

7. Jon’s regret

Will Jon take a man’s life? (Picture: YouTube)

There’s a genuinely intriguing climax when sweet Samwell Tarly pleads with Jon Snow, only to be met with the reply ‘I’ve done plenty wrong’. The bastard might be referring to his ‘betrayal’ of the Night’s Watch while undercover with the wildlings. Or he could mean his carnal oath-breaking with Ygritte. But a blazing final shot suggests Jon is going to take a man’s life. Will it be a wilding or one of his ‘brothers’ among the watchers on The Wall? The answer could define Jon’s future.",

* WARNING - SERIES 3 SPOILERS *

After the horrific and bloody end to series three, which saw the brutal deaths of Catelyn Stark and her son Robb (as well as quite a few others!) during the infamous Red Wedding, the trailer shows Sansa Stark coming to terms with what happened.

Dragons are the order of the day, though, as we see Daenerys Targaryen sit with her brood – now a lot bigger and more menacing than when we last saw them.

The trailer also shows the sheer scale of her vast army as she declares: ""I will answer injustice with justice.""

And dwarf Tyrion Lannister looks like he's going to clash with his father yet again.

Fighting, vengeance, backstabbing, blood, sex, violence – and that's just the trailer!

A new trailer of ""Game of Thrones"" season 4 was aired on HBO just before the finale season of ""True Detective"" on Sunday and fans are thrilled with what they saw.

The trailer focuses on loss, especially that of the Stark family's, and the consequences of previous actions.

The opening shots of the trailer show Cersei questioning what good power is, if one cannot protect their loved ones. Jon Snow wonders why the world has suddenly fallen apart and Sansa is grieving for her family after the Red Wedding.

Dany is also seen stating her intentions to fight injustice with justice. And, now that her dragons are all grown, she is sure to use them to her advantage. Season 4 will showcase a new side of Dany's, that actress Emilia Clarke described as darker and confident one from the previous three seasons.

Struggles for families that have emerged victorious and unexpected triumphs for the vanquished can be expected when season 4 returns.

Meanwhile, Lena Headey, who plays Cersei in the series, told Vulture that a reunion with Jaime Lannister is on the cards for Cersei.

""It's horrendous. It's kind of crazy. Interesting to film, because we were ... she's in deep pain, and he wants her, because he missed her, and he needs to know she wants him. It's just a weird, fucked-up moment. It's quite mad!"" Headey said.

The plot synopsis of the first four episodes of season 4 has also been released. Check them out below.

Episode 31: ""Two Swords"" - Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King's Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) finds himself unwelcome. Dany (Emilia Clarke) is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya (Maisie Williams) runs into an old friend.

Episode 32: ""The Lion and the Rose"" - Tyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand. Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery (Natalie Dormer) host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) loses patience with Davos (Liam Cunningham). Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) finds a purpose for his pet.

HBO teased its viewers with the latest trailer of the new season of Game of Thrones during the True Detective season finale.

Based on the George R.R. Martin fantasy novel, the season four of the Game of Thrones series will premier on 6 April.

The promo of the HBO fantasy drama begins with Cersei speaking to one of the new character Oberyn Martell, ""What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?""

The new season begins with four of the surviving characters, Cersei, the grieving Sansa, thoughtful Littlefinger and the planner Stannis, to continue the epic journey of treachery and nobility throughout the spectacular landscapes.

The Game of Thrones Season 4 is loosely based on the George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series and the second half of A Storm of Swords.

The summary of the first episode The Two Swords reads,

""Tyrion welcomes a guest to King's Landing. At Castle Black, Jon Snow finds himself unwelcome. Dany is pointed to Meereen, the mother of all slave cities. Arya runs into an old friend.""

The hit fantasy series by HBO will introduce 18 new characters in the new season and promises to bring more drama and adventure.

The fourth season of Game of Thrones is looming like an armour-clanking phalanx, ready to maraud into your social life from 7 April onwards.

The newest trailer for the series launched last night in the US, during the finale of True Detective, and all the usual political power-plays, backstabbing intrigue and massive fantasy battle sequences all seem to be in place – Daenerys is massing her dragons and sounding ultra-tenacious, while Tyrion and Tywin continue their lip-curling fiendishness.

In the very lightly spoilery words of HBO, who released a synopsis of the forthcoming series last week, the season will look a little like this:

""Encouraged by the Red Wedding slaughter in the Riverlands that wiped out many of their Stark nemeses, the Lannisters' hold on the Iron Throne remains intact … but can they survive their own egos, as well as new and ongoing threats from the south, north and east? While an unbowed Stannis Baratheon continues to rebuild his army in Dragonstone, a more immediate danger comes from the south, as Oberyn Martell, the Lannister-loathing 'Red Viper of Dorne' arrives at King's Landing to attend Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and perhaps act on an ulterior agenda. In the north, a depleted Night's Watch seems overmatched against the inexorable Wall advances of Mance Rayder's army of wildlings, which in turn is being trailed by an even more formidable foe: the undead White Walkers. As if that weren't enough, Daenerys Targaryen, accompanied by her menacing trio of dragons and army of Unsullied, is poised to liberate Meereen, the largest city in Slaver's Bay, which could ultimately provide her with enough ships to sail to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne.""

The season premiere is on Sky Atlantic on Monday 7 April at 9pm.",

UNFETTERED violence has been a hallmark of Game of Thrones so far, and that isn’t going to change in season four.

A new trailer (yes, another one) has been released for the upcoming season, and even discounting several million action shots, it suggests the next 10 episodes of HBO’s fantasy drama will be just as backstabby as the last 30.

Daenerys’s dragons are huge. They’ve grown into something resembling young adulthood, which we presume is as moody and dangerous an age for dragons as it is for human kids.

If anything though, the dragons look and sound more merciful than Daenerys herself.

“Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy,” Ser Barristan Selmy says at one point in the trailer.

“I will answer injustice with justice,” Daenerys replies. Rather forcefully.

If Daenerys is ascendant as we enter season four, the Starks are anything but. And doesn’t Sansa know it? The trailer shows her moaning to future husband Tyrion about The Red Wedding.

“Do you know what they did to my brother, and my mother?” she asks. “I lie awake all night, thinking about how they died.”

Obviously, the elder Stark girl won’t be getting any more cheerful.

The rest of the trailer flashes through some interesting moments, including a philosophical/menacing conversation between Cersei and Oberyn Martell, the ever-broody Jon Snow whining about the world falling apart, and an AWESOME shot of Tywin sitting on the iron throne.

There’s also a piece of typically creepy wisdom from Littlefinger.

“Always keep your foes confused,” he says. “If they don’t know who you are or what you want, they can’t know what you plan to do next.”

Hear that, Ned?

http://www.totalfilm.com/news/new-trailer-for-game-of-thrones-season-4-watch-now,entertainment,"A new international trailer has been released for period horror movie The Raven , and itâ€™s stuffed to the brim with grisly, gothic chills.



The film sees John Cusack star as Edgar Allan Poe, the renowned author of macabre horror and detective fiction. When a serial murderer appears to have drawn inspiration from Poeâ€™s stories, Luke Evansâ€™ determined detective enlists the writer to help bring the guilty party to justice.



However, it soon becomes clear that Poe himself is a target, along with his beautiful girlfriend (Alice Eve). Take a look at the new trailer belowâ€¦









Itâ€™s essentially a truncated version of the original US trailer, a more streamlined teaser that gives away a little less plot-wise, but makes plenty of room for the filmâ€™s grislier pleasures.



Its good to see a healthy number of Poe references dotted throughout the trailer, most notably for The Pit And The Pendulum , The Masque Of The Red Death , and of course, The Raven itself. Weâ€™re not quite so sure about casting Poe as a full-on action hero (â€œIâ€™ll send you to hell!â€), but thereâ€™s some nicely knowing humour on display when Evans questions Cusack as to whether many of his stories end in murderâ€¦



The Raven will be released in UK cinemas on 9 March 2012.",

Of course, this is the typical reaction following the final episode of a number of the premium network's shows including Game of Thrones , the one who will soon fill those aforementioned huge shoes. Don't worry, the fourth season will surely satisfy all your viewing needs and make the murder mystery a distant memory. No? Maybe you need to watch the new 'Secrets' spot again?Perhaps, revisiting the Red Wedding will help you forget aboutand remember your hatred for Westeros' 'Yellow King.' Joffrey's snivelling face and stag-antlered crown (he's still a Baratheon in name, if not in blood) also open both of the first two trailers for Season 4, ' Justice ' and ' Vengeance ,' because nothing is as powerful as the hate for that sadistic coward. He probably is 'The Yellow King.' Sorry, I'm getting off track. Back to thepromo its new looks at the upcoming season.To be honest, this was probably the least satisfying trailer of the three so far mostly because of the heavy reliance on characters talking. I'm as big a fan of the show's sharp dialogue as anyone but thepromos work best when they pick a few winning soundbites and pair them, and loads and loads of action, with a piece of music that sets the tone. And, after using Chelsea Wolfe's ""Feral Love"" and The Everlove's (cover of Siouxsie and the Banshees') ""Cities in Dust"" for 'Trailers 1 and 2,' respectively, the 'score' for secrets added nothing. Remember the incredible Season 2 spot with ""Seven Devils"" by Florence + The Machine? That's how you cut a trailer to music.Still, ""Secrets"" did contain a few shots worth mentioning. I like how all the previews keep introducing Pedro Pascal's Oberyn Martell since he's probably the most significant new player in theand this time we get a glimpse of him walking and talking revenge with Cersei. The full scale attacks on Mereen and The Wall also get some screen-time with Dany's army looking to continue her advancement in the Free Cities while Jon is back at Castle Black just in time to battle the Wildlings he 'betrayed.' Oh, and how about the shot of all three grown dragons? The rest of the promo played a bit of catch-up, making sure to show all our favorite characters in their current situations (Jamie re-learning to fight from Bronn will be too rad) as this is likely the last full length trailer before the premiere.The spots are far from the only push that Home Box Office is making for the return of their award-winning fantasy series with and an excellent Valar Morghulis poster campaign as well as a some cool teases from more magical points of view. Can't forget about the three-eyed ravens, dragons and direwolves. I especially like how the 'All Men Must Die' poster made the raven's undercarriage resemble the Iron Throne.

http://digiday.com/platforms/dstilleryes-game-of-thrones/,entertainment,"Digiday’s coverage of SXSW, which runs March 7-11 in Austin, Tex., is sponsored by Dstillery, the pioneer in audience targeting for brands.

There’s a brand installation at South by Southwest so immersive a woman momentarily thought on Friday morning she was going to die in it. Scared that she about to plunge hundreds of feet to her death, she screamed “Oh, my God!” — and started inching back from the abyss that yawned before her.

But in reality there was no abyss: The woman was on an inches-high platform at Austin Music Hall, where HBO has set up a virtual reality experience that transports users to Westeros, the fictional setting of HBO’s hit show “Game of Thrones.” And even if she did trip and fall, Tony Berger, CEO of Relevent, the experiential marketing agency partly responsible for the installation, was there to catch her.

The installation uses the popular Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and tactile cues to give users the sensation that they’re scaling The Wall, a several hundred foot ice fortification that prominently features in the show. The headset’s immersive display changes realistically along with the user’s head movements, allowing users to determine what they want to look at. Meanwhile the floor vibrates to make participants feel like they’re in a squeaky elevator and fans blow cool air to remind them they’re atop a giant block of ice.

Here’s a video of this reporter experiencing the installation.



The installation took three months to create, Berger said, with Relevent working with visual production company Framestore to perfect it. (Framestore also worked on the visuals effects for “Gravity,” for which it won an Oscar.)

When Framestore isn’t winning Oscars, it’s a digital agency, working directly with brands like Beats by Dre to create digital experiences. For Mike Woods, founder of Framestore’s digital department, the installation is both a sign of how far brands have come in terms of their willingness to experiment with digital and the future of immersive storytelling for both advertisers and media companies.

“Advertisers have spent the last year trying to get their websites to be more immersive,” he said. Woods said automotive brands could use this kind of technology to stage virtual test drives while retail brands could show a digital mockups of different home furnishing styles. Media companies will be able to use the Oculus Rift to create media that was previously unthinkable. And while the Oculus Rift is typically viewed as a gaming device, the “Game of Thrones” experience hints that it may open new forms of video entertainment.

The installation also underscored how much more daring agencies and brands have become technology-wise, Woods said. Eight years ago, Woods was creating banner ads. Now he’s making people feel as though they might plummet to their deaths in the fictional land of Westeros.

“The fact that they’re willing to back unprecedented tech work is a big step,” Woods said. “A few years ago, if it hadn’t been done before, they’d be very afraid to put big bucks behind it.”",

USA TODAY

AUSTIN – Few people can claim they ever ascended to the top of the 700-foot-tall Wall of Westeros in a Castle Black elevator and witnessed an attack by the Wildlings – and lived to tell of it.

In what's sure to become one of the more popular draws at SXSW, HBO has set up a nearly 5,000-square-foot exhibition of their hit show Game of Thrones that allows fans to experience the costumes, props, tragedy and magic of the series.

The Austin Music Hall downtown has been transformed into a virtual Westeros, the fictional continent where Game of Thrones takes place. Fans enter the exhibit through black drapes and could peruse costumes worn by characters such as Bran Stark, Hodor, Arya, the Hound and Daenerys Targaryen.

""We wanted to give fans a sense of what went into making the show,"" said Elana Loewenthal, HBO's director of international marketing, who oversaw the creation of the exhibition.

There are original costume sketches for the series, storyboards and props such as a Jaime Lannister's ""golden hand"" and the enormous severed head of the wolf Grey Wind. A glass case displays the various hatchets, daggers and swords used in the show, while volunteers encourage visitors to sit in the coveted Iron Throne for a quick photo opp.

But the centerpiece of the exhibit is the ""Ascend the Wall"" experience, a 90-second virtual immersion into the world of Westeros. Visitors climb into a wooden elevator and slide on an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and a pair of headphones. Suddenly, snowflakes flitter about and the elevator rattles and starts to ascend. The visitor feels the lifelike sensation of being pulled up by the rickety lift to the top of the 700-foot iced Wall, used in the series to keep out Wildlings and other aggressors.

At its apex, the visitor turns and walks out of the elevator and down a snow-covered path to the edge of the Wall and a striking panoramic view. A cold breeze rustles through. Suddenly, a flaming arrow, shot from way down below, whistles nearby. Another one hits the user square in the chest and he tumbles down the face of the wall, just before the experience – mercifully – ends.

The immersive experience combines the latest in interactive technology and computer graphics generated by Framestore, winner of this year's Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for its work on the film Gravity, said Ian Cleary, of Relevent, which oversaw the production. The experience combines 40 different elements – including sound, sights, air blasts and physical movement – to create the immersion effect, he said.

""It's very innovative,"" Cleary said. ""Basically, we're tricking your brain into thinking it's somewhere it's not.""

Terrence O'Brien, a journalist with engadget.com who tried the experience, said it was extremely lifelike, though didn't offer much connection to the show besides the environment. Still, it was nerve-rattling, he said.

""For a guy who's afraid of heights, it was terrifying,"" O'Brien said. ""Pretty realistic.""

Austin is the second U.S. stop for the Game of Thrones exhibit, which spent time in New York City during the Super Bowl earlier this year, followed by a tour in Mexico City, said Janine McGoldrick, an HBO spokeswoman.

After six stints in rehab Lindsay Lohan is ready for a fresh start.

LINDSAY Lohan plans to stay in control and live ""with integrity"", she said on her new documentary series last.

The troubled actress - who has endured a string of legal problems in recent years and been to rehab six times - is determined to make a fresh start and wants to put her problems behind her.

Speaking on her new docu-series 'Lindsay', which debuted in the US last night, she said: ""Living with integrity and in control of my own self - that's the life I want now...

""I'm excited to start this new chapter, so it's going to be good.""

The 'Mean Girls' star was also seen telling programme director Amy Rice that she now has ""inner peace"".

She said: ""I'm in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now. All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don't really affect me anymore.""

The programme also saw Lindsay search for an apartment in New York and left devastated when she found one she liked - but was told it required a $10 million insurance policy.

She exclaimed: ""I can't do that. I'm not Oprah!""

The 27-year-old actress stayed in a hotel while apartment hunting, and after a month in the luxury residence, she admitted she was finding the experience upsetting because she associated it with a ""crazy phase"" in her life.

She said: ""It's the first time I'm really getting a place in New York and it's really chaotic.

""I'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live, how to live out of a hotel, which I did when I was in a crazy phase in my life and that brings up a lot of memories and I hate it. ... And now I'm figuring out everything for myself with things being left up in the air constantly.""

However, she insisted her housing struggle wouldn't send her out of control again.

She added: ""I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober. And I'm dealing with it.""",
http://dailytrojan.com/2014/03/10/reality-shows-shouldnt-exploit-their-subjects/,entertainment,"Much of my identity has been shaped by Lindsay Lohan — or shall I say, the more wholesome Lindsay Lohan.

As a small child, I watched The Parent Trap almost every day until my mother, an onlooker with less exposure than I, could even recite the words. Freaky Friday marked my third-grade existence; I wanted to be just like Anna: in a band and resilient against snobby popular girls. I sported a black choker for months to emulate her style. Of course, the form of Lindsay Lohan that is most embedded in the very fabric of my life is her character in Mean Girls. I quote it an annoyingly frequent amount of times a day and hope that maybe someday I’ll embody as much grace as Cady when she won Spring Fling Queen, breaking off pieces of her tiara for everyone in the crowd.

Nowadays, the Lindsay we are all familiar with is the Lindsay that parties an exorbitant amount, the one that checks in and out of rehab and seems to always miss her various court dates. Her escapades in recent years have infiltrated all media outlets and her actions are sometimes bigger news than breaking international events. She has tried to reinvent her image countless times, and as someone who has followed Lindsay for years and even idolized her at one point, it was increasingly disappointing to see her repeated downfalls. Eventually, her news became tiring, and I just resorted to watching Mean Girls for the 100th time.

On March 9, Oprah Winfrey premiered a reality show on her channel, OWN, documenting Lindsay as she picks up the pieces of her life following her very public battles with substance abuse and the law. Clips from Lindsay show the actress saying she “felt like she’s in a prison” with the camera crew constantly surrounding her and Oprah intervening, telling Lindsay to “cut the bull” for missing work. The series is an extension of the Lindsay we have all been accustomed to in the media, yet it also explains her actions. She is perceived as a party girl, but there is a back story to go along with it. Without sounding too maudlin, this series allows the audience to understand her difficult childhood and the pressures of being a child star.

Though I do commend Oprah for using her immense power to inspire change, I question, in this case, if her influence is used in the right way. Utilizing the documentary as a means of casting light on Lindsay’s flaws isn’t the type of programming one would expect from Oprah. People are curious about Lindsay’s life, and their curiosity generates ratings. Lindsay’s life — successes and failures — is used for capital gain. As a person whose life was put under a microscope, which ultimately was one of the factors that her career was put in jeopardy, Lindsay would not benefit from even more cameras in her life. Furthermore, reality television shows should be taken with a grain of salt, because sometimes the production entails for dramatic set-up.

Technicalities aside, Oprah’s new show does lead me to question why viewers, myself included, are interested in Lindsay’s not-so-shining moments at all. Is it because her life is so chaotic that it’s almost a source of entertainment for people to view it seemingly uncensored? Or is it because we want to support her as an underdog? Either way, discriminating against Lindsay’s troubles invites generalities about her life. Making these matters public allows people to focus on the trivial rather than expending their energy on something more useful.

Lindsay Lohan has had a past that is undoubtedly widely covered by the media. It is also a past that people have widely analyzed. Whether she decides to direct her path toward her Disney hey-day is not up to anyone, nor is it anyone’s business.

But if she were to make another film with the same brilliance as Mean Girls, that would be so fetch.

http://popcrush.com/lindsay-lohan-new-tv-show-episode-1-eye-opening-moments/,entertainment,"Lindsay Lohan's highly anticipated OWN docu-series, 'Lindsay,' premiered its first episode last night, March 9. While the pilot ep wasn't as jaw-droopingly intense as we thought it might be, it definitely set the stage for how the series is going to go. As she says on camera, Lindsay is hoping to show the world her truth, which is exactly what her life is like post-rehab. Read on to find out the most eye-opening moments from the series' inaugural episode.

Lindsay's Devotion to Her Family

""It's comforting to be around my family,"" Lindsay reveals to the camera. ""They're a big part of my recovery."" While Lindsay's home life has been notoriously unstable (her mom Dina is often seen as an enabler and her dad Michael has wreaked havoc on the actress's life), she is close with her mom and three siblings.

""I hate hearing people that I love cry, especially my mom, because it kills me,"" Lindsay reads aloud from a diary she kept while in the Betty Ford clinic in 2012. Soon after, Lindsay gets angry when rehashing the incident that lead to her mom's tears, which was that Dina wasn't allowed to visit her daughter while in rehab. Still, there are happier moments with Lindsay's fam, like when she is beaming with pride (even getting choked up) when her sister Ali models in a fashion show.

Just How Ruthless the Paparazzi Can Be

""Look at my watch,"" one paparazzo proudly shows off to the camera. ""Lindsay paid for it.""

One good shot of the actress can make a paparazzo rich, but it leaves the actress with little privacy and, quite literally, a roadblock to her recovery.

“We’ve been stuck in the [hotel] room all day because there’s like 40 paparazzi outside and I really don’t feel like dealing with them today,” she told the camera, adding that she feels like a ""prisoner all the time"" due to the intense scrutiny. The actress declined to go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting later that evening due to the paparazzi and her belief that it wouldn't be fair to the rest of the group.

Her Experience With Jail and 'The Bling Ring'

In 2008, Lindsay Lohan was a victim of 'The Bling Ring,' the group of wealthy Los Angeles teens who burglarized celebrities' homes, later made famous in the Sofia Coppola film. But while Alexis Neiers, the leader of the Ring, was serving a brief amount of time in jail for her actions, Lindsay was right next to her serving time for her own.

""When I was put into jail,"" Lindsay recalls, ""I was put into solitary, obviously for safety purposes. The girl [Alexis Neiers] I guess was in the same pod next to me, and they released her,"" Lindsay said.

Her Trust Issues

""Once someone promises me something and they break that promise, I lose all trust in them,"" Lindsay says. ""That happened to me when I was a kid, with my dad.""

In the first episode, we see her trust issues shine through when she has a meltdown over a lingerie film shoot she agreed to help out with for a filmmaker friend. When the filmmaker changes the script on her (something they did not agree upon in their initial contract), Lindsay gets visibly upset and storms out of the room, crying and yelling about the incident and the sudden change in plans.

What She Wants to Show Fans

At the beginning of the episode, Oprah asks the starlet what she wants out of filming this documentary. Lindsay responds that she wants people to see her for who she is.

""I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober,"" Lindsay claims at the end of the episode. ""And I'm dealing with it.""

We're rooting for you, Lindsay! Tune in to the second episode of 'Lindsay,' airing next Sunday night, March 16, at 10 PM on OWN.",

http://radaronline.com/exclusives/2014/03/lindsay-lohan-insists-completely-sober/,entertainment,"Lindsay Lohan is telling pals that she is STILL completely sober after she raised eyebrows Sunday night with her confession that it’s hard for her to go to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings because of pesky photographers.

In her self-titled documentary on OWN Sunday night, an antsy Lohan, 27, suddenly decided she had to get an entirely new room in the same hotel where she’d been staying in a New York hotel for 36 days.

Lohan, a source told Radar, is “in a really good place right now… she is doing what has been asked of her by the court in her lying to cops case. She tries to get to AA meetings, but because she is a celebrity, it’s always an issue.”

Earlier in the episode, an assistant had sounded optimistic about a new life for the former Mean Girls‘ star, who is now better known for her arrests than her acting.

“If she screws this up — she knows what’s at stake,” the man said.

An insiders close to Lohan said, “Lindsay would hardly even allow housekeeping in the room to clean. She was afraid someone was going to take pictures and sell it to the tabloids. The level of paranoia with Lindsay is terribly high, sadly.”

During Sunday’s premiere, which is a documentary series about Lohan’s life after getting out of rehab, the actress was shown storming off the set of a lingerie shoot and ranting to her real estate agent.

“My intention is to just be me,” the recovering alcoholic told Oprah Winfrey in starting her new TV journey.

Viewers also saw the drama of Lohan moving back to New York and looking for a new apartment in Soho.

But when Lohan finally found a place she liked, the recovering party girl was convinced her real estate agent, Cash Bernard, wasn’t working hard enough to seal the deal!

In a tense phone conversation with Bernard, Lohan said: “What EXACTLY is it going to take to get the keys?! I hear it in in the tone of your voice, how lackadaisical you are about it.”

After finding out a $10 million liability policy had been put in her lease, Lohan went ballistic, shouting to Bernard over the phone: “They can’t just add that to the lease! How the hell can anyone have that?! I’m not Oprah. I can’t get that!”",

We met Lindsay’s sober coach, Michael Cormier! He’s got a tough job, especially because it seems like Lindsay really doesn’t want to get better. She’d rather just be Lindsay!

She mentioned Alexis Neiers (but not by name)! (BTW – She wishes you the best, babe!)

And explained how the judge was being mean to her, not “helping” her.

Plus, she tearfully warned people NOT to put words in her mouth during her breakdown (above)!

She, also, made sure to remind the world that she’s not Oprah.

Leopards struggle to change their spots, and so do LiLos. Just hours before she was seen telling Oprah Winfrey she is through with partying, Lindsay Lohan pulled a 48 hour bender.

Standard behaviour.

On Sunday night, the former actress, 27, said: “There’s no party that I haven’t gone to, there’s no person that I haven’t hung out with, there’s no situation that I haven’t been exposed to.” And she insisted: “There’s nothing left in having a drink for me.”

But she must have found something to occupy herself at LA’s famous party venue the Chateau Marmont, as I can reveal she was there until 5am on Saturday morning. And something kept her amused enough to go on to a house party.

She can’t be too done with fun times, because she was back partying at the hotel later that evening, too - and she remained there until the early hours of Sunday morning.

[Clearly, it should be pointed out that the hotel has lifted Lindsay’s ban from the place - she was temporarily barred after she failed to pay a £30k bill.]

I’m told: “Lindsay started on Friday night at the cocktail bar at the Beverly Hills hotel, before moving on to the Chateau.

(Image: lindsaylohan/Instagram)

“She was out in the garden until early in the morning, and then the group moved on to a house party in the Hills.

“Literally hours later she was back in party mode at the Chateau again.”

And while she was recovering the next night, the first episode in an eight part documentary following the star aired on OWN.

In it, she skipped an AA meeting because her apartment was surrounded by paps. She admits that booze is her drug of choice, but insists she wants to move past her wild partying lifestyle.

The interview is the first the actress has given since her last spell in rehab in July 2013 - her sixth stint. She is still required to attend therapy sessions to prevent a relapse.

Perhaps they hold them at the Chateau?",

http://www.papermag.com/2014/03/lindsay_lohan_reality_show.php,entertainment,"Last night Oprah's OWN network aired the premiere of Lindsay Lohan's reality show, Lindsay, which documents the troubled star's attempt, fresh out of rehab, to get her career going again and stay sober. Nothing could go wrong when you ad a reality show to the mix, right? Join us below, we as review some highlights from the episode.





<br/><br/>1) Oprah's pre-interviews are intense. Before they film an interview that aired on OWN in August, days after Lohan had been released from rehab, Lindsay tells Oprah that she only wants to come across as herself in the interview. Oprah, smelling the bullshit, tells Lohan ""I'm only interested in what is the truth."" Lohan gulps and nods and then lets Oprah talk her out of going on a potentially sobriety-derailing trip to Europe. It's kind of awesome. Shouldn't this show just Oprah following Lindsay around, tell her not to do things and not breaking eye contact until Lohan agrees?<br/><br/>2) Much is made of the fact that Lindsay <i>does not have an apartment </i>in in New York, and must live for like three weeks in a 5-star hotel until she can find a place with a co-op board that will accept her. At first I was like, ""get. over. it.,"" but it's understandable how disorienting and un-fun living out of a suitcase would feel for a person desperate for stability. Not a good idea. Kind of like doing a reality show fresh out of rehab. <br/><br/>3) Living out of a hotel means that she's living out of suitcases and boxes, with much of the show featuring her sorting through clothes, shoes and jewelry laid out in front of her as now sad reminders of her previous success. When she pulls a <i>Mean Girls</i> t-shirt with <br/>""Fetch"" on the front of it from a box at Dina's house, where most of her belongings are in storage, Dina stares blankly at it. Oh, oh, yes, that's right, <i>Mean Girls</i>. Cute, hon. Even crazy old Dina has moved on. <br/><br/>4) Lindsay's broker is named ""Cash Bernard."" Cash Bernard is, in Lindsay's opinion, not working as hard as he could to get her into an apartment. Cash Bernard is being ""lackadaiscal"" about the whole thing, says Lindsay of Cash Bernard. Cash Bernard.<br/> <br/> <iframe src=""http://www.oprah.com/common/omplayer_embed.html?article_id=48884"" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" scrolling=""no"" width=""640""/></p><p class=""shareTitle""><br/></p> 5) Lohan has trust issues, and herself admits that people are always trying to jerk her around. This makes sense, given who her parents are, but one gets the impression watching Lohan become weepier and more explosive during an argument with a director at a lingerie shoot she had agreed to appear, in only to have her role changed without her knowledge, her only defense mechanism in these situations is to explode and act like a huge, bratty baby.<br/><br/>6) On said lingerie shoot, the grim realities of life as a former child star become plainly obvious. There are depressing one-on-ones with models likely 3 to 4 years younger than Lohan, talking about as her like she's a decades-older old washed-up star who's now a novelty. ""I'm excited to work with Lindsay Lohan,"" says a girl in a bra. ""<i>Parent Trap</i> was my favorite movie growing up."" This is, where the show shines and shows real potential. While there are certainly one or two awkwardly staged opportunities --going to a fashion show to see her model sister, who seems vaguely surprised to see her there, walk the runway, for one -- the show is seemingly more or less candid. No bullshit staged storylines a la <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> or <i>Real Housewives</i> -- it's all about true intentions. This is Oprah country, y'all. <br/><br/>7) And for all of her own trust issues, people, unsurprisingly, don't trust Lindsay Lohan. When Cash Bernard does finally find her an apartment, she must also put down $10 million for an insurance policy. When Lohan is a no-show at <i>The Canyons</i> junket in Venice, director Paul Schraeder describes working with LL as like being ""held hostage by a talented but unpredictable actress."" Nope, nothing could go wrong with this Oprah reality show. Not at all.<br/><br/>8) Constant commercials for Cliffiside Malibu where Lohan did her latest rehab stints adds to the pressure on Lohan to not Totally Screw This Up. The ad's tagline: ""At Cliffisde, you should only have to do this once."" <br/><br/> <iframe src=""http://www.oprah.com/common/omplayer_embed.html?article_id=48882"" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" scrolling=""no"" width=""640""/><p class=""shareTitle""><br/></p><p class=""shareDescription""/> 9) The paparazzi keep her prisoner in her hotel room, unable to go to an AA meeting, and it's pretty dark. She might not be getting work, but Lohan is still worth tons of paparazzi dollars, one photographer standing outside her hotel room flashing a watch at the camera that he brags Lohan paid for. <br/><br/>10) Despite showing flashes of self-awareness, freely talking about her tendency to self-sabotage, she's also totally oblivious at other times.

And then she has her personal assistant scramble to move all of her belongings into a new room in her hotel because she feels like a change of scenery. <br/><br/><p/>",

http://observer.com/2014/03/et-tu-oprah-lindsay-lohan-doc-just-more-exploitative-celebrity-garbage/,entertainment,"Early on in Lindsay, OWN’s four part “docu-series” by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice, we see Oprah sit down with the former Mean Girls actress and ask her what she wants to get out of her experience.

“Just to be,” Lindsay Lohan says. “Just to be honest and open and just…me.” It’s a cringe-worthy moment in a show filled with cringe-worthy moments, made all the more cringe-worthy because you know how bad you are for watching it. But what Oprah says next, to the woman who just came out of rehab and who she just paid $2 million to shoot a documentary about, is even worse.

“Okay, because that’s my intention too,” says Queen O. “My intention is to serve as a path for you to be able to do that. And so if I know that’s what you really want to do, I’m going to call you on it when I feel like you’re really not.”

You see the problem here, right? Asking a celebrity whose public train wreck has led her to a sixth stint in rehab what she wants, or hey, put ANY person on the spot and ask them what they hope to achieve by being interviewed by Oprah, and you’re going to get a lot of nonsensical, pseudo-self-help nonsense answers. No one is going to say “damage control,” or “money,” or “self-promotion.” And yet Lohan’s meaningless response–“Just be?” Aren’t we all “just being” all of the time, whether or not we are on drugs or honest or in The Canyons or have shitty, terrible parents–is immediately validated by Oprah as being exactly the right answer.

In almost every scene of Lindsay, we watch someone validate Ms. Lohan’s addled world-view by agreeing to accept events on her terms. Her drug counselor (who looks exactly like Mike White from Enlightened) lets her stay in her room at the Soho Grand instead of going to AA meetings because there are paparazzi outside. Her personal assistant lets her make iffy arrangements with “friends” who want to use her for a lingerie shoot. The “friends” tolerate Lindsay’s whiny tantrum behavior (which eventually leads to her just leaving the photo shoot, because she doesn’t want to play an intellectual or doesn’t want to have to memorize lines, it’s unclear), because they are succubi hangers-on, just like everyone else in her life.

Lindsay Lohan frequently sounds paranoid as she spouts off all the ways every life interaction makes her feel “used” and “lied to,” but she’s not wrong. Shoving a camera in an addict’s face is one way to speed up bad behavior, and unlike other Oprah endeavors, this feels like it’s angling not for a redemption story, but for a massive meltdown. It’s such a blatant kind of transaction–OWN gets the ratings, Lindsay becomes relevant for half a second–that you almost start to not feel bad about watching it. After all, we watch the Kardashians and don’t feel like we are ruining anyone’s lives, right?

The difference is, and god help me for saying this, but Kim Kardashian is a wise old soul and a savvy businesswoman, at least compared to Lindsay Lohan, who has no filter for keeping the leeches away. If Oprah wanted to let her “just be,” she would do so not by offering massive amounts of cash in exchange for frontside tickets to the drama, but by…you know, letting her be. At no point does anyone ever tell Lindsay Lohan the truth: that the public is interested in her only as far as she can fall, not for how high she can climb. That it’s not in her best interest to publicize her struggle. That Oprah and her drug counselor and her mother don’t want what’s best for her; they want what’s best for them. And that’s for her to fail.

“My family has so much love,” Lindsay Lohan says at one point. “I can’t wait till we get to the point where we don’t need to talk anymore.”

Neither can we.",

http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/lindsay-lohans-own-reality-series-opens-with-693000-viewers/,entertainment,"Lindsay Lohan’s rehab reality series Lindsay on OWN opened in a highly crowded Sunday 10 PM time slot with about 200,000 fewer viewers than caught Lohan’s highly touted sit-down with Oprah Winfrey on OWN last August. That, in turn, had been a substantially smaller audience than some other Oprah-exclusive sit-downs on her cable network. This, just a few days after Lohan’s visit to Jimmy Fallon on NBC’s Tonight show to plug the launch of the OWN series logged a preliminary 3.2/9 household rating, which will likely translate to about 4 million-ish viewers when Nielsen gets them crunched.

Even so, OWN president Erik Logan calls the launch a success, noting Lohan’s opener achieved his network’s highest rating in the Sunday hour in 27 weeks with women 25-54 and that the series launch posted triple-digit gains in key demos versus the time slot’s prior six-week average (+178% in total viewers; +300% in women 25-54; +478% women 18-49), and double-digit gains versus the tim eslot one year ago (+57% in total viewers; +37% women 25-54; +73% women 18-49).

“We had set out to try to attract a different type of viewer and audience to the network and we felt like we did that — especially young women demo which is up by triple digits,” he said, calling the demo “people who normally don’t come here.” “We thought this was a great opportunity for us — we feel great about the young end of the numbers, and the premiere in a time slot we never programmed before on a most competitive night of television.” He said the numbers for Lohan’s post-rehab sit-down with Oprah are “a little apples and oranges” because that interview occurred in a franchise that was two-years established — Oprah’s Next Chapter. “This is programming a brand new time period and not an easy place to go,” he said. The premiere episode of Lindsay will re-air on OWN tonight at 10 PM ET/PT.

Last August, Oprah Winfrey‘s post-rehab interview with troubled star Lohan drew far smaller audience than some other of Oprah’s exclusive sit-downs. The Lohan interview on Oprah’s Next Chapter on Sunday, August 18, averaged 892,000 total viewers at 9 PM, only slightly above the show’s Sunday average (+7%). For comparison, Oprah’s interview with Whitney Houston’s daughter Bobbi Kristina drew 3.5 million viewers and her chat with disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong clocked 3.2 million. For the night, including the 10 PM rebroadcast, the Lohan sit-down averaged 1.8 million viewers.

Last Thursday, La Lohan was a guest on Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to plug the debut of her OWN reality series, though she explained it away as doing all the reality -TV stunts, like making the most chaos of her move to New York, though she said Oprah herself has helped her a lot and that she sometimes does not pick up calls from Oprah just so she’ll have Oprah’s voice recorded on her voicemale. During a Water War with Fallon, when he’d gotten thoroughly drenched and railed “Why is this happening?!” she responded: “Because I have the power of OWN!”",

“We feel really good about [the ratings],” OWN president Erik Logan told TheWrap. “Part of what excited us about this project is that we had the opportunity to diversify the network and expand the brand.”

The cable network’s exec touts the show’s gains in the 10 p.m. Sunday hour over last year in total viewers and several demos: Up 57 percent in total viewers; up 37 percent with key demo W25-54 and up 73 percent in the younger-skewing W18-49.

Although the numbers seem on the low side for the original series, Logan said that the network intended for the show to open the network to new and younger female viewers.

“We feel really good about the goal that we had set out,” Logan said, “which was one, to tell a good story; two, demonstrate the flexibility of our brand under Oprah [Winfrey]; and three, continue to attract new audiences to the network.”

For the younger demo of Women 18-34, “Lindsay” ratings actually ranked third after comparable reality series “Iyanla: Fix My Life” with a .89 and “Life with La Toya” with a .58. “Lindsay” saw an increase in the younger demo in the hour of 241 percent year-over-year.

OWN doesn’t sell ads against Women 18-34, though, like it does for W25-54 and W18-49.

In August 2012, Lohan’s appearance on interview series, “Oprah’s Next Chapter,” earned 892,000 total viewers and a .66 W25-54 rating.

As different show formats and without the presence of Winfrey, Logan said those numbers aren’t comparable.

“It’s really, really hard to compare the two, because Oprah is hosting the show and this is a docu-series around Lindsay Lohan,” Logan said. “Also, that show has a track record of over two years of an audience, this is a premiere of a series that doesn’t have Oprah in it. So, it’s apples and oranges.”",

Lindsay seems to be doing really well: she is clearing her life of clutter, listening to her sobriety coach, and staying away from potential temptations. That being said, there will never not be Mean Girls parallels in Lindsay's life.

Behold, the fetchest moments of Lindsay:

1. Her storage unit is ""I made my parents trade me"" huge. Seriously, is that one singular warehouse? There cannot be more storage units like that in one warehouse.

/strong>

2. She can't help it that she's so popular: ""There's no party I haven't gone to, no person I haven't hung out with,"" says the girl whose Fairy Godmother is Oprah.

3. It may have looked like she was being a bitch, but that's only because she was acting like a bitch: No seriously, though: ""I can't compromise myself and my sobriety by being in that headspace, by being stressed out. I'm here, I'm showing up, I'm sober, I'm dealing with it.""

4. Unlike Regina George, she'd tell someone if she had the ugliest effing skirt she'd ever seen: ""I don't like being lied to because I don't like to be a liar.""

5. The lesson in all of this, I think, is that too many people said to Lindsay, ""Get in, loser, we're going shopping."" And now no one trusts her not to go on any more sprees of any kind, particularly the landlord of her new apartment, who asked her for a $10 million security deposit. (And you thought two months' rent was bad.)

Perhaps soon Girl World will finally be at peace.

During its first episode, Lohan is shown storming off the set of a lingerie shoot, ranting at her real estate agent, and forcing her personal assistant to get her a new hotel room after leaving her original one in a complete mess.

“My intention is to just be me,” Lohan told Winfrey.

Being “me” for Lohan means ranting, raving and crying if things don’t go her way.

Case in point: upon hearing the real estate agent had put a US$10 million ($11 million) liability on the lease (can you blame them?) for her New York apartment, Lohan goes ballistic.

“They can’t just add that to the lease! How the hell can anyone have that? I’m not Oprah. I can’t get that!”

She then sends her poor personal assistant to clean out her hotel room (where she’d been living for 36 days).

“I was the lucky guy that got to switch everything over. This woman’s got s*** you couldn’t believe,” said the hapless assistant.

While her personal assistant cleaned up after her, Lohan told the cameras — with a straight face — she remembered “being in this bubble where everything was done for me. Now I’m figuring everything out for myself.”",

http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/10/lindsay-lohan-oprah-reality-show-supporters-enablers,entertainment,"The Oprah Winfrey-produced series reveals a tumultuous world in which Lohan is clearly struggling – but for now, at least, its intentions appear to be good

Lindsay, the eight-part reality TV show which follows Lindsay Lohan in her attempts to rebuild her career, made its debut on the Oprah Winfrey Network on Sunday, and it reveals a world as tumultuous as might be expected.

The series began filming in July 2013, as Lohan finished her sixth stint in rehab. It shows that the star is so hounded by the paparazzi that she can’t attend her AA meeting. She is striving for normalcy despite not being able to rent an apartment because of her reputation. But for now, at least, Lohan appears to be trying her best.

Winfrey and OWN deserve some credit here. Lindsay is clearly a reality show, but it doesn’t romanticize tears and/or meltdowns: it focuses on Lindsay’s commitment to sobriety, and it uses recovery jargon to show just how all-encompassing her addiction treatment really is. The show sets Lohan up to succeed – it is not presented as an attempt to break her down.

But despite the positive intentions surrounding Lohan’s move from Los Angeles to New York, is watching what is undoubtedly one of the most challenging times in her life supporting her comeback, or enabling her downfall?

It’s easy to get caught up in the technicalities, or to frame them as part of the star’s now-infamous legacy. Four days out of rehab, Lohan is encouraged by Winfrey, who takes on a mentoring role, not to travel to Europe for the premiere of her Bret Easton Ellis-scripted movie The Canyons. Her sobriety coach repeats the point, which leads to her cancelling her appearance at the Venice film festival. She pulls out of a short lingerie film because the producers ask for dialogue, and explains that doing this would have “compromised her sanity and sobriety.” She gets angry because, when they find out who she is, she is charged a $10m insurance fee by a condo board, effectively eliminating her chances for an apartment.

What Lindsay shows is that none of us can know what Lohan’s road to recovery looks, or should look, like, because her story is her own. Only she has Dina Lohan for a mother, only she has paparazzi bragging about how photos of her bought them expensive watches, and only she knows what this reality show is meant to do. Perhaps it will be part of an elaborate recovery process, or perhaps it is intended to prove to herself (and to potential employers) that she’s serious about working again.

Lindsay has a potential to give Lohan the platform she needs to convey the difficulties both of addiction recovery, and of being a famous woman in a fame-obsessed world. It can give her a mouthpiece aside from the occasional one-on-one interview or TMZ sound bit. The early signs are cautiously promising.

There are seven episodes left. If it becomes sensationalist; if it becomes a show that exploits Lohan more than media outlets already have, and romanticizes tragedy rather than strength, then it sets up both Lohan and viewers to fail: her, because she will be its victim; us, because we encouraged it.",

Lindsay Lohan wants to live ''with integrity''.

The troubled actress - who has endured a string of legal problems in recent years and been to rehab six times - is determined to make a fresh start and wants to put her problems behind her.

Speaking on her new docu-series 'Lindsay', which debuted on March 9, she said: ''Living with integrity and in control of my own self - that's the life I want now...

''I'm excited to start this new chapter, so it's going to be good.''

The 'Mean Girls' star was also seen telling program director Amy Rice that she now has ''inner peace''.

She said: ''I'm in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now. All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don't really affect me anymore.''

She exclaimed: ''I can't do that. I'm not Oprah!''

The 27-year-old actress stayed in a hotel while apartment hunting, and after a month in the luxury residence, she admitted she was finding the experience upsetting because she associated it with a ''crazy phase'' in her life.

She said: ''It's the first time I'm really getting a place in New York and it's really chaotic.

''I'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live, how to live out of a hotel, which I did when I was in a crazy phase in my life and that brings up a lot of memories and I hate it. ... And now I'm figuring out everything for myself with things being left up in the air constantly.''

However, she insisted her housing struggle wouldn't send her out of control again.

She added: ''I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober. And I'm dealing with it.''",

Part 1 of the eight-episode series finally premiered after months of publicity and hype, but despite a great teaser trailer in which Oprah tells LiLo to “cut the bullshit”, the first hour of the reality show was a bit blah.

Lindsay began with Lohan, who left rehab for the sixth time at the end of July, moving to NYC to start fresh. The episode was full of references to Linds finally growing up and calming down and the downsides of living in the public eye were highlighted as paparazzi followed the starlet everywhere – what else is new?

Linds often became snappy with the people around her, although she praised her family for helping her get through tough times. Interesting…



The biggest trauma of the night came when it became obvious that renting a place would be a lot harder than anyone thought. As it turns out, Lindsay can’t get renter's liability insurance ""because of who I am”.



The highlight for us? When Linds stopped by Jimmy Fallon earlier this week to do some promo for Lindsay and ended up playing water war.

In just a few minutes we saw more of the good ol' funny, adorable LiLo of yesteryear than in an hour of her OWN special. Win.

Lindsay, the new Lindsay Lohan docuseries, premiered last night on the Oprah Winfrey Network and, as expected, completely OWNed the night. The riveting series proved to be one part Intervention, one part Hoarders—and all parts train wreck. Naturally, it was brought to you by Cliffside Malibu, one of Lindsay’s numerous rehab clinics. Whether this sponsorship will be a win for the center remains to be seen—the same can be said of Oprah’s sponsorship of America’s favorite troubled starlet. One thing’s for sure though, we’ll be watching!

Here’s what you need to know:

Lindsay’s intention is to be honest

Yeah, that’ll happen. Good thing Oprah’s intention is to call her out on her shit. Can’t wait for that “Cut the bullshit” byte OWN has been teasing.

Lindsay is a Stage 3 hoarder

WIth a storage space bigger than your city block we all learned something last night: this girl’s got a lotta shit! She also likes to lay out all her jewelry on the floor and meticulously polish and examine it. Hmmmm, nope doesnt sound like drug induced behavior to us.

Lindsay does not go to AA meetings

Despite half the show consisting of her getting in and out of Escalades while being chauffeured around the city Lindsay admits that she feels like a “prisoner” and decides she cannot handle leaving her hotel room when it comes time to, you know do that pesky chore of actually getting help for her addiction.

Lindsay’s personal assistant used to work for Shaun White and Steven Tyler

And “addiction specialist” was clearly listed in the “other talents” section of his resume.

“Fetch” T-Shirts exist

In related news, Dina Lohan has no idea what “Fetch” means, as evidenced when her daughter shows her one of said t-shirts

It’s pronounced Low-HAN

She said it herself, kids! Whatever happened to “Lowen” as Lindsay preferred to be called in 2011? Rehab rebirth? Tomay-to/To-mahto. Whatever who cares.

Lindsay airs Sundays at 10/9c on OWN",

“I’m not Oprah,” Lindsay Lohan yelled into a cell phone in the first episode of her new show on OWN. From the trailer that came out last week, it seemed like the show wanted nothing more than to highlight the difference between those two: Oprah is the good influence on Lindsay, who is a bad influence on herself.

The first episode of the series didn’t show the real conflict between the woman responsible for the docu-series and its subject—that’s being saved for later episodes, we guess—instead the episode was about Lindsay’s big move to New York City after her latest stint in rehab. So we got scenes of Lindsay packing up her stuff at an L.A. storage facility; Lindsay driving around looking at apartments, stopping at her friend's store for a change of clothes; Lindsay dropping her stuff, which includes a Mean Girls “fetch” t-shirt, off at her mom’s house. We know who the villains are here: the paparazzi, the Los Angeles lifestyle, Lindsay's own persistent demons.

In the beginning of the episode, everything was mostly happy-go-lucky. Lindsay seemed intent on recovering, and her personal assistant explained how much he believed in her. It was only at the end that we began to see the whole operation unravel. Lindsay couldn’t make it to an AA meeting because of the paparazzi; Lindsay dropped out of a shoot involving lingerie models; Lindsay still hadn't found an apartment. The show couldn't help but veer from mundane to trashy-tragic as Lindsay pouted and tears swelled in her eyes.",
http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/03/10/lindsay-premiere-5-most-upsetting-moments-from-lindsay-lohans-reality-show/,entertainment,"Four days after Lindsay Lohan left rehab last summer (her sixth stay in six years), she started shooting a reality show for the Oprah Winfrey Network; the eight-episode series, “Lindsay,” premiered Sunday night. Who thought this was a good idea?

Lots of people, apparently. Oprah’s network certainly needs the viewers and Lohan needs people to think her life isn’t a total trainwreck anymore. Presumably, the goal is to mutually help each other, but is it really smart to put an addict in front of a camera at all times?

Yeah, we know the answer, too. As a result, watching the “Lindsay” debut just felt wrong. Lohan is clearly still very troubled, and even though every celebrity docu-series is somewhat voyeuristic, this one was flat out sad and absolutely no fun. Most of the premiere involved Lohan, accompanied by a sober coach and personal assistant, talking to the cameras about this new transitional phase in her life and how much she’s changed; Lohan getting in and out of giant chauffeured SUVs as she searches for a new apartment in New York; and Lohan bailing on various scheduled commitments.

If you couldn’t stomach it, here are the five most upsetting moments in the hour-long premiere.

1) The flashbacks to Lohan’s glory days.

For the last several years, most photos of Lohan show the actress looking miserable, usually on her way to court or after she’s been caught in some sort of trouble. That’s why it’s heartbreaking to flash back to Lohan’s earlier days. In the beginning of the episode there’s a short clip of adorable 12-year-old Lohan on the red carpet for the premiere of “The Parent Trap” remake, her first big movie, beaming with happiness as she answers questions about playing twins.Then we see Lohan grinning for the cameras at the “Freaky Friday” debut in 2003 (box office gross: $160 million) and later, posing for photos for her star turn in “Mean Girls” in 2004. Obviously, it all went downhill from there: DUI convictions, arrests, probation, violation of probation, theft charges, etc. Being reminded of her once-promising future is just sad.

2) Lohan family time

The main storyline of the premiere is that Lohan is moving from Los Angeles to New York to make a fresh start and live closer to her family. After shipping a massive amount of boxes to her mother’s house on Long Island, Lohan pays a visit to go through some of the things, including a journal from her time at the Betty Ford rehab clinic. She reads some passages out loud, including one about being upset that her mother, Dina, was barred from visiting. Having been bombarded with headlines about the highly dysfunctional Lohan family relationships, it’s all way too invasive.

The saddest moment? Seeing Lohan hug her younger brother and tell her family she loves them in a feel-good moment that feels way too forced — underscored by the microphone pack clipped on the back of Lohan’s dress, a depressing visual reminder that they’re all playing for the cameras.

3) Lohan promising she’s changed her unreliable ways, then bailing on everything

Though Lohan swears she’s become a different person post-rehab, she bails at least three different times on various planned commitments through the course of the episode, making life difficult for others. Case in point: Lohan decides she’s too stressed out to fly to the Venice Film Festival to promote her latest film, “The Canyons,” (the subject of that fascinating “Here is What Happens When You Cast Lindsay Lohan in Your Movie” NYT article) and cancels her trip. The director, Paul Schrader, is blunt with the crowd in Venice. “Today I am a free man,” he says dramatically. For the last 16 months, “I have been a hostage of my own choosing by a very talented but unpredictable actress, and she was supposed to be here today. She said she would be, but she’s not.”

Ouch. Later, Lohan has signed on to appear in a “short film” to promote a lingerie brand (side note: what?) because she’s friends with the producers. Only once she finds out they want her to be involved in actual scenes with dialogue rather than a photoshoot, she angrily decides to drop out. The reason? They lied to her about her role, and she doesn’t trust liars. She acknowledges that she only agreed just so she could be on a set again — but that environment wasn’t good for her “sobriety or sanity.”

4) The people who have to deal with her

Matt, Lohan’s beleaguered personal assistant, has to keep up with her demands, erratic behavior, and general bad mood when she’s been living in a hotel for a month because she can’t find an apartment in New York. (By the way, Matt tells the camera that before Lindsay, he worked as an assistant to Sean Astin, Prince, Shaun White and Steven Tyler. Someone get this man his own show!) Lohan also chews out the real estate broker, Cash, for not finding her an apartment — especially when one building insists she have a $10 million rental insurance policy, because obviously that’s Cash’s fault. Her sober coach, Michael, is the most patient, even when Lohan decides she doesn’t want to go to an AA meeting because of the dozens of paparazzi staked outside her hotel.

5) Oprah’s role in all of this

You know what, Oprah? We appreciate all you’ve done for a lot of other people, but it’s hard to have respect for you after seeing this show.

We see Oprah sitting down with Lohan at the beginning of the episode, grilling her on what she wants out of the experience. “Just to be honest and open and you know, just to be me,” Lohan says. Oprah replies that’s good, and just get ready, because she’s ready to call Lohan out on any bad behavior or lies throughout production. Lohan eagerly nods, and it’s sad because she so clearly wants approval from one stable adult in her life. Oprah is beyond condescending about it. “I’ll let you change into your pretty little dress,” Oprah says flippantly after their pre-interview chat, walking out of the room so Lohan can get ready for the day.",
http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2014/03/lindsay-own-review.html,entertainment,"But the real magic of this show is in its timing. Like most reality subjects, Lohan indicates at the top of the show that she'd like to help people in some way by exposing her journey. Unlike most reality subjects, she's not bulls—ting. The whole ""if I can even make one person _____"" trope has been worn out by housewives and D-listers who, deep down, just want to be on TV.

Lohan's position is different. A teaser for the season ahead hinted at the sort of troubles we've come to think of as characteristic for her—flaking on shoots, etc.—but the actress's power, in this series, doesn't hinge on her behavior record or even her intentions. The fact is: She's in a fragile place, as a young woman and as an addict, having seen a hell of a lot and needing to decide how to move on. How do you build a stable future when your past was all high glitter and major stumbles? How do you get excited about what's ahead when your former definition of excitement—both the substances and the circumstances that led to them—is now off-limits, by your own choice?

That's the question this series seems to be setting out to answer—and it's one addicts and nonaddicts alike can empathize with. The great thing about having Lohan in the question is we really care what happens to her. Not all of us (as I'm sure someone's gonna tell me in the comments!)—but millions of us, in a way that can't quite be explained, except to say that maybe some people are born to be rooted for. Lohan is one of those people. If she's been dealt a mixed hand in life, that is her ace. Lindsay gives us a chance to watch as she plays her next card—and it knows we all want her to nail it.",
http://www.refinery29.com/2014/03/64069/lindsay-lohan-reality-show-recap,entertainment,"It's hard to say. There were several moments last night that were hard to watch. While we credit Lohan for her bravery in exposing her private demons and battle to stay sober, she clearly has plenty of issues to deal with. The 27-year-old actress points out that she has to miss AA meetings when the paparazzi are camped outside — rather than risk them tagging along. In that case, we have to wonder if filming a reality show — even one with Oprah on board — is helping her recovery, or providing another distraction.",

Lindsay Lohan London - Lindsay Lohan wants to live ""with integrity"". The troubled actress - who has endured a string of legal problems in recent years and been to rehab six times - is determined to make a fresh start and wants to put her problems behind her. Speaking on her new docu-series 'Lindsay', which debuted in the US on Sunday, she said: ""Living with integrity and in control of my own self - that's the life I want now... ""I'm excited to start this new chapter, so it's going to be good."" The 'Mean Girls' star was also seen telling programme director Amy Rice that she now has ""inner peace"".

She said: ""I'm in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now. All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don't really affect me anymore.""

The programme also saw Lindsay search for an apartment in New York and left devastated when she found one she liked - but was told it required a $10 million insurance policy.

She exclaimed: ""I can't do that. I'm not Oprah!""

The 27-year-old actress stayed in a hotel while apartment hunting, and after a month in the luxury residence, she admitted she was finding the experience upsetting because she associated it with a ""crazy phase"" in her life.

She said: ""It's the first time I'm really getting a place in New York and it's really chaotic.

""I'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live, how to live out of a hotel, which I did when I was in a crazy phase in my life and that brings up a lot of memories and I hate it. ... And now I'm figuring out everything for myself with things being left up in the air constantly.""

However, she insisted her housing struggle wouldn't send her out of control again.

She added: ""I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober. And I'm dealing with it."" - Bang Showbiz",

http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/lindsay-own-first-episode-baggage.html,entertainment,"The word’s saddest episode of Storage Wars aired last night on OWN, and it took the form of Lindsay Lohan’s first Oprah-supported venture into reality TV. The premiere centered around Lindsay moving to New York to be closer to her family after leaving rehab, and because the city is less paparazzi-infested. In preparation for the relocation, we saw the falling starlet organizing the caverns of her storage unit while a crew of onlookers (Sober Coach! Assistant! Dina Lohan!) attempted to organize the emotional baggage she’s been carrying around for the past 25 years. And that was the high point: Considering how drama appears to follow Lohan, it’s weird that last night’s premiere was so … boring. Maybe because it’s hard to sympathize with a rich person trying to get an apartment in NYC — even if her excuses for the slow move (it’s not easy to get a co-op board to approve a press magnet) were relatively valid! Or maybe because the tantalizing clip OWN released of Oprah yelling at Lohan doesn’t happen until at least episode three?

But on reality TV, isn’t all baggage the same — even if it comes in the literal form of a mountain of boxes full with dated and wrinkled couture dresses? Watch LiLo sort through her crap, literally, in a scene layered with metaphor, and pretty much a sign of what you can expect from the seven upcoming episodes of the docuseries.",

http://www.eastidahonews.com/2014/03/lindsay-lohans-docu-series-premieres/,entertainment,"Discovery Communications, Inc.(NEW YORK) — The series premiere of Lindsay Lohan’s OWN docu-series, Lindsay, on Sunday night was filled with the kind of drama you’d expect from the actress, though nothing especially scandalous.

Lindsay began with the Mean Girls star sitting down with Oprah Winfrey for an interview last August, just days after she was released from court-ordered rehab, stemming from a car crash case. But much of the one-hour episode focused on Lohan’s move from California to New York, in an attempt to wipe the slate clean.

Lohan dropped off a lot of her stuff at her mom Dina’s Long Island home, but she didn’t crash there. Instead, she decided to live in a hotel until she could find an apartment, which proved to be more difficult than she anticipated.

Amid all of this, Lohan was offered a chance to be flown to the Venice Film Festival to promote her film, The Canyons. The catch: she had to make an appearance in London for GQ. After consulting with her sober coach, she chose to nix the deal and skip the film festival, drawing the ire of her director, Paul Schrader. He claimed at a Venice press conference that he’d been held “hostage” by Lohan.

Lohan missed working on a set, so she agreed to appear in a lingerie spot. However, she didn’t like the script, and she later had a heated exchange with the director that ended with her leaving in tears. She dropped out of the project.

The episode ended with a preview of what’s ahead later in the season. There are more arguments ahead, including at least one with her father, Michael Lohan.

Episode two of Lindsay will air next Sunday night on OWN.

http://gawker.com/heres-lindsay-lohan-chewing-out-multiple-people-on-her-1540338494,entertainment,"[There was a video here]

Lindsay Lohan was chainsmoking and braless for much of last night's premeire of her OWN reality show, Lindsay. So that's kinda fun. The show documented her move from Los Angeles to New York and, as she told Jimmy Fallon last week, her life's resulting chaos.

It wasn't until more than halfway through when the ""real"" ""drama"" kicked in—Lindsay cried while preparing for a lingerie promo she'd appeared to be in because she felt that her role in it had changed with her increased availability. Or something. Basically, Lindsay felt like she was getting jerked around and so she chewed out the director. And then she did the same to a real estate agent whom she felt ""lackadaisical"" and lacking in urgency when it came to securing her a permanent residence.

And then she yelled at people a few more times in the trailer for the rest of the season of her show.

Time will tell if Lindsay is quality, quality trash, or neither, but the first episode seemed to present an uncommonly complicated portrayal of its star. If it weren't completely candid, it was brilliantly constructed to appear so. Lindsay's capacity for sympathy ranges from scene to scene. She's sometimes bratty, but that's often when she feels like people are taking advantage of her (and as a former child star whose parents have fucked her over repeatedly in the harsh light of public, you see why she'd be extra touchy about getting taken advantage of). But she also seems to demand so much of some people in her life that you wonder if she's not taking advantage of them, and if what she's fighting for is merely the upper hand. After she backed out of the lingerie shoot, Lindsay said it was ""like a filler thing"" and that, ""I was just doing it to do it and I shouldn't have done that, because I compromised myself and my sobriety and my sanity."" That's fair but also kind of disrespectful of one of the few jobs she had offered to her at the time of shooting.

""I know that this is my last shot at doing what I love to do,"" she said at the beginning of the show, matter-of-factly aware that reality TV is where some careers go to die. That's a brutal self-evaluation.

Paparazzi play a big role in the show—they irritate, they complicate, they make Lindsay feel virtually immobile at times. Below, she explains how they're preventing her from attending an AA meeting. They might be some irony to derive from that, given her relationship to fame, if she weren't a former child star who had a lot of attention foisted on her and no tools for comprehending whether that's what she actually wanted at the time. Lindsay seems like she can be a jerk, and her self-sabotaging can be infuriating for anyone rooting for her, but this prisoner-in-her-own-life stuff struck me as just plain depressing.

Back in their first interview, Oprah and Lindsay met at the interview area. Oprah says that before the interview starts, she asks if Lindsay wants out of it. Lindsay says she wants to be honest and be herself. Oprah says that’s her intention: to provide a path for that and she will call her out on any BS. Oprah says she is really interested in the truth about her struggles and path to recovery. Lindsay recognizes that she’s an addict and that her drug of choice is alcohol.

Oprah says she has heard she plans to go to Europe. She says she doesn’t believe that because it’s just days after rehab. Linday says her brother is going with her because she is doing a yoga meditation program.

Oprah says she doesn’t think it’s a good idea. She says she questions it because she thinks Europe is the playground for fun and pleasure and that she might fall in the mindset “why not do this?” Lindsay says she won’t be going to parties. Oprah says she is not her coach, but she wants her to think if that environment would be the best for her sobriety as opposed to staying in NYC where her family is. At the end of the episode, they mention that two days later after the interview, Lindsay canceled her planned trip to Europe.

Back in LA, 11 days out of rehab. Lindsay gets into a car and drives to get her stuff from storage. Amy Rice –who has been hired to direct the series — asked her how her days have been. She says the chaos of daily life doesn’t affect her anymore.

We see many boxes full of clothes. she’s moving everything she has accumulated over 9-10 years in LA to NY to her mom. We start seeing footage of fans, some of whom are optimistic while others have lost hope for her. Overall, they wish her the best. Throughout the fan footage, we see black background with messages referring to the multiple counts of her infamous DUI charges, theft charges, violation of probation, and reckless driving.

Lindsay says she knows this time is her last chance to come back. She says there’s nothing else in that party environment for her to do. So from here on now, she can only live on integrity.

We see Lindsay sorting though her boxes filled with clothing items and sort what will be going to NY. Next week we get part 2. We are promised that future episodes will show Lohan trying to rebuild her stagnant career, battling Michael Lohan and dealing with Oprah who calls her out on bad behavior.",
"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-0309-dear-lindsay-lohan-20140309,0,5258580.story",entertainment,"Dear Lindsay Lohan:

Just caught the first hour of your new OWN reality show “Lindsay,” and honey, this show is so not a good idea.

I understand that, after 90 days clean and sober at Cliffside Malibu, you felt the need to prove you are not an irretrievable mess; that, despite recent evidence to the contrary (“Liz and Dick,” “The Canyons”), you still have much to offer as a performer.

And having Oprah Winfrey promise she will call you out must make you feel somewhat safe (who wants to disappoint Oprah?) and special. Which is one of the biggest reasons filming one’s recovery for display on national television is not standard practice among 12-step followers.

Advertisement

In your path to sobriety, you aren’t special; you’re just another drunk with the same sort of issues as the guy sleeping in the doorway of whatever part of New York in which drunks are still allowed to sleep in doorways.

It was difficult not to wonder if you had, perhaps, rushed into this whole thing. You were only out of rehab four days when filming began and frankly, your explanation for doing the show -- “There’s something to be said about my being so public” -- is not the best one could have hoped for.

Yes, Lindsay, there are many things to be said and most of them will not be nice. So why on earth would you put yourself in this position, especially at a time when you should just be going to meetings, reading the Big Book and finding a sponsor?

Celebrity is an addiction too.

As for Oprah, well, it was hard not to be a wee bit concerned when she suggested that you not take the trip you were planning to Europe. “I’m wondering,” she said, “is that the best decision. ... There’s something about Europe, being the playground for fun and pleasure.”

So going to Europe, no, but moving from Los Angeles to New York, with a film crew and a famous director (Ann Rice) in tow, yes. Am I the only one who remembers when Kirstie Alley did a realty show so she could lose weight? Which didn’t work?

Still, it is difficult not to love a girl who sorts through her endless vault of storage boxes wearing short shorts and knee-high black boots. You looked fabulous, Lindsay.

You do have way too much stuff, though. And possibly you shouldn’t have moved it all until you had found an apartment in New York. As you say yourself, living in a hotel means you can’t get a workout schedule or go to meetings or get a sponsor.

I’m not sure why that is, precisely, but you said it quite convincingly and if that is the case, then surely you could have sent someone on ahead to find you a flat. If only so you didn’t have to dump all your stuff on your mom, which meant hanging with Dina. Something that hasn’t always gone so well. In the past.

I’m certain your personal assistant, Matt, could have found you a place, or your sober coach Doug, a man who seems remarkably unfazed by your refusal to attend a meeting because of all the paparazzi who somehow knew to gather outside your hotel (first clue: film crew).

Frankly, between the assistant, the coach, the driver (black SUV because nothing says “I just want my privacy” like a black SUV), the coterie of unnamed security guards and the film crew, you probably could have put together a small AA meeting in your hotel room. Heck, some of the paparazzi are probably sober, right?

You see, Lindsay? It’s difficult for even a sympathetic viewer to watch you shopping and smoking and complaining about how your last judge was “punishing me instead of helping me” without making a crack or two.

The ads for Cliffside Malibu also do not help.

Nor do the scenes in which you throw tantrums about a photo shoot that is not going the way you thought it would or a real estate agent who is not dropping everything to get you into the one apartment you finally decide you like. In one priceless moment, you were telling the audience, with obvious sincerity, that you were just trying to figure out how to live in a sane way and figure out how to do it yourself. You remember? You were wearing a Wonder Woman-like gold headband and a dress cut down to there to a Fashion Week event while, back at the hotel, Matt and your team raced around moving all your crap from one hotel room to another.

As a TV critic, I cannot deny it made for some great if painful television. As someone who would like to see you stay sober and get healthy, well, honey, this show is so not a good idea.",

Lindsay Lohan is infamous for her hard partying, addiction, convictions and severe lack of common sense or self-control. Lindsay Lohan, a once-legitimately talented actress, has become a cautionary tale of young Hollywood. Lohan has six rehab stays, multiple arrests, convictions and probation violations under her belt, and every time the public starts to root for her, she goes and inexplicably puts herself back at square one. Lindsay Lohan has been given more chances than is seemingly acceptable and she realizes that—or so she says.

Lindsay Lohan’s docu-series premiered on OWN Sunday night. Many people were shocked that Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful women in the world, would put her faith in Lohan given the girl’s disaster of a track record. The episode opened with Oprah interviewing Lindsay Lohan, who claimed that she wanted to “show the real me” and “ to live life with integrity.”

For the most part, the show is pretty tame. It follows Lindsay Lohan and her wranglers (which includes her sober coach—who isn’t convinced that Lohan is sober) mere days after she was released from her latest rehab stay in Malibu. Lohan packs up her stuff and returns to New York, where she tries to find an apartment. She claims she needs to be settled and can no longer live in hotels, because the instability helps enable her behavior. It’s small gems of entitlement and inability to take responsibility for her actions like this that made viewers roll their eyes. The most telling part of the episode is when Lindsay Lohan complains that the judge refused to release her from jail even though there was overcrowding because “an example needed to be made” of her. Lohan fails to see that maybe her jail stay was extended because she committed a multitude of crimes and actually deserved jail time. It seems that thought never crossed her mind.

Another cringe-worthy moment came from Lindsay Lohan’s mother, Dina. As she helps Lohan unpack boxes, they come across a t-shirt with the word “Fetch” printed on it. “Fetch” has been a decade-long joke from “Mean Girls,” which was Lindsay Lohan’s biggest hit at the height of her career. However, Dina doesn’t get it. It’s painful to watch Lindsay Lohan explain to her mother that it’s a line from “Mean Girls,” as it is the most successful film her daughter has ever done and the success of the movie no doubt paid for Dina’s house. Moments like this make the viewers feel bad for Lindsay Lohan.

All in all, the episode was relatively dull. People expecting “Jersey Shore”-style debauchery are out of luck. However, Lohan’s unprofessional and selfish nature seems more prevalent in the preview for next week’s episode, as she refuses to film and enrages Oprah Winfrey. The problem is that Lohan seems to have finally run out of luck and the public just doesn’t care enough either way.",

Lindsay Lohan is a very busy lady as 2014 rolls on.

Not only has her own reality series Lindsay aired its first episode on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network, the headline-making actress is also set to make a guest appearance in hit sitcom 2 Broke Girls.

The 27-year-old star is set to play bride-to-be Claire Guinness in the CBS show, and her character asks Max (Kat Dennings) and Caroline (Beth Behrs) to make her wedding cake.

Obviously not all goes to plan, as the duo quickly reality Lindsay's character struggles with decision making.

This won't be the first time she's made a cameo appearance on TV, with a whole host of roles to her name. We've picked out five of the best for you to look back on.

That 70s Show (2004)

The popular sitcom launched the careers of the likes of real-life lovebirds Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, and Lindsay was part of its seventh series.

She appeared in one episode as Danielle, alongside her then-partner Wilmer Valderrama as one of his character Fez's customers at the salon.

It worked out well for Fez, with Danielle ditching a date with Kelso (Ashton) and takes him out instead.

Ugly Betty (2008)

Initially set for a longer run, Lindsay appeared as Betty's high school nemesis in four episode.

It was reported she was originally booked for six, but reported clashes with star America Ferrara - and apparent attitude issues - meant her run was cut short.

Glee (2012)

The first on our list which saw the star play herself, a couple of years ago Lindsay appeared in the popular musical drama.

During an episode in the third season of the Fox show, she was a judge at Nationals - alongside gossip blogger Perez Hilton - where the New Directions are competing.

Anger Management (2013)

In another appearance as a version of herself, Lindsay was able to have a laugh at her own expense when she starred opposite Charlie Sheen.

She hired his character to be her anger-management therapist on the set of a commercial, but typically it all goes wrong when they end up sleeping together and the paparazzi get wind of the situation.

Eastbound & Down (2013)

We're testing a new site: This content is coming soon

Perhaps not her proudest moment, but certainly her most recent TV cameo, Lindsay didn't have any lines for this one.

Still, she took on the role of Kenny Powers' daughter in the fourth series finale of the HBO comedy and looked happy enough in her brief appearance.",

The often-troubled actress, 27, opened up her life to Oprah Winfrey and director Amy Rice as she tried to remain sober and create a new life following her sixth rehab stint last year.

Here were the best moments from the premiere:

PHOTOS: Lindsay's biggest OMG moments

1. Oprah convinces Lindsay not to go to Europe

It's not clear what Oprah thinks happens in Europe, but it is clear that she sees life across the pond as a hot bed of sin and depravity. When she finds out Lohan is heading abroad for a yoga retreat, the talk show host quickly advises the star to forget her excursion. Lohan immediately cancels her trip at Oprah's request.

2. Lindsay finds ""Fetch"" T-shirts from Mean Girls

While sifting through her discarded boxes at her mom Dina's house, Lohan happens upon a pile of ""Fetch"" T-shirts made for the popular catch phrase from the 2004 film Mean Girls.

3. Lindsay finds an elaborate ball gown stuffed in a box

While preparing to move from Los Angeles to New York, Lohan finds a giant ball gown shoved inside of a box. The floor-length black embellished gown had no protective covering or packaging.

4. Lindsay's friend tells her The Canyons will become a ""cult classic""

While apartment searching in New York, Lohan's friend Chrissie Miller gushes about the star's box office flop, The Canyons.

""I loved it! I think it's awesome,"" Miller said of the raunchy indie film costarring porn star James Deen. ""You're amazing in it. You looked great. It's different. It's going to be like a cult [film].""

""Cool!"" Lohan happily replies.

5. Lohan's future landlord adds a $10 million insurance fee

As she struggles to find an apartment in New York, the Freaky Friday star finally finds one she likes. But the landlord adds a $10 million insurance fee to the property.

""I can't afford that! I'm not Oprah!"" she declares. But she does know Oprah, so maybe she can pull a few strings.

At least after one episode, the jury is still out.

The 27-year-old was filmed for a new eight-part Lindsay reality series last year for Oprah Winfrey's OWN network, chronicling her life and experiences post-rehab.

On many cases, that life still looks turbulent.

She states her desire to live with integrity and be in control, yet seems awfully unsure of how to achieve that, despite moving back to her native New York.

""Coming back to New York I needed a change, a fresh start, a clean slate and I needed to be close to my family,"" she revealed during the hour long show.

""Life can be chaotic and it's keeping myself calm in the middle of that which I didn't do before and I'm learning to do,"" LiLo added ... but is she learning?

""It's really stressful finding a place in New York,"" the actress, who recently spoke of a Mean Girls reunion for the show's 10-year anniversary, lamented.

""The boards who have to approve you, they're like, 'Oh it's Lindsay Lohan. Oh will she be having late, loud nights? We don't want her in our building.'""

""Or 'Oh great, we'll have her in the building. Let's up the price!'""

As she was filmed storming off the set of a photo shoot after growing flustered, the fragile star revealed that it was a case of too much too soon.

Constantly flanked by her sober coach and a personal assistant, Lindsay was seen veering from being tearfully happy to agitated and angrily chastising others.

""Do you ever feel like you're a prisoner?"" Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice asked, regarding the paparazzi attention. ""Yes, all the time,"" she replied.

Fortunately, there is always family ... well, maybe fortunately.

""It's comforting to be around my family and they are a huge part of my recovery,"" she concluded, with no mention of previous dramas with her parents.

""There's so much love in all my family members... It really will be nice when there's no more talking and only positive things will be said and that day will come...""

How soon, if at all, remains an open question.

'This Is Not What I Signed Up For!' Lindsay Lohan's Diva Side Flares Up On New Show

'This Is Not What I Signed Up For!' Lindsay Lohan's Diva Side Flares Up On New Show

Lindsay Lohan‘s self-titled reality TV show on Oprah Winfrey‘s OWN channel depicted the troubled star as an ornery prima donna in its’ premiere Sunday, and we’ve got all the details for you right here on RadarOnline.com.

On its’ first night, Lindsay — a documentary series about Lohan’s life after getting out of rehab — the actress was shown storming off the set of a lingerie shoot, ranting to her real estate agent, and forcing her personal assistant to get her a new hotel room after leaving her original one in shambles.

“My intention is to just be me,” recovering alcoholic Lohan told Winfrey in starting her new TV journey.

And was she ever!

Viewers were treated to scenes of Lohan claiming to be in a better place and “excited to start this new chapter” — but then reverting to her old hard-to-work-with ways.

Just 34 days out of rehab, Lohan was shown making a cameo in a film to promote a lingerie line — and immediately having issues with producer Jeremy Frommer.

“This is not the way I would show off lingerie,” Lohan told Frommer after hearing what she had to do.

“I thought this was a photo shoot that was going to be filmed,” Lohan told OWN’s cameras. “And then they added this weird dialogue. I don’t like being lied to.”

When Frommer tried to get to the bottom of what was bugging Lohan, she said, “When we discussed this … I was the girl that had the love story. That was interesting to me. That’s why I wanted to do this.”

Lohan’s personal assistant, Matt Harrell, told the cameras, “They wanted to change the script … that’s not what we agreed upon.”

When Lohan told Frommer she’d rather be in London promoting her movie The Canyons, the producer got angry and blamed Lohan’s schedule for the problems.

“Listen to me!” Lohan then said, pointing at shocked Frommer. “Now I’m getting p***** off. I canceled my f***ing trip! Don’t put words in my mouth.”

Lohan started to cry, then said, “This is not what I signed up for,” and stormed out of the makeup area.

Frommer attempted to clear the air with the out-of-control star later, but Lohan said she felt uncomfortable with the shoot, and ultimately pulled out of it.

Also during the episode, viewers saw the drama of Lohan moving back to New York and looking for a new apartment in Soho.

But when Lohan finally found a place she liked, the recovering party girl was convinced her real estate agent, Cash Bernard, wasn’t working hard enough to seal the deal.

In a tense phone conversation with Bernard, Lohan said, “What EXACTLY is it going to take to get the keys?! I hear it in in the tone of your voice, how lackadaisical you are about it.”

After finding out a $10 million liability policy had been put in her lease, Lohan went ballistic, shouting to Bernard over the phone, “They can’t just add that to the lease! How the hell can anyone have that?! I’m not Oprah. I can’t get that!”

Following the apartment debacle on Sunday’s show, her assistant Harrell had to pick up the pieces.

After living in a New York hotel for 36 days, antsy Lohan suddenly decided she had to get an entirely new room in the same hotel where she’d been staying.

Harrell had to quickly transfer all of Lohan’s clothes and personal items into a new room before she came back from watching her sister, Ali Lohan, do a runway modeling job.

“I was the lucky guy that got to switch everything over. This woman’s got s*** you couldn’t believe,” Harrell sighed as he cleaned the room, which looked like it belonged to a hoarder!

While Harrell did all the dirty work, Lohan improbably told the cameras she remembered “being in this bubble where everything was done for me.. Now I’m figuring everything out for myself.”

Lindsay Lohan: “I Know That This Is My Last Shot”

Since 2007, Lindsay Lohan has had two DUI convictions, a handful of probation violations and six stays in rehab. Now, the starlet says she has one last shot at doing what she loves to do. Watch as she explains why there’s “nothing left” in drinking and partying for her anymore and reveals what kind of life she wants for herself now.

Then, the cameras switched back to Harrell, who was surprised to see Lohan’s hotel mini-bar was empty!

Earlier in the episode, the assistant had sounded optimistic about a new life for the former Mean Girls‘ star, who is now better known for her arrests than her acting.

“If she screws this up — she knows what’s at stake,” Harrell said.

But Lohan — who also got help from sober coach Michael Cormier, visited her mother, Dina Lohan, and dodged the ever-present paparazzi on the Sunday reality show — apparently can’t help herself!",
http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/52648-possible-mean-girls-reunion-lindsay-lohan-weighs-in,entertainment,"MANILA, Philippines - Actress Lindsay Lohan hinted that the cast of Mean Girls is reuniting some time soon.

In a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon on his Tonight Show, Lohan said that she spoke with Mean Girls writer and co-star Tina Fey about the possibilities of a reunion, in celebration of the movie’s 10th anniversary (the film came out in the US in April 2004).

“She (Tina) made mention some sort of reunion cause she was like ‘I follow you on Instagram,’ and I was like, I didn’t know you cool people follow me,” Lohan said.

Lohan also said that Fey is talking with the movie’s producer Lorne Michaels about the project.

“This is important,” Lohan said. “This needs to happen.”

Watch Lindsay's interview here:

The movie, based on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman, starred Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert as popular high school students of North Shore High School, arguably becoming one of the most popular teen movies of all time.

Lohan, who took time off from the acting scene to deal with several personal issues, recently returned to television via Lindsay, an 8-week series shown by Oprah’s OWN. There, the TV host interviewed the 27-year old star about her life after rehabilitation, and making a fresh start in New York.

Lindsay Lohan wants to live ""with integrity"".

The troubled actress -- who has endured a string of legal problems in recent years and been to rehab six times -- is determined to make a fresh start and wants to put her problems behind her.

Speaking on her new docu-series ""Lindsay"", which debuted in the U.S. last night, she said: ""Living with integrity and in control of my own self -- that's the life I want now...""

""I'm excited to start this new chapter, so it's going to be good.""

The ""Mean Girls"" star was also seen telling programme director Amy Rice that she now has ""inner peace"".

She said: ""I'm in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now. All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don't really affect me anymore.""

The programme also saw Lindsay search for an apartment in New York and left devastated when she found one she liked -- but was told it required a $10 million insurance policy.

She exclaimed: ""I can't do that. I'm not Oprah!""

The 27-year-old actress stayed in a hotel while apartment hunting, and after a month in the luxury residence, she admitted she was finding the experience upsetting because she associated it with a ""crazy phase"" in her life.

She said: ""It's the first time I'm really getting a place in New York and it's really chaotic.

""I'm trying to figure out how to be sane and live, how to live out of a hotel, which I did when I was in a crazy phase in my life and that brings up a lot of memories and I hate it. ... And now I'm figuring out everything for myself with things being left up in the air constantly.""

However, she insisted her housing struggle wouldn't send her out of control again.

She added: ""I'm here. I'm showing up. I'm sober. And I'm dealing with it.""",

http://www.gossipcop.com/lindsay-lohan-premiere-recap-documentary-reality-show/,entertainment,"Lindsay Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, the first child of Dina and Michael Lohan, who would go on to give the star three younger siblings, Michael Jr., Cody, and Aliana. Lohan’s parents had a stormy marriage, and continued to battle publicly and privately even after their 2007 divorce.

Lohan’s career kicked off when she began modeling at just three years old, before doing dozens and dozens of commercials. Following a turn on the soap opera “Another World,” her big break came when she was cast in the dual lead roles for the 1998 remake of “The Parent Trap,” playing twins opposite Dennis Quaid. Lohan received high praise, and went on to star in a number of teen-friendly films, including “Freaky Friday,” “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,” and “Mean Girls.”

In 2004, Lohan released her first single, “Rumors,” and her debut album, “Speak,” which went all the way to number four on the Billboard 200 chart. But following several more films and another record, Lohan’s career started to derail in 2006 with personal and professional problems that led to a 30-day stint in rehab in early 2007. Just a few months later, the actress was arrested for DUI. She again entered treatment, was released after 45 days, and had a second DUI fewer than two weeks later, during which she was also caught possessing cocaine.

After a guilty plea, Lohan was placed on three years probation, went to rehab for a third time, and while ordered to spend a day in jail, ultimately served just 84 minutes due to overcrowding. Lohan’s probation was extended in 2009 after she failed to complete required counseling, and her career continued to suffer due to sporadic projects that failed to find any success. In 2010, a judge determined Lohan had violated her probation, and ordered her to serve 90 days in jail, of which she only ended up behind bars for 14. She was also supposed to spend 90 days in rehab, but left after 23 days.

After a failed drug test later that year, Lohan once again entered rehab, staying at the Betty Ford Center for three months. In early 2011, Lohan was arrested for allegedly stealing a necklace, and after pleading no contest, she was sentenced to 120 days in jail, but ended up doing 35 days of home detention instead. Months later, Lohan was again ordered to jail for a probation violation, but spent only five hours locked up.

Lohan seemed on the brink of a comeback in 2012, with a Playboy spread and a well-received turn as “SNL” host. But a car accident on her way to filming the TV movie “Liz & Dick” ultimately led to charges of reckless driving and lying to police. She pleaded no contest, and was sentenced to 90 days in rehab. Upon her release in 2013, Lohan filmed a reality show for Oprah’s OWN network, documenting her attempts to rebuild her life. It aired in 2014, and Lohan revealed on the finale that she had suffered a miscarriage in the months before.

With her last film, “The Canyons,” ripped by critics, Lohan set her sights on the stage, and made her West End debut in “Speed-the-plow” in the fall of 2014. She completed the run without incident. Lohan nevertheless remains a tabloid target, and is routinely romantically linked to various people, even though she hasn’t seriously dated anyone since Samantha Ronson.",

Lindsay Lohan's hopes of reinventing herself as sober, calm and together were hindered last night as viewers of her new docu-series saw her lose her cool in a series of angry outbursts.

The 27-year-old actress was filmed for new eight part series Lindsay last summer as documentary makers from Oprah Winfrey's OWN network followed her experiences moving back to her native New York after a 90-day stint of court-ordered rehab.

But while Lindsay was seen stating her desire to live with integrity and be in control of herself, the troubled star was seen struggling to keep her emotions in check during the first show which aired last night in the USA.

""Coming back to New York I needed a change, a fresh start, a clean slate and I needed to be close to my family,"" she revealed during the hour long documentary. ""Life can be chaotic and it's keeping myself calm in the middle of that which I didn't do before and I'm learning to do.""

However as the camera followed Lindsay's efforts to find somewhere to live in SoHo, New York, she was seen getting increasingly worked up.

""It's really stressful finding a place in New York,"" the Mean Girls actress admitted. ""The boards who have to approve you, they're like, 'Oh it's Lindsay Lohan. Oh will she be having late, loud nights? We don't want her in our building.' Or 'Oh great, we'll have her in the building. Let's up the price!'""

Later as she was filmed storming off the set of a photo shoot after growing agitated that the brief had been changed the fragile star revealed it was a case of too much too soon.

She said: ""That was me trying to do something to feel like I'm on set... and I shouldn't have done that as I compromised myself and my sobriety and my sanity by being in that headspace by being stressed out.""

Constantly flanked by her sober coach and a personal assistant, Lindsay was seen veering from being tearfully happy at the sight of her sister modelling at a runway show to angrily chastising her broker for being 'lazy' when it came to securing the home she so desperately desired to get settled.

Her planned trip to an AA meeting was also thwarted by the 40-odd paparazzi camped outside her hotel. ""Do you ever feel like you're a prisoner?"" Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice was heard asking the actress during filming.

""Yes, all the time,"" she replied.

While paying a visit to her mother's Lindsay once again expressed her desire to escape the chaos of her former life and find some normality.

""It's comforting to be around my family and they are a huge part of my recovery,"" she concluded, with no mention of previous dramas with her parents. ""There's so much love in all my family members... It really will be nice when there's no more talking and only positive things will be said and that day will come...""

But as highlights of the next episode of the docu-series showed more clips of an irate Lindsay crying and losing her temper, she clearly has some way to go.",

27-year-old actress Lindsay Lohan was filmed for new eight part series Lindsay last summer as documentary makers from Oprah Winfrey's OWN network followed her experiences moving back to her native New York after a 90-day stint of court-ordered rehab.

After the first episode hit US screens at 10pm last night, here is what we learned.

She really wants inner peace

Eleven days out of rehab, one Oprah interview down and planning her move back to New York, Lindsay seemed pretty zen.

“I’m in this really good place where I have this inner peace right now,” she declared cheerfully. “All the distractions and chaos that go on outside just in daily life in general don’t really affect me anymore.”

She is determined not to drink again

""There's nothing left in having a drink for me,” Lindsay insists. “There's no party that I haven't gone to, there's no person that I haven't hung out with, there's no situation that I haven't been exposed to. Some of it was fun, some of it was really not, but I've had that. So I want to try another way for me…”

The girl is a serious hoarder

When Li-lo said she was off to get her stuff from storage we envisaged a fairly extensive shoe collection, but zillions of boxes of junk, tat, Mean Girls’ t-shirts and some kind of sparkly mannequin? Ay Caramba!

“I’m moving everything I’ve accumulated in eight or nine years in Los Angeles to New York…” she sighed while rifling half-heartedly through a few boxes.

“So I still have to go to my mom’s, she still has stuff in storage,” she casually added no doubt prompting a wince of pain from her personal assistant.

We’re pretty sure he’d like to go back and work for ex-employer Steven Tyler right now.

There was quite a lot of debate about going to Europe

At the start of the show Oprah Winfrey (who appeared very fleetingly) advised Lindsay not to go on her planned trip to Europe. So Lindsay didn’t go to Europe.

Then Lindsay thought about going to Europe for the Venice Film Festival but ultimately decided not to go to Europe.

Then at a photo shoot she’d agreed to do for a friend Lindsay felt she’d been lied to about the brief and regretted not going to Europe.

“I want to be in London right now,” she told him tearfully. “I cancelled my f****** trip… I cancelled flying out. This is exactly not what I signed up for.”

Cue a disgruntled Li-Lo pulling out the shoot.

Oh and she didn’t go to Europe.

She missed her AA meeting

As two smug members of the paparazzi were seen gleefully salivating over how much a snap of Lindsay would earn them, the lady herself was hiding indoors .

“We’ve been stuck in the room all day because there’s like 40 paparazzi outside and I really don’t feel like dealing with them today,” she revealed.

“I can’t go to the meeting I was supposed to go to as I don’t want them following me to an AA meeting as it’s just not cool for anyone else there.”

The inner peace may be work in progress

“When somebody promises me something and then breaks that promise I lose all trust in them,” Lindsay revealed in an outburst about the broker who still hasn’t secured her a home. “It happened when I was a kid with my dad.”

Cue an ear-bashing for said ‘lazy’ broker.

“What exactly is it going to take to get me the keys?” she ranted down the phone as her people looked on despondently. “They want a 10 million dollar insurance policy? How the hell could anyone have that? I’m not Oprah!”

It’s going to get a whole lot worse next week

The preview for week two gave glimpses of Lindsay in meltdown, yelling and crying plus getting a dressing down from Oprah.

“The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,” the chat-host legend warns.

Oh Lindsay, we really were rooting for you...",
http://www.financialexpress.com/news/lindsay-lohan-to-sign-usd-one-million-deal-with-harpercollins-/1232420,entertainment,"Troubled actress Lindsay Lohan is reportedly set to sign a USD one million deal with HarperCollins to publish a memoir which is based on a diary she wrote during her rehab stint.

The 27-year-old 'Mean Girls' star apparently kept a diary during her rehab stint in 2013 and that would be the base of the book, reported Aceshowbiz.

""It's more or less an autobiography, but she had a minimal number of sample pages. There was initial interest, but everybody backed off. There was concern she wouldn't deliver,"" a source said.

http://www.today.com/entertainment/lindsay-premiere-new-series-same-chaotic-lohan-2D79346467,entertainment,"""Lindsay"" was supposed to show the star's rebuilding her life in New York, but what the premiere revealed is what a mess her life still is. Today

""Lindsay"" was touted as a docuseries chronicling Lindsay Lohan's ""attempts to build a new life"" in New York City following her sixth stint in rehab.

But the premiere, which aired Sunday on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network, could just have easily been an episode of A&E's ""Hoarders"" or ""Intervention,"" or even Britney Spears' ""Chaotic"" (the word pops up a lot in ""Lindsay"").

Emmy-nominated director Amy Rice interspersed the shots with on-the-street interviews and the grim statistics of Lohan's career nosedive, from plummeting box-office numbers to her numerous arrests and stints in rehab. But according to the actress, her cross-country move meant a step on the latest road to redemption. ""Lindsay"" offers a revealing glimpse into the troubled star's everyday life — and a closet full of skeletons. Or at least necklaces.

Buried alive

Lindsay Lohan has a lot of stuff. Enough to fill a cavernous warehouse — where we found the actress, 11 days out of rehab, when the series began. With film crew in tow, she cherry-picked which items she planned to store at mother Dina Lohan's Long Island apartment in preparation for her move to the Big Apple. The cameras also captured the ""Liz & Dick"" star's nostalgia over the mementos she saved from her much-lampooned portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor in the Lifetime biopic.



But she also kept souvenirs from her glory days, like the ""Mean Girls"" ""Fetch"" T-shirt she brandished at her mom's place — now overrun with boxes of her daughter's possessions. Like ""fetch"" — the catchphrase that was ""never gonna happen"" — Lindsay's quest for an apartment seemed hopeless. By the end of the first episode, she had been living in hotels for more than a month — her clothes and jewelry strewn across nearly every inch of furniture and floor space, more like a flophouse squatter than a ritzy hotel guest.

Bling ring

Lohan would be spreading even more jewelry on the carpet if it weren't stolen by Alexis Neiers, one of the notorious ""bling ring"" thieves who targeted the actress and other Hollywood celebrities. ""Lindsay"" is saturated in irony, but perhaps the greatest of all — from the star's perspective — is the fact that Neiers occupied an adjacent jail cell but was released when she ""got put in.""



""They kept making me stay there,"" she complained about the judge who vetoed her own early release. Whatever sympathy the LiLo had from viewers at the start of the show, it shrank noticeably when she whined, ""They were punishing me instead of trying to help me!""

Blame game

The premiere didn't do any favors for Lohan's reputation for unreliable behavior. She ran out sobbing from a friend's film shoot, in which she was to cameo as an ""intellectual"" who ""gets absorbed into the world of beauty and lingerie.""



The filmmaker had to scrap an entire day's work when she pulled out, but Lohan insisted, ""I'm not an actress turned model,"" adding, petulantly, ""My sister's the model in my family."" (Not that there's anything wrong with that. She did support Aliana during her first fashion show in another segment.)

She also canceled a London promotion for ""The Canyons"" (which, despite her friend gushing that ""it's gonna be a cult movie,"" made only $51,000) and the film's Venice Film Festival press junket — where the embittered director, Paul Schrader, told the press, ""I've been a hostage of my own choosing to a very talented but unpredictable actress.""

It's a Catch-22: Lohan's potential landlords are requiring an astronomical $10 million insurance policy, but she can't (or won't) work — or workout, or get an AA sponsor — because she doesn't have a ""sanctuary"" to call home and help clear her ""headspace.""

Lohan in cars, getting coffee

But Lohan and her realtor, Cash Bernard (a name made for reality television), didn't give up. In fact, much of the hourlong program featured the actress, sipping Starbucks with her posse (which also included her PA and a ""sober coach"") and driving around the city. (Ten different shots involved Lohan entering, exiting or riding in a chauffeured SUV.)



And yet, though Lohan pointed to her dedication to her sobriety as the reason for backing out of her professional commitments, she skipped AA meetings because of the paparazzi hounding her.

""Look at my watch,"" one of the insensitive photographers bragged to the documentary crew. ""Lindsay paid for it.""

Oprah, as usual, said it best: ""The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,"" she warned Lohan in the previews for the rest of the season. Some highlights: The actress clashes with her assistant, bails on the docueries' filmmaker and causes her coach to question her sobriety.

""This is exactly what everybody said was gonna happen, and I believed differently,"" said Oprah. ""I believed she was ready.""

But not everyone is losing faith. Many fans tweeted their support during their show — and plan to keep watching Lohan's story unfold.

He has got the top job in TV talk shows, and it's clear that Jimmy Fallon is living his dream. And for some, getting the opportunity to pour cold water on wild actress Lindsay Lohan might count as a career high too.







Jimmy brought over his popular segment Water War from his Late Night show, and didn't hold back with the Mean Girls star.







Lindsay and Jimmy had to turn over cards, and whoever won the hand got to throw a glass of water over their opponent. The 27-year-old and 39-year-old both ended up suitably drenched, but Lindsay was the one who won the game.







That meant she got to get revenge on the host with a giant super soaker, but not before pouring water all over Jimmy's crotch.







Lindsay was giggling with glee as she shot it straight into Jimmy's face, before the pair posed for selfies together.







The former child star had looked gorgeous before the water fight, which she tied her red locks up for. Lindsay wore a white knit dress with some sparkly thread in it, which had a cute collar and necktie detail.



The star was promoting her reality show Lindsay which will premiere on Oprah Winfrey's network OWN on Sunday. She admitted she is concerned about the show, explaining the timing wouldn't show her at her best as she said: ""They picked the first two months when I got back to New York after treatment and I got really spiritual.""







Lindsay revealed that her troubled days are 'the past' and said: ""I feel really lucky to have been able to work with someone like Oprah.""

SEAL-ed with a kiss















They were once one of pop music's most beautiful couples, with public declarations of love and renewed wedding vows.







But model Heidi Klum and singer Seal, real name Seal Henry Samuel, are clearly still on good terms — despite divorcing after seven years of marriage.







The pair were seen meeting up at the Heritage Auction house in Beverly Hills, California, on Tuesday where they spent time with Klum's daughter, Leni, from her previous relationship with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.







Embracing in a brief goodbye, the couple — who have three children together — appeared to have enjoyed a cordial meeting, giving hugs and kisses as they went their separate ways. Dressed in an all-black ensemble which consisted of a cardigan with a crucifix on the back, the model looked stylish in leather boots and over-sized sunglasses. Meanwhile, Seal kept it casual with a pair of fresh Converse trainers, roll-up jeans and a military jacket over a grey T-shirt.

Isaiah returns to Grey's Anatomy after seven-year absence















He was sensationally axed from Grey's Anatomy seven years ago following his use of homophobic slurs towards a co-star.







But now Isaiah Washington is set to return to the medical drama as Dr Preston Burke for a special one-off appearance in May as his on-screen love interest Dr Christina Yang (Sandra Oh) departs the show. Speaking about Burke, who was last seen during the finale of season three as he stood Christina up at the altar, showrunner Shonda Rhimes said in a statement: ""It's important to me that Cristina's journey unfolds exactly as it should. Burke is vital to that journey - he gives her story that full-circle moment we need to properly say goodbye to our beloved Cristina Yang.""







Sandra will leave the show at the end of the 10th season in May.







Washington's character was one of the central players on the programme for the first three seasons.







However, on-set altercations with then co-star T R Knight led to him using anti-gay slurs against his fellow actor and he was fired.







Despite this, GLAAD, the non-governmental media monitoring organisation which promotes the image of LGBT people in the media, has praised his return.







It said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter: 'His PSA and his statements promoting marriage equality in recent years have sent a strong message of support for LGBT people. ""We look forward to seeing him return to one of our favourite shows, as well as in Patrik-Ian Polk's moving film Blackbird about a young man coming out in a small Southern town.""

http://www.contactmusic.com/article/lindsay-lohan-oprah-winfrey-documentary_4103643,entertainment,"Lindsay Lohan’s new reality show premiered on Oprah over the weekend and the star, who has become the poster child for child star go bad, managed to shock everyone again. By not being that shocking at all.



Lohan is back on the straight and narrow... in the first episode, at least.

Sure, the first episode shows Lohan struggling to toe the line – by the end of it, she’s having obvious trouble following the restrictions set by Oprah. Her troubles with substance abuse and numerous DUIs aren’t directly addressed, but are alluded to, when the actress tries to rent a place in New York. One of the final scenes Sunday showed an exasperated Lohan reprimanding her real estate broker because she's required to get renter's liability insurance before she can move into her new apartment.

""I can't get it,"" she tells him, ""because of who I am.""



Oprah has the dificult task of cleaning up Lohan's image, while maintaining the show's ratings.

Everyone knows what she means, even if it isn’t stated explicitly, But that’s essentially it for the whole episode. Following classic reality show tropes like the redemption journey and making expert use of the kind of language you’d expect to hear on a reality programme. Both Oprah and Lindsay frequently refer to about ""making the right decisions"" and ""being in the right place."" But uneventful is the best kind of rehab Lohan could want. Hopefully this time she’ll stick with it. It might not bring stellar ratings to OWN, but we’re still rooting for Miss Lohan.",

Lindsay Lohan attends Z100's Jingle Ball presented by Aeropostale on December 13, 2013 in New York. London - Lindsay Lohan has reportedly been offered a $1 million book deal. The 27-year-old actress is believed to be on the verge of signing a contract with publishing house HarperCollins to create a story based on her troubled life. The memoir will follow her journey from a child star to her court-ordered stint in rehab last year, with the diary she penned during her 90-day stay being used as the basis for the book. A source told the New York Post newspaper: ""It's more or less an autobiography, but she had a minimal number of pages."" The flame-haired star's agent, Scott Waxman, has reportedly had a number of meetings with different publishers, but his efforts to secure a $5 million deal were unsuccessful following concerns that Lindsay would not produce a completed story.

The source added: ""There was initial interest, but everybody backed off. There was concern she wouldn't deliver.""

Meanwhile, Lindsay's new TV show hit screens on Sunday night on her mentor Oprah Winfrey's OWN network, which will highlight her struggle to stay sober and resurrect her career.

Lindsay said previously: ""I did it because it's not a reality show, it's pretty raw. Obviously it's TV, so things will be edited in certain ways to get ratings, which I can't control, but I do know that my intentions going into it were really pure and really honest. I appreciate all that's happened and all that [Oprah has] done for me."" - Bang Showbiz",
http://variety.com/2014/tv/reviews/tv-review-lindsay-1201127006/,entertainment,"OWN has sought to surround “Lindsay” – its docu-series devoted to Lindsay Lohan – with a patina of seriousness and quality, from touting the involvement of director Amy Rice (“By The People: The Election of Barack Obama”) to preceding it with a showcase in which the channel’s namesake interviews Russell Brand about addiction. But seriously, who’s fooling whom? In the best Hollywood tradition, the Oprah Winfrey-Discovery network and the tabloid-plagued actress are using each other, the irony being that if Lohan stays on the straight and narrow, she’ll yield a show as boring as Sunday’s not-screened-in-advance premiere.

Frankly, one appreciates Lohan’s efforts to stay clean and sober. But it shouldn’t come as a newsflash to anyone – starting with Oprah – that the dramatic needs of reality TV and straightening out her life are mutually exclusive.

The show picks up last August, right after Lohan has finished her sixth stint in rehab. While alcohol, she says, has been her drug of choice, it’s clear another kind of high comes from staying in the spotlight.

The opening runs through Lohan’s spotted history of arrests and slip-ups, while incorporating the “backstage” portion of her Oprah interview, before filming the series began.

Mostly, the show is filled with meta moments. There’s the spectacle, for example, of the cameras filming Lohan being photographed by the paparazzi staking out the hotel where she’s living (they become what amount to extras throughout); or her assistant, Matt Harrell, saying the actress knows the OWN project amounts to a last chance, and thus that she won’t screw things up.

Still, it’s hard to see what screwing up would entail in this context, other than falling completely off the wagon, while Lohan’s sober coach, Michael Cormier, keeps a watchful eye on her.

So what’s left? Lindsay talking to the camera, without makeup; Lindsay visiting her mom, Dina; Lindsay trying on hats; Lindsay looking for an apartment; Lindsay having a minor meltdown at a modeling shoot.

At this rate, Linday watching paint dry is a pretty good subplot for episode three.

Frankly, “Lindsay” says far more about OWN than it does about Lohan. Having already handed a fair amount of time over to Tyler Perry, the channel continues to drift farther away from the “Oprah” brand in pursuit of hits.

That’s worked, to a point, but it also dispels the notion that Oprah’s magic touch would somewhat make broccoli TV palatable.

“The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,” Oprah tells Lohan in the “this season on” tease, as if – in this context – her channel isn’t taking a taste. In that respect, “Lindsay” represents another form of addiction, and spinning things any other way is simply putting lipstick on it.",

http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2014/03/10/lindsay-own/,entertainment,"Lindsay on OWN – Season 1, Episode 1 recap

By Nicole Youngblut

Last night was the anticipated premiere of Lindsay, directed by Amy Rice on OWN. Two days after exiting rehab at Cliffside Manor, Lindsay Lohan sits down with Oprah and discusses her new life path of sobriety.

In the first episode, Lindsay cancelled her yoga and meditation retreat in Europe after Oprah cautioned against it. Then, she moves back to New York from LA to be closer to family. Lindsay is working with her sober coach, Micheal Corimer, to integrate the tools needed to stay sober into daily life. She states family as a huge part of her recovery.

The show portrays her daily life struggle of rebuilding her personal life, while dealing with addiction. Adjusting to a move back to New York, finding an apartment, and arguing with brokers that try to take advantage of her by raising housing market prices on account of her celebrity.

New York City with its fashion parties and nightlife has too many temptations for Lindsay’s recovery. Is it better than L.A.? Maybe. Her family is there, but it seems like she’s trading one hot bed of temptation for another.

One day, Lindsay and her film crew could not leave her hotel room, because of the swarm of paparazzi outside. Lindsay feels like a prisoner. She has to worry about the added stress of paparazzi following her to an AA meeting, so she doesn’t want to go.

Does this docuseries expose a relatable human side of Lindsay Lohan? Even with all of her fame and wealth, she still has some of the daily struggles of family problems, relocating to a new city and finding personal inner peace.

Is New York City the best place for Lindsay’s recovery? I’ll be watching Lindsay on OWN next Sunday to find out!

http://www.nbcbayarea.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/Lindsays-Oprah-Reality-Check-249227911.html,entertainment,"The build-up to “Lindsay” included a much-played clip in which Oprah Winfrey bluntly warns Lindsay Lohan to “cut the bull****."" The show, which debuted Sunday on Winfrey’s OWN channel, got off to a far milder start, with the daytime talk show legend telling the star-crossed former child star, “I want you to win.”

Winfrey, the world’s supportive TV friend, clearly cares about Lohan, whose interrelated problems with family, alcohol and the law have overshadowed her acting talent. But while anyone with a heart is rooting for Lohan to turn her life around, it’s far from certain viewers will stick around to witness the BS that began to unfold during Sunday’s initial installment.

Lohan says a lot of the right things to Winfrey and the cameras: She knows this is her “last shot.” She “feels different.” She’s finding “inner peace.”

Her words, in the context of the show, offer the disturbing suggestion that Lohan is linking her public struggle for stability to the resurrection of her career nearly a decade after her peak in “Mean Girls.” It’s difficult to watch “Lindsay” without thinking she might be better off if nobody was watching.

For all her talk about “inner peace,” there are plenty of signs of outer chaos as Lohan uses the paparazzi as an excuse to miss an AA meeting. She makes her assistant move her heap of clothes and junk from one hotel room to another because she’s feeling claustrophobic. She breaks down and walks off a shoot when she decides – not unreasonably – that a friend is taking advantage of her.

""Lindsay"" is billed as an eight-part ""docu-series"" in an apparent bid to separate the program – and Winfrey – from the often-exploitative Reality TV genre. The show certainly isn't ""Keeping up with the Lohans"" – there aren’t signs of staging the action or manufacturing conflict.

""Lindsay"" is less Reality TV than reality check TV, even if most folks in recovery aren’t fortunate enough to have a sobriety coach, drivers and assistants. Still, “Lindsay” succeeds in capturing the sadness, confusion and fragility of Lohan’s post-rehab life. She’s striving to emerge from the too-high pile of troubled former child stars – a mound of misery that includes Michael Jackson, the most talented and most tragic of them all.

Amanda Bynes, who experienced unfortunate public breakdown, recently tweeted to let her fans know she’s okay and in school. Hopefully, that’s last we’ll hear from Bynes for a while as she gets her life together.

Lohan, who, like Bynes, is 27, can’t keep away from the public eye: She’s set to appear on “Two Broke Girls” April 14, and is slated to start filming a movie next month. On Thursday, she promoted “Lindsay” on “The Tonight Show,” seeming in good spirits as she told Jimmy Fallon she takes comfort in knowing Winfrey is always just a call away. As for her many problems, Lohan told Fallon, “That’s the past.”

The past may not be as distant as Lohan would like. The cameras began following her just six months ago, days after she finished her latest rehab stint.

Previews suggest that Winfrey’s tough talk comes in the next episode. But if Lohan’s going to “win,” she’s needs to take control of her life – whether or not Oprah or the rest of us are watching.

http://www.thewrap.com/lindsay-lohan-own-premiere-episode-review-recap,entertainment,"The much-anticipated OWN series starring Lindsay Lohan, titled simply “Lindsay,” already sets the season’s storyline on Sunday’s premiere episode: Who’s the biggest threat to Lohan? The outside world or the actress herself?

Director Amy Rice followed the “Mean Girls” actress as she decided to relocate from Los Angeles to New York City. The actress felt that a change of scenery and being closer to her family would give her stability as she tries to stay sober. At one point, Lohan acknowledged that the next few months are important ones.

“It’s my last shot,” the actress said of her career.

See video: Lindsay Lohan Gets Doused in the Face by Jimmy Fallon

In setting up the series, it shared Oprah Winfrey‘s pre-interview with the star ahead of the taping of her August interview on “Oprah’s Next Chapter.” Winfrey asked the question she poses to all her guests: What do you want from this interview?

“Just to be me, be honest and open,” Lohan answered and Winfrey promised she’d call the actress out if she felt she wasn’t sticking to that path.

The truth is probably the hardest thing to discern on the premiere episode. We hear what Lohan wants, but we’re unsure what happens off-camera and just how much she participates in situations where she feels others have wronged her.

Also read: Lindsay Lohan to Guest Star on CBS’s ‘2 Broke Girls’

There are plenty of examples of this on the episode. She promised to be in London to do press for her movie, “The Canyons,” but pulled out because she’s worried about how the pressure will affect her sobriety and that the press will really only want to ask her about her recent stint in rehab. In turn, director Paul Schrader told reporters that he felt like he “was held hostage” by the actress during the shooting of the film, clearly disappointed she was skipping out on its promotion.

Yet, there are some real challenges to being Lindsay Lohan. The paparazzi are clearly out of control. They stood outside her hotel and followed her to events. One boldly held up his watch to OWN’s cameras and said, “Lindsay paid for it.”

At one point, she’s unable to attend her AA meeting because the paparazzi would follow her there and she’s worried about the other people at the meeting and their privacy. When Rice asked if she ever felt like a she’s a prisoner, Lohan answered, “Yes, all the time.”

Also read: Is Oprah Winfrey Exploiting Lindsay Lohan?

She also goes for more than a month in New York City unable to find an apartment. Lohan said that finding the place is the easy part, but then the building’s board finds out who she is and doesn’t want her as a neighbor or they raise the rent. At one point, she’s very close to signing a lease when a last-minute clause requiring her to purchase a $10 million insurance policy gets added – something her realtor said is a standard amount though Lohan argues that she isn’t your standard renter. Truth.

At other times, it’s clear Lohan may not know what she needs. She wants stability, yet she orders her personal assistant to switch her hotel room and move her belongings (which are strewn all over her hotel room like an episode of “Hoarders”).

The show shoots only her second visit with her mother since leaving rehab. Why has she only seen her mother once since rehab if her family is such a force for stability? And, her father? Well, he hasn’t quite been her best protector either and has yet to appear during Lohan’s first month in NYC.

She’s a living example of contradictions. Lohan does come off as very courteous to others, greeting her drivers, the hotel staff who open the door for her, etc., though at one point she decided to change her clothes during a realtor appointment and literally goes shopping for new duds while the realtor stands outside on the sidewalk.

It remains to be seen if Lohan can herself begin to decipher during the course of the season ahead the difference between when others are gunning for her and when she’s holding the gun.

A troubled, messy, fraught one, to be sure.

Above all, troubled. But at least human.

Oprah Winfrey, whose name is on the network, asked her at the outset Sunday night what Lohan wanted out of this eight-part ""docu-series,"" which began taping just four days after her release from a Malibu rehab facility last summer -- her sixth such stay over the years.

""Just to be honest, and open. Just me.""

Lohan has been demonized for so long that it's been easy to lose sight of who that ""me"" is, exactly. But this fascinating new documentary, ""Lindsay,"" produced by Amy Rice, attempted to at least to offer some sort of framework.

It began with Lohan literally packing up her life in Los Angeles, lost amid a thousand boxes. ""I need a fresh start, a clean start,"" she says. ""Life can be chaotic. But it's about keeping myself calm in the middle of that, which is what I'm learning to do.""

And then came the chaos: Hunting for apartments in Manhattan, returning to her family home in North Merrick, limo rides to who-knows-where-or-why, and a constant swirl of handlers, helpers, and hangers-on. A thrum of stress and anxiety seemed to crowd her in every scene: An argument over some business arrangement, or over a lease, followed by a quick cut to her counselor who says, ""She's trying to create security in an environment that's not very secure.""

http://thestir.cafemom.com/entertainment/169402/lindsay_recap_lindsay_lohan_struggles,entertainment,"On the premiere episode of Lindsay, the docuseries about Lindsay Lohan's struggle to stay sober and sane fresh out of rehab, Linds moves from Los Angeles to New York City in order to be closer to her family and hopefully reboot her career. She's got her work cut out for her. ""I used to like her,"" is the general consensus from strangers interviewed on the street. Yeah, we all used to. Remember The Parent Trap? Mean Girls? And then the DUIs, thefts, more DUIs, car crashes, lying to the police, and solitary confinement? More what Lindsay is known for now. But coming out of rehab for the sixth (that's not a typo) time, Lindsay feels that this could be her last chance to get back some respect. Well, maybe not respect. But something? A paycheck, maybe?

The show starts off with Lindsay apartment hunting -- which is probably the single most stressful undertaking a human being can attempt if the apartment hunting is being done in New York City. Lindsay doesn't have it any better than your average schlub -- in fact, she may have it worse, given her reputation. For who really wants Lindsay as a neighbor? And when her broker breaks the news that the owner of the apartment she settles on wants a $10 million insurance policy -- which she is sure no one will give her -- well, let's just say Lindsay's post-rehab serenity immediately flies out the window. ""Who has that?"" she snaps at the broker. ""I'm not Oprah!""

That wasn't Lindsay's only meltdown of the evening. There was her decision not to fly to the Venice Film Festival for the launch of her movie The Canyons. She very rightly concludes that the party atmosphere of a film festival isn't where she should be when she's trying to avoid champagne -- but that doesn't stop the film's director, Paul Schrader, from slagging her off at a press event.

""I've been held hostage to a talented but unpredictable actress who said she'd be here today but isn't,"" he grouses. Sheesh, Paul, maybe don't hire Lindsay Lohan next time if it was predictability you wanted.

We also get a scene of Lindsay's famous temper when she quits a lingerie shoot rather than take on some dialogue she wasn't prepared for. ""This isn't what I signed up for!"" she hollers, before storming off set and refusing to shoot anything.

But behind the diva antics are some real issues -- and we get one real clue where all of this is coming from when Lindsay says in an off-guarded moment, ""I hate when someone makes a promise and breaks that promise. It makes me lose all trust in them. Just like when I was a kid with my dad.""

A-ha! And for a moment you feel deeply, truly sorry for Lindsay.

But then she spontaneously makes her hapless assistant move all of her things out of her hotel room and into another -- for no particular reason.

I look forward to Lindsay turning some of that venom on the person who really deserves it -- her father.

Did you watch the show? What did you think about Lindsay's behavior?

http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/lohan-to-sign-usd-one-million-deal-with-harpercollins-114031000073_1.html,entertainment,"Troubled actress Lindsay Lohan is reportedly set to sign a USD one million deal with HarperCollins to publish a memoir which is based on a diary she wrote during her rehab stint.

The 27-year-old 'Mean Girls' star apparently kept a diary during her rehab stint in 2013 and that would be the base of the book, reported Aceshowbiz.

""It's more or less an autobiography, but she had a minimal number of sample pages. There was initial interest, but everybody backed off. There was concern she wouldn't deliver,"" a source said.

A representative for the publishing house however declined to comment.

Lohan's publicist Tej Herring, meanwhile, said that ""there have been some conversations, but nothing official yet.",

In 'Lindsay,' Oprah Winfrey tells Lindsay Lohan she needs 'to cut the bullsh*t.'

(OWN/YouTube)

11:02: In sum, we need more Oprah. We know there's more Lindsay complaining, Lindsay angst and Lindsay anger. OWN's voice of reason needs to make another appearance, badly.

11:00: To come this season on ""Lindsay"": more problems with shoots. An appearance from her dad, Michael Lohan, and problems with her assistant, Michael. Lindsay on a pole. Lindsay at a doctor's office or hospital(?). Oprah getting angry.

""The vultures are waiting to pick your bones if you're not ready,"" Winfrey tells Lindsay. Ruh roh.

10:58: Lindsay is stressed again. She can't get the keys to her new apartment. They want a $10 million dollar insurance policy added to the lease. ""How the hell could anyone have that?"" she tells her broker. ""I'm not Oprah."" She's now been living in a hotel for 36 days. She requests a new room. She hates living in a hotel. It brings her back to a ""crazy"" time in her life, when she was also living in a hotel. She doesn't approve of much lately, except for her sister's walk in a fashion show.

10:48: Lindsay's shooting a short film to promote ... lingerie! And she doesn't like the script. It's not what she expected. It's all very confusing. The models are waiting. She pulls out of the shoot. ""It just wasn't the right timing,"" she says. Compromising her sobriety, apparently.

10:38: Michael, Lindsay's ""sober coach"" thinks it's a bad idea for her to travel, even when business calls. She also isn't too keen on the idea. So she misses at trip to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of her movie ""Canyons."" She's not settled in a routine yet. They're stuck in a room all day because there's paparazzi outside. She's missing meetings because the photographers would follow her. She feels like a prisoner ""all the time."" Yet she thinks back to the time when a judge wouldn't let her out of actual jail (to make an example of her, Lohan supposes), and she was placed in solitary confinement. The hotel room is probably better.

10:33: Lindsay explains the problems with finding an apartment when you're Lindsay Lohan. No one wants Lindsay Lohan in their building, and if they do, they bump up the price, she says. :( :(

10:29: Back at Mama Lohan's house in New York, Lindsay sorts through her belongings. She's moving back in until she finds something more permanent. Mama Lohan looks a bit addled. Lindsay hugs her brother, Cody. They ""have a special bond,"" she says.

""We have so much love in each one of us,"" Lindsay continues. ""It really will be nice when that day comes when there's no more talking and there's only positive things being said, and that will come.""

10:25: Matt, Lindsay's personal assistant, sounds like he could have a show of his own, having assisted Shaun White, Steven Tyler, Sean Astin ... nevermind, Lindsay would probably deliver enough material.

10:18: August 2013. Being back in New York is good for Lindsay, we learn. She's going shopping, trying on hats. Laughing, lighting up a cigarette.

10:11: So far Oprah has given Lohan fair warning: We're both here to get the real you, meaning honest Lindsay, not lying Lindsay. Lohan tells Winfrey she's an addict, specifically an alcohol addict. With the actress just four days out of rehab, Winfrey thinks it's a bad idea for her to go on a trip to Europe for yoga. Lohan thinks better of it and decides to stay in the states. We're reminded that this ""docu-series"" is being directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice. We get a short history of Lindsay, from bright-eyed star of ""The Parent Trap"" to beleaguered actress-addict.

10 p.m.: ""Lindsay.""

Will this prove better than Lindsay Lohan's performance in the Lifetime movie ""Liz & Dick?"" And by better, meaning worse, meaning better? Anyhow, this is quite a jarring transition from tonight's premiere of Neil deGrasse-Tyson's ""Cosmos."" A lot of star-gazing, minus the profundity?

Whatever the case, whether car-crash TV or an enlightening character study, here's a running chronicle of the events in ""Lindsay,"" a new reality show on OWN, presented by Oprah Winfrey. A whole hour of Lohan, doing what she does. And Oprah, calling her on nonsense, at least once.

http://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/Lindsay-Lohan-has-Oprah-Winfrey-on-speed-dial-20140310,entertainment,"Los Angeles - Lindsay Lohan has Oprah Winfrey on speed dial.



The recovering actress has been mentored by the talk show star since she completed a 90-day court ordered stint in rehab last year, and says she feels blessed to have such a strong bond with her.



She told Extra TV: ""I love that I can call Oprah on the phone, and be like, 'Oprah, can we talk right now?' and she calls me within two minutes. I have to trick her into leaving voicemails, so I can just have Oprah's voicemails ... she's the coolest person ever.""



Lindsay, 27, has also filmed a docu-series for Oprah's OWN network which she is keen to stress isn't a reality show, and she says she had no control over what made the final cut.



She added: ""I did it because it's not a reality show, it's pretty raw. Obviously it's TV, so things will be edited in certain ways to get ratings, which I can't control, but I do know that my intentions going into it were really pure and really honest. I appreciate all that's happened and all that Oprah has done for me.""

http://home.nzcity.co.nz/news/article.aspx\?id=183450&amp;fm=newsmain%2Cnrhl,entertainment,"Lindsay Lohan says her legal issues are ""in the past"".

The 27-year-old actress has made a concerted effort to turn her life around after completing 90-days of court-ordered rehab last summer - which stemmed from an arrest for lying to police about a car crash in June 2012 - and she credits talk show legend Oprah Winfrey with helping her get back on track.

11 March 2014

Appearing on 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon' on Thursday night, she said of her legal problems: ""That is the past. I feel really lucky to be able to work with someone like Oprah and create. I have a really strong bond with her where I can call her for advice and she has become someone I can learn from in life.""



Lindsay gave an interview to Oprah right after leaving rehab last August and has filmed an eight-part reality show for her TV channel, OWN.



However, the 'Mean Girls' star hasn't seen any of the footage, which includes Oprah telling her to ""cut the bulls**t"".



She explained: ""I have seen nothing ... it is really interesting as I kept hearing my name [on trailers] and I get really uncomfortable with it.



""It is a television show so they want ratings - they picked the first two months after I got back to New York after I had been in treatment.""



Oprah, 60, has recently been accused of exploiting Lindsay by signing her up for a reality show, but the actress says the drama seen in the show isn't as it seems.



She added: ""I became really spiritual over this past year and I have been trying to find peace and serenity in my life. So of course they take the chaos of me moving after eight years of living in LA back to the city of New York. So it's like 'Oprah reprimands Lindsay!' ""

http://www.contactmusic.com/article/miley-cyrus-fan-dressing-room-leaves-note_4104407,entertainment,"Prior to Miley Cyrus' 'Bangerz' concert in Omaha, a crazed fan manage to avoid security and sneak into the 21 year-old's dressing room.

Last Wednesday (March 5th), approximately two hours before Cyrus was scheduled to hit the stage for a rehearsal, police were called to the CenturyLink Center.

An 18 year-old male named Tucker Salvesen was spotted on CCTV walking into restricted parts of the arena, including Miley's personal dressing room, reports Omaha television station KETV.

Tucker then posted a message to the 'Wrecking Ball' singer on Twitter, instructing her to look for a note he had left her.

In the tweet, the fan attached a photo of Miley's dressing room which was clearly marked ""Miley Cyrus.""

The police told the television station that Salvesen, who travelled all the way from Utah, told law enforcers he had been given a VIP pass from a truck driver working for the tour, and thought this gave him unrestricted access.

Unknown to Salvesen, VIP passes do not give access to the restricted areas where the star's dressing room was located.

According to the police report, the 18 year-old's message read, ""I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got broke ... we went through the same thing @ the same time ... Miley I love you!!! Please let me meet you.""

He also left his phone number and Twitter username for Cyrus.

The concert was scheduled for the following day, and when Salvesen arrived on the grounds of the arena, he was arrested by the local police on suspicion of misdemeanour criminal trespassing.

On the day of the concert, the crazed fan tweeted, ""I got arrested and missed the show because I came backstage yesterday when they were setting up #heartbroken.""

He continued, ""walked back there to take a look, saw her dressing room and next thing I know im@in handcuffs lol.""

Salvesen was detained the day of the concert in a public area at the CenturyLink Center and cited on suspicion of trespassing. Cyrus' publicist didn't immediately return a message from The Associated Press on Monday.",
http://www.gossipcop.com/tucker-salvesen-miley-cyrus-fan-dressing-room-note-arrested/,entertainment,"Miley Cyrus was born Destiny Hope Cyrus on November 23, 1992 to country singer Billy Ray Cyrus and wife Tish Cyrus. She earned her nickname, which she later made her legal name, after everyone would call her “Smiley.” The Cyrus family includes younger siblings Braison and Noah, older siblings Brandi and Trace, whom Billy Ray adopted from Tish’ previous relationship, along with a half-brother, Christopher, who was born to Billy Ray’s ex the same year as Cyrus. Country icon Dolly Parton is Cyrus’ godmother.

Partially inspired by her father, Cyrus developed an interest in singing and acting early on. Following the debut of “Hannah Montana” in 2006, in which Cyrus played a pop star living a double life, she became one of the Disney Channel’s biggest successes. In 2008, Cyrus scored her first Billboard Top 10 hit with the song “See You Again.” She then slowly began experimenting with a more racy image, as seen on a controversial “Vanity Fair” cover with her father, and in her 2009 Teen Choice Awards performance, during which she pole danced.

Following others hits like “7 Things,” “The Climb,” and “Party in the USA,” Cyrus debuted a new sound with her third studio album, “Can’t Be Tamed,” which was released in 2010, the same year she starred in “The Last Song.” The star continued to cause controversy after a leaked video showed her getting high. By the end of 2011, Cyrus was completely separated from the Disney brand.

No longer with the Mouse House-approved Hollywood Records, Cyrus signed with RCA and released her “Bangerz” album in 2013, with the hits “We Can’t Stop” and “Wrecking Ball.” At the MTV VMAs that year, she and Robin Thicke caused a huge firestorm with a sexually-suggestive performance, and Cyrus continued to push boundaries with nude photo shoots, outlandish concerts, and an outspoken love for marijuana.

Cyrus, however, spent part of 2014 sidelined with serious health woes. She began work on new music in 2015, which she rung in with new boyfriend Patrick Schwarzenegger. He was Cyrus’ first relationship since she and “Last Song” co-star Liam Hemsworth ended their engagement in 2013. However, they split up and Cyrus got re-engaged to Hemsworth, with whom she’s been for the past few years.",

An overzealous teenage boy was arrested on March 6 after he ended up in Miley Cyrus‘ dressing room backstage at a Nebraska concert and left the twerking pop singer a note, RadarOnline.com is reporting.

According to the police report, security cameras showed Tucker Salvensen, 18, walking in restricted areas backstage at the CenturyLink Center the day before the concert.

Salvensen basically incriminated himself, tweeting a photo of Cyrus’ dressing room and telling the singer he left her a note.

Salvensen, a Utah native, was arrested the next day on suspicion of misdemeanor criminal trespassing and missed Cyrus’ concert.

“I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got broke … we went through the same thing @ the same time,” the note read, according to the police report.

“Miley I love you!!! Please let me meet you.” Salvensen also left Cyrus his phone number and Twitter handle.

The teenager claims he was duped by a truck driver that gave him a VIP pass, which he thought gave him free reign to wander the entire building — and he says he would do it all over again.

http://popcrush.com/miley-cyrus-fans-sneaks-into-dressing-room-in-omaha/,entertainment,"It was almost an ""Oh My!"" moment in Omaha for Miley Cyrus. A fan, 18, snuck into the superstar's dressing room a day prior to her Bangerz Tour arriving in the Nebraska city.

That's scarier than any of the cray cray stuff that takes place while Miley is on the stage, entertaining her Smilers.

In all seriousness, the fan, named Tucker Salvesen, gained access to a restricted area of the Century Link Center on Wednesday, March 5. He said he received a pass from a truck driver on the tour, according to local news channel KETV reports.

He left a note, begging the singer to meet with him and followed up that old-fashioned transmission with a digital one – he then tweeted to Cyrus, telling her to look for his note and even showed a picture of her dressing room door.

According to authorities, Salvesen pledged his love for Cyrus and said that he found the answers to help cure his broken heart in her music and expressed empathy over the fact that they both went through breakups. That sounds somewhat sweet and innocuous, but sneaking in and leaving the note was an act of trespass.

The note read as follows, according to reports.

""I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got broke ... we went through the same thing @ the same time ... Miley I love you!!! Please let me meet you.""

The teen was detained on the day of the concert at the venue and cited on suspicion of trespassing, according to Yahoo!

While he didn't sneak into Miley's quarters while she was on site, the fact that he was able to bypass security and gain entry is somewhat frightening. Granted, it was a day in advance, so restrictions may have been lax as opposed to day of, but still.

What if he camped out all night waiting for her? Suppose he snuck up on her or left something threatening? You just never know and Cyrus' safety could have been compromised.",

On Monday night, Juan Pablo Galavis' polarizing run as the star of the ABC reality hit ended in quite the dramatic fashion: he didn't propose to Nikki or Clare, a first for the franchise since Brad Womack's first-go-around.

But that doesn't mean he ended the two-hour finale alone, as he still wanted to be with one of the ladies. ""I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not going to use it,"" he told Nikki, the pediatric nurse. ""I'm not 100 percent sure I want to propose to you, but at the same time I'm 100 percent sure I don't want to let you go.""

Her response to being offered the final rose, but not an engagement ring? ""Absolutely.""

NEWS: Was Juan Pablo ""the worst Bachelor"" ever? Producers thought so!

And during the After the Rose ceremony, Nikki and Juan Pablo confirmed that they are still in a relationship, but things were tense as it was revealed that JP has yet to tell Nikki he loves her and Chris Harrison was unable to get him to say it during the awkward hour-long special.

But that wasn't the episode's most shocking moment as Clare and Juan Pablo's relationship came to an explosive end, with the Venezuelan Bachelor actually saying, ""I'm glad I didn't pick her,"" after he told her she wasn't The One.

And we're surprised Clare even stuck around for the final rose ceremony, as the Venezuelan Bachelor said something to her that ""no woman wants to hear"" that the cameras didn't happen to catch. While Clare wouldn't repeat what he said, she described it as ""offensive"" and ""insulting."" He later than admitted he didn't know her that well and basically said he just liked hooking up with her.

But JP was able to convince Clare that he saw a future with her, one that even included children. And Clare was sucked right back in.

And Clare was mad as hell when Juan Pablo said goodbye to her at the final rose ceremony, calling him out for his ""awful"" behavior.

""I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, I thought that as you, I thought I knew what kind of man you were,"" she said, before doling out this doozy: ""I would never want my children having a father like you."" (Sorry, Camila!)

One of her parting remarks? ""Don't tell me you loved f--king me,"" she said in a talking head. (We wish she had a mic to drop at the end of that.)

And during the After the Rose ceremony, Clare refused to see JP, saying, ""I don't wanna sit here on this couch and get fed anymore BS.""

Happily ever after doesn't look all that happy for Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis and his chosen lady, Nikki Ferrell. The two were reunited in public for the first time since filming the finale on Monday's After the Final Rose special, and things got pretty awkward pretty quickly. Let's recap!

The ATFR special kicks off with Bachelor host Chris Harrison introducing Juan Pablo's runner-up, hairstylist Clare Crawley, who is as angry now as she was when Juan Pablo sent her packing in St. Lucia. Clare admits she should have left after the so-called helicopter incident in the finale, but says she ""trusted that there was a man here that wanted what [she] wanted.""

PHOTOS: Meet Juan Pablo's bachelorettes

Not so much anymore, though. Clare is done with Juan Pablo's excuses and explanations — so much so that she declines to sit down with him in front of the live studio audience. ""I don’t want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more BS,"" she explains, adding that she said all she needed to say in St. Lucia.

On that note, it's time to bring out Juan Pablo! The Venezuelan-born Bachelor is unapologetic about giving Clare the boot, telling Chris Harrison he stands by his choice. ""I made the decision that was best for me,"" he says, ""and it is what it is."" Chris gives Juan Pablo a bit of a hard time about his treatment of Clare in the helicopter, but Juan Pablo refuses to take the bait, saying only that he has ""nothing bad"" to say about her, regardless of what she says about him.

PHOTOS: Bachelor proposals, promise rings, and breakups

Maybe Nikki will be more talkative? Chris puts Juan Pablo's chosen lady in the hot seat next, and though she insists she's ""very happy"" with the Bachelor, she admits he has yet to tell her he loves her. ""He hasn't ever said those words to you?"" Chris asks her. ""Does that worry you?""

Nikki insists it doesn't, but Chris doesn't seem convinced. Juan Pablo apparently has a ""big surprise"" planned, though — something he promised an ""ABC executive"" while in St. Lucia.

So is this ""big surprise"" a ring? An ""I love you""? None of the above, actually. In fact, Juan Pablo says there is no surprise, and even goes so far as to declare that he and Nikki are ""done with this show"" for good. ""We are so done,"" he says.

PHOTOS: Failed reality TV romances

Asked by Chris how he feels about Nikki, Juan Pablo avoids the L-word, saying only, ""We feel great,"" which prompts Chris to ask again, ""So you love her?""

""I'm not going to answer that question. People don't understand that this is real life…We are happy we had the opportunity,"" he says. ""It's been tough…It hasn't been easy. What I'm feeling with Nikki is fantastic.""

Fantastic might be an overstatement, but Nikki backs him up. ""I just feel like, time will tell,"" she says. ""This is a real relationship to us.""

Juan Pablo Galavis (Craig Sjodin/ABC)

Whether you’ve seen angry rants about someone named “Juan Pablo” blowing up your Twitter feed or you’ve been roped into a “Bachelor” finale party on Monday night and haven’t seen a single episode, never fear — here’s a quick primer for everyone who is clueless about ABC’s hit reality show. Don’t be ashamed for wondering. It’s natural.

“The Bachelor”:

It’s one of those shows that everyone skewers, yet many of those very same people can’t stop watching. The finale airs Monday night from 8 to 11 p.m. on ABC. (Yes, three hours.) This is the network’s 18th season of its find-a-soulmate show and it remains a fixture in pop culture, even though ratings aren’t what they used to be. (Seriously — 18 seasons.) So far, two relationships have actually worked out long-term; one was Sean and Catherine, who married about a month ago. (Sister show “The Bachelorette” has had nine seasons, with two weddings and one engagement that still appears to be on. Not bad odds!)

The Bachelor:

Juan Pablo Galavis, 32, single dad to a sweet four-year-old daughter. Unfortunately: Also the reason this season has been pretty much a disaster, even turning die-hard viewers away. He’s been pretty sleazy, hooking up with more women than is usually acceptable even for a show that is exclusively about hooking up with as many women as possible as a means of finding a soulmate. Two contestants have dramatically quit, and he drove another to tears after a late-night rendezvous in the ocean that he tried to pretend didn’t happen the next day. (And off-camera, there were those anti-gay comments that went viral.) Viewers have not been happy, and the tabloids are filled with stories about how even the show’s producers think Juan Pablo has been the “worst Bachelor ever.”

The finalists:

And yet, there are two women still vying for his love. Or at least a giant diamond ring. Every finale, one of the tackiest scenes is when “Bachelor”-approved jeweler Neil Lane strolls out with a ginormous case of bling, while the Bachelor contemplates which one is the shiniest and also which of the two women he should propose to after knowing them for a few weeks.

Anyway, the contenders are Clare Crawley, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki Ferrell, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City. They do not get along. (Meanwhile, Clare is the one who took that swim in the ocean with Juan Pablo that caused so much controversy — but obviously he wasn’t too upset about it.)

The actual finale:

Buckle up, because this is a three-hour “journey,” to use one of the show’s favorite words. First, there’s the two-hour show where Juan Pablo will spend a lot of time gazing over the ocean (the finale taped in St. Lucia) and decide which woman he wants to marry, or at least pretend to marry for the purposes of this program. And after an agonizingly long process, both women — decked out in evening dresses — will stroll out to meet Juan Pablo, who will be standing in a forest or something, where he’ll either propose or dump them. It will be magical.

Then, the real fireworks start at 10 p.m. with the “After the Final Rose” special. The actual “Bachelor” was filmed months ago, and now everyone (Juan Pablo, the finalists, other rejected contestants) joins together on live television to rehash the season and find out what everyone’s been up to. Translation: Are Juan Pablo and the winner actually still together? Chris Harrison will ask completely invasive questions. It will be awkward, in the most glorious way possible.

“The Bachelorette”:

Another fun fact about the “After the Final Rose” special: That’s where we learn the identity of next season’s “Bachelorette,” almost always a reject from the previous “Bachelor” season. Rumors are that lawyer Andi Dorfman — the final three contender who stormed off and dumped Juan Pablo in a “shocking” twist a couple weeks ago — will get the honor, and have 25 eligible men competing for her.",

http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/542716/20140311/bachelor-season-18-finale-juan-pablo-galavis.htm,entertainment,"One of the most controversial seasons of ""The Bachelor"" came to an end on Monday with Juan Pablo Galavis giving the final rose to Nikki Ferrell.

But unlike the previous seasons, a proposal wasn't forthcoming as Galavis said he wasn't sure whether he wanted to marry Ferrell.

""I have a ring here in my pocket and I'm not going to use it,"" he told Ferrell. ""I'm not 100 percent sure that I want to propose you, but at the same time, I'm 100 percent sure that I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot. So, Nikki, will you accept my final rose?""

Although Ferrell accepted the rose, she seemed to have been expecting a proposal. On various occasions Ferrell had professed her love for Galavis, but he has never returned the sentiment.

Is marriage on the cards for Ferrell and Galavis? Only time will tell.

Meanwhile, Clare Crawley left with a heavy heart saying Galavis was not the man she was expecting.

When the single dad approached Crawley and said that he would have to send her home, she was livid and said that she stuck around because she believed in him.

""I lost respect for you ... I thought I knew what kind of man you were. But what you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you,"" Crawley said before walking away.

And Galavis' response? ""Whew, I'm glad I didn't pick her.""

Referring to an off-camera moment the couple had, Clare said that she gave Galavis another chance to come closer when he said he doesn't know her at all. But it ended badly when he took her on a helicopter date and insulted her.

An insider told Wetpaint that ""Clare asked Juan Pablo, ""Just tell me you love me,"" knowing that Galavis may be hesitant to declare his love on camera. And he said, ""I really loved f—ing you.""

Back in the studio live after the final rose segment, both Galavis and Ferrell looked awkward and refused to speak about their relationship.

This was unlike the previous seasons when the couple expressed their relief at being able to flaunt their relationship after three months of hiding.

Ferrell was also not wearing an engagement ring, indicating that their relationship had not proceeded further.

The situation became even more awkward when ""The Bachelor"" host Chris Harrison asked Galavis if he loved Ferrell.

""I'm not going to answer that question,"" Galavis said. ""People don't understand this is real life. We're very happy and we are so done with the show.""

""So….you're not gonna tell us you love her?"" a confused Harrison asks. ""This is what this show is about. We're on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.""

But the couple remained evasive and explained that although they have made plans for the future, they would not divulge the details.

The show ended with Harrison announcing Andi Dorfman as the next Bachelorette.

The new season of ""The Bachelorette"" will premiere on 19 May.",

It may have taken me the entire season to figure out that I really hated Juan Pablo, but also to realize who Clare Crawley looks like.

But I finally figured it out. And you’ll see it, if you check the face shape. (Though her chin is bigger.) It’s in the nose. It’s not about hair color.

I’m talking about a former star of The CW. Someone who recently got engaged. A brunette.

The 32-year-old Venezuelan soccer player — who managed to get in trouble every step of the way — chose to give his last rose to Nikki Ferrell, 23, from Kansas City, MO, after a twisty finale that had all but indicated the he would choose Clare.

Juan Pablo had almost scared Clare off completely by telling her something disrespectful and ""sexual"" while the audio wasn't hooked up. He reassured her the next day that he really liked her and wanted kids with her in the oddly specific time period of one year and two months. Then he sent her home. To everyone's delight, she did not go quietly into that sunny beach. ""What you just made me go through, I would never want my kids to have a father like you,"" she said. Once she had walked out of earshot, Juan Pablo muttered, ""Wow, I'm glad I didn't pick her."" Cue the entire audience's boos.

Nikki seemed overjoyed to get the final rose, though Juan Pablo wouldn't say he was in love with her, nor would he give her the ring in his pocket. Even at the after show, Juan Pablo still refused to say he was in love with Nikki. I'm curious what you think of the episode — vote and sound off below.",

As we’ve seen many times before, Juan Pablo Galavis does not like to lose fights, so after he sent Clare Crawley home and she dissed him, he decided to return the favor by getting in one last nasty comment as she left. Talk about egotistical!

It’s hard enough to lose any competition, but when it’s a competition like The Bachelor where your heart is on the line, losing can be devastating.

[hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]

It’s been so clear throughout the season, and especially during the March 10 finale, just how much Juan Pablo meant to Clare. So to see him diss her after sending her home just seemed wrong.

Clare may have given him some ammo when she said she would never want someone like him to be the father of her children, but he had just turned her down on live television so from where we’re standing, she had the right to make that comment.

But instead of being chivalrous and keeping quiet during the After the Final Rose special, Juan Pablo just had to diss Clare. “I’m glad I didn’t pick her,” he blurted out for all of the world to hear. Unbelievable!

Clare Crawley Knew Juan Pablo Galavis Wasn’t The One

This whole exchange, including Clare’s diss, was shocking. But Clare admitted that she had a gut feeling that Juan Pablo wasn’t the one, and that’s why she called him into her room to talk the night before the ceremony.

Though we don’t know for sure what was said during their infamous helicopter ride, we do know it really rubbed Clare the wrong way. From that moment, we really think she knew that Juan Pablo was not the man for her.

What did YOU think of the show, HollywoodLifers? Do you think it was cruel of Juan Pablo to diss Clare? Let us know!

But no one was more appalled by Juan Pablo’s behavior than former ‘Bachelor’ star Catherine Giudici, who gave him a BIG piece of her mind for dissing Nikki by not popping the question.

We’re sure everyone from Clare Crawley to Chris Harrison would have enjoyed telling off Juan Pablo Galavis during The Bachelor‘s After the Final Rose special on March 10. In the end, it was Bachelor alum Catherine Giudici who slammed Juan Pablo — and we could be happier about her bold diss!

Catherine Giudici Disses Juan Pablo On ‘After The Final Rose’ For No Proposal

Juan Pablo was tight-lipped to the point of being disrespectful during the After the Final Rose special, refusing to open up about his feelings for Nikki or any of their plans for the future. Whenever Chris asked him a question, Juan Pablo replied by saying that the world should respect his and Nikki’s privacy now that the show is over.

[hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″]

[hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]

The most infuriating part about all of this was that Juan Pablo knew exactly what he was signing up for when he agreed to be the next Bachelor. Chris said as much, but since he was the host he had to hold back a bit. Catherine, however, did not!

She and her husband, fellow Bachelor alum Sean Lowe, were in attendance for the show and they seemed just as disgusted by Juan’s bad behavior as the rest of us!

Catherine told Juan he was dissing The Bachelor and the show’s entire process, not to mention Nikki, by not proposing to her and revealing his true feelings during After the Final Rose. “Don’t slap the hand that fed you,” she tells Juan Pablo. Of course, this phrase was lost on Juan Pablo, but thankfully Chris made sure he got the message.

Sean Lowe Slams Juan Pablo: Tell Nikki You Love Her

Sean, ever the gentleman, just couldn’t understand how Juan Pablo could humiliate the woman who won his heart by refusing to profess his love for her on the show. Sean tells Juan Pablo that he fell madly in love with Catherine when they were on The Bachelor, and once he knew she was the one, he didn’t hold back.

“The moment I knew, I could not wait to tell her that,” Sean says. How sweet! Now that’s the kind of Bachelor we like to see. Juan Pablo could definitely take a few pointers from Sean!

So HollywoodLifers, are YOU glad Catherine and Sean told Juan Pablo off? Share your thoughts in the comments below!

NIKKI! NIKKI! NIKKI! NIKKI!

After dumping her at the final rose ceremony, Clare told Juan Pablo that she “would never want my children having a father like you.” He had told her the last night he had seen her that he could see himself living in Sacramento with her and having children together. She felt disrespected that he would say those things if he wasn’t planning on choosing her. Once Clare walked away, Juan Pablo said to himself “I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”

When Nikki came to the rose ceremony, Juan Pablo told her that he does not want to let her go, but that he is not ready to propose. He asked her to accept his final rose, and she accepted.",

The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.

Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.”

Both Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley looked absolutely beautiful when they met Juan Pablo Galavis for that final rose — after he took them home to meet his family. So, who did he choose? And who totally dissed him after getting sent home?

‘The Bachelor’ Finale Recap

We know you can’t wait to hear who he picks, but first, let us fill you in on what you missed on The Bachelor finale.

Meeting the parents is apparently just as awkward for the Bachelor and his leading ladies as it is for normal couples, huh? [hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″][hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]

When Juan Pablo brought home Nikki and Clare to get to meet his parents, brother, cousin and of course, his daughter Camila, it was just about as awkward as you’d imagine. Clare was of course eager as could be to meet his parents — she totally told his mom everything and more, and they really clicked. She explained how great of a listener he was (what?) and that he was always honest even if it was something she didn’t want to hear — this led to Juan Pablo’s mom agreeing with what we’ve all been thinking: he can be “very rude!” She even said that he’s made her cry before!

As for Nikki, she dove right in too. She wanted to know if his mom thought he was ready. Of course, the answer was that she was “pretty sure” — probably not exactly the answer that she was looking for now that it’s down to the final two. She also sat down with Juan Pablo’s cousin for an awkward conversation about fighting, Juan Pablo’s attitude, and how she’ll deal with it. She said she thought they would “fight well” together. Whatever that means!

Juan Pablo’s Final Dates: Nikki & Clare Want More

For his last date with Clare, he takes her away in a helicopter ride — and when they landed there was no cameras or lights, and Clare was, of course excited for a moment alone with him so he could whisper some sweet nothings in her ear. Instead though, he told her that that he didn’t know her at all as well as “some sexual thing” that she couldn’t even repeat. Naturally, she was heartbroken.

However, she called him out on it and told him that if there were doubts, it needed to be open because to her it’s much more than physical and she’s much more than a hook up. After he spent some time begging her for a kiss, she finally told him she needed to know where his head was at, and he said all the right things — that he could see a future with her. He even played “No Better Lovers” by Josh Krajcik, which they danced to together earlier in the season. Of course, Clare said they can dance to it at their wedding.

After all that awkwardness, we almost forgot he had to take out Nikki. Right away, she was explaining to the cameras that she too wanted to know how he felt. But, of course he said it was gonna be “okay.” It was clear that she really “wanted forever” as she put it, as she even framed a picture of them along with a super sweet card. After he left, she wasn’t happy — she sat and balled her eyes out.

Juan Pablo Turns Down Clare

I don’t think I’ve ever been so heartbroken before in my life. The moment that JP said “I have to say goodbye to you” to Clare, my heart seriously broke. After he told her, he went in for a hug — and she put her hands up — and the crowd applauded. Good for her! She called him out on saying that she could see himself with her in Sacramento, having kids with her, etc., and said that she “believed in us.”

“I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, I thought that as you, I thought I knew what kind of man you were,” she said before COMPLETELY slamming him, saying “I would never want my children having a father like you.” Juan Pablo proved right there it wasn’t a match when he said, “I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”

It got even more intense when Clare said to the cameras, “Don’t tell me you loved f–king me.” Ouch!

Juan Pablo Has A Ring . . . But Doesn’t Know How To Use It

Next up was Nikki, who had no idea what just went down. However, she told Juan Pablo how much she loved him and he answered by telling her that there are many things that he loves about her. He also brought up the fact that Nikki’s father told him to be 100% sure if he was going to purpose!

“I’m not 100% sure that I want to propose to you but I’m 100% sure that I don’t want to let you go,” he told her, adding, “I like you a lot. So Nikki, will you except my final rose?”

Of course she did, but he still never said “I love you!”

So, are they still together– tune in to After the Final Rose to see! Were you happy with his final decision, HollywoodLifers? Let us know!

The former pro soccer player chooses between Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley in the season 18 finale of the dating show.

Mar 11, 2014

AceShowbiz - %cJuan Pablo Galavis% may spark a new debate with his final decision on ""The Bachelor"". In the season 18 finale aired on Monday, March 10, the soccer stud took Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley to meet his family before choosing one of them.

Clare was the first to meet Juan Pablo's family in St. Lucia. His father Saul gave his approval, telling Clare, ""I love you"" in Spanish. Juan Pablo's mother admitted her son was ""sometimes very rude,"" and Clare said, ""It made me cry."" Still, Clare felt that ""he gets me."" She also told Juan Pablo's cousin, Rodolfo, that she's ""falling in love.""

Things, however, got awkward during their final date. Whisked on a helicopter, Clare claimed Juan Pablo whispered something offensive when they landed. ""What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth. And I was shocked,"" she said. ""He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. ... It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.""

Clare later confronted Juan Pablo, saying that she would leave if he felt their relationship was ""just a physical connection."" He managed to convince her to stay, telling the camera, ""We have had our ups and downs but I know that she could be the one. I just know it.""

When Nikki met Juan Pablo's family, his mother thought, ""She's very strong. If he chooses this girl, I think she is going to say 'yes.' "" Nikki was confident that he would propose to her in a few days, while Juan Pablo was seemingly torn between the two. ""Can I keep both?"" he said to the camera.

For their final date, they had a boat ride. Nikki wanted to hear him say, ""I love you,"" but he didn't. She admitted to Juan Pablo that ""it's kind of scary,"" and he told her, ""However it's gonna be, it's gonna be.""

Before he left, Nikki gave him a photo of them kissing and a note that says, ""I love you."" He kissed her and said, ""I'll see you tomorrow,"" leaving Nikki in tears.

When it's time for the final Rose Ceremony, Clare arrived first in a long turquoise dress. Calling her ""such an amazing woman,"" Juan Pablo said, ""I got to follow what I think is best for me and I have to say goodbye to you."" He tried to hug her but she pushed him away.

Clare was clearly upset as she told him before leaving, ""I lost respect for you."" She added, ""I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you... What you just made me go through - I would never want my children having a father like you."" His response was, ""Whew! I'm glad I didn't pick her!""

Nikki later showed up in a blue dress with a thigh high slit. She spoke first, telling him, ""I want you to be a part of my life. I've never felt like this before. ... I've waited a long time for this. ... I can't imagine spending my life without you. ... I love you.""

Juan Pablo said, ""Nikki, I love so many things about you. ... You're like me, very honest. ... It's been a perfect time every time I've been with you."" He continued, ""I have a ring in my pocket, but I'm not 100|percent| sure that I want to propose to you. But I'm 100|percent| sure I don't want to let you go. I like you a lot.""

He asked her if she would accept his final rose and she answered, ""Absolutely."" They kissed and he lifted her up.

During the ""After the Final Rose"" special, Clare couldn't hide her anger. She didn't want to meet Juan Pablo and said before exiting, ""I don't want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more b.s.""

Juan Pablo entered later, explaining his relationship with Clare, ""We had a roller coaster. We lived through it. It worked out the way it worked out. I have nothing bad to talk about Clare. She was there for a reason. I'm not the guy.""

Juan Pablo returned backstage when Nikki came out. She said she's still in love with Juan Pablo, but when asked if he loved her, she said, ""Um, I don't know."" Though he didn't say it, Nikki said, ""I know that he does. He wouldn't be here if he didn't care about me.""

Juan Pablo then returned on stage and joined Nikki. He said they're ""very happy,"" but refused to say if he loved her when pressed by host %cChris Harrison%. ""I'm not going to answer that question. People don't understand that this is real life... We're very happy We're done with the show. We are so done. We are happy we had the opportunity.. .It's been tough. You have been boxing with me. It hasn't been easy. ... What I'm feeling with Nikki is fantastic,"" he reasoned.

Nikki defended him, saying, ""It doesn't matter if we say we are or aren't. Time will tell.""",

Immediately following the big finale on Monday night, Juan Pablo caught up with the ladies of the show, Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell, for what became a very heated The Bachelor: After The Final Rose reunion.

It should come as no surprise to those watching this season, that things got awkward.

http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/03/10/bachelor-recap-juan-pablo-makes-his-choice-in-awkward-unprecedented-finale/,entertainment,"Whew. The worst — and most bizarre — season of ""The Bachelor"" is finally over.

After a rocky season filled with tears, anger and controversial comments, Bachelor Juan Pablo did not get down on one knee to propose to a lucky bride-to-be in Saint Lucia. Instead, he offered the last woman standing, Nikki Ferrell, just a rose.

“I can’t imagine spending my life without you,” Nikki, 26, told Juan Pablo, clearly expecting a diamond ring. “I love you.”

“I can see you as a good stepmom for Camilla,” Juan Pablo, 32, said. “It’s been a perfect time every time I’m with you.”

Then it got awkward.

“I have a ring here in my pocket and I’m not going to use it,” he said. “I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go. I like you a lot. So, Nikki, will you accept my final rose?”

“Absolutely,” Nikki said.

Really?

Runner-up Clare Crawley’s departure was just as uncomfortable.

“I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along,” Juan Pablo told Clare. “But I have to follow what I think is best for me. I’ll have to say goodbye to you.”

Clare is livid.

“This entire time I’ve stuck around because I believed in you,” she said, fighting back tears. “I needed that reassurance [on our date last night] and I gave you that opportunity right then.”

Clare was alluding to an off-camera moment during the pair’s last date, when Juan Pablo told Clare he barely knew her at all.

“He told me that he really doesn’t know me and then said some sexual thing,” Clare said the night before. “It was insulting and it made me feel awful. The words he used…I can’t even repeat it.”

Clare cited Sharleen Joynt and Andi Dorfman, two women who exited the show as soon as they weren’t feeling the relationship.

“You had every opportunity like those other girls did to tell me how you felt,” she said. “I lose respect for you. I would never want my children having a father like you.”

Ouch.

Even more ouch? Juan Pablo’s comment under his breath when Clare ran away in tears.

“I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”

The show got even more bizarre during the live “After the Final Rose” special after the taped finale.

Juan Pablo and Nikki made their first appearance in public together, and while most “Bachelor” couples gush about finally being able to appear together after three months of hiding, profess their love repeatedly and show off engagement rings, the mood was quite awkward and emotionless.

“So you love her?” host Chris Harrison asked.

“I’m not going to answer that question,” Juan Pablo said. “People don’t understand this is real life. We’re very happy and we are so done with the show.”

“So….you’re not gonna tell us you love her?” Chris asked, obviously baffled. “This is what this show is about. We’re on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.”

Chris polled former “Bachelor” alums in the audience, newlyweds Catherine and Sean Lowe, who tried to explain to Juan Pablo that he signed up for a reality show and the spotlight is part of the deal.

“Don’t bite the hand that fed you,” Catherine said, to loud applause from the studio audience.

“This is a real relationship to us,” Nikki said. “We’re taking it very seriously. He has a daughter, he doesn’t just have himself to think about.”

“Sorry the show didn’t end up like you guys wanted it to,” Juan Pablo said, to boos from the audience.

“This is so awkward,” Chris said laughing, as he tried one more time to get just a bit of information from the couple by asking them their plans for the future.

“We have our plans,” Juan Pablo said. “It’s something we want to keep private.”

“Bachelor” fans breathed a collective sigh of relief when the show cut to a commercial break and Chris was able to announce the new Bachelorette — Atlanta assistant district attorney and fan-favorite — Andi.

Clare Crowley has had enough of Juan Pablo Galavis. After he sent her home during the season 18 finale of The Bachelor, she realized he wasn’t at all who she wanted. So, when Chris Harrison asked if she wanted to see him, she flat out said no.

Clare Crawley Refuses To See Juan Pablo

We’ve got to say — go Clare! When Chris Harrison asked if she wanted to bring out Juan Pablo, she admitted that she had thought about that.[hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″][hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]

“Looking back and thinking about that day in St. Lucia, that day was pivotal for me, because I had never been able to stand up for myself to a man before,” she explained. “I think so many women can relate to that where you want to have hope, and you give it chance after chance, and it was so liberating to be able to stand there and say, ‘this is exactly how I feel’ and ‘it’s not okay.’ To be able to stand there, to be able to say every word and how I felt, and get it all out there that day in St. Lucia — that was my closure. That was all I needed, and that enough was closer for me. I don’t wanna sit here on this couch and get fed anymore BS.”

So, Chris asked if there was anything she wanted him to say or ask.

Clare: ‘I’ve Moved Forward’

“You know what, ‘no.’ I’ve moved on, I’ve moved forward,” she explained. “Watching it back, is closure for me and it’s all the answers that I needed. He’s plain and simple not the man that I thought he was, and it’s so disappointing because I had such high hope for it.”

After he completely broke her art by not only choosing Nikki Ferrell, but by leading her on and really offending her, it’s not surprising that she didn’t want to. What do you think, HollywoodLifers? Should she have sat down and talked with him again? Let us know!

Yes, it’s true, despite the lack of the usual proposal ending, Juan Pablo Galavis chose Nikki Ferrell as the winner of his heart — and she looked absolutely stunning in her flowing blue finale gown!

Nikki Ferrell’s ‘Bachelor’ Finale Dress — Stunning Blue Gown

Nikki’s sleeveless dress was her signature royal blue in color and it featured a draped low cowl neck as well as a very long, sexy slit up the side — almost all the way up to her hip bone!

[hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″]

[hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]

The color perfectly complimented her beautiful blonde locks, which she wore half-back and away from her face. And although the dress was fitted, it still managed to look flowing, which is a credit to the 26-year-old winner’s rocking bod and extremely long, graceful legs.

Even though Juan Pablo didn’t propose to Nikki in the end of the show, she still won him over more than any of the other ladies — which is not surprising, considering how stunning she is! This dress, classic and elegant, was the perfect choice for Nikki’s final rose ceremony, and it certainly made for beautiful TV.

Clare Crawley Shines In Turquoise

Despite her loss tonight, Clare Crawley‘s finale look is still worth mentioning. She wore an ornate, floor-length turquoise gown that was both beautiful and flattering.

The one-shoulder draped extravaganza also featured a slit, though not quite as high as Nikki’s! It showed off Clare’s petite frame as well, thanks to a thick rhinestone band around her waist.

Although she didn’t end up with the final rose, Clare still looked beautiful and she can go home proud as the final runner-up to Juan Pablo’s corazon.

Whose dress was your favorite, HollywoodLifers — Clare’s or Nikki’s? Let us know!

http://www.mediaite.com/tv/juan-pablo-seals-fate-as-most-despised-bachelor-ever/,entertainment,"If tonight’s Twitter reaction is any indication, Juan Pablo Galavis has effectively sealed his fate as The Bachelor‘s most despised contestant ever.

We had to do our own background research to provide you the background, so here goes: Galavis had previously drawn outrage for comments about a potential gay Bachelor being “too hard to watch” because homosexuals tend to be “more pervert.”



Since then, his tenure with the show has been marred by battles with executive producers over those comments, and his general on-air behavior. But his actions in tonight’s finale took home the prize for odiousness, according to the internet.

Apparently Galavis’ selection between the top two choices to receive a proposal for marriage (What even is this show?) ended in an incredibly awkward fashion: One girl went home in tears, while the winner was given a non-proposal, told he “liked” her, and offered a rose as consolation of some sort.

Flash forward to the live, in-studio conversation between Galavis, the winner Nikki Ferrell, and host Chris Harrison. Galavis accused his host of repeatedly interrupting him, while refusing to go anywhere near saying he “loves” Ferrell, even though the 26-year-old woman has said multiple times that she has fallen “in love” with him. The audience boos, previous Bachelors chime in to rebuke Galavis — the whole thing is bizarre, even from an outsider perspective.

If you need any further proof of how much this man is now despised, just look at the tweets here. Some examples:

http://newsok.com/who-got-juan-pablos-final-rose/article/feed/660674,entertainment,"The Bachelor's Juan Pablo Galavis has spent weeks looking for love among 27 women vying for his affection, and after narrowing it down to pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell and hairdresser Clare Crawley, he at last gave away his final rose to Nikki on Monday night's show --but did he propose?

The 32-year-old Venezuelan former pro-soccer player and single dad started off the finale by bringing Clare and Nikki to meet his extended family in Saint Lucia.

Clare, 32, was the first to be introduced to his relatives, and had intimate conversations with Juan Pablo's mother, father and brother where they welcomed her with open arms. However, they warned Clare in a roundabout way that Juan Pablo might not be the easiest person to start a relationship with.

Warning: Massive Bachelor season 18 spoilers ahead! If you haven’t yet seen the March 10 season finale of Juan Pablo Galavis’ season of the Bachelor, don’t continue reading!

In what will surely be one of the most contested, debated Bachelor seasons ever — so many tears! — season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis gave out his final rose to one, er, lucky lady. In the end, the polarizing 32-year-old Venezuelan-born hunk’s final choice was between hairstylist Clare Crawley and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell. So which “lucky” lady got the final rose? Let’s recap!

PHOTOS: Juan Pablo's bachelorettes

The action begins in St. Lucia, with both Clare, 32, and Nikki, 26, meeting Juan Pablo’s straight-talking family. Clare’s up first, and she wastes no time before telling Juan Pablo’s mom, Nelly, that she’s in love with her son. Nelly, in turn, answers honestly when Clare asks if Juan Pablo has any ticks she should know about. “He’s hyperactive,” she replies. “He sometimes is very rude.” Juan Pablo’s cousin Rodolfo has some harsh truths for Clare, too, telling her that the man she’s in love with is the kind of guy who will walk away when things “get rough.” None of this changes Clare’s feelings, though; she maintains that it’ll be “the best day of [her] life” if Juan Pablo proposes.

Nikki gets more of the same from Juan Pablo’s family. “He’s not an easy guy,” Juan Pablo’s father warns her. “It’s always about what he wants.” To drive the point home, Nelly tells Nikki that the fantasies she has of their life together — game nights and family beach trips — are just that. “You feel he is the kind of guy you want?” Nelly asks. “You’re sure?” Nikki insists she is, but it’s kind of hard to believe, given that even Juan Pablo’s family doesn’t seem to like him all that much.

Moving on to the final one-on-one dates! Clare’s up first again, and she happily joins Juan Pablo on a helicopter ride over St. Lucia. Somewhere between takeoff and landing, though, the “happily” part goes away. Once on solid ground again, Clare reveals Juan Pablo whispered something in her ear that she can’t bear to even repeat. “What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth, and I’m shocked, she says. “He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. That he doesn’t know me and some sexual thing I don’t want to repeat. It was insulting and it was offensive…Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he’s not the man I thought he was.”

Later that night, in her hotel room, she confronts Juan Pablo about what he said to her. He deflects any blame from himself and tries to gloss over the situation by saying that he’s just struggling with the decision he has to make between her and Nikki. He also assures Clare that she’s special to him, and even goes so far as to say that if they end up together, they’ll have a baby in no time. “Now it’s like I know it’s definitely a lot more than physical attraction between us,” she says in a confessional, apparently satisfied with his explanation. “Tonight, I know that he wants me here.”

Ah, but what about tomorrow? Nikki’s final one-on-one date is up next, and she and Juan Pablo can’t keep their hands off each other. There’s a lot of making out — but what Nikki really wants is for Juan Pablo to tell her he loves her. “I’m in love with this guy,” she gushes. “I want forever with him. I do!”

The question, of course, is whether he wants the same thing with her. Fortunately, she doesn’t have to wait long to find out. After a brief commercial break, the camera zooms in on Juan Pablo at the final rose ceremony, where he’s waiting to meet Clare. He feeds her some platitudes about how “unbelievable” and “amazing” she is, and then cuts to the chase: “I wish the earth sucked me today, because this is the hardest decision.” Clare is heartbroken — but more than that, she’s angry, and she rejects Juan Pablo’s goodbye hug. “I’ve saved this moment for the man of my dreams, and I thought that was you,” she says bitterly. “What you just made me go through — I would never want my children having a father like you.”

Juan Pablo’s response? “Whoo! I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”

So how does he feel about the woman he did pick? Lukewarm, apparently. Though he “chooses” Nikki at the final rose ceremony, he’s not quite ready to tell her he loves her. “I love how much you care about other people,” he begins. “I love your honesty, so much…I can see you as a good stepmom for Camila.” That said, he’s not ready to see her as a good wife for himself. “I have a ring in my pocket, but I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you,” he confesses. “But I’m 100 percent sure I don’t want to let you go. I like you a lot. A lot.”

Good enough! “Nikki, will you accept my final rose?” he asks. “Absolutely,” she replies.

http://www.gossipcop.com/juan-pablo-nikki-after-final-rose-love-still-dating-chris-harrison-awkward-video/,entertainment,"“The Bachelor” premiered on March, 25, 2002 on ABC, with the premise of 25 women competing for the heart of one man. Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.

The contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.

The first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.”

The series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.

Though “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run. Rehn, Mesnick, Hebert, and Lowe have all had weddings specials air on ABC.",

Clare and Nikki’s family meet ups go exactly the same. They both meet Juan Pablo’s mother, father, cousin, brother, sister, daughter, and niece. Juan Pablo’s family is amazing in that they are not one hundred percent on #TeamJuanPablo. All of them express concern that Juan Pablo isn’t great in relationships and needs someone who will stick with him and not run because that’s what he tends to do. Juan Pablo’s mom tells Clare, “He is sometimes very rude.” Clare responds that he made her cry and the mom says, “Me too.” Basically, this guy is trouble and his family knows it. Juan Pablo’s mom has another great quote she tells to Nikki that sums everything up, “He is charismatic, but Juan Pablo is not easy.”This is when things start getting wild. Clare and Juan Pablo go for a helicopter ride around St. Lucia and we find out that there was a point, during landing, when the cameras and microphones were off and Juan Pablo told Clare something. We find out because even though the microphones were off, that doesn’t mean Clare isn’t going to tell in the confessional as soon as possible. She says that JP told her he doesn’t really know her and made a weird sexual comment. She is very upset about it and I’m like, “Oh snap! Another lady is going to leave!” But not so fast…Later, Juan Pablo arrives to Clare’s hotel room for the second part of their date — calm your jets, it’s a suite and they’re just hanging in the living room — and she brings up what he said in the helicopter. He says something along the lines of, of course they don’t know everything about each other because it’s been such a short time and he tells her that he can see having babies with her very soon. It’s not a convincing argument AT ALL, but Clare gathers that this is reassurance and feels better, doesn’t leave, and is totally on board again.Nikki and Juan Pablo go on a boat (helicopter was already taken) and it’s totally boring. Absolutely nothing of interest happens. During the night time portion, Nikki gives him a framed photo of them riding horses (That time when he said if she was riding the horse in a thong , he would ride behind her. Yuck!) and a card that professes her love. I thought that at the end of the date he whispered something in her ear, which caused her to cry when he left, but it’s never brought up again so I guess she just cried because she was overcome with emotion.Clare enters the Rose Ceremony very confident. I mean, they have already been through two fights in their brief time together and so obviously that means that they have a strong foundation and not ""OMG get out because no one should fight that much that soon!"" Juan Pablo rejects Clare and seems totally calm and collected about doing it. Clare gets very upset, as she should, and tells him that she gave him a chance to let her go the other night, but he reassured her that she should stick around. (Again, he did an undeniably poor job of this.) She tells him that she lost all respect for him and that she would never want a man like him raising her children. Go Clare! I never really cared for her, but she told it like it was in this situation and I was glad to see her escape his clutches.The poison cherry on the top of all of this is that as soon as Clare is out of sight, Juan Pablo says, “Woo! I’m glad I didn’t pick her!” He. Is. The. Worst.Nikki shows up for her portion of the Rose Ceremony and as she approaches, Juan Pablo is shown holding an engagement ring and then a single rose. Nikki says her spiel about falling in love and Juan Pablo brings up the point her father made during hometown visits about not proposing unless he’s 100 percent sure. He tells her that he is not going to use the ring, but says “I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t wanna let you go.” Never says, ""I love you."" She accepts the rose and they live happily ever after for two weeks until she inevitably realizes that he’s a horrible boyfriend and definitely not husband material.Or maybe you watched the after-show and already know what goes down. We’re keeping it to the proper episode of The Bachelor here, so that’s all folks!",

http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/03/10/juan-pablo-bad-in-bed-sex-diss-bachelor/,entertainment,"Talk about a dig — literally. Juan Pablo wasn’t a favorite of the women in the house, so it’s no surprise that one of the contestants is talking to her friends . . . and claiming he’s bad in bed!

It seems like every day it’s a different diss on Juan Pablo Galavis! The newest however, is one of the most personal we’ve ever heard! Apparently it’s not just the language that he’s not good at, he also isn’t entertaining in the bedroom.

Juan Pablo ‘Bad In Bed’

“I’ve heard from someone on the show that Juan Pablo is bad in bed,” a friend of one of The Bachelor contestants told Life & Style mag. “He’s like a jack-hammer!”

See, now you know what I mean when I say “ouch!”

Of course we haven’t see Juan Pablo actually hook up with any of the girls, they have had overnight dates and Clare was alone with him in the ocean that night!

Juan Pablo has been dissed repeatedly during his run as the Bachelor — by people on the show! After Andi Dorfman went off on him after the over night dates, she took to Instagram to actually mock him wiping something off her face.



Then she captioned it with, “ees ok,” mocking his accent.

So, it’s no secret that he’s not a favorite. “The reason he was so interested in being the Bachelor was to make money and become more famous,” an insider told the magazine. “He’s always actively looking for money and work.”

What do you think about the diss HollywoodLifers? Do you think it could be true or that one of the girls is just making things up? Let us know!

Just in case you were wondering if there was anything worse than watching Monday night’s “Bachelor” finale, there was: The “After the Final Rose” special. We listened to Chris Harrison try every trick in the book to get information on this season of the show from Juan Pablo Galavis, and was met with a rude, arrogant, entitled guy who refused to play any part of the game.

So where is what Juan Pablo did. He refused to say that he loved Nikki Ferrell on-camera, he didn’t really want to be there, and he didn’t want to even say where he was going to live or what he was going to do with her.

Why was he so upset? Here’s our feeling on it: He said two weeks ago that his plans changed drastically, and our theory on that is that he was probably going to be on “Dancing with the Stars,” and ABC at the last minute decided that they didn’t want him on the show. (We can only imagine why.) If this theory is right, he’s probably annoyed at the network and wanted to take it out on the network by not being anywhere close to the same guy that he was at the start of the show. He really did, to quote Catherine Giudici during this segment of the show, want to bite the hand that felt them. We don’t exactly think that “The Bachelor” is the land of all that is good and holy and that people are always on the show for love, but we do certainly think that more often than not, they are at least open and accepting of what the duties are. We felt for Chris Harrison, and it’s not often that we feel for him.

This whole hour was a complete disaster, and ironically, we would have so much more sympathy for Juan Pablo if he was a guy who went through the experience, and realized after the fact while watching it that he doesn’t like the concept of fame and what has happened to him. Instead, he came across as a guy who was bitter that he didn’t get what he wanted from it, who said homophobic comments that he blamed on “culture,” and rather than actually raising good points about the parts of the “Bachelor” process that are clearly wrong and staged, looked like the biggest villain of all. We’re all relieved that this is now over, and we can move on. Hey look, Andi Dorfman’s the new “Bachelorette”! Let’s talk about her instead! Grade: F-, or something worse. We’d give it a G, if we could.

",
http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_25315767/bachelor-and-final-rose-goes,entertainment,"Juan Pablo Galavis, the former pro soccer player described by Entertainment Weekly as a “shallow, narrow-minded hunk of man meat,” brought a merciful end to perhaps the most controversial season in the history of “The Bachelor” Monday night when he made his choice between two remaining women.

And the final rose went to …

Nikki Ferrell, the 26-year-old nurse from Kansas City, Mo.

But hold on: Because J Pab isn’t yet completely sure that marriage is in the cards, he decided not to get down on bended knee and fork over the big rock in St. Lucia. Perhaps that will come later.

Nikki told El Bachelor how much she loved him and he replied by thanking her and telling her that there are many things that he loves about her.

He then recalled how her father told him to be 100 percent sure before issuing a proposal.

“I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go,” he told her, adding, “I like you a lot. A lot. So Nikki, will you except my final rose?”

She nodded and said, “Absolutely.”

His decision left Clare Crawley, 32, the sensitive hairstylist from Sacramento, out in the cold — and very, very bitter.

After breaking the bad news to Clare (“I have to say goodbye to you”), he moved in for a hug, but she fended him off — a move that drew cheers from the in-studio crowd watching a feed of the finale.

“I saved this moment for the man of my dreams,” she said. “I thought that was you. And I thought I knew what kind of man you were.”

Then she drove in the final dagger, hissing, “I lost respect for you. … What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you.” More cheers.

After Clare stormed off, El Bachelor breathed a sigh of relief: “Hooo. I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”

Classy guy.

Earlier in the episode, Clare admitted that she was “falling in love” and said she could envision herself as part of J Pab’s family “forever.”

Or not.

Actually, there were bad signs for Clare during her final date with J Pab. On a helicopter ride, with the cameras off, she said he told her something “insulting and offensive” that made her feel like an “object.” It was a “sexual thing,” she added. (Apparently about how he enjoyed hooking up with her).

Also on Monday, we learned who will be our next “Bachelorette.” During the “After the Rose” special, it was announced that Andi Dorfman, the 26-year-old district attorney from Atlanta will be handing out the roses. She became a fan favorite after she told off J Pab and left the show.

Dorfman made the final 3, but decided to leave after her overnight date in St. Lucia, where J Pab told her she made it to this stage by “default.”

Like we said, classy guy.

Juan Pablo was deemed by many fans to be the “worst” Bachelor ever. During the turbulent season, he stirred controversy by making intolerant remarks about gay people, and he was occasionally rude and dismissive toward some of the women. Many fans considered himself too blunt, too complacent, too arrogant, and worst of all, too boring.

During Monday’s finale, even some members of El Bachelor’s family raised red flags about him. His brother, for one, spoke of how he tends to walk away from relationships when things get “rough.”

But how do you feel? Do you think J Pab and Nikki have what it takes to form a lasting partnership? And do you believe she’d be a good mother to his young daughter, Camila? Or is there “doom” written all over this thing?

Tonight’s episode begins now – Refresh Page for Updates

Now that Juan Pablo has officially given his final rose to Nikki Ferrell, it’s time for the live episode of After The Rose with host Chris Harrison.

To kick off the After The rose episode, Chris Harrison brings Clare Crawley out to discuss the Bachelor Finale. Clare confesses that it is really hard for her to re-watch the Bachelor finale, and she felt that Juan Pablo led her on by telling her he wanted to have kids and move away with her. She really thought he was going to propose to her, and instead he sent her home. Chris asks her what Juan Pablo said to her in the helicopter that was offensive, and Clare says she doesn’t want to repeat it. Clare admits she should have left after the disastrous helicopter date, and she wishes she had listened to her gut because it was “right on.” Clare “trusted the process of The Bachelor though” and hoped that she would find someone that wanted to fall in love and get married.

Chris Harrison asks Clare if she would like Juan Pablo to come out and speak to her right now about what happened in St. Lucia. Clare says that cursing Juan Pablo out in Saint Lucia was all of the closure she needed, and she has no desire to “get fed any more BC from Juan Pablo.”

Next Chris Harrison brings Juan Pablo out to discuss Season 18 of The Bachelor. Chris asks Juan Pablo if he regrets his good-bye with Clare, but Juan Pablo is confident with his decision and says “it is what it is.” He knew that Clare would be hurt after he said good-bye to her, but it just “wasn’t there between them.”

Chris Harrison brings Nikki Ferrell out next to discuss her take of Season 18 of The Bachelor. According to Nikki, she and Juan Pablo are still together and they are very happy. She also confesses to Chris that Juan Pablo still has never told her that he loves him. She does say it has been difficult to make their relationship work, because they have had to stay in hiding until the season finale.

Juan Pablo comes out on stage and joins Nikki and Chris. Chris asks Juan Pablo what his “big surprise is” and Juan Pablo has no idea what he is talking about, he says that there is no surprise. Chris asks Juan Pablo if he is going to tell Nikki that he loves her, and Juan Pablo says “that’s private.” Juan Pablo tells Chris Harrison that he appreciates the opportunity to appear on The Bachelor, but he and Nikki “are done with the show” and they are ready to live their own private lives. Chris tries to ask Juan Pablo another question and Juan Pablo tells Chris to “stop interrupting him.” Juan Pablo tells Chris that he is “sorry the show didn’t end the way everyone wanted, but they are taking their relationship slow and this is real life.”

Chris asks Nikki how long she is going to stick around waiting for Juan Pablo to tell her he is in love with her. Nikki says that as of right now “it feels right” so she doesn’t mind waiting. Chris asks her what their plans are now that the show is over, and Juan Pablo says “that’s private.”

Catherine Giudici chimes in and says that “she is happy for them that they are happy, but she is confused. She doesn’t understand what is going on with Juan Pablo and Nikki.” She also adds that Juan Pablo needs to “stop slapping the hand that fed him,” she doesn’t like the way that Juan Pablo keeps dissing The Bachelor franchise.

Chris Harrison is speechless, he claims he has been doing this for 12 years, and this episode is by far a “Bachelor first.”

Chris adds that he is happy to move on from Season 18 of The Bachelor. Chris also announces that the 2014 Bachelorette is…Andi Dorfman. Andi joins Chris Harrison on the stage, Chris jokes and tells Andi that she shouldn’t be afraid to tell anyone on the show that she is in love with them (since Juan Pablo obviously had a problem with it). Overall Andi is excited to start her journey as the next Bachelorette, and she can’t wait to find her future husband.

Andi Dorfman’s season of The Bachelorette will premiere on May 19th.

It all came down to this on ABC's The Bachelor Season 18 Episode 11, the epic season finale, followed of course by the After the Final Rose special.

We came into this evening with just two women remaining on this ""journey."" Would Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley become the future Mrs. Juan Pablo Galavis?

That was the question on everyone's mind heading into the final rose ceremony when, as predicted, Juan Pablo chose one woman and rejected the other.

So who won the final rose? Did he propose? And are they even together?

Turns out The Bachelor spoilers were pretty spot on here in 2014.

Not only was the longtime speculation regarding the winner accurate, so were the details surrounding this weird season and how the aftermath played out.

So who won and who lost (and/or dodged a bullet)? Read on ...

Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo Galavis left St. Lucia as a couple!

That's right, she got the rose, but El Bachelor didn't propose.

Clare Crawley got the heave ho, and Nikki won. But that's it.

And yet a lot was revealed on the season finale. Namely:

He told Nikki he had the ring in his pocket, but he's ""not gonna use it"" 'cause he's ""not 100 percent"" sure he wants to marry her, but ""I like you a lot.""

Somehow, this was still enough for her to accept the final rose anyway.

He told Clare that he liked f--king her (?!) at least, or something along those lines that's so offensive she won't even repeat it on the program.

She can't even bear to look at the guy on the big reunion show tonight.

Juan Pablo has no regrets about the way he handled this whatsoever.

His big ""surprise"" was that they are still together! And starting a relationship, beginning today! One in which he still won't say I love you!

He is kind of a dick to Chris but eeees okay, he's ""honest with people.""

Just leave them alone, people. This is PRIVATE. And very awkward.

Basically Clare, Andi and Sharleen - 3 of his top 6 - hate this clown.

Even Juan Pablo's parents don't even seem to like him that much.

As for whether Juan and Nikki have any sort of future, that we will have to wait beyond the standard After the Final Rose special filler to truly find out.

They have no plans, really, to do anything. But stay tuned.

It's been rumored that Galavis was ""hurt"" after getting dumped by Andi Dorfman and ""doesn't necessarily find his soul mate"" with Clare or Nikki.

It's also rumored that Juan Pablo went on the show as a giant self-promotional campaign but never had any real engagement or marriage aspirations.

Think that's true, based on what we just saw play out tonight? Did he lead them on this whole time? Or was he just not feeling these final two? What do you think?

Also, Andi Dorfman is your new Bachelorette. She's so hot.

What do you think of the season finale? Was the non-proposal a letdown? Is Juan Pabs the worst Bachelor in history? Share your comments and votes below:

But Clare didn’t walk away silently, she let Juan know exactly what she thought about him and it was intense!

Juan Pablo Galavis dumped Clare Crawley on the finale of The Bachelor, and instead picked Nikki Ferrell. But the moment he tells her that she’s not the one for him, she literally pushes him away and unleashes a fury of harsh criticisms.

‘The Bachelor’ Season Finale — Clare Crawley Slams Juan Pablo

Juan told Clare that he didn’t have strong enough feelings to propose and her eyes immediately welled up with tears. It was then that she started to walk away and then turned around and began to slam him.

[hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]

[hl_ndn videoid=”25699018″]

She said that she was disgusted with what he whispered to her when they got off the helicopter and that she gave him every opportunity to tell her that she wasn’t the one for him. Then she said that he wasn’t genuine and she’d never want to have children with him!

When she got back on the boat to ride off into the sunset he said he was happy he didn’t pick her. Wow, how rude!

The biggest shock was when he picked Nikki but didn’t propose! He said he wasn’t totally certain about her so he gave her a rose instead.

This entire season has been emotional and many people wonder if Juan was there for the right reasons.

HollywoodLifers, were you surprised Juan sent Clare home?

More ‘Bachelor’ Coverage:",
http://www.latintimes.com/bachelor-season-18-finale-recap-juan-pablo-picks-nikki-ferrell-he-doesnt-propose-spoilers-158614,entertainment,"Season 18 of “The Bachelor” has finally come to an end, and the winner is Nikki Ferrell but the pair did not get engaged. In probably the series most awkward Final Rose Ceremony, Juan Pablo revealed that he did not want to get engaged to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse because he wasn’t 100% sure. But he claimed he was 100% that he didn’t want to let her go, meaning that Nikki uncomfortably accepted JP’s final rose with him stating that he did not love her, but instead “liked her a lot.” In direct comparison so Juan Pablo’s lack of emotions, before receiving the final rose from Juan Pablo, Nikki delved into a tender monologue professing how much she truly adored him and admitted that she does love him. Even though it’s becoming more and more obvious that Juan Pablo did not come to “The Bachelor” to find a wife, and a stepmother to his daughter Camila, Nikki unfortunately did look truly in love. She was nervous and could barely breathe as Juan Pablo revealed that she would not be able to call her mom and say she was engaged because he was not “going to use” the enormous diamond engagement ring.

As for the Clare and Juan Pablo interaction in this finale episode, the most controversial “Bachelor” shows once again that he is not to worlds most sensitive of leading men. When Clare arrives on the beach to meet with Juan Pablo, he does actually look nervous. While at first we thought that his nervousness was due to his genuine attraction for Clare, but now we are assuming it was more because he had led her on for too long and he was worried of her reaction. Clare’s voice over is actually even sweeter than Nikki’s she discuss her father, who tragically passed, however she is hopeful for what’s to come with Juan Pablo. When she first sees him, she speaks first revealing how she trusts him and believes him, but it seems Clare may have put her eggs in the wrong basket because Juan Pablo does not return her sentiments. Juan Pablo states that she is an amazing woman but that he must say goodbye, her goodbye is much more abrasive and we loved it! Clare looks devastated and doesn’t let him hug her as she turns to leave St. Lucia, but not first without telling him she lost respect for him and would never want to have a father like him for her kids. Juan Pablo reacts in his typical way, by being completely rude stating, “Whew! I’m glad I didn’t pick her,”

We are thinking that Clare really dodged a bullet with this one, because Juan Pablo is really proving himself to be rather heartless. We truly wish Nikki good luck however just from the Final Rose Ceremony and Nikki’s clearly deflated acceptance of the rose; we are assuming that the relationship won’t last. Juan Pablo seems to have never really expected to fall in love on season 18 of “The Bachelor.”",
http://www.current-movie-reviews.com/43704/the-bachelor-after-the-final-rose-live-leaves-no-stone-unturned-or-door-unslammed/,entertainment,"Immediately following the season finale of The Bachelor 2014 where Juan Pablo does not present Nikki with the ring or a proposal but the final rose and the words “I like you ALOT” which is enough for her to accept the rose, Chris Harrison brings out Clare to first express her final thoughts and to determine whether or not there is anything she would like to talk to Juan Pablo about.

Clare, acting very mature and gathered from her rejection, states she should have followed her gut instinct and left but it was something she wanted so badly only to realize this bachelor is not the man she thought he was or even who he thinks he is. There is nothing left for her to say as the video of that final day is closure enough for her…it is likely that comment he made after she left in addition to her standing up to him which she says was liberating.

After the break, Juan Pablo enters the studio in the hot seat expressing relief and stating prayers for what is going on in Venezuela. At the “Women Tell All” Juan Pablo did not have any regrets. Does he now have any? He is defensive trying to get the point “It’s fine” is the comment about Clare and he has no regrets about what he said in the helicopter and glosses over his final remarks to Clare during his goodbye and afterwards but it should be no surprise to the television audience. Juan Pablo has not really taken responsibility for anything adverse this season.

Nikki comes out to talk about where things stand with Juan Pablo. She confirms there is a relationship with the bachelor but there is still no confirmation about his feelings for her. For her, it is okay that his actions speak louder than the words she desires to hear. Chris Harrison makes a point about the fact the words have not yet been uttered on Juan Pablo’s part. How long will she be willing to wait?

What is Juan Pablo’s surprise? Is he finally going to propose to Nikki or will he break it off with her on national television? It is Nikki onstage with her beloved Juan Pablo. Chris Harrison mentions he stated there is to be a big surprise to which Juan Pablo says it is that they are happy and can now be out in the open after months of waiting for this final show.

Chris keeps prying to get the bachelor to open up about his feelings which he continues to run around the bush. Chris asks “Do you love her?” which Juan Pablo remains unable to state the words. Juan tells Harrison he interrupts him as his defense starts to show once more. Shawn Lowe jumps in and states when he knew he was in love with Catherine, he could not wait to tell her with a comment of “to each his own” aimed at Juan Pablo along with the clarifier people handle things in different ways.

Chris Harrison does not know what he is looking at; it is a dating situation. Clare defends Juan Pablo and the fact others have been onstage and declared love not there – which is a great point – and the relationship they have is real and progressing at the pace they are comfortable. Should audiences judge with suspicion not knowing what is behind closed doors away from the microphones and cameras?

Harrison asks Nikki how long she will wait for the words. She says she will remain as long as it feels right. The relationship changed drastically before “Women Tell All” but it is not elaborated on and plans are to change beginning now but they are not expressed. Juan Pablo is extremely guarded, defensive, and demeaning to the public which is commented on by Catherine who says “Don’t slap the hand that feeds you.”

It is confusing and Juan Pablo remains completely oblivious to the dynamics of reality television and delusional, according to Shawn, he is now done with the show and is going to move on with his private life. Who is to be the new bachelorette? After another beak, Chris Harrison reveals Andi Dorfman is The Bachelorette 2014.

Chris Harrison may be right – Monday’s season finale of Juan Pablo Galavis’s roller-coaster ride as the star of The Bachelor was perhaps the most dramatic yet.

Juan Pablo’s final two women were confident Sacramento-based hairstylist Clare Crawley, who made her strong feelings for Juan Pablo clear from day one, and sweet and sensitive pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell, who wants to be a mom.

So which woman won Juan Pablo’s heart and the final rose? And is there a newly engaged couple in the Bachelor family?

Juan Pablo sent Clare home angry and gave the final rose to Nikki – but he didn’t propose to anyone. Here’s how it all went down:

Clare was the first to meet Juan Pablo’s family in St. Lucia – and she earned their approval. His father Saul practically welcomed her to the family, saying, “I love you” in Spanish.

“Juan Pablo definitely has my heart. And now so does his family,” Clare said. “I could 1,000 percent see myself a part of Juan Pablo’s family forever.”

Nikki had already met Juan Pablo’s family briefly at his daughter Camila’s dance recital. But this time they had a chance to chat about Juan Pablo.

“My feelings are so real,” Nikki told Saul, “and I’ve thought about all of this and I feel like I’m ready for it.”

Final Dates

On his final date with Clare, Juan Pablo took her on a romantic helicopter ride over St. Lucia. But the romance didn’t last long.

“What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth. And I was shocked,” Clare said of Juan Pablo’s private whisper when they landed. “He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. … It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.”

Later, Clare confronted Juan Pablo about saying he didn’t know her well. She said she would not stick around if he admitted he felt their relationship was “just a physical connection.” But Juan Pablo convinced her to stay.

“We have had our ups and downs but I know that she could be the one,” Juan Pablo said. “I just know it.”

For his final date with Nikki, Juan Pablo took her on a boat ride. She also expressed doubts about whether he would make her wishes come true.

“I know how I feel about Juan Pablo. I know that I love him,” she said. “But … I want to hear him tell me he loves me. I just want to hear all the things that I’ve been waiting for him to say.”

When Nikki gave him a letter, in which she said, “I love you,” Juan Pablo did not say anything back. He left for the night and she broke down in tears.

Final Rose

Juan Pablo’s final decision was not an easy one – for anyone.

“I got to follow what I think is best for me and I have to say goodbye to you,” Juan Pablo told Clare. He tried to hug her but she pushed him away.

“I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you,” she said before walking away. Then she turned and told him, “What you just made me go through – I would never want my children having a father like you.”

“There’s a really good chance I’m getting engaged tonight,” Nikki said on her way to see Juan Pablo, who did pick out a ring with Neil Lane.

But he didn’t use the ring. “I’m not going to give it to you,” Juan Pablo said. “I’m not 100 percent sure I want to propose to you. But at the same time I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go. I like you a lot. A lot.”

Then he asked her to accept his final rose. And she said, “Absolutely.”

[Warning: Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen Monday night's episode of The Bachelor.]

And then there was one.

The Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis revealed his final pick in Monday night's season finale of the ABC reality series.

It came down to pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell and hairstylist Clare Crawley, and in the end, Galavis chose Ferrell.

He did go through the process of picking out a Neil Lane engagement ring. However, in a twist not seen since Brad Womack's first season in 2007, Galavis didn't propose to Ferrell, instead telling her he wasn't sure he was ready to propose but that he still wanted to date her. He also asked her to accept his final rose, and she said yes.

Womack, who actually chose not to continue dating either of the final two women in his first season, went on to propose to Emily Maynard in his second season three years later, but that engagement didn't last.

Other Bachelor stars who didn't propose include Alex Michel in season one, Bob Guiney in season four, Jesse Palmer in season five, Charlie O'Connell in season seven, Travis Stork in season eight and Lorenzo Borghese in season nine. None of those relationships lasted, either.

Galavis' predecessor, Sean Lowe, not only proposed to his pick, Catherine Guidici, but the couple were married on live TV in January. That marked the fourth televised wedding in franchise history, following the nuptials of Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter, Jason Mesnick and Molly Malaney and Ashley Hebert and J.P. Rosenbaum.

Galavis has made headlines during this season, most recently for retweeting a joke that used the word ""retard."" In January, he also generated controversy for saying that ABC shouldn't have a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show and calling gay people ""more pervert.""

Juan Pablo chose Nikki in ""The Bachelor"" finale. He didn't propose to her, though.

(ABC)

Juan Pablo Galavis has spent weeks trying to find the perfect woman to be a stepmother to his 5-year-old daughter, Camila.

He thinks he has found her in Nikki Ferrell, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo. El Bachelor — so named because he is the first-ever Latino to star on the ABC reality show — gave Nikki the last rose of the season. But because he's not 100 percent sure he wants to marry her, he didn't give her the diamond ring in his pocket.

Juan Pablo sent Clare Crawley, the 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., packing.

Juan Pablo ""broke up"" with Clare before giving the last rose to Nikki. Clare was understandably heartbroken and shocked. She said Juan Pablo is not the man she thought he was.

She wished that he hadn't strung her along this entire time if he had known his feelings for her weren't there. Earlier in the episode, Juan Pablo apparently said something very insulting to her off-camera, while on a helicopter ride in St. Lucia.

As Wetpaint reports, Clare apparently asked Juan Pablo if he loves her.

His response? ""I really loved f---ing you."" Clare even repeated the phrase in her reaction to being dumped. That's pretty low, Juan Pablo.

Clare said she doesn't even care about his reasons for not choosing her. After she left, Juan Pablo said he was happy he did not choose her.

Nikki fully expected a proposal from Juan and seemed ready to accept it. Looks like her own dad's advice — that he shouldn't propose unless he's totally sure — really resonated with her man.

It's probably for the best. Do you think they'll actually end up tying the knot? Will Nikki be a good stepmom to Camila? Only time — or the hour-long special following the finale — will tell.

Update following ""After the final rose"" special:

Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together, but there has been no proposal. Juan Pablo hasn't even said he loves her yet, even though he feels as if he's in love. He seems to have an issue with how public ""The Bachelor"" wants their relationship to be — does he know he was just on a TV show?

And Andi, the district attorney from Atlanta, is the next ""Bachelorette."" Everyone seemed happy to have the spotlight shift from the awkward Juan Pablo and Nikki to her bubbly, hopeful face. I thought Andi would have been smarter than to accept such an offer, but when you're desperate for love (and see a gigantic check waved in front of your face), I guess it's hard to resist.

Though he had a Neil Lane diamond ring in his pocket, he didn't give it to her. Instead, Juan Pablo gave her the final rose — and Nikki accepted.

When Juan Pablo joined her in the hot seat, he said he was looking forward to starting a normal relationship with Nikki.

Host Chris Harrison asked about a ""big surprise"" that Juan Pablo had planned — but the ""Bachelor"" denied any such thing (so, no live proposal). He also refused to say that he loves Nikki.

""This is real life. When you are with somebody, you don't say you love her or not,"" he said. ""It's something that you feel. We are happy right now.""

He added, ""We are so done with the show.""

Nikki was a frontrunner all season, but her bond with Juan Pablo was cemented when she was the first woman to meet his adorable daughter, Camila. Their relationship continued to grow after he met her family in Kansas City.

Their romance has been unmarked by the drama that characterized Juan Pablo's relationship with the other finalist, Clare. While his chemistry with Clare was off the charts, they clashed after a late night swim that he called a ""mistake"" — leaving her in tears.

Then, in the finale, things turned rocky again when Juan Pablo made an offensive, off-camera comment to Clare. She confronted him in the evening, asking if their relationship was entirely physical. He assured her that he liked many aspects of her personality and talked Clare off the ledge.

But when it came to proposal day, Juan Pablo said goodbye to Clare. Angry and hurt, she lashed out at him. ""I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, and I thought that was you,"" Clare said.

[Related: The Oddest Odd Jobs of 'Bachelor' Contestants]

She also accused Juan Pablo of not being the man she thought he was. ""What you just made me go through, I would never want my children to have a father like you.""

As Clare stomped away, Juan Pablo let out a sigh of relief. ""Whew, I'm glad I didn't pick her,"" he breathed. (The live studio audience gasped in dismay.)

When it was Nikki's turn, Juan Pablo let her know she was the last woman standing, but that he couldn't get down on one knee. She accepted the final rose anyway.

""It's OK,"" as Juan Pablo would say.",

UPDATE: Nikki Ferrell wins The Bachelor and gets the final rose. However, there is no proposal from Juan Pablo Galavis. Watch the Final Rose live on TV Tag here.

The Bachelor 2014 finale will air tonight and fans will finally get to see who Juan Pablo Galavis will give the final rose to.

Will the bachelor choose Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell?

Juan Pablo Galavis is said to be one of the most controversial bachelors on the show due to the drama that has been caused behind the scenes of the ABC reality show.

According to E!Online, producers and crew members of the show have never been so ready for the Bachelor to end. ""It has not been anyone's favorite, that's for sure,"" an insider told E!

Although viewers of the show do not know the final results of the show, there are reports that there have been lots of fighting between Juan Pablo and the winner.

""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,"" a source said.

The Bachelor host Christ Harrison recently stated his opinion to TV Guide about the former soccer player. ""Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy. Whether this was a good fit or not or the best decision, I feel like he's fought it. For me, he gets really defensive and short and that's when he says, 'OK' or 'perfect,' whereas normally you'd have a response. He either gets defensive or goes into dad mode and he talks to them like they're his daughter, and says things like, 'Don't be sad,' and touches their hair.""

The Bachelor star recently retweeted a fan's insensitive joke last week which sparked controversy. The joke read: ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating b*stard you.""

Juan Pablo replied: ""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..."" When fans expressed their outrage over his comment, he replied: ""I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture."" Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect. Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture.""

Juan Pablo Galavis is a former professional Venezuelan soccer player who retired in 2008. He and former girlfriend Carla Rodriguez have a daughter, Camila.

After weeks of traveling around the world, and picking off his bachelorettes one by one and sending them home, Juan Pablo has narrowed his search for love down to the Final Two, Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley.

Nikki and Clare have really come across as exact opposites on The Bachelor this season. Nikki is very sarcastic, and tells it like it is, even if doing so hurts someone’s feelings. Several of Nikki’s fellow Bachelorettes even referred to her as the villain of their season, due to her negative attitude. Clare Crawley is far from negative, her perky and bubbly personality annoyed the other Bachelorettes as much as Nikki’s negative attitude, and even caused some of the other women to think she was being “fake.”

When Season 18 of The Bachelor premiered, Nikki and Clare were the last two women America expected to see in the Final Two. When rumors leaked in January that Nikki Ferrell would be crowned the winner of this season of The Bachelor, it was hard to believe, and most Bachelor fans doubted they were true. However, we are down to the last week of The Bachelor and Nikki is still in the running, and it looks like the rumors were actually spot on. Reality Steve (blogger and Bachelor spy) was right again! Juan Pablo gave his Final Rose to Nikki Ferrell.",

She's too busy shooting guns, modeling, swimming, jumping on beds and looking hot as heck while doing it. We rounded up the sexiest photos of Ferrell, so get ready to drool ... and to be jealous of Galavis.

Well, not too jealous. He's still kind of an idiot. In fact, we're not sure he even deserves someone as sexy as Ferrell!",

The Venezuelan soccer veteran picked Nikki Ferrell over Crawley for the Final Rose, and now not only will he be missing out on a sweetheart with a sweet bod, but he'll also need someone new to cut his hair. (And hopefully to get rid of those stupid frosted tips, too.)

Here's hoping Crawley's not too bummed about her loss. Hey, it's not like the winner actually got a ring! And with a prize package like Galavis, well, we think Crawley may be the real victor here.

“The Bachelor” finale is something that ABC has turned into some sort of massive event, as they air it live, and show just about anything and everything over the course of three long hours.

On tonight’s edition, this also included a discussion with Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici that could definitely be described as uncomfortable. Why would they even be at the finale in the first place? Obviously, ABC wanted to have a success story there, and possibly a distraction from what was a pretty terrible season.

This discussion was led by Chris Harrison, who put Catherine on the spot and asked her what her thoughts on Juan Pablo were. Her response? That she thought he was a “great guy” … and then tried to get some other words together. It’s a pretty bad position to be in for her, since she doesn’t want to completely bash someone on the show. Sean is basically the same way. They’re more ambassadors of good will and peace for ABC, and we have a feeling that so long as they stay married, they will continue to make the occasional appearance on the show to share a few thoughts here and there and updates on their marriage.

As for Juan Pablo, we have a much harder time thinking that he will be used for a lot of “Bachelor” promotion. We really doubt that he will even have a wedding special if he makes it that far.

Is there anything that you are specifically hoping to see from Sean and Catherine moving forward, and why in the world do you think they were pressed for their opinion on this in the first place? Share some of your thoughts below, and also visit the link here if you want to see the rest of our updates from the finale.

What a bizarre finale for “The Bachelor” this was, given that there were so many things that really did not make much sense. There was no deliberation from Juan Pablo Galavis on who to pick, a fight between him and Clare Crawley, and also the guy’s family practically warning the women that this guy may not be right for them.

Yet, this show has a way of doing funny thing to people. It gets in their head and distorts your opinion. It really makes you think that you are in love with someone who doesn’t really know you that well, and may make you feel better than you would about them in the real world. That is why it is so much easier to feel bad for some of the women on this season.

Do we have a ton of sympathy for Clare Crawley right now? Yes and no. While her rejection of him was all kinds of awesome, she did ignore everything that was going on in her head for so long. She’s a victim of her own decision-making, since both Sharleen Joynt and Andi Dorfman were smart enough to walk away when they had a chance to do so. But, this guy was a TOTAL d-bag beyond question when he acted with no sympathy at her getting mad, and then said “glad I didn’t pick her” after she left.

This only left one woman in contention for Juan Pablo’s heart, and it was Nikki Ferrell … who we actually felt bad for tonight for the first time to date. She was getting completely strung along most of the episode, and while we understand “Bachelor” protocol is to not disclose your feelings for as long as possible, he could have at least done something more.

So did Juan Pablo actually propose to her in the end? Nope! Somehow, ABC tried to make a romantic moment out of the fact that he didn’t give Nikki a ring despite the fact that she wanted one, and he still barely talked about his own feelings. As a trainwreck, this was a big one; but as a romantic experience, what a disaster that was all drawn-out and ridiculous. Grade: D-.

What did you think about this episode, and about some of the insane decisions that Juan Pablo made, from the way that he says “honest” all the time to him stringing people along? Share your thoughts with a comment below, and head over here if you want to read some more news related to the show.

http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/juan-pablo-bachelor-2014-worst-chris-harrison-producers-hate/,entertainment,"Juan Pablo has made a quite a few enemies since he took on the role of Season 18 Bachelor, that was made pretty clear during the Bachelor Women Tell All special last week. Along with the laundering list of ex-bachelorettes that despise Juan Pablo, you can add the gay community, anyone with a mentally challenged family member, and all of the Bachelor viewers at home who have tuned in to the show this year. And, apparently we can now add the producers of The Bachelor to growing list of people that despise Juan Pablo.

According to an inside Bachelor source that spoke to E! News, the producers of The Bachelor are “over Juan Pablo” and “ready for this season to be over.” The source went on to tell E! News that, “His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici’s wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine’s special weekend.”

Another inside Bachelor source told E! News that Juan Pablo has caused way too much drama behind the scenes of the reality TV show, and he and the rumored winner Nikki Ferrell have been fighting non-stop. The source added, “Producers are hopeful that they’ll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath.”

It appears Juan Pablo is as horrible as we all suspected, even the producers that gave him The Bachelor gig can’t stand to be around him. Juan Pablo has turned The Bachelor franchise into a joke (well, a bigger joke than it already was), are you as over him as his own producers are? Or, do you think Juan Pablo’s behaviors have blown out of proportion this year? Let us know how you feel about the 2014 Bachelor in the comment section below.",
http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/nikki-ferrell-wins-the-bachelor-18-2014-juan-pablo-winner/,entertainment,"Juan Pablo may very easily go down in history as the worst Bachelor yet on the popular ABC reality TV show. Since he took on the role of The Bachelor, he has been followed by a cloud of scandal ranging from anti-gay slurs to numerous girlfriends and relationships. It’s really hard to believe that Chris Harrison and ABC managed to find 27 women to compete for Juan Pablo’s love, and even harder to believe that his final two bachelorettes Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell, didn’t walk out on Juan Pablo before the Season 18 Finale.

Monday on ABC Juan Pablo will finally hand out his Final Rose, and Season 18 of The Bachelor will be a wrap. Despite the fact that season finale of The Bachelor hadn’t aired yet, America has known for weeks that Juan Pablo chooses Nikki Ferrell, a young pediatric nurse (courtesy of Reality Steve and other Bachelor leaks). If Juan Pablo chooses Clare Crawley, it will be a shocking Bachelor twist, but the odds of that happening are slim to none.

This year there will be no proposal after the Final Rose Ceremony, it appears that Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell basically broke up as soon as the Bachelor cameras stopped rolling. Juan Pablo was photographed with at least three different women before Episode 5 of The Bachelor had even aired on television.

A lot of Bachelor fans are less than happy with Season 18 of The Bachelor, the entire season is beginning to look like a complete sham. Not only was there no proposal and no relationship afterwards, Juan Pablo has embarrassed the entire Bachelor family with his disrespectful behavior and comments. Nikki Ferrell may be the least lucky Bachelor winner…ever.

Are you glad Season 18 of The Bachelor is finally coming to a close? Do you think American may be wrong and there is still a chance Clare Crawley could get the Final Rose? Let us know in the comment section below.",

Tonight, the compelling 18th season of The Bachelor airs and considering how the rest of Juan Pablo's journey has played out, it's sure to be a doozy. Will he pick Nikki? Will he choose Clare? WHAT WILL HAPPEN?! We're eagerly anticipating the episode, but before all of our most pressing questions are answered, here are 13 possible outcomes for tonight's season finale:

1. Juan Pablo proposes to Clare and she accepts. The two live happily ever after with Clare's crazy eyes and JP's total jerkiness.

2. Juan Pablo proposes to Nikki. She accepts. She texts all the rejected women saying ""I WON! HAHA,"" then dumps him.

3. Juan Pablo proposes to one or both of the women, neither accepts. JP is left to ""swim in the ocean"" by himself, forever.

4. Sharleen comes back because she's still not sure about how she feels. She sings him some opera; he touches her hair. They share some more alarmingly tonguey kisses. She decides she's still just not that into him and leaves again.

5. Chris Harrison locks Juan Pablo in the fantasy suite, declares that this is his moment to shine, and crowns himself the next Bachelor.

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Tonight, the woman who wins the Bachelor 2014 might not exactly get what she had hoped for. Did Juan Pablo get engaged, who wins the Bachelor 2014 tonight, and is there an After the Final Rose engagement surprise? When you tune into tonight’s Bachelor Final Results telecast, and sit back to learn who is the Bachelor 2014 winner, don’t flip your remote control. Bachelor spoilers before tonight’s telecast tell news that the Bachelor final results for March 10, 2014 may have a bigger surprise in the After the Final Rose telecast than in the Final Rose episode itself.

Details about who wins the Bachelor were revealed last winter. No, Juan Pablo did not get engaged. Yes, Nikki is allegedly the Bachelor 2014 winner. And finally, Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together. RealitySteve spoilers claim that, early on in the season, it was clear that Nikki was headed to becoming the winner. But when Juan Pablo picks Nikki in the final minutes of the telecast, he delivers, at least to her, a shocker. According to RealitySteve, Juan Pablo picks Nikki but does not propose. There is no engagement during the final rose, claims RealitySteve, and there is no engagement in the weeks after that episode aired as well.

So are Juan Pablo and Nikki still together? RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together officially. But reports have claimed that Juan Pablo has been allegedly dating other women, prompting claims that Juan Pablo was cheating on Nikki. Nevertheless, coming into tonight’s After the Final Rose, Juan Pablo is expected to tell ABC viewers that he is happy that he picked Nikki, and that he was reluctant to propose at that time.

But what about this After the Final Rose Juan Pablo secret engagement? RealitySteve claims that an alleged “offer” was made to Juan Pablo to propose during tonight’s After the Final Rose. So does the Juan Pablo secret engagement happen, does Juan Pablo and Nikki get engaged in the After the Final Rose tonight? RealitySteve claims to know that the alleged offer has been made but does not know if the alleged offer has been accepted. That will be revealed tonight.

For now, the big surprise may tonight be in the After the Final Rose telecast. But before the season started, RealitySteve said “When it’s all said and done, I think you’re going to hear a lot of things come out about this season, whether it be on my site, or in the tabloids, or coming from some of his girls Twitter and Instagram accounts, that presents overwhelming evidence to the fact that this guy … was never interested in finding a wife”. Juan Pablo has been called the worse Bachelor ever, even though his ratings have been strong.

But that could all change tonight with a possible surprise engagement. RealitySteve tweeted moments ago “The first 90 min of tonight’s show is basically pointless. As is every finale. Just get us to the ending since that what it boils down to.”

So will RealitySteve be correct tonight? “Yes, I’m aware I had the wrong ending last season. So if you already think that this ending is wrong, there’s nothing I can say or do to convince you otherwise. It is what it is.” He adds “Over the next three months, tabloids will run stories, people will email me saying they think I’m wrong, people will have theories on why this happened or that happened. And to that, I’ll take it all in and say ‘Thank you’ and just move on. Without giving up my sources and where I got this info, I can’t convince anyone who doesn’t want to believe it that this is the correct ending.”

He adds “Some will choose to harp on last season being wrong, and some will choose to look at my track record over the long haul and know I had the previous 7 seasons correct. It’s all what you choose to believe. This is how the show ends this season and I’ll leave it at that.”

Galavis added ""LOVED IT"" to the retweet, but deleted the post when users pointed out the insensitive nature of the joke.

By way of apology, Galavis said that Americans needed to ""enjoy jokes and sarcasm.""

""Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture,"" he added.

This isn't the first time Galavis has had to defend his comments. In January, he apologized for saying that gays and lesbians couldn't be on The Bachelor because it didn't ""set a good example for kids.""

""If you listen to the entire interview, there's nothing but respect for gay people and their families. I have many gay friends and one of my closest friends who's like a brother has been a constant in my life especially during the past 5 months,"" he explained.",

The Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis must love the taste of shoe leather, because he can't stop putting his foot in his mouth.

This time, Galavis' transgression went down on Twitter, where he retweeted an incredibly insensitive, ignorant and, frankly, unfunny joke from a fan.

The idiotic missive read, ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don’t care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f**king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!""

Aside from the obvious -- you know, that it's cruel and wrong to poke fun at the mentally challenged -- whoever came up with this brilliance is also clearly a hypocrite, because most people with an I.Q. in the triple-digits know that ""cupcake"" is one word.

Just like he did when he said that homosexuals are ""more pervert, in a sense,"" Galavis defended himself the only way he knows how: By reminding the world that English isn't his first language. Except this time, Galavis also had the gall to say that his critics need to learn both culture and respect. The irony can be cut with a knife, folks:

""I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture""

""Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES...""

""People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM...""

""In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect""

We're going to go out on a limb here and assume Nikki Ferrell is thrilled she didn't get a ring from this troll. On that note, since even bad things seem to be okay with Galavis as long as they're commonly used, by his logic, my going out to buy heroin with counterfeit cash right now would be totally cool, right?

Ugh. Take a seat, sir. In fact, rent out a soccer arena and take all the seats.",

After starting the dating competition with 27 women, Juan Pablo has finally narrowed down the contestant to two women, and tonight he will give one of these lucky ladies the final rose and possibly even an engagement ring alongside it. So will it be for Juan Pablo, either Clare, the 32-year old hairstylists from Sacramento, California or Nikki, the 26-year old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Missouri. Only time will tell, but both of the women have made serious impact on the Latino single father. So much so that Juan Pablo even introduced his daughter Camila to Nikki while the pair were in Miami.

But does the family introduction mean that Nikki is the winner of season 18 of “The Bachelor” and Juan Pablo’s heart? Most likely yes- multiple spoiler reports claim that tonight Nikki goes home with the final rose while Clare only goes home with her bags packed. But the one thing we have heard over and over again is that Juan Pablo didn’t actually propose to Nikki, something that according to Wetpaint, ABC wasn’t too happy about. So even though there is a winner in tonight’s “Bachelor” finale, there will most likely be no ring! However, I wouldn’t full rule out Clare just yet. In a deleted scene from tonight’s episode Clare and JP are seen relaxing sweetly together, when the romantic bachelor begins to play a special song for Clare, the moment between the pair is so sweet and tender that she actually starts crying. Then the couple go on to discuss playing the song at their wedding….hmm certainly sounds like she still has a shot at that final rose.

No matter who walks away with Juan Pablo and the final rose on the season 18 finale of “The Bachelor” you know it will be an entertaining one! That's why you must watch the finale tonight on ABC at 8 p.m. or if you can’t watch live on the TV be sure to tune in and watch “The Bachelor” finale online available via live stream after the live airing on WatchABC.com!",

We aren’t really surprised at who won The Bachelor 18, but you might be surprised at what happened after the final girl got her rose!

Although The Bachelor 2014 finale tonight may come to a close with a final in the hands of one of the ladies, that doesn’t mean everything turned out roses for her and Juan Pablo in the end. From the rumors we are hearing out there, no matter what happened on the show tonight, things are not smelling so flowery behind the scenes for the Latin lover and his chosen lady!

The Bachelor spoilers source Reality Steve leaked the news quite a while ago that part-time model and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell would be the lady who won The Bachelor tonight. The website also claimed that Juan Pablo Galavis was actually offered money to propose to Nikki on the show because he really isn’t that interested in her, and does not want to get married! But, even with a monetary incentive, did Juan Pablo propose? No way, Jose!

Make no mistake about this season, and you can choose to believe me or not – this was a complete cash grab for Juan Pablo,” Reality Steve said. “He never had any interest in finding a wife on this show, or a step mother for Camila, or whatever else line of BS ABC will run at you all season. This guy wants to act, he wants to be in commercials, he wants to model, and he wants to be on ‘Dancing with the Stars.'”

Regardless of what happened on The Bachelor tonight, Juan Pablo and Nickki Ferrell allegedly don’t even like each other very much at this point, and have been fighting furiously. Which means the real fun may just come after The Bachelor 2014 finale tonight when host Chris Harrison sits down with Juan Pablo and the ladies.

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Will After the Final Rose 2014 tonight on The Bachelor feature a Juan Pablo Nikki Ferrell engagement, does Juan Pablo propose to Nikki on ATFR tonight, and will there be surprise Bachelor results tonight March 10, 2014 on ABC? RealitySteve’s Bachelor spoilers claim that Juan Pablo does not propose to Bachelor 2014 winner Nikki Ferrell in tonight’s finale episode. You allegedly won’t see a Juan Pablo engagement during the final taped episode tonight. But RealitySteve tells news that Juan Pablo might propose to Nikki Ferrell on the After the Final Rose telecast, and there might be a surprise engagement.



After the Final Rose telecasts usually deal with subjects like “are they still together”,” are they still dating”, and of course “are they still engaged”. But RealitySteve recently revealed a shocker about tonight’s telecast. “According to my sources, there is a …. offer on the table for Juan Pablo to propose to Nikki on the After the Final Rose show.”

Strangely, RealitySteve tells news that he knows that the alleged offer to Juan Pablo was made but does not know if it was accepted by Juan Pablo. “That fact absolutely cannot be changed. As for what happens at the live ATFR, I don’t know. I know they are still together and they will be together when you see them on the ATFR.” But he adds “Will he propose? Well, the…. offer is on the table for him too. Should be interesting.”

Tonight’s After the Finale Rose could leave more questions than answers. “I’m sure people will have their thoughts regarding the finale, the ATFR show, and what the future holds.” But Bachelor spoilers have yet to indicate if an engagement has been in the works. Juan Pablo has allegedly been dating other women since the season wrapped filming. So why would consider to propose tonight? “Does it mean it will for sure happen? I don’t know.”

RealitySteve does not indicate how he knows that an alleged offer was made. But as to whether it was accepted, he remarks “I have no idea what goes on in that guy’s brain…. But that offer is there, and I guess we’ll see if he takes it come March 10th.”

From there, however, RealitySteve hits Juan Pablo with a series of allegations. Namely, RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo during the season, and in the finale, never wanted to propose to Nikki or any other contestant. “Regardless of if he proposes on the live show or not, the point is… He’s never going to marry Nikki. Nothing has changed with this guy since the very beginning. He doesn’t want to be married to her, he never wanted to be married to her”. Yet, is he correct?

But is the possibly out there? RealitySteve claims so, alleging “Just wanted to give you a heads up since that’s now a possibility at the ATFR. Regardless, he will never marry Nikki in your lifetime or mine, so, I would put zero stock into it if he does propose. Means nothing.”

2014's Season 18 Bachelor finale premieres in just a few hours, but does Juan Pablo really know who the ladies are. Speculation as to whether or not Galavis is going to propose and to whom abounds, but the former soccer player is right to be nervous. Evil contestant Claire Crawley hasn't been entirely truthful about her restraining order past. Spoilers: Claire's dubious double-dealing with men has got her into a lot of hot water at least once before.

Juan Pablo was dealt quite an unexpected blow, when two of his favorite ladies decided he wasn't for them, instead of the other way around.

The rejections have fueled intense speculation that Juan Pablo will probably not propose to either one of tonight's finalists.

While it isn't at all clear who Juan Pablo is leaning towards, it's pretty certain that the ladies from the show don't want to see cruel Claire Crawley win.

A show insider tells Star that Crawley worked hard at making sure she alienated every single woman and the show:

""From dominating Juan Pablo's time, even during group dates, to unfairly sneaking away for an unscheduled midnight swim with him in the ocean, Claire clearly was the gal that the other women loved to hate this season.

""She tried to play innocent afterwards but it didn't wash.""

Not surprisingly this isn't the first time that Ms. Crawley has got on the bad side of a lady by acting sketchy around a man.

Back in August of 1999 Claire had to turn to Sacramento County according to Star to protect her against a group of women that were looking to settle a few scores.

In the order of protection filed by Claire, she alleges that ladies called her ""a f***ing sl*t"" a well as threating her physical person:

""Claire claimed that Jennifer, sometimes accompanied by a group of friend, has 'threatened to physically harm me', and had stated she would 'hunt me down and beat the s**t out of me.""

One can only surmise since Claire hasn't learned her lesson, Jennifer never was able to catch up with her.

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Are Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo still together 2014, are Nikki and Juan Pablo still dating, what happened between Nikki and the Bachelor, and will there be no Nikki Juan Pablo engagement tonight? RealitySteve Bachelor 2014 spoilers claim that Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo are still together, they are still dating 2014, but that they do not get engaged in the finale episode tonight on ABC. The question is whether Juan Pablo will propose to Nikki on After the Final Rose.

Nikki and Juan Pablo were together, and dating, right after tonight’s episode was filmed. But there might not be anything more to that. RealitySteve tells viewers that false tabloid reports have been heating up this month. RealitySteve suggests in his spoilers that are not any real surprises tonight. The episode was filmed without much drama. Juan Pablo didn’t choose Clare. And while Nikki was expecting a ring, she does not get one. “The overnight date portion of this season took place at or near Sugar Beach, which was where the rose ceremony was. Then for the final rose ceremony which took place Tuesday, November 12th, I originally reported it was going to be at The Landings resort.” RealitySteve adds “That was mistaken. The final rose ceremony took place at or near the Cap Maison Hotel. Both Clare and Nikki showed up, he didn’t send one home early or anything like that. And in the end. Juan Pablo chose Nikki, but he did not propose”.

But the real confusion tonight won’t be over who wins, but how they win. Nikki is believed to have expected an engagement ring and does not get it. And according to RealitySteve, Juan Pablo and Nikki leave the Hotel a couple, are still together and still dating. “So for the first time since Brad’s first season, there will not be an engagement at the end of the season.”

Why does Juan Pablo not propose to Nikki in the finale? Only Juan Pablo knows the true answer. And hopefully he will be asked that in After the Final Rose. But RealitySteve claims an alleged motive by Juan Pablo. He asserts that Juan Pablo allegedly never wanted to propose to any of the women in this case. “However, for Juan Pablo, I’d say it’s more about him never wanting to propose to any of these girls in the first place before he even started this journey.”

But the vacuum of confusion remains on the future of Nikki and Juan Pablo. RealitySteve is vague about the couple since filming wraps. He says they are together but adds the disclaimer that does not mean anything. Of course, Juan Pablo has allegedly appeared on dates with other women as this season has aired.

RealitySteve remarks “Everyone can read into whatever they want, and they can dissect the promo of Clare crying, Nikki crying, and Juan Pablo ‘walking away’ from the final rose ceremony stand to make you think he left alone. It’s all smoke and mirrors.” He adds “I’ve said it since November 20th, and I’ll say it again: Juan Pablo chose Nikki at the end but didn’t propose to her.”

For Juan Pablo Galavis, however, there's a collective shrug about his choice between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell. The buzz on Twitter is that he’s the ""worst 'Bachelor' ever."" The women on the show didn’t like him. Even the show’s producers are totally over him.





[Related: Juan Pablo Has Some Not-So-Nice Thoughts About a Gay 'Bachelor']

""Everyone is definitely ready for Juan Pablo's season to be over. Producers felt like they were putting out fires left and right with him, starting with the gay comments,"" an inside source told Yahoo TV.





""He used the 'second language' excuse a lot, no one is really buying it. Two girls chose to leave in the top six. When has that ever happened before? That should be indicative of what we were working with.""





[Related: 'The Bachelor': Was That the Awkwardest Kiss Ever?!]

How far Juan Pablo has fallen! When he was chosen to be the ""Bachelor"" in August after vying for Desiree Hartsock’s heart on ""The Bachelorette,"" his adoring public couldn’t stop gushing over his abs, his sexy accent, and his tender love for his daughter. At the ""Men Tell All"" taping, female audience members screamed ""JUAN PABLO"" so loudly, they could practically be heard in the next state.



Fast forward half a year, and he's generating comments like this:





Juan Pablo is honestly the worst bachelor they have ever chosen; he has noo personality, he's rude, & he has bad taste In girls #sendHIMhome — Abby Martinson (@abbymmsugar013) February 26, 2014

Let me speak for every woman in the United States, Juan Pablo is the absolute worst bachelor. — Regan Brickman (@ReganBrickman) February 26, 2014

Spoiler alert, Juan Pablo falls in love with himself. It took him the whole season but he now realizes he is the best thing for him. — William Holman (@WilliamFHolman) March 10, 2014

I mean. Juan Pablo is really the worst. — Gillian Smith (@gillyheartsyou) March 4, 2014

It all began early in the season, when Juan Pablo made remarks against having a gay ""Bachelor."" He apologized for the derogatory comments, but they ignited a controversy that the show still hasn’t escaped.



Then he displayed hypocritical behavior — sometimes he would hold off on kissing women out of ""respect"" for his young daughter, Camila, while other times he would make out with one contestant in front of the others.





[Related: A 'Bachelor' Finalist Leaves After Disaster Fantasy Suite Date]

The most egregious example was when he ""slut-shamed"" finalist Clare, who asked him to join her for a late-night swim in the ocean. The next day, he essentially blamed her for putting him in a situation that was ""disrespectful"" to his daughter.



And, as our source noted, two of the top six women left early by their choice. Andi Dorfman departed after a ""disaster"" fantasy suite date. She accused Juan Pablo of being self-absorbed and never asking her questions about herself.









The recent ""Women Tell All"" episode confirmed that hardly anybody seems to consider Juan Pablo a good catch. They eviscerated him for using the ""language barrier"" and his daughter as excuses for his conflicting, hurtful behavior.



We don’t know whether to congratulate or feel bad for whichever of the final two women, Nikki or Clare, wins... if you can even call it winning.

While I'm guilty of getting sucked into the reality show, some weeks (especially this season) the show's biggest draw is the excuse it provides to invite friends over and mix a few cocktails while watching. That inspired me to find some rose-themed cocktails for tonight's season finale.

Rose syrup is a extra-sweet variation on simple syrup that's infused with rose petals. It can add a mild floral taste and light pink hue to a drink, depending on how much you use. It's also quite easy to make at home – just boil sugar and water, then simmer lightly with rose petals and let it infuse for a couple hours.

You can use rose syrup as a sweetener in myriad cocktails. In fact, it adds a nice touch to even standard recipes like margaritas (see my version below). That's the beauty of infused simple syrups – they're an easy way to add a fresh touch to otherwise familiar drinks.

Below are three rose syrup cocktails perfect for sipping while seeing who Juan Pablo picks – or on any other occasion, for that matter.",

If you've been watching this season of ""The Bachelor,"" then you know it's probably the MOST dramatic season yet. (Cue the Chris Harrison voiceover).

It's understandable when all of us viewers (whether you love or hate the show) complain about Juan Pablo's annoying idioms and utter lack of emotional attachment to anyone other than his daughter, Camila. But, you know it's bad when Juan Pablo agrees …

""The Bachelor"" star tweeted to promote the series finale on Monday, March 10, and said what we've all been thinking:

The day has COME... Finally TODAY the soap opera comes to an END... 😃 — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 10, 2014

So, let's get this straight.

Even THE Bachelor himself thinks this whole season (and debatably the whole show) is one, big soap opera? For once, Juan Pablo seems to really know what he's talking about!

So, on that note, let's take a look back at Season 18 -- in all its melodrama -- from the beginning.

One of the girls, Clare, was crazy enough to fake a pregnancy right off the bat and still made it to the final two.



The stress of it all lead one girl to drink a little (or a LOT) too much and put on quite a show.



One man dating 27 women is asking for confusion and heartbreak, like the time Kylie thought her name was called, but it wasn't.



There's always the character who is a bit more open with her body. Gotta spice things up …



Juan Pablo has always made sure to push the girls to the edge of their comfort zone and a bit into the panic range. Remember when he asked Andi to pose naked?



As in any good soap, alliances formed and rivalries blossomed, notably between our final two, Nikki and Clare.





To cement the similarity, it's been impossible to tell who is actually the crazy one.



Meanwhile, Juan Pablo is just going along his merry way -- confused as ever. Whether it's the girls, his grasp of the English language or his unwillingness to emote, our protagonist is always a few steps behind.



Of course, this lead him into a few muddy situations: for one, the time he had a late night ""swim"" with Clare and blamed her for inappropriately coercing him.



Or the time he eliminated Cassandra on her birthday, which led to her breakdown about how long she's been waiting to find the love of her life. (Keep in mind that she was turning 22 years old.)



Of course, not everyone blindly swooned over Juan Pablo's Latin charm. His obvious favorite, Sharleen, turned the tables and disappointed our main man.



Others, like Renee, fell in love before getting sent home.



As our soap comes to an end, tensions are high and drama begins to unfold … like the time Andi gave up and pointed out all of Juan Pablo's obvious flaws.



At the end of the day though, there is only one thing any of us can say.



Tune in for the season finale of the Bachelor Monday, March 10, at 8/7c.",

http://www.latintimes.com/bachelor-2014-winner-spoilers-top-5-reasons-why-clare-crawley-will-not-win-juan-pablos-final-rose,entertainment,"Tonight’s finale of “The Bachelor” will finally conclude the sad chronicle of Juan Pablo on season 18 of ABC’s hugely popular series. Even though we haven’t yet watched the final rose ceremony, multiple spoilers reports claim that this season’s front runner did not end up winning Juan Pablo’s heart, instead Nikki Ferrell home the final rose. So why after several one on one dates, steamy make outs and, of course, their infamous moonlight ocean dip did Juan Pablo not choose Clare Crawley as the season 18 winner? Well because there are many more factors at play involved in choosing the final lady then just the amount of time JP and Clare spent together.

The main reason as to why Clare will not win Juan Pablo’s heart is mainly because Clare was too smart for her good, and unfortunately treated the dating competition as just that— a competition. Clare knew exactly how to get Juan Pablo’s attention, not because he was actively seeking her out, but more due to the fact that Clare knew how to put himself on his radar at every opportunity. Some simple examples of Clare’s tactics include her refusal to eat the octopus and then only tasting it “for him,” or the more well known and controversial ocean swim that led to Clare and Juan Pablo engaging in the earliest intimate night in the history of “The Bachelor.” Even though Clare was on the receiving end of most of Juan Pablo’s attention, she never really got to know him instead continually one-upped her fellow contestants.

Even when they attempted to further their relationship, it was all based on psychical attraction rather than an emotional connection. Like Sharleen who notably eliminated herself from season 18, Juan Pablo and Clare have a serious magnetism to each other but it seems like that wasn’t enough for JP to choose to spend the rest of his life with her. More over the most important piece of evidence indicating that Nikki will receive JP’s final rose instead of Clare, is Camila. Juan Pablo introduced his young daughter to Nikki in Miami, and that is most likely the most important clue into telling us whom JP truly cares for.",

LOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Who win the Bachelor 2014? Last fall, RealitySteve’s Bachelor 2014 spoilers announced who Juan Pablo picks. Final results for The Bachelor tonight March 10, 2014 reveal if the Bachelor 2014 winner is in fact just as RealitySteve predicted, and if Juan Pablo makes his pick consistent with months of RealitySteve spoilers.

Tonight the mystery over who wins the Bachelor 2014 is resolved. And if Reality Steve’s spoilers are correct, tonight ABC viewers will watch the Bachelor 2014 name Nikki Ferrell as your winner. The question remains, however, what happens thereafter. Details about why Juan Pablo picks Nikki, how he picks Nikki, and more important, what happened to Juan Pablo and Nikki after filming ended, remain uncertain.

RealitySteve tells news today 3/10/14 that viewers should ignore tabloid reports about Juan Pablo. Does Juan Pablo live with his parents, is Juan Pablo broke, and does Juan Pablo deliver an engagement to Nikki in the finale tonight? For several seasons, tabloids have historically delivered fake spoilers in advance of the finale. These “faux spoilers”, as LALATE called them last year, involve tabloids telling readers that they have juicy spoilers about the season finale, when in fact the tabloids know that the spoilers are actually untrue.

Steve says Juan Pablo picks Nikki, Juan Pablo does not propose to Nikki, Juan Pablo and Nikki are still not engaged, but that they are still together. However, RealitySteve has been telling readers allot lately that “it means nothing.” But has not yet clarified what he means. For example, on Monday he tweeted “As four tonight spoiler, nothing has changed since St. Lucia. Ignore the tabloid reports. Juan Pablo. & Nikki still together, even though it means nothing.”

But could RealitySteve be wrong? He has been wrong before. Last season on the Bachelorette, it appeared in the penultimate episode that RealitySteve’s spoilers were going to be wrong. Reaction heated Twitter the night of that episode. But RealitySteve defended his predictions. In the end, his Bachelorette spoilers were wrong. And yet, Steve has never truly told viewers how, where and why those spoilers turned out to be wrong, very wrong.

Along with tonight’s episode have come other predictions about the finale’s editing. “ABC is gonna have to do one h–ll of a spin/editing job this season. First, knowing that the spoilers are out there, they’ll edit the show to throw people off in any way they can”, Steve told news. But that has not exactly happened.

Steve adds that “And secondly, to convince America this guy is sincere … let’s just say the light isn’t even on upstairs and nobody’s home.” Steve did correctly predict backlash about Juan Pablo this season. So far Juan Pablo has appeared on several magazine covers being called the worse Bachelor ever. That type of reaction was predicted by RealitySteve last winter. “But this notion that this is the best Bachelor they’ve ever had and what a great season it’s going to be is all propaganda. In the end, a guy who didn’t care from the beginning picked the girl that no one liked …..Their dream is going to be crushed.”

Love hurts! Juan Pablo Galavis will make his decision between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell — or no one at all — on the finale of the Bachelor Season 18 on Monday, March 10. One thing, however, is certain — there will be tears.

In a sneak peek video from the finale, Clare and Ferrel are both seen sobbing as they prepare to either get a proposal or the old heave-ho from Juan.

“I could definitely imagine my future with Juan Pablo,” hairstylist Clare, 32, says. “I’ve fallen in love with him.”

“Every little girl dreams of their wedding . . . Dreams of the day they know they found someone,” pediatric nurse Nikki, 26, says. “In a few days, he’s going to be down on one knee.”

Clare and Nikki both meet Juan’s family, and have honest, frank discussion about the 32-year-old Venezuela-raised single dad’s personality.

“He sometimes is very rude,” Juan’s mother tells Clare. “It made me cry,” Clare replies, referring to their fight in Vietnam when Juan said he regretted an intimate swim the two shared in the ocean.

Waiting to find out whether or not Juan loves them back, eventually takes its toll on the ladies. Both are shown crying in their hotel rooms in St. Lucia as they await their fate.

“I could pick out all the negative things and dwell on them, but I don’t want to lose this,” Nikki says.

The finale of The Bachelor Season 18 premieres Monday, March 10 on ABC at 8:00 p.m. EST. Watch the sneak peek video above and tell Us: Who do you think Pablo will end up with in the finale?",
http://www.latinpost.com/articles/8656/20140310/abc-bachelor-2014-spoilers-who-will-win-finale-producers-reportedly.htm,entertainment,"Fans of The Bachelor are counting down the minutes until tonight's finale when Juan Pablo Galavis will finally pick a lucky lady. According to reports, some unlikely candidates also can't wait for season 18 to end: the show's producers.

Galavis has been criticized plenty by the ABC show's contestants, former The Bachelorette contestants and even host Chris Harrison. Now, a source ""connected"" with The Bachelor says that Galavis isn't getting love behind the scenes either.

""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over,"" the source said in an interview with E! News.

Galavis first started drawing negative attention when he said that gay people should not be on The Bachelor because ""they're more pervert"" (he later blamed it on his poor English). The source says that The Bachelor's crew and producers are still not over the controversy.

""His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend,"" the insider continued.

As a result, the source says that the season 18 finale will be celebrated for more reasons than one.

""It has not been anyone's favorite, that's for sure,"" the source added.

Meanwhile, ""multiple sources"" claim that Galavis and the woman he gave the final rose to have been doing ""lots of fighting.""

""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,"" another source said.""If they are together at the finale, it's probably just an act.""

Galavis will make his decision tonight at 8/7c on ABC.

SPOILER ALERT: So why is Galavis fighting with his supposed soulmate? According to Star-Spin, Nikki will win the final rose. The site claims that Galavis and Nikki never got engaged but are still together. LALATE, however, claims that Galavis is now flirting with others. Perhaps the rumors are getting to The Bachelor winner.

While it was known to the general public that Juan Pablo was no Sean Lowe, aka sweet, smart and oh so marketable, E! News just revealed that there would be no future partnership between ABC and Juan Pablo. The celebrity news outlet claims that the show’s producers, who were first thrilled with the idea of the first Latino bachelor, are know counting down the moments until season 18 comes to a close. Juan Pablo will of course have his fair share of late night talk show appearances, but a source told E! News that his time in the limelight will soon be up, ""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over.""

The fans, the producers and even the winner of season 18 of “The Bachelor” have allegedly had enough of Juan Pablo. While we don’t yet know for sure, whom Juan Pablo will pick, but according to Reality Steve, the Latino bachelor will choose Nikki Ferrell over Clare Crawley but that doesn't mean he is picking her for life. Many news outlets are speculating that on tonight’s finale episode, JP does not propose to Nikki, but he does at least give her the final rose, so despite the lack of engagement, there is some sort of a commitment between the pair. Although E! News reports that the pair’s commitment has already run it’s course, apparently there has been “lots of fighting” happening between JP and Nikki.

A source claims that JP and Nikki “are together at the finale, it's probably just an act,"" another source supports the claim that the couple’s relationship is already falling apart. The tension between the couple will come to a head on the live “After the Final Rose” episode, making it one of the most dramatic “Bachelor” finales ever. ""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,"" the source says. There are some reports claiming that ABC is attempting to salvage the season by paying JP to propose to Nikki on the “After the Final Rose” special, but considering their failing relationship ABC and Nikki Ferrell might just want to cut ties and run!",

With all of this in mind, then, it's no wonder that Juan Pablo Galvais has been voted the ""Worst Bachelor Ever.""

According to E! News, the latest gaffe made by the least likable Bachelor in ABC history came as an end result of him re-tweeting a joke made by one of his ""fans"" on Twitter. The ""joke"" read: ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!""

He then added insult to injury by Tweeting that he ""loved"" the joke, while laughing along with it. CLASSY!

When people -- justifiably -- called him out on it, he defended the joke by blaming a language barrier, then said that ""some people need to TRAVEL more often."" Even classier!

No surprise, then, that the people who are working behind the scenes of The Bachelor can't wait for the show to be over, according to The New York Daily News. ""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over,"" a source close to the show told the newspaper.",

The season finale of The Bachelor airs Monday night on ABC, with the reality TV star set to make his decision between Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley. But Monday night also marks the final edition of upstate New York store Rochester Appliance's four-week-long ad campaign featuring Galavis.

‘The Bachelor’ Winner Spoilers: Who Does Juan Pablo Choose, and Do They Stay Together?

“The Bachelor” season 18 finale is set to air tonight (Monday) at 8 p.m., and spoilers about what will happen have been coming out.

Juan Pablo is going to choose between Clare Crowley and Nikki, but some people already know what will happen because the entire season was filmed in 2013.

Reality television blogger Reality Steve–whose prediction for the end of last season was wrong–is insisting that Pablo chooses Nikki. Other entertainment blogs are saying the same thing.

But, he says, Pablo will not propose to her, making it the first season since Brad’s first season that there won’t be an engagement.

Reality Steve says that Pablo never had any intention of finding a wife on the show–instead, he wanted to use it to get fame because he wants to act and model.

Steve added that Pablo is being offered money to propose to Nikki on the “After the Final Rose” (ATFR) show–which airs live after the season finale.

(ABC/Rick Rowell)

(ABC)

Apparently people involved with the ABC show are not fans of Pablo, with a source telling E! News that “Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over.”

Producers and crew members have never been so ready for a season to end, the source said.

“It has not been anyone’s favorite, that’s for sure.”

Another source said that Pablo and the winner of the show have been fighting a lot.

“Producers are hopeful that they’ll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,” one source said.

“If they are together at the finale, it’s probably just an act.”

Meanwhile, Andi Dorfman, who voluntarily left “The Bachelor,” is reportedly poised to become the next “Bachelorette.”

That announcement will be made tonight during or after the ATFR show.",
http://nypost.com/2014/03/10/the-seven-best-moments-from-this-years-bachelor/,entertainment,"It will be a battle of the blondes on the season finale of “The Bachelor” Monday night, when 32-year-old Venezuelan single dad Juan Pablo Galavis will have to choose between hairstylist Clare Crawley and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell. Whom will he choose? Will the two women, sworn enemies, utter a single word to each other? It’s anyone’s guess, but it’s certainly been a crazy season. Here are our favorite moments from this season of El Bachelor:

Baby bump alert!

When Clare arrived at the opening-night ceremony wearing a prosthetic baby bump. Gentlemen, when a woman shows up for a first date pretending to be pregnant, you can’t say you haven’t been warned about any manner of crazy that ensues. Points awarded to Clare for truly bizarre humor, though.

Meet Lucy: the “free spirit”

Contestant Lucy — whose occupation was listed as “Free Spirit” — and her inability to keep her clothes on. Whether she was happily strolling down the street nude to promote animal adoption or flashing everyone in the pool, Kate Upton BFF Lucy Aragon seemed far more interested in having fun than in pursuing any great love connection with blond, bland Juan Pablo. For this, Free Spirit Lucy, we salute you.

The Vietnamese Beach Incident (a.k.a. Juan Pablo slut-shames Clare)

Getting caught up in the spontaneity of a moment, Clare knocked on JP’s door and invited him for a midnight swim; he happily accepted, and there was a wild makeout session in the water. We didn’t hear any complaints until the following day, when JP announced that the hookup had been a mistake — he has a 4-year-old daughter, after all. Clare was ashamed; tears flowed, and “I have a 4-year-old daughter” was firmly established as JP’s favorite convenient excuse (followed closely by “English is my second language”).

Andi’s dad

Hy Dorfman became the toast of Bachelor Nation during the show’s “Hometown Visits” episode, wherein Juan Pablo visited four contestants and their respective families. When asked if he would give his blessing to Juan Pablo and Andi, Hy turned the question on Juan Pablo, asking him how he would feel if his own daughter came to him with a man who was dating several other women. “If I seemed over-protective on the show, it is because I am protecting the most spectacular, special, amazing daughter in the world,” Hy tweeted after the show. The best part? If Andi Dorfman becomes the next Bachelorette, as has been widely speculated, we’ll get to see more of Hy.

Chris Harrison’s barely concealed disdain for Juan Pablo

The host’s normally jovial demeanor has been cool this season; it’s clear from his flinty-eyed glances that he thinks Juan Pablo is a huge tool. In that estimation, he is far from alone; the hashtag “WorstBachelorEver” had plenty of entries on Twitter, and E! News published a recent story saying that Juan Pablo would not be cast on season 18 of “Dancing With the Stars” (he was reportedly seriously being considered at one point). It didn’t help when Juan Pablo said a gay “Bachelor” doesn’t belong on TV because gays are “more ‘pervert’ in a sense.” He blamed it on the language barrier. Nice try.

Sharleen says bye-bye to ‘The Bachelor’

Professional opera singer Sharleen Joynt was a breath of fresh air on the show, a gorgeous, smart woman who, while physically attracted to Juan Pablo, felt she was missing that “cerebral connection” she needed. “I wish I was a little dumber,” she said, frustrated with her tendency to “overthink” situations (not a problem shared by Juan Pablo). She mystified many of the other women, who seemed truly baffled that Juan Pablo was intrigued by the brunette. (Ladies, a hint: It could have had something to do with the fact that she wasn’t falling over herself to date him.) Sharleen eventually left of her own accord, a refreshing change from the usual tearful rose ceremony rejection with the guy calling all the shots.

Andi dumps Juan Pablo and ‘es okay’

Fellow gorgeous smart woman Andi was another contestant to feel that Juan Pablo’s charms were only surface level; after a night in the Fantasy Suite that was anything but fantastic, she elected to leave as well. Juan Pablo’s response to this breakup? “Es okay,” he said, shrugging. And then, several more times throughout the farewell conversation: “Es okay.” We hope he’s looked into copyrighting this phrase; while “DWTS” doesn’t look like it’s going to pan out, there are always T-shirts and coffee mugs to be sold.",
http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/03/09/the-bachelor-craziest-moments-juan-pablo-dissed-pics-andi-nikki-clare/,entertainment,"Poor Juan Pablo. Season 18 has been a rough one on him. He may be one of the better looking bachelors, but he’s definitely one of the least liked — which means this season of ‘The Bachelor’ was one of the most explosive ever.

During Juan Pablo‘s search for love, he encountered many (and we mean many) hilarious OMG moments. Somehow, we cut down the tons of crazy Bachelor moments down to six — and with the finale taking place March 10, we’re reminding you of the best, worst, and just all-around awkward moments on season 18. Click through our gallery to relive each and every one.

‘The Bachelor’ Craziest Moments

While I’ll let you click through the gallery of the best moments, I have to run down some of most shocking moments of the season that I still can’t believe even happened. [hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]

The best moment of the entire season was when Andi Dorfman told JuanPabs exactly what he needed to hear — it’s not ok to only talk about yourself on every single date, it’s not okay to just kiss when you’re not talking about yourself, it’s not okay to bring up your overnight date with Clare on your overnight date with Andi, and it’s not ok to to tell someone they “barely” made it this far. Oh, and most importantly, it’s not ok to say “ees ok” after every statement. Then she tells him she’s over it. Even at the Women Tell All special, she said that she pretended to be asleep that night so the overnight date would be over. Ouch!

However, Andi wasn’t the first to leave voluntarily. Sharleen was a favorite of JP’s all along, but since day one, she wasn’t sure she was totally into it. While their sexual chemistry was apparently really good (and the kissing was really bad to watch) , she pretty much told Juan Pablo she couldn’t see him as the Juan for her. She also told the cameras continually that pretty much, she was too smart for him. She actually said at one point, “I wish I was dumber.”

They definitely had a connection, as did Juan Pablo and Andi — but both the girls (in my opinion) took the right route and got out of there!

Nikki Rocks ’70s Cowgirl Look

One more moment I’ve got to mention is that outfit that Nikki Ferrell rocked before she spent the night with Juan Pablo. They went horse back riding, so she wore pants, and they swam in the ocean, so she paired the pants with a bikini top — sounds ok? Well, we have to mention that the pants looked like a uniform from Woodstock, as they were wide-leg and floral print, and the bikini top had tassels all over it . . . Maybe she was going for ’70s cowgirl? The only thing more uncomfortable was that Juan Pablo told her if she wanted to just wear a thong, he’d be fine with that. Ugh!

More ‘Bachelor’ Coverage:",
http://www.ibtimes.com/bachelor-2014-spoilers-why-juan-pablo-was-worst-bachelor-ever-his-7-most-controversial-moments,entertainment,"Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is coming to a close on ABC on March 10, and needless to say the 2014 season has been a complete mess. Rumor has it that the producers and crew members have dubbed Juan Pablo “the worst bachelor ever,” and in honor of that, we’re looking back at his seven most controversial moments this season:

1. Not Kissing Lauren … And Then Kissing Clare

Juan Pablo started off the season by making and breaking some rules. In episode 4, Lauren tried to kiss the bachelor but was immediately shot down. Juan Pablo tried to console her, but Lauren ended up in tears.

“I know that you’ve kissed other girls,” she told him. But all Juan Pablo would tell her is that it’s not an easy situation. He proceeded to tell the cameras that he’s not on the show to kiss everybody … but then went on to kiss Clare shortly after.

“I know I said I’m not going to kiss anybody,” Juan Pablo explained to the cameras. “But she’s sexy. She’s hot.”

2. Juan Pablo’s Anti-Gay Remarks

While doing an interview to promote his season of “The Bachelor,” Juan Pablo made an extremely controversial comment about the possibility of a future gay bachelor. The 32-year-old reportedly told The TV Page’s Sean Daly: “I respect [gay people], but, honestly, I don’t think it’s a good example for kids.” “The Bachelor” star continued that he finds gay people to be “more ‘pervert’ in a sense,” and that the show would be “too hard to watch.”

“Bachelor” host Chris Harrison later told the Hollywood Reporter that he was “disappointed” in Juan Pablo’s comments and that they don’t reflect his feelings or thoughts on the subject. Juan Pablo ended up being confronted by rejected bachelorette Kelly during the “Women Tell All” special, and told her that they would discuss it after the show.

3. Clare’s Ocean Drama

From the start of the season, Juan Pablo shared a steamy connection with Clare – and things escalated between the pair in episode 5. After a group date in Vietnam ended up with the two in his private pool, Clare decided to pay the single dad a visit in his hotel room … at 4 a.m. Asking him to jump in the ocean with her, Juan Pablo stripped off his shirt in a blink of an eye and ran after the 32-year-old California native. Clare told the cameras that the two “just went for it” and that it was “pure bliss … in every way.” But Juan Pablo didn’t feel the same way.

The next day he pulled her aside and told her that he made a mistake. However Clare stood by her actions, telling the cameras that “there was no misunderstanding.”

4. Sending Cassandra Home On Her Birthday

Juan Pablo made a promise to single moms Cassandra and Renee that he would let them know immediately if he didn’t feel a connection with them so that way they wouldn’t be separated any longer from their children. And he did just that with Cassandra … on her 22nd birthday.

“I’ve been thinking a lot,” he told her. “It’s been so hard for me because you’re so gorgeous, you’re funny, you’re so nice … I wish we were in the same chapter.”

It may not have been “controversial” that he dumped her on her birthday, but “Bachelor” fans did find it cruel.

5. Sending Renee Home After Meeting Her Son In Hometown Dates

All season long Juan Pablo has called Renee and Cassandra his “special ones” because they are single moms. However after deciding to go on a Hometown date with Renee and meeting her son, he ended up dumping the 32-year-old. The move seemed hypocritical after he insisted throughout the season that he moved slow with her and was respectful of kissing her because he had her 8-year-old son, Ben, in mind. His decision to dump her after meeting Ben became even more controversial when he revealed a story about how Ben had been devastated over his mom’s last breakup.

6. The Fantasy Suite ‘Nightmare’ With Andi

Andi made it into the top 3, but when time came for her and Juan Pablo to spend some time away from the cameras in the fantasy suite things began to fall apart. While Andi stayed the night in the suite, in the morning she told the cameras that she couldn’t leave fast enough. According to the 26-year-old assistant district attorney, Juan Pablo spent the night “name dropping” and talking about his overnight date with Clare. She continued to tell the cameras that their evening was “unbelievable” and inappropriate” due to his inability to filter. “He thinks that he could say whatever he wants to say,” Andi explained, saying that it’s “just offensive.”

7. The ‘Default’ Dilemma

Andi chose to have a heart-to-heart with Juan Pablo about her decision to leave, and things proceeded to blow up. Juan Pablo told her everything was “OK” and that he respected her decision, but that wasn’t what Andi wanted to hear.

“It’s not OK,” she fired back at him. “I put myself out there … it bothers me when you say it’s okay.”

The bachelorette then brought up the fact that Juan Pablo allegedly told her that she made it into the top 3 by “default.” However Juan Pablo told her that he didn’t say “default” because it’s not in his vocabulary … instead he told her that he may have said “you barely made it here.”

“She put words in my mouth by saying that I used the word ‘default,’” Juan Pablo later wrote in his blog for People. “It was because of her comments in Atlanta about wanting badly to fall in love that I almost decided to bring Renee instead of her, but I followed my heart and feelings instead.”

The season finale of “The Bachelor” airs on March 10 on ABC at 8 p.m. EDT. What did you think was the most jaw dropping or most controversial moment with Juan Pablo on “The Bachelor”? Let us know in the comments section or send a tweet to @AmandaTVScoop.",

The Bachelor type TV Show Network ABC Genre Reality

Today’s the day, rose lovers! By the time we fall asleep tonight, we’ll know the outcome of Juan Pablo’s aventura to find love. Will he choose Clare? Will he choose Nikki? Will he propose? Will he walk away alone? Luckily, we’re only a few hours away from finding out the answers.

To tide you over until the finale, we’ve got one last installment of our countdown to the Bachelor finale. Specifically, it’s an exclusive deleted scene from the season’s last episode, in which Juan Pablo meets with jeweler Neil Lane to look at rings and discuss his final two women. And by discuss, we mean he says, “They smile a lot.” And when Neil Lane asks Juan Pablo who he “shine[s] the most with,” Juan Pablo doesn’t seem to have an answer. All of this leads to one burning question: Will he propose to anyone?

Watch the Bachelor fumble over his words (and look a little panicked) in the clip below:

Tonight, it’s finally here: The light at the end of the tunnel for “The Bachelor.” What this season has shown to us is that this show’s fanbase is one of the most patient ones out there. Even though this season is by most estimations terrible, and Juan Pablo Galavis is not exactly the most sought-after man in America (let alone his in Miami), people still watch.

As of right now, the biggest question for many is whether or not we are going to actually see him still with the person he picks, and we’ll find that out during the live “After the Final Rose” special tonight. If there is a woman still by his side, maybe she can give a much better explanation about why he comes off some badly than Juan Pablo has been able to give himself.

At this point in time, there’s not really even that much of a debate to us: Nikki Ferrell is almost surely winning the thing. Her relationship with Juan Pablo is so much more natural than anything that Clare Crawley has with him; there just seems to be a whole lot more there when it comes to drama, and we have already seen from him that this is not a guy who is particularly down for that. With his attention on his daughter, he probably just wants to say “it’s okay” to end every argument under the sun.

As for if Nikki (if this prediction is correct) is still with him, there are only three possible explanations as to why she would:

1. She genuinely loves him, regardless of what any of the tabloids say about him and some of the things that he has said.

2. She recognizes that there is more value in being with him when it comes to her career, or appearances that they could make together. (Then again, we don’t feel like that is necessarily true in this case.)

3. She wants to put on a good face tonight, and then potentially end the relationship a little ways down the road.

Of course, we want to hear all of your responses to these in the comment box below! We’ll have much more of “The Bachelor” moving forward into tonight, so be on the lookout for that; also, sign up now for our CarterMatt Newsletter if you want to get more news and updates from us via email.

Will Juan Pablo propose to the woman he gives his final rose? Are they still together? Read on for the latest The Bachelor 2014 spoilers on the season 18 winner!

WARNING: Major The Bachelor spoilers ahead on who wins and what happens after!

If you haven’t heard already, the news leaked a while back from Reality Steve that The Bachelor Juan Pablo chooses part-time model Nikki Ferrell as the recipient of his final rose. But does Juan actually have feelings for Nikki or was he paid to make things look good for the camera? Will Juan propose to Nikki on the show, or will we have the first The Bachelor finale since 2007 without a proposal at the end?

According to Reality Steve, The Bachelor Juan Pablo was offered an undisclosed amount of money to propose to Nikki Ferrell on the show after giving her his final rose. Regardless of whether he does or not, rumor has it the relationship is completely for show.

“He’s never going to marry Nikki. Nothing has changed from this guy from the very beginning,” The Bachelor spoilers guru Reality Steve says. “He doesn’t want to be married to her, he never wanted to be married to her, and all he’s doing is playing a character on a TV show.”",

The reality TV star also visited a chapel two nights before the show’s finale is set to air.

Far short of controversial comments, Juan Pablo Galavis hit Las Vegas, Nevada, to watch a boxing match just two nights before the The Bachelor finale airs. The opinionated single father apparently also visited a wedding chapel as a possible hint to how the hit dating show might end.

Galavis decided to document his whole trip on Twitter. Mainly there to watch fellow countryman Jorge Linares of Venezuela take on Nihito Arakawa in a boxing match, Galavis also jokingly took a photo of the MGM wedding chapel.

In the photo, Galavis stands in front of the chapel smiling and pointing to the entrance, seemingly teasing fans with what might be a hint to how the show ends in the final episode.

Galavis traveled with two pals who accompanied him to the fight and later to a dinner with 10 members of Linares’ boxing team. The group ate at Joe’s Stone Crab, staying at the eatery for more than two hours.

“It was him and a bunch of guys who were a part of the Venezuelan fighter’s team and a couple of older ladies with big hair,” a source for People magazine said.

CONGRATS to my BRO @JorgeLinares for that WIN tonight… pic.twitter.com/LovIklVxXl — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 9, 2014



After the meal, Galavis and his two friends went to Beacher’s Madhouse nightclub for a short visit. The 32-year-old The Bachelor star didn’t drink anything, but he posed for photos with fans for about 30 minutes. Then the three friends took a stroll around the MGM Grand’s casino where Galavis posed for more photos with anyone who would request it.

After several recent controversial comments, Galavis has become a polarizing figure among The Bachelor fans. Some call him the worst Bachelor ever while others think he’s just honest and possibly misunderstood because of his Spanish language barrier.

After an eventful season, Galavis will choose between his two finalists, Clare and Nikki, on Monday night, and will most likely propose to one of them, given that it all goes well. However, as with many seasons before this one, several rumors have claimed that the current Bachelor does not propose to anyone at the end of the show.",
http://time.com/16150/video-heres-what-usually-happens-in-the-bachelor-finale/,entertainment,"The much-anticipated Season 18 finale of The Bachelor has been touted as the Most Dramatic Finale Ever, which brings up the question: Exactly how juicy would it have to be in order to top all the previous 17 finales? While Juan Pablo, Nikki, and Clare (and Andi) have created plenty of gossip to keep America occupied and guessing at how their quest for love will end, let’s not forget the many men and women who have walked down this road before.

And if their experiences are any indication, there will most likely be a proposal… but a wedding? Improbable.

When the first season of The Bachelor aired in 2002, the dating game show ended with bachelor Alex Michel making a difficult decision in choosing between the final two contestants. While episode previews showed him picking out Harry Winston rings, he didn’t actually propose.

Since then, however, there’s been a steady trend of proposals in recent years, with more than half of the seasons ending in proposals thus far.

Unfortunately, an accepted proposal doesn’t automatically lead to marriage. In fact, only one of the final rose ceremony proposals resulted in a wedding, and that didn’t happen until season 17 with Sean and Catherine. (Jason and Molly from season 13 got married as well, but he actually proposed to someone else on the show.)

Watch the video above to see how it ended for some of the most notable couples from previous seasons of The Bachelor. Juan Pablo fans (if any such people exist) will probably hope that his story ends a little differently from the norm.

‘Bachelor’ Juan Pablo Glavais Is Using The Show & The Women For Fame, Says Former Bachelorette Contestant

No one likes Juan Pablo Galavis this season, as the Bachelor is getting ripped by all of the women and even guys from other seasons are saying that he is using the women on the show for fame.

Chris Bukowski, from Emily Maynard’s Bachelorette season has given his opinion on the Venezuelan charmer and he doesn’t have a very high one of him.

“I’m not convinced any of those girls are going to be his future wife,” Chris told Cupid’s Pulse about Juan Pablo.

The ABC reality show star has come under fire from the women he tried to romance, with Andi telling him off and everyone else ganging up on him during the Women Tell All special, and his actions are what worry Chris too.

“I think he’s using the show as a way to enjoy himself and probably get himself out in the public eye,” he said.

As for his own love life, Chris says he isn’t tied down to anyone right now.

“I am the most single person in America,” but that he’s ready for love with the right girl.

“I love the fairytale endings.”",
http://www.latintimes.com/bachelor-finale-winner-predictions-who-will-juan-pablo-pick-plus-watch-clare-pick-out-wedding-song,entertainment,"The most controversial season of “The Bachelor” is finally coming to a close on tonight’s highly anticipated finale, but before we get rolling on our countdown and predictions there is a new piece of Juan Pablo evidence that we must consider. The evidence is a recently released deleted scene from season 18 of ABC’s hugely popular dating series, and the two subjects in the scene are none other than Juan Pablo and Clare, and like the rest of this couple’s alone time the moment captured on film is tender and romantic.

The competition has come down to just two women, Clare and Nikki, and tonight’s finale episode will have Juan Pablo choosing one of them to marry while the other one just sent home with just her bags in tow. But way back before the competition was narrowed down so severely Juan Pablo and Clare made waves in the literal waves by becoming the first “Bachelor” couple to how should we say this, take a “dip in the ocean” so early on in the competition. They were immediately attracted to each other from the gecko with the pair enjoying the first intimate one-on-one date for the season. During the date, Juan Pablo and Clare enjoyed a private concert from Josh Krajcik. Like many other couples after enjoying his music and show, they have come to consider Krajcik’s “No Better Lovers” their song. Before listening to it in the tender moment that was deleted from the season, they have danced to it before during another one-on-one date.

Juan Pablo plays the sweet song off his cell phone while the pair are just lounging on the couch, the thoughtful gesture takes Clare by such surprise that she even begins to cry. The pair does begin their signature make out, with a bit of candid lip-syncing in between, before Clare announcing, “We should just play it when we get married.” While Juan Pablo does not immediately respond to her request for the wedding song, he does belt out a cute “baby” right in tune with the song, so we are assuming he agrees.

Obviously we are basing our assumption of who Juan Pablo picks off of spoilers, and while the king of TV spoilers Reality Steve claims that JP ends up picking Nikki Ferrell in the final rose ceremony, this exclusive video is making us second guess. JP and Clare had an immediate connection, and the pair are obviously attracted to each other physically, what we thought was lacking was their emotional connection. However, after watching them relaxing together and then JP produce a romantic surprise for Clare, we are thinking that these two are more in love than we first assumed. Clare obviously feels comfortable enough to openly discuss marriage with him, so much so that she is already planning the playlist.",

http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/bachelor-2014-spoilers-winner-nikki-ferrell-clare-crawley-juan-pablo/,entertainment,"Thanks to extensive spoilers announced over a course of several months, we know that Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley are the two finalists to win the Bachelor. Oh, who are we kidding? We knew it was Nikki since before the show even started, thanks to the spoilers populating the Internet. It just proves – the Bachelor may look unscripted, but there are things on the show that are decided by the network brass long before the fans even get a look in.

It’s now been a few months of Juan Pablo ‘searching for love‘, a.k.a. being a douche to the contestants and becoming the most hated Bachelor to ever grace our television screens. Although he’s sent home contestant after contestant every week on the show, Reality Steve has already confirmed that Nikki Ferrell will win the show, much before it even premiered. Since she did, indeed, end up in the final two, it’s hard to imagine that all the spoilers were inaccurate.

Nikki’s attitude and behavior might have also raised eyebrows, and nobody suspected that she would manage to make it to the final two – but alas, here she is. So even if the show is rigged, at least its consistent? Clearly, the brass doesn’t change its mind if they’ve decided that someone is going to win the show.

However, with that being said, rumors have been abounding about the possibility of NO proposal at the end of this season. Not only that, but Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell apparently broke up months ago – either that, or Juan is still dating her as well as numerous other women at the same time. So in other words, this whole Bachelor season has been completely pointless.",

The Bachelor 2014 spoilers might have me believe that it is Nikki Ferrell that he proposes to, but I may believe somewhere in that crazy brain in my head that Clare Crawley still has a shot at taking home that diamond ring!

To me, this is a toss-up and not because I think both of the women are good for Juan Pablo, but because I think this whole season is a joke. You could see that last week on The Bachelor 2014 Women Tell All special and the women ganging up to attack Juan Pablo and not attack each other! They said it (and I agree with them), but they don’t think Juan Pablo was genuine in his search for a wife and stepmother to his daughter Camila.

So, whoever does win The Bachelor 2014 tonight, do we think they will still be together a month from now, if they are ever still together today? I don’t think so, but I am picking Nikki Ferrel to win The Bachelor Season 18 tonight and then moving on to date Jef Holm this summer!

This season of the popular ABC reality dating show has been particularly noteworthy, and Galavis has garnered headlines for his controversial statements off the show and questionable behavior on it. Last week contestant Andi took herself out of the running after a fantasy suite date with Juan Pablo turned ugly.

Andi accused the Bachelor of caring only about himself, and not putting in the time to learn even the most basic details about her.

The season will come to an end Monday at 8 pm ET, when Juan Pablo will pick between the remaining two women, Clare and Nikki.

Viewers who watch The Bachelor finale live online will get to see if there are any fireworks to end the memorable season. The show’s host, Chris Harrison, has said Juan Pablo has generated more interest than any other Bachelor he can remember, and not for all good reasons. Some outlets have painted him as the “most disliked Bachelor of all time.”

Harrison said he doesn’t know if that’s true, but does admit that Juan Pablo is a big draw with viewers.

“I don’t know how you answer that,” Harrison says. “Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven’t that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor…. People want to follow Juan Pablo because he’s unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions.”

Viewers can watch The Bachelor finale live online thanks to ABC’s Watch Live function. The live streaming video may not be available in all areas, but for those who miss out on Monday the show will be put online within a day of airing.

Juan Pablo Galavis, star of the 18th edition of ""The Bachelor"" airing Mondays on ABC.

(AP)

Welcome to the Daily Buzz, a quick and pithy rundown of the stories people are talking about:

Police stumble on two 16-year-olds burying classmate's body in woods; both teens charged with homicide: Chilling?

It’s a scene out of some mob movie – burying a body in the woods late at night.

Only, police in Wylie, Texas, say they came upon just this scene involving two 16-year-olds over the weekend. And when the officers asked the boys what they were doing in the woods on that Saturday night, one responded, chillingly:

""We are burying a body.""

According to CNN, police found the body of 17-year-old Ivan Mejia of Wylie in the woods northeast of Dallas they. The two 16-year-olds, classmates of the victim, have been charged with homicide.

CNN reported that police first became interested when they checked out a suspicious, unoccupied vehicle backed up to the treeline, according to a department statement. Officers went into the woods, and spotted two suspects running from the area.

Police then returned to the car, and the 16-year-olds walked up and answered the question that set off immediate suspicion among the officers.

Daughter, 13, allegedly lured mom into garage so boy, 15, could cut her throat: Should they be charged as adults?

There is so much more to this story than the few facts being reported as this hour – like what is going on with these two teens caught up in an alleged plot to kill the young girl’s mother. But even the scarce details are shocking.

It comes out of Ocala, Florida, where police say a 13-year-old girl allegedly lured her mom into the family garage, where a boy, 15, allegedly waited to cut the mom’s throat. All this, according to CNN.

The Marion County Sheriff's Office said the boy slit the woman’s throat, then the husband, and father of the girl, heard commotion and went to check on the garage.

The boy allegedly put a knife to the dad’s throat, as well. But the father pleaded for his life and the teens permitted him to take his injured wife to the hospital, CNN reported.

'Bachelor' Juan Pablo Galavis: Love him or loathe him? Why this season, concluding tonight, is so controversial

There is no doubt about it. Juan Pablo Galavis is the most controversial ""Bachelor"" ever. (See videos below.)

But the question remains, has the good-looking lightning rod been good or bad for the ABC show, which holds its three-hour finale at 8 p.m. tonight?

On one hand, as a Fox News think piece notes, there's been a ""ton of negativity"" surrounding this season of ""The Bachelor."" And fans haven't been shy about sharing their distaste for Season 18 star Juan Pablo.

But if Juan Pablo is turning off fans; they sure aren't turning off their TVs. Instead, they are talking about the infuriating cut-throat Casanova. So much so, TV types are dubbing it one of the most talked-about seasons in the series' 14-year history.

Man convicted of murdering 7 people in a diner wins $500K lawsuit over tussle with prison guard: Justice?

Don’t spend it all in one place. Such is the usual advice for someone coming into a nice sum of money.

But that advice might not apply to James Degorski. He is a prison inmate serving life in prison for the 1993 murder of seven people at a suburban Chicago restaurant.

And although Degorski just came into a cool $500,000 – his award in in a civil lawsuit in which he alleged a jail guard punched him in the face – he just might have to spend it all in one place. As in prison.

Or, he might not get to spend much of it at all.

Already, the civil award for Degorski is stirring controversy. Victims' relatives Sunday criticized jurors' decision, according to the Associated Press.

""If broken bones are worth a half-million, then how much are seven lives worth? This just doesn't feel right,"" said Ann Ehlenfeldt, a sister of Richard Ehlenfeldt, one of the owners who was killed, according to AP.

Get the background on the inmate’s crimes and learn whether he will be able to spend any of that money.

Will it actually happen and will we have a happy ending on The Bachelor 2014? That is yet to be determined, but we do have a sneak peek of The Bachelor 2014 finale for you to check out in our The Bachelor 2014 spoilers video below!

Last week on The Bachelor Season 18, we took a week off from all the action during the taping of the season and had the Women Tell All special. The eliminated women on The Bachelor 2014 took to the stage to sit down with Bachelor host Chris Harrison to dish on things we didn’t see. What didn’t we see? Well, it seems like all of the women were not impressed with Juan Pablo and how he did not seem genuine in wanting to be there! Jilted exes? I would say the very least. It got harsh at times and I almost felt bad for Juan Pablo, which is hard for me to even type!

Tonight on The Bachelor 2014, his journey comes to an end and the final decision is made. Will it end in Juan Pablo getting down on one knee and proposing to his future wife? Which women (Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell) will go home with a broken heart? Check out the sneak peek here:

The Bachelor prepares to make one of the most difficult choices of this life, having narrowed down the field to two women - Clare and Nikki.

(ABC/Rick Rowell)

After a season full of tears, catfights and early departures, Bachelor Juan Pablo handed out his final rose tonight, and it went to Nikki. But there was no proposal or ""I love you"" from JuanPabs.

Since Jen Steer and Chris Fedor have followed every awkward moment from the beginning, they live blogged during the show.

The last time we saw these contestants, they were in St. Lucia for their one-on-one dates and time in the Fantasy Suite.

Clare confessed her love for Juan Pablo, by eloquently saying, “Honestly, like, I'm just loving like falling in love with you."" Then the pair spent most of the night making out in the hot tub.

District attorney Andi had fun during the day with Juan Pablo while playing a pick-up soccer game then picnicking in forest. But her time in the Fantasy Suite made her realize Juan Pablo knew absolutely nothing about her.

Nikki and JP went horseback riding. Later, she told the Bachelor she loves him.

&lt;a href=""http://polldaddy.com/poll/7866110/""&gt;Who should get Juan Pablo's final rose?&lt;/a&gt;

“I didn’t know that,” Juan Pablo replied.

Before the rose ceremony, Andi called Juan Pablo out on his crap and decided to leave the show.

“There’s a difference between being honest and being an a**hole,"" Andi said.

“The Bachelor” finale aired Monday on ABC with the one-hour “After the Final Rose” special set to follow. Be sure to follow along with Jen and Chris in the comments section.

Are you ready for the Season 18 finale of “The Bachelor”? Viewers of the ABC dating series might be … but it doesn’t sound like Juan Pablo and his lucky lady are.

After weeks of group and one-on-one dates, Juan Pablo has finally narrowed down his search to two women – Nikki and Clare. But with the 2014 “Bachelor” season finale set to air on March 10, reports are surfacing that Juan Pablo and the winner are not going to have their “happily ever after.”

According to E! News, Juan Pablo and the Season 18 winner have been fighting … a lot. “Producers are hopeful that they’ll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,” a source revealed to the site. “If they are together at the finale, it’s probably just an act.”

[WARNING: Do NOT continue reading unless you want to find out who reportedly won Season 18 of “The Bachelor.”]

But who is the woman that Juan Pablo is struggling with? Who Juan Pablo chooses will not be unveiled until the end of the season finale, but Reality Steve (the all-knowing reality-TV blogger) revealed on his site that the Season 18 winner is none other than … Nikki! However Juan Pablo doesn’t reportedly propose to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse. Instead, Reality Steve claims that the 32-year-old single dad will simply “choose” to be with her.

As we previously reported, Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is set to come to a “shocking conclusion” as Juan Pablo prepares to make “one of the most difficult choices of his life.” However viewers will see that Juan Pablo isn’t the only one with a decision to make. Andi’s early departure could potentially throw both Clare and Nikki into a tailspin as they contemplate what went wrong, and if the same thing could happen to them.

But the real drama will come in the “After The Final Rose” special, which is set to air after the finale at 10 p.m. EDT. The special episode will feature a live sit down with Juan Pablo and host Chris Harrison as they discuss the final two women – Clare and Nikki. The bachelor will explain what was going on in his mind during his final few days in St. Lucia, all leading up to the “shocking outcome” of the 2014 “Bachelor” season. It’s during the “After The Final Rose” episode that Juan Pablo will finally be reunited with Clare or Nikki … and fans will be able to see whether tension between the two exists.

Catch the Season 18 finale of “The Bachelor” on March 10 at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC. And don’t miss the “After The Final Rose” special when it airs directly after at 10 p.m. EDT.

Will Nikki get the final rose? Will Clare cry tears of joy? Or will Juan Pablo pull a Brad Womack and choose neither, a possibility that seems more and more likely as his family says below that the star is ""pretty much"" ready to settle down.

Or not. But someone will win the final rose, FWIW.

Barring a stunning development in which Juan pulls a Brad Womack and picks no one this evening either Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley will win Season 18.

We could actually see that happening, for sure, but The Bachelor spoilers indicate he does in fact choose someone. But who? And how? And does it last?

For those details, just read on, The Bachelor fans ...

So will Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley become Juan Pablo's wife? We're going to go ahead and say no and no, based on what we know of this guy.

That said, Galavis does choose one woman over the other:

Nikki Ferrell will walk away as your winner this evening.

The most controversial and least popular Bachelor ever has been accused of not taking this so seriously, and according to Reality Steve, doesn't propose.

According to inside sources, Galavis is still ""hurt"" after getting dumped by Andi Dorfman and ""doesn't necessarily find his soul mate with Clare and Nikki.""

It is speculated that Juan Pablo and the winner ""left as a couple"" after the St. Lucia season finale, but there are no engagement or marriage plans. At all.

So are they still together, since that was October?

Rumors have suggested that when the After The Final Rose special airs tonight, we'll learn that they aren't even together after the ""journey"" we just watched.

Not necessarily, the latest reports indicate.

They are still together as of the ATFR taping, and not only that, the producers are trying to convince Juan Pablo Galavis to propose on the broadcast!

Think he will? We have serious doubts.

The Bachelor spoilers and predictions have been accurate this season, so we're still anticipating a very short lived relationship between Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell.

Still, we've been wrong before, more than once, and until you watch The Bachelor online (or live), you'll ever know with 100 percent certainty what happens.

UPDATE: It's over! Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo Galavis are a couple!

That's right, a couple. She got the rose, but he didn't propose.

Clare Crawley got the boot, and Nikki won. But that's it.

A quick rundown on the season finale:

He told Nikki that he had a ring in his pocket, but he's ""not gonna use it"" because he's ""not 100 percent"" sure he wants to marry her, but ""I like you a lot.""

Somehow, she accepted the final rose anyway.

He told Clare something so offensive that she won't even repeat it on the program and she can't even bear the thought of talking to him again.

His big ""surprise"" was that they are still together!

He won't say ""I love you,"" but they're a couple.

We think. They don't seem to have any plans.

He seems like kind of a jerk to be honest.

As for whether Juan and Nikki have any sort of future, we'll have to wait until the After the Final Rose special, and likely a long time beyond that, to find out ...

Juan Pablo and Nikki: Will it last?

Yes. Forever and ever. They are made for each other. Maybe for awhile. Don't count them out. LOLOLOLOLOL View Poll »

Worst Bachelor ever?",
http://www.realitytea.com/2014/03/10/is-juan-pablo-galavis-the-worst-bachelor-yet/,entertainment,"I think Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis may be past the point of a simple ""Bless his heart."" He just needs to step quietly away from the roses and fade back into obscurity. And while he's at it, he should probably stop blaming all of his insensitive remarks on a language barrier.

On Friday, Juan Pablo retweeted (and then quickly deleted due to backlash) a follower's joke that made light of disabilities. In the aftermath, he told his detractors to ""relax"" and ""try to be happy and enjoy jokes and sarcasm."" I'm confused. Hasn't ol' JP blamed all of his cluelessness about sarcasm on his language barrier? It seems that ABC is as tired of this season's Bachelor as I am!

CLICK THE CONTINUE READING BUTTON FOR MORE!

A source close to the show dished to E! News, telling the site that Juan Pablo is just as dramatic and hard deal with behind the scenes. The insider reveals, ""Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over.""

Continuing, the source explains,""His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend,"" adding that everyone who is working on the show is more than ready for the season to draw to a close.

The insider claims, ""It has not been anyone's favorite, that's for sure,"" with another source sharing that employees of the show believe that Juan Pablo is ""the worst bachelor ever.""

As for finding a wife on the series, many sources cite rumors of ""lots of fighting"" between JP and whoever was lucky (yeah, no) enough to make it to the end. One insider admits, ""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath. If they are together at the finale, it's probably just an act.""

“The Bachelor” (8 p.m., ABC): We’re running out of roses, which means Juan Pablo has a big decision to make in tonight’s season finale. Will he commit? Will she? Will there be a nasty, tabloid-ready breakup weeks from now? Does anyone still care?

“How I Met Your Mother” (8 p.m., CBS): Lily apparently pulls a disappearing act this week. But we’re still hashing over last week’s puzzling episode, which seemed to indicate that the “mother” may not be long for the world. That has to be a red herring, right? Right?!

“Believe” (10 p.m., NBC): Can one gifted child save the world? That’s the question pegged to this new drama series from J.J.

Rumor has it that Ferrell will be the last one standing, as Galavis seemingly made his choice clear when he introduced the pediatric nurse to his daughter and former partner in one of the earlier episodes. The fact that only Ferrell's family seemed to embrace Galavis is a point in her favor.

But Crawley, too, appears to have a strong hold on Galavis, as the duo was seen discussing their wedding song in one of the deleted episodes.

In the clip, Galavis is seen taking out his cell phone, making Crawley feel that he is going to take a selfie. But the bachelor plays Josh Krajcik's ""No Better Lovers,"" which immediately bring tears to Crawley's eyes.

""I love this song,"" Crawley says before kissing Galavis, who in turn comforts crying Crawley saying: ""We started like that. Don't cry.""

Crawley then tells him that they should play the song when they get married. The former Venezuelan soccer did not respond to the suggestion, instead just kissed her.

Later, during a confessional interview, Crawley said that she became emotional as she was caught up in the moment.

""I am lost in the moment. That song is how I feel and how I felt.""

""Juan Pablo has definitely helped to break down those walls that have been up around my heart,"" she added.

Meanwhile, Reality Steve, a blogger who said Ferrell would be crowned the winner much before the current season premiered on ABC, is sticking to his prediction. But he notes that there might not be an engagement when the show ends.

""Juan Pablo and Nikki left Saint Lucia as a couple, but not engaged. First time in 10 seasons, there hasn't been a proposal at the end,"" Steve writes in his blog. He also added that there is a monetary offer for Galavis to propose to Ferrell on the ""After the Final Rose"" show.

It remains to be seen if Steve's prediction will prove to be accurate.

The season finale of ""The Bachelor"" will be telecast on Monday at 8 pm on ABC.

But not before three intense hours, during which Juan Pablo is to select his one and only ladylove – if any of the candidates still want him by that point, of course.



How much damage has Galavis' reputation suffered since the Women Tell All episode?

For diehard fans of the show, EW published a deleted scene on Saturday – presumably to tide them over until the finale. It features Pablo and would-be girlfriend Claire, getting cozy on a sofa (get your mind out of the gutter) and sharing a tender moment, set to Josh Krajcik’s No Better Lovers.

During the tender moment, JP pulls out his phone, making Claire think he is about to take a selfie, romantic guy that he is. But he pulls a surprise move on her, playing No Better Lovers, at which point his ladylove practically melts into a puddle of happiness.

The 'Bachelor' star documents his road trip to the Sin City over the weekend to watch a boxing match between Jorge Linares and Nihito Arakawa at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Mar 10, 2014

AceShowbiz - %cJuan Pablo Galavis% headed to Las Vegas ahead of the broadcast of ""The Bachelor"" season 18 finale. The soccer stud and his two friends drove to the Sin City to catch a boxing match between Jorge Linares and Nihito Arakawa at MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday, March 8 and documented his road trip on Twitter.

""Road Trip with @marquezparis... #Noelamaaaaa,"" he wrote in a caption of a selfie which shows a man seemingly fixing a car in the background. He stopped by the MGM's wedding chapel as he's expected to propose to one of the girls in the ""Bachelor"" season finale.

Juan Pablo also posted photos with Venezuela boxer Linares, one of which features them in the dressing room. He reportedly stood in the ring with Linares when the boxer was announced and later left the arena before the main match of the evening began.

The 28-year-old hunk had a dinner at Joe's Stone Crab as a source said, ""It was him and a bunch of guys who were a part of the Venezuelan fighter's team and a couple older ladies with big hair.""

He made the most of the night by briefly visiting the nightclub and later left for Beacher's Madhouse. He reportedly arrived at 12:30 A.M. and exited after about 30 minutes. He didn't drink but he posed for photos with girls and guys.

Juan Pablo has a reputation as the worst Bachelor ever for his controversial comments and actions. Most recently, he retweeted a message that made fun of people with mental handicaps. The post read, ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r*****d can read, but look at you go, little buddy!""

""Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f**king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone!""

He then defended himself, once again blaming his bad English for the inappropriate tweet, ""Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.""

""The Bachelor"" three-hour season finale will air Monday, March 10 at 8/7c on ABC. Juan Pablo will take Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell to meet his family before he makes his final decision.

http://www.inquisitr.com/1165724/the-bachelor-finale-spoiler-who-will-juan-pablo-pick/,entertainment,"The Bachelor finale is set to air with Juan Pablo Galavis picking between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell, but spoilers indicate a twist ending to what has been an all-around controversial season.

Though Juan Pablo started out as a fan-favorite pick to serve as the latest Bachelor, some of his actions this season have worn thin with viewers. First there were remarks he made in January that having a gay Bachelor would be “too perverted,” a comment that prompted ABC to respond that “Juan Pablo’s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show’s producers or studio.”

Then there have been instances on the show the paint him as a womanizer, including a fantasy suite date with Andi where Juan Pablo seemed not too interested in learning about her. That ended with Andi calling out Juan Pablo for his behavior before taking herself off the show.

The Bachelor finale spoilers indicate an even bigger twist to end the show.

[WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD]

For one, the blogger Reality Steve seems to think that Juan Pablo is more interested in himself than either of the two remaining women. While Steve does say that Juan Pablo ends up picking Nikki, but not actually proposing to her.

Steve, who has successfully predicted the ending of all but one season so far, wrote:

“Make no mistake about this season, and you can choose to believe me or not – this was a complete cash grab for Juan Pablo. He never had any interest in finding a wife on this show, or a step mother for Camila, or whatever else line of BS ABC will run at you all season. This guy wants to act, he wants to be in commercials, he wants to model, and he wants to be on Dancing with the Stars. Come the spring season, you can pretty much bet your a** that Juan Pablo will be on DWTS, even though he can’t dance a lick.”

Reports from after The Bachelor finale seem to bolster the idea. In February, Juan Pablo was seen at a Miami Heat game with singer Mayra Veronica, with witnesses saying the two were acting very much like a couple.

Another source told Life & Style magazine that Juan Pablo has been seen cozying up with at least three different women since the show wrapped, and none of them were the final two women on the show. The source also said that Juan Pablo doesn’t seem to have much direction in his life.

“The cash is running out – fast,” the show insider told Life & Style magazine. “Nobody seems to know how Juan Pablo makes a living. During the week he spends his time going to the gym or the beach. His life in Miami seems rather mundane.”

TOP PICK

The Bachelor (ABC, 8 p.m.): Our long national nightmare is over, at least for the next month or so—Juan Pablo and the 18th season of The Bachelor release their hold on us tonight. Unfortunately, that is because Juan Pablo will then sink his teeth into either Nikki or Clare, two unsuspecting women who came on a television show looking for a soulmate. Their national nightmare is just beginning. Claire had an early lead with all that ocean sex, and that deleted scene with the suggested wedding song might be a sure sign Clare is going to win. [Or a feint to distract us from Nikki’s success! ONLY TIME (and ratings) WILL TELL.] We’re not covering this, because Juan Pablo is a name we’d rather forget as soon as possible. We’d rather Clare and Sharleen hooked up and ditched Juan Pablo for the nearest tropical resort. But that’s why they don’t let us write about The Bachelor anymore—too much slashfic.

Regular Show (Cartoon Network, 7:30 p.m.): We’re tickled because Regular Show is doing an honest-to-goodness Daylight Saving Time-themed episode—Mordecai and Rigby have to change all the clocks in the park. Alasdair Wilkins will only begin to observe Daylight Saving Time when the park does, too.



Believe (NBC, 10 p.m.): And tonight is the series premiere of the much-promoed new NBC drama, Believe—which has Alfonso Cuáron at the helm! Good, right? Not really! Brandon Nowalk reviewed the pilot for us pre-air, and he thinks it’s not good yet, but could be, ONLY IF YOU BELIEEEEVE! Read his review (AND BELIEVEEEEE) here.

Rick And Morty (Adult Swim, 10:30 p.m.): Back after a long hiatus is Dan Harmon’s animated spectacular, featuring a hapless kid and his alcoholic grandpa. Now that Zack Handlen has caught up on the first few reviews we missed, it’s time to embrace Snuffles and his missing testicles with equal fervor. AVE ATQUE VALE. HAIL, AND FAREWELL.

ELSEWHERE IN TV CLUB

Todd VanDerWerff delved into the ’60s sitcom He & She for One-Season Wonders, Weirdos, And Wannabes. It was a show ahead of its time; looking back, it’s easy to see both why it failed and also how enormously influential it would prove to be. He & She laid the foundation for The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but the network didn’t always know what to do with the show. As Todd observes:

It wasn’t as if CBS had a huge number of open timeslots conducive to a witty, urban drama about two young married people who were very obviously having copious amounts of sex (and having a great time with it to boot).

WHAT ELSE IS ON?

Bones (Fox, 8 p.m.): This show, which was just renewed for a 10th (?!) season, is debuting in its new timeslot tonight, after languishing in Fridays for a bit. Is there some kind of planned synergy—or, God forbid, a crossover being plotted between this and The Following? BEELEIEEEEVEEEEEEE!

Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills (Bravo, 9 p.m.): We are pretty sure we have written about the finale of this show already, and also sure that we will feature it again in the future. But some type of finale for RHOBH is happening tonight—and then there will be a three-part, three-hour reunion that will rehash all the drama of the finale. And then we’ll need another reunion special for all the drama after that. And then we’ll all die. Time is a flat circle. BELIEEEEEEEEEVEEE

Top Gear (BBC America, 8:30 p.m.): Richard tests out a Porsche hybrid sports car in Abu Dhabi, and Aaron Paul sits in, and thinks about, the Reasonably Priced Car. They are not the same car. Probably. (BEELIEIEIEIVEIVIEIEIVEIEE)

Bates Motel: After Hours (A&E, 11 p.m.): After everyone goes to sleep, Norman Bates plays video games. Norma watches My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. No one is hurt… tonight.

Jaws (AMC, 8 p.m.): Live every week like it’s Shark Week by watching this movie tonight. Also don’t wear jewelry in the ocean, or douse yourself in fishblood, because we imagine that also draws sharks. Also don’t play that music. When that music starts you just know something bad is going to happen.

Legally Blonde (Oxygen, 8 p.m.): Exercise makes endorphins. And endorphins make you happy! And happy people just don’t kill their husbands.

The Bachelor type TV Show Network ABC Genre Reality

It’s officially time for day three of our countdown to the Bachelor finale! The subject of choice: A deleted scene featuring a tender moment between Juan Pablo and one of his final two women, Clare.

Before all the drama surrounding Juan Pablo and Clare’s dip in the ocean, they were just the happy couple who went on the first one-on-one date of the season. And during that date, they were treated to a private concert from Josh Krajcik. From that point on, they’ve considered Krajcik’s “No Better Lovers” their song. They even danced to it during a one-on-one date later in the season.

And in an exclusive deleted scene, we see Juan Pablo surprise Clare by playing it on his phone, a move that makes her tear up and proclaim, “We should just play it when we get married.”

Watch the video below:

The Bachelor finale airs Monday, March 10, at 8 p.m.",

According to the latest gossip, however, he doesn't have much else to give.

In the latest cover of Life & Style, the tabloid claims to have acquired information that makes Galavis' ""Secret Life EXPOSED."" The magazine reportedly spoke with ""a show insider,"" who shared surprising information about the former professional soccer player, according to Radar Online.

""The cash is running out -- fast,"" the source told Life & Style via Radar Online. ""Nobody seems to know how Juan Pablo makes a living. During the week he spends his time going to the gym or the beach. His life in Miami seems rather mundane.""

In addition, the source claims that Galavis is not quite ready to commit. This is not the first report that the 32-year-old Venezuelan is extra friendly.

""Since filming wrapped, Juan Pablo's been caught getting cozy with at least three women,"" the source continued.

Galavis' is also reportedly getting cozy with the mother of his children, Carla Rodriguez.

""They share a bond that appears to extend beyond their daughter,"" the source claimed.

SPOILER ALERT: The finale of The Bachelor airs Monday at 8/7c on ABC. According to Star-Spin, Nikki will win the final rose. The site claims that Galavis and Nikki never got engaged but are still together. LALATE, however, claims that Galavis is now flirting with others.

Recently, host Chris Harrison shared his opinions on the Bachelor.

""Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy,"" he told TV Guide. ""Whether this was a good fit or not or the best decision, I feel like he's fought it. For me, he gets really defensive and short and that's when he says, 'OK' or 'perfect,' whereas normally you'd have a response. He either gets defensive or goes into dad mode and he talks to them like they're his daughter, and says things like, 'Don't be sad,' and touches their hair.""

He's pulled the language barrier card over and over again to dig himself out of sticky situations, and up until now, I've sort of bought the excuse. A little bit. (I mean, have you heard his English? It's really not great.)

Tomorrow, tomorrow, The Bachelor finale is tomorrow. It’s only a day ah-way! Okay, that’s enough. Perhaps I should let Juan Pablo’s phone do the singing.

In day four of our countdown to the Bachelor finale, we’ve got an exclusive look at a deleted scene involving Juan Pablo and what appears to be his signature move. In this clip, Juan Pablo pulls out his phone and plays Nikki a song, the same way he pulled out a phone and played Clare a song in Saturday’s clip.

But this time, instead of him playing a song his significant other already knows, Juan Pablo picks a song specifically for Nikki. And with lyrics like, “‘Cause you’re the only one for me; your love is like the deep blue sea,” we don’t blame Nikki for feeling reassured. But when he starts to sing along? Yep, he did that with Clare too.

In this edition of “crazy rumors regarding ‘The Bachelor,'” we present something that may actually have a little bit of validity to it: A story regarding just how ready ABC and the show’s producers are to move on from the whole Juan Pablo Galavis disaster. In between his attitude on the show and his feelings on homosexuality and the r-word (which stirred up a lot of conversation earlier this week online), the folks over at public relations have been working overtime. Also, you have the editors desperate to still try and show that he is a good guy that should actually be sought after.

According to a report from E! News, here are a laundry list of reasons why some powers that be are counting down the minutes until they can move forward and focus fully on “The Bachelorette” (which is likely to star Andi Dorfman from this season).

1. The blatant statement from a source that most everyone involved “cannot wait for the season to be over.”

2. There are rumors already that he and the woman that he picked at the end of the show are not getting along, which would hardly come along as a surprise. We know that it behooves ABC if the two are still together for the live “After the Final Rose” special, but at the same time, there’s a sadistic part of us interested more in a complete trainwreck where they break up in front of everyone. We don’t want to see heartbreak, but at the same time, it’s been hard to see how emotionally invested anyone really is with this season so far.

3. Producers were extremely upset over how Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici’s wedding was at times overshadowed in the press by the comments Juan Pablo said about a gay Bachelor: “His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici’s wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine’s special weekend.” This quote sounds a little dramatic since the wedding special still seemed perfectly fine for the bride and groom, but maybe this quote is more of the smoking gun into why Juan Pablo, who was at one point invited to the wedding, was not in attendance.

You can get some more evidence about the disdain for Juan Pablo’s decision-making from Chris Harrison here, as he chided him earlier this season for flip-flopping on Clare Crawley. We’ll have more news soon, and if you want to get some of it via email, subscribe now for our CarterMatt Newsletter.

http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/bachelor-season-18-winner-nikki-ferrell-finale-spoilers-juan-pablo-proposes-clare-crawley/,entertainment,"Season 18 of The Bachelor is coming to a close, in less than a week Juan Pablo will give the last rose to one of the final two contestants, Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell. Bachelor Nation has been tuning into the reality television show since January, and has watched Juan Pablo send home potential bachelorettes one by one, narrowing down his search for true love.

Blogger and Bachelor spy, “Reality Steve” announced pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell would win this season of The Bachelor long before the season premiere on ABC. At first Bachelor fans thought he may be wrong after witnessing Nikki’s negative attitude and rude comments, it was hard to believe Juan Pablo would want to spend the rest of his life with Ferrell, let alone another week. Weeks went by though, and everyone seemed to either be eliminated or quit on their own behalf, and before we knew it the season was nearly over and Nikki Ferrell was in the Final Two. So, it appears Reality Steve was right after all, Nikki Ferrell will win Season 18 of The Bachelor.

If you were hoping to see Juan Pablo get down on one knee and propose to winner Nikki Ferrell during the season finale, then you are going to be seriously disappointed. Rumor has it there was no proposal at the end of this season, the winner Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo broke up months ago! They may take the cake for shortest Bachelor relationship ever. Since the season premiere of Season 18 of The Bachelor in January, Juan Pablo has been linked to numerous women, and none of them are Nikki Ferrell. If they are still together, then someone seriously needs to sit Nikki down and open her eyes to Juan Pablo’s wandering eye.

Now that The Bachelor is almost over, how did you feel about Season 18? Were you as disappointed in Juan Pablo’s stint as The Bachelor as everyone else was? Share your thoughts on this season of The Bachelor in the comment section below.",

You would think he was on the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted List, why are Bachelor fans such haters? Is Bachelor Juan Pablo just misunderstood or is our single daddy a stone cold player?

First off, Astrochicks thinks fans forget this is JUST A TV SHOW! In fact, most girls would swoon if a guy like Bachelor Juan Pablo asked them out. A responsible single father, a former professional soccer player, a handsome guy, who knows how to salsa. Where do I sign up?

Bachelor Juan Pablo a Leo, we think is probably surprised by all the nasty backlash. Unfortunately, social media and blogs like Astrochicks, lets cranky fans hide behind their computers and post horrible comments about someone they’ve never met.

Yes, Bachelor Juan Pablo made some “off the cuff” comments, we definitely don’t agree with everything he said, but Astrochicks has personally met men + women, 100 x worse than this Latin hunk. Hollywood is full of them.

Astrologically speaking, Bachelor Juan Pablo we feel is disillusioned by love and may regret his final rose decision. According to Reality Steve, he chooses Nikki but there’s trouble in paradise. For Astrochicks, we think he seemed more in love with Clare and not Nikki. What happened?

Our Astrology prediction is Bachelor Juan Pablo and Nikki will split. In fact, we think he will return to the loving arms of his baby mama. Hang in there JP, your 15 minutes of fame are almost up.

This entire season of “The Bachelor” has been an utter mess from start to finish, and there is really only one person that you can look at as a major reason why: Juan Pablo Galavis. This is the guy who has been at the center of everything, and to call him a letdown would be being far too kind. Instead, he has sank the show like a lead balloon, blamed his language barrier and culture differences for everything, and also apparently even annoyed a guy in Chris Harrison who is almost always on the side of his leading men and women.

So what did Juan Pablo do in this case that was so egregious? Entertainment Weekly posted a new behind-the-scenes video recently from earlier this season, and it is intense enough to stand out even in the midst of all the other crazy stuff that has happened as of late. Harrison is none too pleased about the fact that Juan Pablo completely told off Clare Crawley for making out with him in the ocean. The horror! This was a PG-rated romantic comedy compared to what Ben Flajnik did with Courtney Robertson.

Harrison actually comes off better in this video that he does most of the time on “The Bachelor,” and it’s quite a bummer that this didn’t make it on the broadcast itself. It shows that he is a little more fair to the women than some of the we-don’t-watch-the-show-but-still-criticize-it pundits would like you to think. It also helps to further along the idea that most people with this season probably cannot wait for this to be over. Sean Lowe at this point may as well be Sir Galahad in comparison.

Regardless of whatever we think about this season, it is still our duty to give you more scoop! Plus, we cannot help ourselves.

All right Bachelor fans: We are five days away from what ABC is promising will be an explosive and contentious season finale. To celebrate, we thought we’d start the fireworks early and show you some of the scenes that got cut from this season’s roller coaster ride of love. Starting now and going through Monday, we will release a new, never-before-seen deleted scene each day. Buckle up, rose lovers: This ride isn’t over yet!

For day one of our countdown, we have a clip of Chris Harrison and Juan Pablo discussing this season’s most talked about moment: Juan Pablo’s late-night swim with Clare. At the rose ceremony, just after Juan Pablo left Clare in tears, Chris confronted him about how the Bachelor “devastated” Clare. As Chris put it: “You really think Camila’s going to be upset if she found you swimming at night?” Suffice it to say that Juan Pablo’s answer didn’t exactly put Chris at ease.

Is this the first time in Bachelor history that Chris really doesn’t like the guy sitting across from him? Decide for yourself by watching below.

""His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend,"" the source added.

According to reports, there has been “lots of fighting” going on between Galavis and the winner of the show.

""Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,"" one source revealed.

Galavis came under fire again after he recently retweeted a post that mocked people with mental disabilities.

""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals.

According to Radar Online, the 32-year old has since deleted his retweet after being slammed online. It is reported that he also included ""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT!"" in the RT, seemingly expressing his amusement.

But not everyone was amused by the f**k, retard and bastard-laden tweet, nor were they amused by Juan Pablo's ""jajajajaja."" The New York-born immediately defended his RT, citing his bad English as the culprit.

""I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture, he first tweeted.

""Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES..."" he says in another tweet.

The father of one also cited cultural differences, saying that ""retard"" is commonly used in Venezuela.

""In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,"" he tweeted.

""Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture,"" he added in another tweet.

It seems that The Bachelor star has only taken the RT lightly and was surprised at the backlash of netizens. He tells followers in another tweet, ""People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM...""",

Clare Leaves Juan Pablo in Tears?

She began by asking Clare how she feels about the communication between she and Juan Pablo.

Clare responded, ""I love it. We had a disagreement but we communicated and he made sure to say, 'This is how I feel' even if it's no what you want to hear.""

Galavis Struggles To Get Approval From Contestants' Families

Juan Pablo's mom then revealed that it is not unusual for him to be ""very rude.""

Clare then confessed that their altercation made her cry, but she still appreciates his honesty.

It definitely looks like she wouldn't mind being a part of Juan Pablo's family either.

She said, ""...They all made me feel like I was at home and I couldn't wait to talk to them. I couldn't wait to share stories with them. I couldn't wait for them to tell me stories about Juan Pablo.""

While Clare might enjoy Juan Pablo's honesty, the reality TV star has found himself in the midst of controversy once again. He retweeted a message a fan wrote to him that made fun of people with mental handicaps.

The tweet read, ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r--d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a [messed] up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!""

Juan Pablo retweeted the post and added, ""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..."" before deleting it.

A tweet he didn't delete was one that defended his actions. He slammed his critics and told them to educate themselves on other cultures.

He wrote, ""I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and LITTLE bit of portuguese...For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN...#Culture. Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES...People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM...In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.""

He also told his followers they need to travel and see the world.

The Bachelor finale airs Monday March 10 at 9/8c on ABC.

2014 Season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo is without a doubt the most hated and disappointing lead the reality show has ever had. The contestants seem to hate Galavis for being disingenuous about seriously wanting to settle down. The crew thinks he is a womanizer, and the producers are tired of his total diva mentality. Spoilers: No matter which one of the girls is the winner; there is no ring to really win on this season's Bachelor.

Venezuela-born Juan Pablo is quick to blame any misunderstandings or criticism on miscommunication, but the rest of the Bachelor crew tend to disagree with him.

An insider on the show told OK! that Galavis is universally disliked by all the behinds the scene staff, because of the way he treats everyone:

""The producers despise Juan Pablo! He was a total diva on set, throwing temper tantrums daily.

""A bad signal on his phone made him explode...Another time he almost reduced a junior runner to tears over cufflinks.""

Another show production whistleblower told OK! that it wasn't just his behaviors, but his constant demands for more money that really had some people regretting ever greenlighting Juan Pablo for Bachelor:

""There's no doubt that he's in it for more fame. Love is not his number one goal.

""[Galavis] demanded more money than any other Bachelor contestant and wanted obscene amounts of per diem and free clothes.""

It's all the concern for himself and no one else that has caused the genteel ladies to turn against him publicly claims a source in In Touch:

""The girls think he's an ass...Initially he comes across as very charming, but as you get to know him, you can tell he is not sincere.

""They want to humiliate him now.""

But 2009 Bachelorette Jillian Harris thinks the world outside the set shouldn't be too quick to judge Galavis based solely by what they have seen on television (via OK! Magazine):

""[Juan Pablo] is really is different...He has very strong opinions, is stubborn and set in his ways.

""But I don't think he's got bad intentions.""

Yeah whatever, he's a slut.

He Put His Foot In His Mouth AGAIN! 'Bachelor' Juan Pablo Makes R-Word Joke, Tells Fans To 'Open Your Mind' And 'Learn Culture'

If Juan Pablo Galavis is trying to become the most-hated Bachelor yet, it’s working.

Hot on the heels of homophobic comments he made in January that enraged the public, Juan has done it again — this time mocking the mentally disabled.

On Thursday Juan Pablo retweeted an insensitive joke made by a fan that read:

“Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I’ve done. I don’t care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you’re f**king special to me, you’re my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!”

Not only did the controversial 32-year-old retweet the offensive message, but he then replied to it.

“JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT…” he wrote — and then later deleted after being slammed with criticism by the public.

Juan then tried to defend himself on Thursday, claiming his poor English was to blame.

I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese… For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN… #Culture — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 6, 2014

Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES… 😂😂😂🙈 — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 6, 2014

People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM… 😉😉😉 — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 7, 2014

He even went on to claim that in his home country of Venezuela, “retard” is not an offensive word.

In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone… #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 7, 2014

But the damage is done, and coupled with his stance that the Bachelor should never have a gay contestant because homosexuals are more “pervert in a sense,” the former soccer pro has quickly become one of the franchise’s most criticized contestant to date.

The season finale of The Bachelor airs on Monday, March 10.",
http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/juan-pablo-retard-joke-mentally-handicapped-twitter-0307/,entertainment,"Juan Pablo is proving himself to be the douchiest Bachelor to ever grace our screens, and that’s saying a lot. He’s already started his fair share of controversies due to his idiotic and insulting comments, and he once again finds himself in hot water after making a horribly insensitive joke about ‘retards’. And once again, he blames his ‘different culture’ on the joke.

The initial ‘joke’ that he tweeted was, “Not every flower can say love, but a rose can. Not every plant can survive thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a fucked up friend, just as I’ve done.” It goes on and on, but it’s too excruciating to continue, and you get the gist.

Basically, Juan Pablo is the WORST. He even stated that he ‘loved‘ the joke, and then later defended himself against people that were [rightly] furious at him. He wrote, “People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM… In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone… #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.”

Again, he blames his idiocy and ignorance on his culture. Poor Venezuelans – if people are stupid enough to believe Juan, they’re going to go and blame Venezuela for this mess. Juan did delete his tweets, but then he also told his followers to ‘learn culture’ and ‘open their mind’. Um, how about you learn about our culture first, especially if you’re living here?

This isn’t the first time Juan’s come under fire for making insensitive comments. He had earlier stated that there shouldn’t be a gay bachelor because homosexuals are ‘more pervert‘. Basically, the consensus is that Juan Pablo is a douche of the first order, and he needs to be banished from public life so we never have to listen to his idiocy again.",
http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/bachelor-chris-harrison-juan-pablo-andi-dorfman-argue-fight-quit-video-0307/,entertainment,"The Season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo has landed himself in hot water multiple times over his “language barrier.” Considering how much trouble he has had with his gay slurs and social media mistakes, one can only imagine how many times Chris Harrison and the Bachelor production team had to edit their video footage and reshoot conversations after correcting his language barrier issues. Although this season has been by far one of the worst seasons of The Bachelor is several years, they did manage to produce an epic Bachelor blooper real courteous to Juan Pablo’s issues with the English language.

Now that Season 18 of The Bachelor is coming to an end, never-before-aired scenes are beginning to emerge all over the internet. Entertainment Weekly just released a clip of Juan Pablo and Chris Harrison arguing over why Andi Dorfman walked out on him after their disastrous Fantasy Suite date.

After Juan Pablo got slammed by Andi and dumped, Chris Harrison asked him what happened. According to Juan Pablo Andi, “wasn’t feeling it.” Harrison, The Bachelor host tried to explain to Juan Pablo why Andi was upset with him, and how she felt like he didn’t care about her feelings or have any interest in getting to know her. It sounds like all Juan Pablo got out of his conversation with Andi after their break-up was, “she say why I say default and I don’t say default.”

Props to Chris Harrison for putting up with Juan Pablo and his alleged language barrier for an entire season of The Bachelor, would you have been able to be that patient with the arrogant Bachelor?",

He said gay men tend to be more ""perverted"" as justification for why such a casting change may be inappropriate for ABC's show.During his season, Galavis was also known for sending his bachelorettes mixed signals -- prompting bachelorette Andi Dorfman to call him a ""rude, arrogant asshole"" after their "" disaster "" of a fantasy-suite date.The woman to receive Galavis' final rose also reportedly leaked a nude photo the former pro soccer player sent her recently, and news had surfaced in early January that Galavis is a deadbeat dad who owed his ex-girlfriend thousands of dollars in unpaid child-support payments for their four-year-old daughter Camila.All of the recent controversies reportedly led ABC to change its mind about wanting Galavis to be a member of Dancing with the Stars' eighteenth-season cast",

The joke, which to clarify was not written by Juan Pablo, but was retweeted to his Twitter profile read, ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can.

For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture."" The star of ABC’s hugely popular dating seris continued his rant stating, ""Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect."" What Juan Pablo is perhaps missing is that not only was his word choice offensive, the indication that all those with mental disability lack the competence to read and not feed themselves crayons is just completely outlandish. Juan Pablo needs a stern lesson in the way of the world, and even is defense of his tweet was lacking claiming the difference in language to be the major cause for concern. The implication and insensitive nature of the joke is offensive, in addition to his use of the r-word.

Juan Pablo’s apology/defense of this joke continued throughout the day with the singe dad also tweeting, ""Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture."" His hastags may be the most telling pat of this apoplgy, which truly shine light on the issue of jokes of this nature. By urging most likely Americans and fans of The Bachelor” to “learn culture” Juan Pablo should take a piece of his own advice and realize that America is a very politically correct country that actively works to openly accept all people. Moreover the insistence to “open your mind” is truly laughable considering Juan Pablo himself is too ignorant to see what hurtful words and comments can do to those who are perhaps already suffering. Do I think he intentionally meant to offend anyone? No-but he should perhaps take some of his own advice and open his mind to the culture of the US and learn acceptance.",

Which of you rose lovers is ready for round two?

Yesterday, we launched our Countdown to the Bachelor finale, in which we will release one exclusive deleted scene each day until Juan Pablo makes his final choice. Day one was all about Juan Pablo’s late-night swim with Clare, and day two focuses on another big talking point this season: Andi’s fantasy nightmare suite.

Just after Andi left Juan Pablo behind, Chris Harrison stopped by to try to figure out what happened. In the clip, Juan Pablo explains that Andi “wasn’t feeling it.” But when the Bachelor starts to talk about whether the word “default” even exists in his vocabulary, Chris tries to jump in and play Dr. Phil by explaining the real reason Andi left. Does Juan Pablo listen?

http://www.ibtimes.com/bachelor-2014-spoilers-new-bachelorette-be-revealed-after-final-rose-special-1560133,entertainment,"After a dramatic season full of tears, breakups and crazy drunken meltdowns, Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is coming to a close. On Monday, Juan Pablo will be forced to choose between Clare, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo. And while viewers of the ABC series are dying to know who the single dad will choose, the main focus of the after-show will be on the next “Bachelorette.”

As we previously reported, “The Bachelor’s” season finale will run three hours instead of the normal two. But the third and final hour of the show won’t be dedicated to the final rose ceremony. Instead it will be the “After the Final Rose” special.

According to a synopsis from ABC, “After the Final Rose” will feature a live sitdown with Juan Pablo and host Chris Harrison as they “discuss his final two women of the season, Clare and Nikki.” Juan Pablo will explain what was going on in his mind during his final few days in St. Lucia, all leading up to the “shocking outcome” of the 2014 “Bachelor” season.

Special guests Chelsie, Kat, Kelly, Renee and Sharleen from Juan Pablo’s season of “The Bachelor” will be in the audience, along with former “Bachelor”/ “Bachelorette” success stories Sean and Catherine Lowe, and Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried. And “After the Final Rose” will feature another mystery guest – the next “Bachelorette.”

While the new “Bachelorette’s” name has yet to be released, many “Bachelor” viewers are speculating (and hoping) that Andi Dorfman will be named Juan Pablo’s successor. Andi quickly became a fan favorite in season 18, despite being the last girl to land a one-on-one date. Making it past hometown dates, Andi’s relationship with Juan Pablo went downhill after her overnight fantasy suite date with him turned into a nightmare. Andi accused Juan Pablo of “name dropping,” not listening to her, and telling her that she was in the final three by “default.” The pair had a nasty showdown in St. Lucia before Andi eliminated herself from the competition.

And fans aren’t the only ones of Team Andi for “The Bachelorette.” Desiree Hartsock, who was “The Bachelor” in 2013, wrote on her blog that she believes the Atlanta woman will take the torch.

“Andi stayed true to how she felt about Juan the day she decided to go home and [stood by her story of] what happened in the fantasy suite,” Des write. “Since she has been a fan favorite throughout this season, I am speculating that she will be the next Bachelorette.”

Do you think Andi will be announced as the next “Bachelorette”? Let us know in the comments section or send a tweet to @AmandaTVScoop.",

Not every r****d can read, but look at you go, little buddy!""...""Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals,""...""You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!""

""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..."" JP added in his own words alongside the re-tweet.

Receiving a flurry of backlash on Twitter just minutes after his post, Galavis got heated, tweeting in his defense:

""I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese. For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture.""

""Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDERSTAND me with all my MISTAKES...""

""People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone...""

""#Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect.""

""Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture.""

Well, Juan Pablo, maybe YOU should have RESPECT when you're in OUR country, and be SENSITIVE to the FACT that the R-word IS offensive in OUR culture. #SorryNotSorry",
http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/03/07/bachelor-juan-pablo-slammed-for-more-controversial-comments/,entertainment,"Juan Pablo Galavis is solidifying his stance as the most-hated “Bachelor” star yet.

The Venezuelan-soccer-star-turned-reality-star came under fire again after he retweeted a post that mocked people with mental disabilities.

""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!""

Galavis replied to the profanity-filled post, writing ""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT...,"" according to E! News.

Fans immediately took to social media, criticizing the star for the post, and the tweet has since been deleted.

Juan Pablo caused a stir back in January when he told a reporter he didn’t think a gay or bisexual Bachelor would set a good example for kids because gays were more, “pervert, in a sense.”

The reality star attempted to rectify the situation by blaming the comments on a language barrier, saying that the word “pervert” in Spanish is not as offensive. He used the same excuse this time around, blaming his latest tweet on cultural differences.

“In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,” he wrote. “Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture”

He posted several other message stating that his English is not that great.

Galavis has been heavily criticized during his season on the ABC dating series, and two women have left the competition, proclaiming they didn’t want to date him. “The Bachelor” finale airs next Monday night on ABC.",

Well, now Reality Steve is sharing some more spoilers for The Bachelor 2014 and it looks like we could have a proposal on the After The Final Rose special next week??? Check out the details in our The Bachelor Juan Pablo 2014 spoilers below!

It may shock many of you, but it looks like Reality Steve is claiming that Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell, the winner of The Bachelor Season 18, are still together! Then explain these photos on Juan Pablo’s Twitter and Instagram accounts with other women. I would pissed if I was Nikki! Juan Pablo does not propose on The Bachelor 2014 finale, but Reality Steve says the couple is still together.



To spice it up, he says ABC is offering Juan Pablo some cash to pop the question during the live After the Final Rose special Monday night! Well, we all now Juan Pablo will do anything for money, so could it happen.

Let your opinion be heard with all the other The Bachelor Season 18 fans out there!

We all know that the frontrunner seems to be Andi Dorfman, I mean, Reality Steve even predicted she is going to be it! That doesn’t mean it is a done deal and some others couldn’t be The Bachelorette Season 10, like Cassandra, Clare, Kat, Chelsie or even Sharleen from The Bachelor Season 18. That does not mean that The Bachelorette 2014 has to be from this current season, but we all know ABC likes to share among the shows.

It all depends on what happens at The Bachelor 2014 finale and who Juan Pablo picks as the winner and maybe the runner-up will move into the role as The Bachelorette 2014? I would like to see ABC switch it up and bring someone new and fresh into the show, like maybe the recently single Paula Patton, but that one would never happen!

So, who would you like to see as The Bachelorette 2014? Tell us in the poll:

http://www.gossipcop.com/juan-pablo-retarded-tweet-r-word-twitter-joke-controversy/,entertainment,"“The Bachelor” premiered on March, 25, 2002 on ABC, with the premise of 25 women competing for the heart of one man. Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.

The contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.

The first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.”

The series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.

Though “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run. Rehn, Mesnick, Hebert, and Lowe have all had weddings specials air on ABC.",

‘The Bachelor’ Winner Spoilers: Juan Pablo Picks Nikki, But Do They Stay Together?

Ahead of “The Bachelor” season finale, spoilers about the winner have been coming out.

It’s down to Clare Crawley and Nikki, and pretty much everyone is saying that Nikki is the one who gets the final rose.

However, noted reality television blogger Reality Steve insists that Juan Pablo does not propose to Nikki, an anomaly for “The Bachelor” shows.

He also says that Pablo was offered money to propose to Nikki on the “After the Rose Ceremony,” which will air live.

“The Bachelor” season ended filming months ago.

He adds that he doesn’t know what happens at the live “After the Rose Ceremony.”

“I know they are still together and they will be together when you see them on the ATFR. Will he propose? Well, the monetary offer is on the table for him too. Should be interesting,” he said.

Renee, Chelsie, Kelly, and Sharleen will all be in attendance at the ceremony.

The blogger also says that Andi Dorfman will be announced as the next “Bachelorette” on the ATFR.

Several other media outlets, including TMZ and WSB have confirmed that part.",
http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/bachelorette-2014-spoilers-andi-dorfman-staged-fantasy-suite-break-up-juan-pablo-0306/,entertainment,"Everybody would be shocked if Andi Dorfman wasn’t revealed as the 2014 Bachelorette, Bachelor Nation appears to be pretty unanimous that she has been the lucky woman to carry on the Bachelor tradition in her own spin-off. You have to admit though, her break-up with Juan Pablo was really convenient. If she hadn’t ditched him after her Fantasy Suite date, then he may have chosen her for the Final Two, and then her chances of being the next Bachelorette would have been shot.

Andi Dorfman appeared to be smitten with Juan Pablo after her home-town date. Then, everything came to a screeching halt after she spent the night talking to Juan Pablo in the Fantasy Suite, and realized he was arrogant, cocky, and inconsiderate. It seems suspicious that Andi traveled around the world with Juan Pablo for weeks, and appeared completely clueless that he was any of those things until the Fantasy Suite date.

We all realized it by the second episode of The Bachelor, it’s doubtful Andi didn’t pick up on it until the Fantasy Suite date. Also, the morning after Andi’s Fantasy Suite date, Juan Pablo gushed about how well it went, completely clueless that Andi was upset. Juan Pablo brought up a good point in interviews after the Fantasy Suite date aired, as much as I hate to admit this. If Andi was so upset during the Suite date, why didn’t she mention it while the cameras were off and air her concerns while they were in the room privately? Why wait until the next morning to bombard him with the news on camera and stage a very public break-up?

Nobody disagrees with Andi Dorfman, Juan Pablo is all of the things she said he was when she dumped him. But, you have to admit it is pretty convenient that she was perfectly okay with Juan Pablo’s arrogance, harsh honesty, and language barrier issues, until she realized she had an opportunity to be the next Bachelorette and could find somebody better.

So Bachelor fans, do you think the Bachelor producers took Andi Dorfman aside and offered her the position as the next Bachelorette if she dumped Juan Pablo before the finale? (Not that we really blame her.) You have to admit it, her sudden change of heart about Juan Pablo was really conveniently timed, and came out of nowhere. Do you think Andi Dorfman would have stuck it out with Juan Pablo, if she wasn’t given the opportunity to be the 2014 Bachelorette?",

News, the ""Women Tell All"" special was pretty heavily edited and some of the juiciest drama was left out. During the special, which aired on Mar. 3, fans saw the ladies of ""The Bachelor"" rip into Juan Pablo but viewers got a much tamer version.

During the show, several of the ladies called out Juan Pablo for not spending enough time with everyone and really getting to know them. A couple felt like he didn't take the show that seriously. He was also called out for his comments about not wanting a gay Bachelor.

E! News was at the taping and dished on which parts was (for whatever reason) cut from the show. The most edited part of the ""Women Tell All"" was JP's conversation with Kelly about why a gay Bachelor wouldn't be a good idea. Kelly was really upset over the comments because she has two fathers.

""It was way more heated than what was televised, with Kelly and Juan Pablo fighting over what he said,"" E! wrote.

Host Chris Harrison had to jump in, telling Kelly that she would be able to talk to JP more about it after the taping. The sit-down with the Bachelor himself was said to be heavily edited and was a lot more heated than what was aired. Some of the ladies told him he was ""narcissistic"" and ""not genuine.""

Juan Pablo reportedly didn't know the ladies were bashing him before he came out because he did not get to see them talking to Chris Harrison but after the taping ended there was no animosity between the ladies and JP. According to E! he hugged and kissed each lady on the cheek after the cameras were off.

Last but not least is Sharleen. E!'s scoop on the opera singer is a little odd but reportedly she was ""a bit more frazzled during filming"" and Harrison had to tell her several times to calm down. She also freaked out a little bit when the AC kicked in at the studio.

The finale of ""The Bachelor"" airs on ABC Monday at 8 p.m.",

Juan Pablo Dating Mystery Woman?

Galavis aired out all of his feelings and slammed many of the women on his People magazine blog Tuesday. He first reprimanded the contestants for not putting themselves in his shoes and considering how difficult it is to have to speak to and try to get to know so many women in such a short amount of time.

""It's very easy to speak when you only have to focus on one guy, but it's much harder when the guy has to get to know 27 women. It isn't easy to remember all of the conversations or the questions that I ask, but I always tried my best and I wish the women recognized that,"" he wrote.

'Bachelor' Contestants Jealous of Clare?

He then revealed that he could tell many of the women he eliminated were ""nervous"" when they had conversations with him and knew it would be too hard for them to ""open up"" in that type of environment.

""The women I had a better connection and attraction with are the ones that I felt fit more into what I was looking for,"" he said.

He specifically called out Victoria for jumping into a conversation during the special and said she has other things to be concerned about.

""Ay, Victoria! During my talk with Kelly, Victoria really surprised me. Why did Victoria jump in the conversation? I believe she should have worried more about being sober on the show so she could get to know me rather than say something negative about me when she was there for only four days. Does she know me? Does she know when and where I learned English?""

He went on to say that of all of the women on the Women Tell All special, Sharleen and Renee are the ones who know him best. He added that Andi's decision to leave the show after their not-so-romantic evening in St. Lucia did him a favor.

Be sure to see who receives the final rose on the 18th season finale of The Bachelor Monday, March 10 at 8/7c on ABC. Take a look at what Sharleen said about Juan Pablo in the video below.

The little ditty, titled 'Ess Okay' (imitating the Bachelor's accent on one of his favorite expressions, ""it's okay"") pays tribute to all of the ladies Galavis has sent home this season, while also giving him a hard time.

Aragon shows a lot of skin in the clip and calls out Galavis for giving her the axe.

""Sent my a-- home cause I was always in the nude,"" she sings while playing the ukelele. ""You ain't ready for this jelly, cause you're kind of a prude.""

She then goes on to make fun of the reality star for his dancing and drinking skills (or lack thereof) and also makes reference to his anti-gay comments.

Ultimately, the song is just for fun, as Aragon repeatedly sings in the clip.

""The words in this clip are not meant to sound bitter,"" she croons at the end. ""But they're funny as s---, I think I'll post it on Twitter.""

But hey, no judgment here, girl! Oteri formerly said she hoped she and Juan Pablo had a future together, saying, ""I do want to fall in love. I do want to get married. I do want to have kids, more kids. And that's my ultimate goal. Obviously, I'm hoping that this does work out for me.""

Juan Pablo’s run on the ABC dating show will come to an end on March 10 with not one hour, not two hours, but a three-hour-long final episode.

Last time viewers of “The Bachelor” left off, Juan Pablo faced his ex-girlfriends in “The Women Tell All” episode. While Renee and Sharleen had nothing but nice things to say about the 32-year-old single dad, some of the other girls had less than stellar reviews of the Season 18 bachelor. Needless to say, one of said girls was Andi, the assistant attorney journal who broke up with Juan Pablo after their “nightmare” fantasy suite.

With the praise and criticism aside from all the ladies, there are currently two women that “Bachelor” fans need to be focusing on – Clare and Nikki. Clare, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo., are the final two women fighting for Juan Pablo. And while both of them are in love with him, Juan Pablo can only give his heart to one of them.

According to a leaked synopsis, viewers can look forward to watching the season finale episode alongside a studio audience and special guests: Chelsie, Kat, Kelly, Renee and Sharleen from Season 18 of “The Bachelor,” and recent “Bachelor/Bachelorette” success stories Sean and Catherine Lowe, and Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried.

The season finale episode, which is set in St. Lucia, will reportedly come to a “shocking conclusion” as the single dad “prepares to make one of the most difficult choices of his life.” As previously mentioned, both Nikki and Clare are head over heels for Juan Pablo, but “Andi’s allegations and her early departure” could potentially put their relationships with Juan Pablo at risk.

Will the women still believe they have a connection and future with the bachelor? Does the bachelor even have strong enough feelings for either woman to hand out his final rose? And if he has found love – will he propose?

Watch the season finale of ""The Bachelor"" when it airs on ABC on March 10 at 8 p.m. Do you think Juan Pablo will propose? Take the poll below or send a tweet to @AmandaTVScoop.",

Bachelor contestant Renee Oteri found her happily ever after being booted by Juan Pablo Galavis on season 18 of ABC's hit reality series. The single mom shared an Instagram photo with her fiance (and her engagement ring!) on Monday, Mar. 3.

PHOTOS: Meet Juan Pablo's bachelorettes!

""My forever,"" Oteri, 32, wrote beside the picture of the smiling newly-engaged couple. In it, her handsome fiance (who's been identified by Wetpaint as an ex-military man named Bracy) drapes his arm over her shoulder, as she holds his hand and shows off her diamond ring.

Sources confirmed to Us Weekly last week that Oteri ""couldn't be happier"" after getting engaged. ""She is so happy and has wanted this with her fiance for a very long time!"" an insider told Us. ""We're all so happy to see them back together!""

PHOTOS: The Bachelor -- where are they now?

""He is always the one everyone wanted to see her with!"" the source added.

The beautiful brunette, who was the fourth runner-up in the current season of The Bachelor, made her mark on the show as a single mom — to 8-year-old son Ben — opposite single dad Juan Pablo. ""Her fiance has known Ben since he was a baby,"" another source told Us. ""Renee is so excited to start over with her new family in Seattle.""

PHOTOS: Biggest Bachelor moments -- breakups, bling, and more!

During a conference call with reporters on Feb. 15, Oteri opened up about her life with Ben. ""We definitely talk about everything, and I want my son to see love,"" she shared.

Although she's moved on since wrapping up filming for the show back in October, Oteri revealed that unlike other contestants, she has ""nothing negative to say"" about Galavis. ""I still feel the same about him now than I did the moment, you know, I met him.""",

http://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2014/the-bachelor-18-winner-nikki-ferrell-spoilers-juan-pablo-0306/,entertainment,"The Season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo has left a sour taste in a lot of people’s mouths, including the bachelorettes that he sent home this season. In the Women Tell All episode Juan Pablo’s ex-bachelorettes ganged up on him and slammed him for multiple things. Two women weren’t present at the Women Tell All episode though, Juan Pablo’s Final Two Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell. Once the season finale of The Bachelor airs next week on ABC, they will be able to share their thoughts and opinions on Juan Pablo, and that is when the real fireworks will start. SPOILER ALERT!!

It’s unanimous, America (and Reality Steve) are certain Nikki Ferrell will be chosen as the winner of the Season 18 of The Bachelor. The real question is, what happened to the happy couple after the cameras stopped rolling? Were they ever a couple? Nikki and Juan Pablo were never engaged, and were already broken up before The Bachelor began airing on ABC. Since The Bachelor premiered Juan Pablo has been linked to several different women, and none of them have been Nikki. If anyone deserves a Tell All episode, it’s Nikki Ferrell. And, once can only imagine the horrible things the scorned ex-Bachelorette will have to say about Juan Pablo once the finale is aired and her contract is up with ABC.

Friends of Nikki Ferrell have already confirmed that Nikki has some compromising nude photos in her possession of Juan Pablo, it is only a matter of time before she leaks them out of spite. But, Nikki is a smart girl, considering all of the negative press Juan Pablo has received, she should hold on to the pictures and publish them in an exclusive tell all book, exposing Juan Pablo for the arrogant and ignorant sham of a Bachelor he was this season. Would you pay money for a Nikki Tells All book about the real Juan Pablo?",

The mother-of-one is engaged to fiancé Bracy Maynard, and according to our sources, the duo has known each other since they were preteens!

Oteri shared a photo this week via her Instagram account embracing her gorgeous new man while flaunting a massive engagement ring. She captioned the photo, ""My Forever.""

But what does Juan Pablo think of Renee finding love so soon after a heartbreak? ""At the end of it all, I’m very happy that Renee found someone and want to send her my congratulations,"" the Bachelor hunk wrote his latest People blog on Tuesday. ""I hope to be invited to the wedding some day.""

http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/542111/20140306/bachelor-juan-pablo-galavis-broke-nikki-ferrell.htm,entertainment,"Juan Pablo Galavis came on “The Bachelor” to find love, and after a long journey that involved his heart being broken, the single dad is all set to choose between Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley.

The current season of the dating reality show will come to a close on Monday, and rumors indicate that Galavis will pick Ferrell as his final choice.

But, she might not be too happy once she gets to know Galavis' reality, as luxury accommodations and extravagant foreign trips aren’t part of his life, a source told Life & Style magazine.

The 32-year-old is reportedly broke and lives with his parents in Miami.

“Most of the money Juan Pablo got from soccer is probably long gone. Money must be tight, because he lives in a three-bedroom apartment with his mom and dad,” the source said, adding that he came on the show to make some money.

“The reason he was so interested in being the Bachelor was to make money and become more famous. He’s always actively looking for money and work.”

Shedding light on Galavis' career, the source said that currently he works as a sports consultant for the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame. He has active work only during baseball season, and monetary situation becomes a bit tight once the season is over.

“During baseball season, he has to travel to different ballparks and try to get Venezuelan players to sign memorabilia he can bring back to the Hall of Fame,” the source said.

It is not immediately known if Ferrell and Crawley are aware of Galavis’ reality. But the source feels “the winner is about to be very surprised. She has no idea what she’s in for.”

If rumors are to be believed, this news is not going to faze Ferrell, whose relationship with Galavis is said to have fizzled out soon after the finale of the show was filmed. However, it is not known if he being broke was a contributing factor to the alleged split.

For a while now, Galavis has been accused of coming on the show to find a girlfriend, and not a wife as he claimed. Andi Dorfman, who walked out on Pablo after their overnight date, recently said that the single dad is filled with negativity, and he came on the show for the wrong reasons.

“I think that he was definitely here to find somebody,” Andi said during Monday’s “Women Tell All” episode. “I think he had that genuine want, [but] I think his version of what he was trying to find was different from ours. In my opinion, I think he was trying to find a girlfriend and someone to date and someone to -- after this is all over -- figure out if it's going to work. And I think we all kind of came here to find a husband.""",

Hot off of Juan Pablo's incendiary talk about the possibility of a gay Bachelor, Chris weighed in on the show's future stars, and what he had to say was the opposite of enlightened. Actually, he went a step FURTHER than our boy Juan Pablo in terms of awfulness. A thing I did not think was actually possible.

In a recent interview, Chris ""Suave"" Harrison was asked if The Bachelor would ever consider someone less hunky than their usual stars. You know, someone with a little bit more to love. Chris shot down the prospect of a chubby Bachelor like it was possum in his attic and he was a gun-toting man with a virulent fear of possums, a fear that surmounted reason or the safety concerns regarding shooting a possum in your attic.

In January, Juan Pablo Galavis stated a gay Bachelor wouldn't set a ""good example for kids""… because why? He said, ""they're more pervert in a sense."" Juan went on to blame his poor choice of words on his sketchy English. Earlier this week, Chris Harrison added that a gay Bachelor probably would not be a good business decision for ABC.

Also? Chubby guys need not apply to be the Bachelor.

When questioned by New York Times magazine about the possibility of a gay lead, Chris said he's ""100% for equality and gay marriage"" on a ""philosophical level"" but posed the question, ""Is it a good business decision?""

""I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell,"" continued Chris. ""Is our job to break barriers or is it a business? That's not for me to answer.""

Who's Abandoning Her Career To Be The Next Bachelorette?

Then, Chris was asked if we'll ever see a ""less hunky bachelor, maybe like a chubby guy,"" and he said no.

""You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive,"" shared Chris. ""Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites.""

http://www.inquisitr.com/1158488/the-bachelor-host-chris-harrison-gay-bachelor-probably-not-good-for-business/,entertainment,"Should the next bachelor on The Bachelor be gay?

Chris Harrison, the host of the ABC reality series The Bachelor since 2002, seems to have some reservations about featuring a gay bachelor on a subsequent season.

In an interview in which he was asked about the current bachelor’s controversial comments, Harrison stressed that he is a 100 percent marriage equality supporter, but that business is business what comes to ratings-driven television content:

The question is: Is it a good business decision? I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you’ve been making pizzas for 12 years and you’ve made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, ‘Hey, you should make hamburgers.’ Why? I have a great business model, and I don’t know if hamburgers are going to sell… Is our job to break barriers, or is it a business? That’s not for me to answer.”

As alluded to above, you may recall that this season’s bachelor, Juan Pablo Galavis, got into hot water when he claimed in an interview that a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show would be “too perverted.”

He subsequently apologized to anyone he may have offended, suggesting that his comments were taken out of context. He also noted that English is his second language, “and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself. What I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept. The show is very racy as it is and I don’t let my 5 year old daughter watch it. Once again, I’m sorry for how my words were taken. I would never disrespect anyone.”

In a slight digression, Harrison — who also has hosted The Bachelorette since 2003 — revealed that unlike the norm for reality television, this season’s Bachelor installment involved minimal boozing. Juan Pablo is a teetotaler (or at least didn’t drink during the entire filming) and successfully encouraged the women to avoid drinking as well, explained Harrison.

The Bachelor 2014 season finale will air on March 10 during which Juan Pablo will supposedly decide between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell.

Are you a fan of Chris Harrison and The Bachelor? Apart from other considerations such as inclusiveness, do you think a gay Bachelor would be good for ratings?

Chris Harrison, host of The Bachelor on ABC, is speaking out on why most of the bachelors are, well, all the same: straight and hot.

When asked why there has never been a gay bachelor, Harrison didn't pull a Juan Pablo Galavis and deliver a homophobic remark veiled under an ""But English is my second language!"" excuse. Instead, Harrison was blunt: It's all about the business!

""The question is: Is it a good business decision?"" told The New York Times Magazine. ""I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell.""

But beefcakes do. And that's also why Harrison, though iffy on a homosexual bachelor series, is firmly against a chubby, overweight or obese bachelor.

""No. You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say,"" he said. But don't think Harrison thinks he's above it, either. He agrees he'd never be a Bachelor himself!

""I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive,"" Harrison said. ""Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites.""

But he probably likes eating pizza, and he doesn't seem like a complete douchebag, which would be an improvement on the prior Bachelors: Remeber Jake Pavelka, who was super mean to Vienna Girardi when the cameras were off? Or how Galavis boasted to Andi Dorfman about the other women he'd spent the night with already? Or the creepy way Sean Lowe talks about his new sex life with Catherine Guidici?

Maybe a less self-absorbed, vain dude would treat his women better. When it's a choice between respect, devotion and adoration and a few extra pounds, I'll take a little paunch any day. If a man who loves pizza and hamburgers treats you better than a guy with highlights, a fake tan and abs of steel who gorges on grilled chicken and stares at his reflection more than your eyes, go with your gut ... for the guy with a gut.

http://www.gossipcop.com/chris-harrison-gay-bachelor-fat-chubby/,entertainment,"“The Bachelor” premiered on March, 25, 2002 on ABC, with the premise of 25 women competing for the heart of one man. Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.

The contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.

The first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.”

The series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.

Though “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run. Rehn, Mesnick, Hebert, and Lowe have all had weddings specials air on ABC.",

Photo credit: Daniel Tanner/WENN.com .

Chris Harrison has seen a lot of Bachelors come and go because of his job as the host of ABC’s hit series The Bachelor.

The question on everyone’s mind at the moment is whether or not there could be the possibility of a homosexual Bachelor on the show in the near future.

The current leading man, Juan Pablo Galavis, has already caused an uproar on that topic after he said homosexuals are “more ‘pervert’ in a sense. And to me the show would be too strong… too hard to watch.”

Although the Venezuelan star has since backtracked and explained that his comments were the result of a language barrier, the same pressing question is not going away any time soon, and this time, Harrison is in the firing line.

However, the 42-year-old TV host was far more diplomatic in his answer, and during his interview with The New York Times Magazine, he confessed he was hesitant about whether there should be a gay Bachelor.

Harrison told the publication, “The question is: Is it a good business decision?”

“I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this — Look, if you’ve been making pizzas for 12 years and you’ve made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, ‘Hey, you should make hamburgers.’ Why? I have a great business model and I don’t know if hamburgers are going to sell.”

And although the dating show host may be on the fence about having a gay star on The Bachelor, he definitely is against having a chubby one. When asked if the show would consider a heavier star, Harrison said, “No. You know why? Because that’s not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I’m old and unattractive.”

“Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don’t have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don’t do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don’t eat 50,000 egg whites.”

And when asked if Harrison himself would ever like to be a star on The Bachelor, he replied, “Now that I’m divorced, it’s feasible.”

“But there needs to be a level of innocence and naïveté when you come in to be the Bachelor, and I have none. I have seen how the sausage has been made for 12 years now, and I helped make that sausage and so it just wouldn’t work.”",

""Bachelor"" host Chris Harrison is speaking out about the future of the franchise and caused quite a stir when he revealed that there would likely never be a ""chubby"" Bachelor or Bachelorette featured on the series. Harrison has seen it all during his time as host of the reality competition, and this season is definitely no different.

""No,"" Harrison responded to a question posed by the New York Times Magazine about having a ""less hunky, like maybe a chubby guy"" for a Bachelor.

""You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive. Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites,"" Harrison explained.

When asked about having a gay Bachelor on the show, Harrison was a little hesitant and said it would depend on whether it would be good for business.

""I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell,"" Harrison said.

Of course, much has been made about the possibility of having a gay Bachelor after the current Bachelor, Juan Pablo, made a controversial remark and said that a gay Bachelor would not be a ""good example"" because gay people are ""more pervert."" He later backtracked and said that it was a mistake in translation and that he had no problem with gay people.",

Former contestant Lucy Aragon posted an original song on YouTube on March 3 during Monday's episode. ""Ess Okay,"" performed naked and with a ukelele, represents everything bizarre about this particular season of ""The Bachelor.""

Aragon was denied a rose in Juan Pablo's quest for love, and this song -- though written for fun, she says -- bashes good ol' JP for being a total ""meano."" Fair-weather ""Bachelor"" fans will remember Aragon as the ""free spirit"" who refused to wear shoes on the first night and then ran around naked a lot. More power to you, girl.

She debuted the video on Instagram with the caption, ""The moment has finally arrived! I give you...the Bachelor Reject Anthem. Original music and lyrics by the only and only #freespirit ME. I just want to show the world that you can make fun of somebody and still be funny rather than mean. #bachelorejects #bachelor #juanpablo #abc #bachelornation""

""It's definitely changed,"" said Cannon, a vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz here. ""I'm hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It's just, 'Sally, the engineer.'""

As startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female-focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what traditionally has been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.

The shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.

Started in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year's main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named ""breakout app"" in 2011.

This year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Ore.-based Palo Alto Software, was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry's culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as ""brogrammers.""

""Part of that is the 'bro-gramming' and too-cool-for-school attitude that goes on,"" she said in an interview before her meeting. ""What women have to push really hard about is you don't have to be successful in a man's world - it's just the world.""

Parsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference's panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.

Hugh Forrest, the symposium's director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.

""If I had a dime for everybody who said that's a great rule but there just aren't enough qualified women I'd be rich, rich, rich,"" he said. ""My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It's impossible for me to believe that you can't find a female speaker in the world who isn't extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.""

Among the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women's issues this year was a March 7 talk ""Starting Up in a Man's World"" that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.",

http://www.denverpost.com/music/ci_25315679/colorado-makes-an-eco-devo-investment-music-industry,entertainment,"Among the thousands of bands, bloggers, CEOs, celebrities and consumer brands heading to Austin, Texas, this week for the annual South By Southwest Music Festival will be a couple of state government employees looking to drum up interest in Colorado’s music industry.

One visit won’t turn Denver into the next Nashville, but Colorado Creative Industries’ chief Margaret Hunt and her colleague Christy Costello do hope to pitch the potential of the state’s already bustling music industry to musicians, record labels and recording studios, and, perhaps, attract another major national festival.

They have success stories to tell — nationally known acts including The Lumineers, One Republic and The Fray hail from Colorado — and can tout major performance destinations, including Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival.

“Colorado Creative Industries‘ goal is to meet with industry leaders and explore what’s happening in music and the future of the music industry to help position Colorado in the forefront,” said Hunt, whose office is a division of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.

Although her office spent $10,000 on the business-development venture, Hunt said Colorado’s official foray into the SXSW marketing fray doesn’t have specific goals attached.

Hunt hopes to make impressions and identify industry trends. She’ll meet with the Future of Music Coalition — individuals involved in music production, distribution and sales, television and radio, music directors, composers and more.

“I thought this would be a good opportunity to put our toe in the water,” Hunt said.

CCI also is co-sponsor, with the Colorado Tourism Office, of the 30-band Colorado Music Party on Thursday and Friday. The unofficial showcase, also sponsored by OpenAir, Reverb and SpokesBuzz, will feature such local bands as You Me & Apollo, Rose Quartz, Gungor and Wheelchair Sports Camp.

While CCI supports a wide spectrum of creative industries — fine arts, dance, writing, publishing and more — Hunt sees music as a key area to develop.

“You look at music festivals and events, the number of venues, the number of recording artists — and Colorado is up there with the cities known for music, like Seattle and Austin,” Hunt said.

SXSW, which runs through Sunday, is considered the premier music industry showcase and festival in the country. The event draws more than 25,000 official participants, including bands and industry professionals.

“We’re approaching this as an industry team to market and brand Colorado,” Hunt said.

CCI, which has an annual budget of $2.7 million, provides grants to arts and cultural organizations and public art programs, funds the Creative District Program, and supports artists and creative entrepreneurs through the Denver Music Summit, youth arts education, and public school programs.

Major players in Colorado’s music industry see the SXSW investment as an important gesture of support.

“It sends the message that the state is more and more committed to helping this place become even more of a mecca for music,” AEG Live Rocky Mountains CEO Chuck Morris said. “The more people that want to move here, the more studios that open up, the more interest from musicians and songwriters is a great thing for our state, our economy and music community.”

You Me & Apollo vocalist Brent Cowles said state backing of the Colorado Music Party means a lot to him and his indie-rock band.

“There’s a lot of music coming out of Colorado that’s getting attention,” he said, “and this means (the state is) going to invest in it and believe in it.”

Kendall Smith, from The Denver Post’s Underground Music Showcase, and Dani Grant, who runs the Fort Collins band incubator SpokesBuzz, approached Hunt to get the state involved in music efforts at SXSW.

“They recognized that Colorado Creative Industries and the state had a role to play in advancing the music industry,” Hunt said.

As the Colorado contingent hits Austin this week, it will be among the likes of Doritos, Converse, Spotify, iTunes and countless other brands trying to be heard in the marketing scrum — a challenge for any brand pushing its product at SXSW.

“There’s no question that SXSW is loud,” said Elaine Garza, an Austin-based marketing and PR expert who has worked with brands at SXSW for 15 years.

“There’s so much going on and there’s always the question: Is it worth the investment to come?”

Garza said she knew of no other state being represented at SXSW, and since Colorado isn’t pitching a consumer brand, like an energy drink or jeans, the message might resonate with fans and industry pros.

“It kind of makes a bigger statement that Colorado is investing in the music scene and spending money to promote that,” she said.

""You're competing with thousands of other bands"": John Patterson of the Grates. Credit:Edwina Pickles This year's record attendance by local artists owes to a surge in up-and-coming dance and electro acts, following the breakout success of Flume, Flight Facilities and Gold Fields at previous SXSWs. Of the 55 Australian artists, 21 are dance and/or electro acts. Australia's electro scene has boomed so much that last year's flagship, the Aussie BBQ, expands this year to include a night dedicated to the dancefloor. ""Beat Pie"" caters to the demand for Australian electro, dance and hip-hop acts.

For relatively new Brisbane indie electro producer Danny Harley, who plays under the moniker the Kite String Tangle, SXSW will be his first gig overseas. He says the chance owes to the breakthrough success of his electro hit Given the Chance. The track has amassed almost 900,000 Soundcloud plays since its release in August and charted at No. 19 in Triple J's Hottest 100 – a solid achievement given Harley is yet to release an EP or album. “The success of my current track is largely due to international blogs,” Harley said, adding that “the online buzz was really valuable for spreading the word about my song. But it will be interesting to see if any of that word has actually made it [to SXSW]”. More than 1700 acts will play at SXSW, but thousands more promoters, managers and labels will lurk behind the scenes, looking out for the next big thing. “For the most part the acts with the most buzz heading in to the conference are the ones that are most likely to come away from it with success,” Ms Millgate said, pointing to the importance of social media and blogs in building a successful SXSW campaign. It wasn't always like this.

Brisbane indie rocker John Patterson, guitarist for the Grates, described their first trip to SXSW at the start of their career in 2005 as “a bit of a gamble”. At the time, the three-piece had just signed on to their record label in Australia following a handful of homemade EPs and grassroots shows, and going overseas was a financial risk. “SXSW is such a huge event,"" Patterson says. ""There are so many opportunities for things to get seen and things to get missed . . . you're competing with thousands of other bands."" But their wager paid off, and through their first SXSW appearance the group landed a US record deal. They have since returned twice, in 2006 and 2009, to promote new material. The sentiment is shared by fellow Brisbane indie four-piece the Jungle Giants, who are making their SXSW debut.

While they have gained renown at home after touring with the Big Day Out, Splendour in the Grass and the Falls Festival, they're cutting their teeth overseas. “It's only now become financially feasible to head over to America, so it's all culminated to this point,"" frontman Sam Hales said. As an unsigned band he hopes the Jungle Giants will meet international labels and garner the release of their debut album, Learn to Exist, overseas, as well as an American tour. Even established Australian bands are jumping on the opportunities of SXSW. ARIA chart toppers Boy and Bear will head to the conference for their second time, and as drummer Tim Hart said, it's almost like starting again with their new album Harlequin Dream.

“It's a really interesting thing over there,"" Hart said. ""You're just another band because there are so many other artists. But this is where all the promoters, festival owners and everyone go to and they're looking for acts."" As a more experienced and mature band, Boy and Bear are ready to make the most out of the SXSW experience, Hart said, and look forward to the networking opportunities.",

Angel Olsen

The Missouri-born singer’s simple chords and powerful yet intimate vocals tell you it’s ok to be lonely. Who needs more than thoughtful songs combined with grunge guitar? Her latest album Burn Your Fire For No Witness is out now on Jagjaguwar.

Jamestown Revival

Jamestown Revival is essentially Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance, two guys from a little town called Magnolia, Texas who have been singing together since they were kids. They have a fresh take on classic twang and their harmonies are as tight as any Everly Brothers recording.

No

This L.A.-based rock band draws comparisons to The National thanks to the deep baritone of Bradley Hanan Carter and lyrics like “We make some noise inside a room and call it art” on their dramatic new single “Leave the Door Wide Open.”

The Preatures

Hailing from Sydney, Australia the band’s latest album Is This How You Feel? is out now on Harvest Records. Isabella Manfredi and Gideon Benson trade off vocal duties over a beat of rhythm-focused ’70s pop.

Jetta

As a backup singer Jetta has been on the road with Paloma Faith and Cee Lo Green. Now, we get to hear her commanding voice as she steps forward to perform her own songs. “Feels Like Coming Home” is the powerful single on her debut EP Start A Riot, out now on Universal Republic Records.

Cloud Nothings

The first single from their next album (due in April), “I’m Not Part of Me” strikes a balance between noisy pop punk and hummable hooks.

Nikki Lane

The country singer’s sophomore album (out May 6), produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, is an eagerly anticipated way for the sweet and sour singer to croon that it’s “always the right time to do the wrong thing.”

Future Islands

There’s been a lot of buzz for the combo of cool synth pop and Samuel T. Herring’s dramatic vocals. Along with a Coachella appearance and a number of sold out headlining dates, the band played The Late Show and will release its new album Singles on March 25.

The Autumn Defense

Since 1999, this has been a side-project for John Stirratt, the bass player in Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, as he collaborates with multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone on ’60s rock and pop. Their fifth LP, cleverly called Fifth, was released this past January on Yep Roc.

Speedy Ortiz

This Massachusetts band, led by Sadie Dupuis, brings ‘90s-style lo-fi guitar and Liz Phair-esque vocals in to the 21st century. The quartet is preparing for the release of a full-length album this year.

Just because we love the name: Potty Mouth

And a few Los Angeles-based acts we’d like to get to: Avi Buffalo, The Blank Tapes, Eleni Mandell, Kelela, Dum Dum Girls, Holly Conlan, Banks, and Fever the Ghost.",
http://www.coloradodaily.com/music-news/ci_25291539/dean-no-apologies-its-sxsw,entertainment,"I’m sorry. It’s that time of year. I’m going to write about South by Southwest.

This will be my third year attending and covering the festival, and I apologize because I’ve grown a sense of guilt about it. Mocking SXSW is about as common and easy as mocking Coachella or Miley Cyrus. The other thing those three have in common, though, is that they’re actually fun if you can manage to not be an eye-rolling, better-than-thou contrarian.

Look, I’m not clueless and neither are most people who go to Austin in March. The festival isn’t what it used to be, it’s too corporate, it’s over-hyped, it’s not the real Austin, etc. They’re valid issues, but there are valid reasons not to do a lot of fun things. If you have the press pass and/or the financial means, why not? And if you don’t, why not pay attention, even peripherally?

SXSW’s music festival is still a great place to find bands. Last year, I caught shows from the Whiskey Shivers and Ringo Deathstarr. In the year since, I brought them both into Second Story Garage. Oddly enough, the first time I ever saw some Colorado bands was at SXSW two years ago. Just following the coverage might give you a handful of new bands to check out.

Austin is weird, as any souvenir T-shirt will tell you, and SXSW acts as an amplifier. The weirdness isn’t even coming from locals half the time, for the month of March. Maybe you have to be of a certain age or disposition to enjoy wading through a litter-strewn and crowded Sixth Street, enjoying dancing sousaphone players or dancing skeleton marionettes. That’s cool. Enjoy it emanating from your computer screen instead.

This sounds like a pitch, and I guess in a way it is, but mostly it’s an argument in favor of chilling out and enjoying something. Maybe SXSW has a confused purpose or significance, but so what? Enjoy the party.

I’ll be back at it this year, and by “it” I mean following local bands, discovering new ones, subsisting on beer, eating a lot of pulled pork and not sleeping.

Here’s the actual pitch: It’s all going on SecondStoryGarage.com, as well as ColoradoDaily.com. Last year’s highlights included Big Freedia twerking, The Yawpers’ Nate Cook getting a little dark and profane on camera, and me drunkenly talking about pizza. Much like SXSW, it’s a messy grab bag of stuff.

Hope you like it, and as always, happy South By.

Yet as the music portion of SXSW kicks into gear on Tuesday there’s not nearly the official Toronto presence one might expect on the streets of Austin.

Oh, there are Toronto acts everywhere at this year, as there always are: F---ed Up, the Darcys, Trust, Timber Timbre, Greys, Lowell, Saidah Baba Talibah among them.

What Rob Ford, and Toronto, could learn from Austin's music industry

But the sole event actually bearing the City of Toronto stamp is a late-afternoon showcase titled “Toronto Turns Up,” featuring More Or Les, Ariana Gillis, July Talk and the Arkells (who are from Hamilton), at the Canadian Independent Music Association’s “Canada House” headquarters at Friends on 6th St. on Saturday.

That’s it.

Despite the establishment last month of a 30-member music advisory committee intended to guide Toronto in its efforts to embrace and exploit its thriving music scene in a manner modelled on that of the “Live Music Capital of the World,” only one city staff member, film commissioner Randy McLean (subbing in until Toronto’s plans to establish a music office with an actual music commissioner akin to Austin’s bear fruition) is in Texas in an official capacity for this year’s festival.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Several members of that committee are here, yes, but they came on their own (or their company’s) dime, and some of them are wondering if Toronto might not be missing the boat on the whole alliance thing.

Even Thursday night’s big “beat battle” at Avenue on Congress between Toronto’s Beat Academy hip-hop crew, led by sometime Drake producer Boi1da and featuring the rising likes of Wondagurl and Rich Kidd, and Texas’s Space City Beats mob happened of its own volition.

It was, the Beat Academy’s Toni Morgan says, a “happy coincidence” that they’d been planning a “Toronto vs. Texas” SXSW event when the Toronto/Austin alliance came into being.

As Jeff Cohen, co-owner of the Horseshoe Tavern and one of the founders of Collective Concerts, observes, Toronto sent two city councillors to SXSW last year and then followed that visit up by sending a delegation back for the Austin City Limits festival last fall that included a very enthusiastic Mayor Rob Ford.

“Five months have passed by since they signed the alliance, and there’s less going on at South by Southwest than there was when there was no alliance,” Cohen said Monday. “I think we’re missing an opportunity. The City of Toronto should have made a big splash at this year’s South by Southwest … It looks like my city dropped the ball. Both (cities) are just losing this great opportunity. Nothing’s been done.”

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Cohen isn’t being a totally negative Nelly. He concedes Toronto is “making headway” with its Austin alliance, “but it’s at a turtle pace.” And that’s much the same refrain one hears from his fellow industry compatriots down here for SXSW.

“I’m happy that the City of Toronto is moving ahead with stuff like the music advisory committee and clearly it’s on their radar screen as something that should be aided and abetted and supported,” says Mike Tanner, director of operations for Toronto’s North by Northeast festival.

“On the other hand, in my North by Northeast capacity, I know how big the city bureaucracy can be and, in the interests of getting things right and making sure that proper policies and procedures are followed it can take a long time to get stuff done ….

“I think it’s kinda down to the industry to do things in a tangible way that has an effect on the street, so that you see musicians or venues or fans or other people benefitting so it’s not just a piece of paper that was signed by two elected politicians, that it actually has a meaning and an impact that people can feel.

“I think a lot of times bureaucracies like to work from the top down, but with something like this I think it might be more effective to work from the foundation up, from the actual events and the actual people and the guys on the ground making stuff happen.”

To that end, Tanner and the NXNE crew will work on their own to strengthen their long-held ties with SXSW this year to make that connection “a lot more evident and obvious” in light of the new alliance.

“We’ve been in much closer contact with them, sharing some info and some best practices,” he says. “And there may be something that comes to fruition at our festival. I don’t know yet.”

Likewise, Amy Terrill of the industry lobby group Music Canada and Toronto’s recently minted “4479: Music Meets World” music-marketing campaign will be conducting business with movers and shakers in the Austin scene on “a more informal basis” during SXSW.

“From the industry level in Austin, there’s a lot of interest,” she says, “and I think the frustration is things move a little bit slowly. Certainly, in Toronto, it’s taken a little while to get the advisory committee set up. But there are necessary foundational pieces, and while we may wish the process went a little bit faster, the committee that Toronto has established is a fantastic committee and there’s gonna be a lot of great people on there and it’s gonna do a lot of great work.

“It’s just that some things take a little bit longer.

“I think the industry-led initiative is where the real magic is gonna happen. So I think that’s okay that that’s where we’re at right now as the city structures get established.”

http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2014/03/10/sxsw-forward-austin-its-time-to-stop-playing-with-trains-and-grow-up/,entertainment,"Having attended major trade conventions like SIGGRAPH and NAB in the past, I'll say this about SXSW. It's one of the best conventions/festivals/trade shows to be found anywhere in the world. It's well organized, well run (well, except for the wifi) and it's mindblowingly diverse and forward-thinking. But it may have already outgrown its host city, Austin. We have the conventions space and the rentable venues and hotel space (barely, in the latter). What do not have are the roads to keep the festival from becoming a major irritant for the people who actually live and work in Austin.

When SXSW isn't in town, Austin's population is about 850,000. When SXSW is in town, that number swells to about 1,050,000. Those people bring a lot of money to town, so there's no question in the grand scheme things that SXSW's visitors are welcome.

The roads around the city aren't even built to handle its everyday population. When the city swells by about 25% for SXSW's fortnight, the city's infrastructure simply cannot handle the influx. Despite the fact that Austin's total footpring -- about 272 square miles -- dwarfs Manhattan's 23 square miles, there just isn't room on the roads to deal with such a sudden population surge. And city decisions are making things worse, not better.

Today was a good case in point. I-35 is the main artery running through Austin north to south. It doesn't just serve Austin, it leads north to Waco and eventually to Dallas and beyond. South, it hits San Antonio and other arteries that lead to points south including the Texas-Mexico border in Hidalgo County. It's a major trade artery for the state and nation, 24/7/365. But because it only gets to eight lanes maximum as it goes through Austin, and four of those lanes are in the dark, dangerous Death Star trench on the bottom deck, 35 is far too easy to disrupt. Today a pair of what appeared to be minor fender benders shut the whole thing down southbound, backing up traffic and trade for miles.

Now, I-35 is federal/state and Austin isn't solely to blame for its thinness. But Austin is to blame for leaving drivers up on 35 with nowhere to go. The city has already been shutting down some of its interior road lanes for bus and bike traffic. Those shutdowns have in turn closed off some parking lots. And with SXSW in town, the city shut down even more interior roads to create a street festival atmosphere. The gridlock on 35 soon became gridlock downtown. There was nowhere to go, nowhere to park. SXSW on-foot attendees probably had little idea that the town around them had gone sclerotic, but for locals who already tend to resent the traffic increase, gridlock became misery.

I-35 clearly needs to be dealt with, but so does Austin's habit of going left and fooling around with old ideas. Mayor Lee Leffingwell's big idea is to keep adding bike paths and bus lanes plus ""Rail or Fail,"" essentially, expanding Austin's Metro rail system. Whether you build roads or rails taxpayer dollars will be used and public debt will be increased, but rail is a favorite, and very expensive, rolling obsession of folks of a leftist bent like Leffingwell. Once you build trains, unless they become efficient systems (which they hardly ever do -- see AMTRAC), they become a permanent public expense over and above the roads. Never mind that this is Texas, a sprawling state with sprawling cities where rail tends to be under-used, and never mind that nearly every time a city gets going on a rail project, they go way over budget and end up getting years behind schedule, just to build something that relatively few people use. And never mind that Austin's Metro has been both over budget and behind schedule and still doesn't offer much in the way of flexibility or speed. Or just getting you from Point A to Point B in the time that the rail system promises. Never mind that rail hasn't really worked in either Houston or Austin, at least not yet, both because of the culture here but also because the cities are just so physically spread. Austin's leaders see none of these problems, they just think they haven't told their dazzling story about trains (a 19th Century way of thinking, to be honest) articulately enough.

Never mind all that. Austin is already host to major events like SXSW, Austin City Limits and every Longhorn home football game. It's also now the host for F1 racing, though the Circuit of the Americas is located far enough outside downtown to produce less of an impact than events like SXSW. It's the capital of Texas, which is larger than most countries by itself. Austin needs to stop shutting down roads meant for cars in favor of turning them into bike paths or giving them over to bus use as a means of forcing residents and visitors onto public transportation. It should also stop kowtowing to the taxi industry via its misguided crackdown on Uber. If it wants to be a major destination and a big star on the map, then Austin really needs to grow up.",

Although the festival has already kicked off the film portion of the festivities, this week marks the beginning of its SXSW Music festival, which will showcase more than 2,000 independent acts in over 100 of Austin’s venues. Kicking off fully on March 11th, the music festival will draw performers from all over the world to Austin

D FrontRow will be in Austin to cover South by Southwest, and to keep you up on its best performances. Here are some of the acts we’re most anticipating:

Thankfully, hip-hop and rap are sporting healthy guests lists this year, as B.O.B, Childish Gambino, Nas, Mobb Deep, Big Sean, and more will be performing in the Austin bar scene for the week. I’m mostly curious to see Schoolboy Q in the aftermath of his first “Billboard 200 Albums” sweep. Fellow “Top Dawg Entertainment” label mates Kendrick Lamar, Isaiah Rashad, and Ab-Soul will also be performing under the hip-hop/rap bill, along with fellow R&B crooner SZA, whose inclusion in the festival strikes another point for the TDE camp. Additionally, Chicago’s growing presence on the SXSW circuit is one to be noted: KatieGotBandz, Lil Bibby, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Mouse will all take the stage to feature some of the best of Chicago’s rap scene.

Other favorites include the Queen of Bounce Big Freedia, whose return to Austin will mark one of many, fellow bounce pioneer Nicky Da B, New York’s A$AP Mob, Atlanta’s trap powerhouse Migos, and Trinidad James. Expect stellar performances from Dallas favorites as welll: Dorrough, Sam Lao, Blue the Misfit, The Outfit, TX and more will all bring a little of Triple D with them to the Austin metroplex.

Additionally, R&B’s biggest and brightest will be in Austin for the week, such as nu-soul/chillwave singer-songwriter 8th Grader, as well as Tinashe, Tweet, electro-R&B songstress Kelela, and singer/songwriter Solange.

Dance fans should take delight in the appearance of local dance-pop outfit Ishi and DJ-producer Ynfynyt Scroll, who will join the likes of drag superstar performer Sharon Needles, The Hood Internet, and Little Boots on the dance music circuit. Similarly, ASTR, Gobby, Giraffage, Keys N Krates, A Tribe Called Red, and Machinedrum will take the stage for the SXSW electronic showcase.

Pop music fans and general celebrity enthusiasts rejoice: Lady Gaga will be making her first SXSW appearance after all. The good news follows the city’s decisions to shut down the pop star’s appearance on the Doritos, 56-foot-tall vending machine-style stage, and which will instead place her at Stubb’s. London singer-songwriter Charli XCX, rising producer and solo act The GTW, Capital Cities, K-Pop princess HyunA, Kelis, Swedish singer-songwriter and frequent Diplo collaborator MØ, disco/New-Wave mashup band Pompeya, and indie pop favorites Tennis will all be making appearances in Austin venues.

The last thing anyone would say about South By Southwest is that it's an avenue for self-improvement. The annual mega gathering, which began last week for film and interactive-technology mavens and turns into a music conference and festival tomorrow, fulfills many needs for the culture nerd. Communal bonding? Yes – somewhere around 100,000 people will wander the Austin streets looking to high-five each other during this time. Fun? For sure. This is the entertainment industry's spring break, with much better music that what you'd hear at the Flora-Bama border, and mercifully fewer bros in board shorts. Excess? That's a given, whether your pleasure comes in a plastic cup, folded into a tortilla or pouring out of a nightclub's speakers. But soul edification? Inner peace? It's about as likely to hit you at SXSW as it is during a game of Temple Run.

Yet after twenty-plus years of on-and-off attendance, I've discovered that there is a key to discovering the Hidden Wisdom of South By Southwest. This kind of self-help goes beyond what any herbal remedy, extra phone battery or pair of sensible shoes offers. Those practical survival tools are givens. So is some modicum of misery, born of overabundance. That's the paradox of choice. But the too-muchness of SXSW can become a route to knowing yourself better, as a music lover, a listener, and a cultural explorer.

Here are some things you can do to make your South By Southwest experience not just a gauntlet to survive, but also a source of renewal. Making these choices can benefit anyone who comes to Austin, badge on lanyard – newcomers and veterans alike – and even those following along remotely, from the comfort of a Wi-Fi enabled home. It turns out that what makes South By Southwest more than bearable is exactly what makes loving music so important. To quote my favorite actual self-help book, it's all about embracing the full catastrophe.",

The concert to take place on the cross over night between South by Southwest’s Interactive week and Music week, will be shared around the globe via the live streaming social media app, Hang w/ – it will take place at Austin’s historic at 1100 Warehouse on March 11, at 8pm. 50 Cent (who is also an investor in the company) said, “I’m going to bring my fans behind the scenes and give the opportunity to those who couldn’t make it a chance to experience a concert at South by Southwest.”

The Hang w/ app allows users to “hang with” each other via live video and simultaneous chat. Users follow other users who interest them, and the system sends a notification every time someone in a user’s “following” network goes live. Hang w/ will enlist hundreds of concert attendees to broadcast the 50 Cent concert live to their friends, colleagues, and social media connections creating a concert around the globe.

“This is going to be a pivotal event in Hang w/ history,” said Andrew Maltin, co-founder and CEO of Hang With, Inc. “Hang w/ has shown itself to be a powerful technology platform for musicians to engage their fans, and we are thrilled at the opportunity to showcase our platform in front of the who’s who of music and tech, courtesy of 50 Cent, who himself lives at the intersection of music and tech.”

The platform, which reached the 1,000,000 download milestone only nine months after launch, continues to release powerful key performance indicators. Recently, the platform released metrics that showed fans are substantially more likely to tune in to a celebrity’s Hang w/ broadcast than they are to engage in comparable metrics on leading social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Dave Swartz, co-founder and President of Hang With, Inc., said, “We are thrilled to be headlining South by Southwest Interactive crossover night with our partner 50 Cent and bridge the gap for artists and fans for a one of a kind experience all over the world.”

Did you know that KPCC's Austin bureau can fit into one bike bag and one backpack?

It's true. I arrived in Austin this weekend with just that — plus my bicycle — to cover South by Southwest for Take Two.

On Sunday, I headed over to the interactive show floor to check out the best new digital creations. What I discovered was a whole lot of gimmicks.

Take this life size ""Operation"" board, for example.

And then there were the folks who lined up to play the ""Price is Right.""

Fun and games at SXSW

I did, however, discover some pretty awesome wearable tech in a conference room at the Hilton. Interested in an Iron Man-like motorcycle helmet? Listen in to my Take Two segment for more.

Completely wrecked by jet lag and daylight saving, I made my way to Joe's Bakery with Armando Rayo Monday morning for the pride of Austin breakfast cuisine. Not everything is bigger in Texas. Case in point: instead of eating giant breakfast burritos like we do here in California, Austinites prefer small breakfast tacos.

Full of bacon, cheese, eggs, Mexican chorizo, salsa verde, jalapenos, beans and tons of other homemade goodness — this is what Texans love. When I brought up the idea of breakfast burritos to an owner at Joe's, she scoffed and said that people from California always ask for them. She didn't understand why.

I'll refrain from debating the merits of the breakfast burrito vs the breakfast taco here — because I'll be doing exactly that on Take Two Tuesday.

Much like ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Seth Meyers, your music critic is in Austin, Texas, this week for the SXSW music festival, a five-day adventure of bands, beers and more bands. Before heading out, I surveyed a baker's dozen of Portland bands to see why the trek's worth it and named a few local acts to watch out for among the thousands invading the city.

I've been in Austin a day and a half and already been to an ear-rattling house show, eaten a fried avocado taco and attempted to devour a full pound of brisket and ribs from Austin BBQ institution Franklin. (I failed; I'll try again when they're in town in August for Feast Portland.) Check in on Oregonlive.com/music and Twitter all week for photo galleries, behind-the-scenes moments and live updates on bands from Portland and beyond.

The fest kicks off properly on Tuesday, with the locals-only Portland Party on Wednesday afternoon -- look for my galleries and write-ups to follow. I'll also be moderating an SXSW panel on Thursday about modern music discovery with Bandcamp's Andrew Jervis and others. I'll be skipping the Lady Gaga Doritos concert, though.

Are you in Austin? Let me know. If not: what do you want to see covered this week? Band discoveries? Interviews? Portraits? Taco photos? I'll do my best to make it happen.

http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/10/geeky-women-breaking-up-bromance-culture-at-south-by-southwest-conference/,entertainment,"Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women’s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it’s different.

“It’s definitely changed,” said Cannon, an Austin, Texas- based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP. “I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It’s just, ‘Sally, the engineer.’”

As startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female- focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male- dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.

I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that

The shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.

Bro-gramming Culture

Started in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year’s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named “breakout app” in 2011.

This year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry’s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as “brogrammers.”

“Part of that is the ‘bro-gramming’ and too-cool-for- school attitude that goes on,” she said in an interview before her meeting. “What women have to push really hard about is you don’t have to be successful in a man’s world — it’s just the world.”

Look Harder

Parsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference’s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.

Hugh Forrest, the symposium’s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.

“If I had a dime for everybody who said that’s a great rule but there just aren’t enough qualified women I’d be rich, rich, rich,” he said. “My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It’s impossible for me to believe that you can’t find a female speaker in the world who isn’t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.”

Man’s World

Among the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women’s issues this year was a March 7 talk “Starting Up in a Man’s World” that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.

The lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere. Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.

Parsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.

The number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers

Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.

The Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.

C-Suite Women

Still, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book “Lean In” to inspire other females.

Carley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers — like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.

“The number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,” she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum. “They have the ideas, but they don’t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code.”

An app that translates text within photos, an online mental health service and a teched-out motorcycle helmet all claimed a spot among the nation’s hottest new technologies on Sunday, each earning top honors at the premier startup competition at the South by Southwest convention in Austin.

Narrowed down from 48 on Saturday, 18 entrepreneurs pitched their startups to a panel of judges during the final round of the SXSW Accelerator on Sunday, vying for the grand prize in six different areas of technology. The winners each received $4,000, an invitation to next year’s convention, and most importantly, a prestigious and historically lucrative title in the world of technology startups.

“It’s fantastic for us, and what’s most important is the exposure that comes with it,” Connor Dickie, whose Canadian company won in the competition’s innovative world category, said in an interview following the event. “It shows people what we’re doing and where biotech is heading.”

Dickie’s company, Synbiota, offers an online, crowdsourced platform where scientists can share information and streamline the research and development stages in the production of new foods, fuels and medicines. Some of the funding the company received Sunday will go toward a “hackathon” the company plans to host in Ontario bringing together Internet wizards and biotech scientists.

In the wearable technology category, Skully Helmets of San Francisco won for its motorcycle helmet that displays information like driving directions inside the visor and features a rear-view camera that allows riders to see directly behind them without turning their head.

Another San Francisco company, ThriveOn, came out on top in the health category for an app that provides an online, personalized program meant to improve mental health. And Israeli company Samba.me landed the grand prize in social technology for a video messaging app that captures video of recipients watching the original video and adds their “reaction” footage to the original.

Irish startup Trustev won in the big data category for online identity verification software intended to help merchants combat e-commerce fraud. And lastly, in the the entertainment and content contest, Rhode Island-based Waygo came out on top for its mobile app that lets users scroll over text in, say, Chinese or Japanese characters and see in real-time the translation in English.

“The $4,000 is just icing on the cake,” Ryan Rogowski, one of the founders of Waygo, said in an interview, noting that the company will likely use some of that capital to explore new marketing tactics and distribution channels. “Meeting these other teams and introducing ourselves to new potential investors, that’s the real benefit” he added.

SXSW Accelerator boasts an impressive lists of pasts participants, many of whom were first introduced to the world at South by Southwest. Siri, which was later acquired by Apple for its now-famous voice-to-text technology, Bump, which was later acquired by Google for its touch-to-share technology, and social media company Klout all passed through the SXSW Accelerator in Austin.

In fact, since the competition debuted six years ago, the 208 finalists have collectively raised more than $580 million in funding.

“Here, it’s all about developing relationships and making new ones,” Rogowski said.

http://www.worldmag.com/2014/03/has_sxsw_lost_its_culture_making_mojo,entertainment,"AUSTIN, Texas—When you land at the Austin airport, you see the T-shirts right away: “Keep Austin Weird.”

The truth is that Austin is a diverse city of more than a million people and the capitol of one of the reddest states in the country. There’s a fair amount of non-weirdness here. Even during the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival—going on now through March 17—it’s business as usual for much of Austin. In fact, if you’re not downtown, where more than 100,000 people will converge during the 11-day festival, Austin might even appear sleepy. The schools—including the University of Texas—are on spring break, and lots of residents try to get out of town during SXSW, or “South by,” as some call it.

Some people have started to question whether SXSW has lost a bit of its culture-making mojo. The festival is actually three events in one. It started as a music event. Movies came soon afterward. Now, the festival begins with a trade show, South by Southwest Interactive, which kicked off on Friday.

SXSW Interactive has been around since 1997, when it had such prescient sessions as “So You Want To Make A CD-ROM” and “The Internet Is Dead.” Becky Worley of Yahoo Tech has taken a look back at “The Ghosts of South-Bys Past” and found SXSW Interactive’s record pretty spotty when it comes to introducing game-changing innovations. But she noted some undeniable hits. “In 2007, Twitter put up TV monitors in the halls of South by Southwest Interactive, scrolling tweets from attendees,” she wrote. “The founders credit that move with catapulting the service to its current status of 241 million active users.” Siri and Airbnb, the on-line house-sharing service, both also got big boosts at Southwest by Southwest.

But those outsized hits have caused most people to forget the misses. Worley noted that in 2009 “some of the big hits in the interactive competition were TubeMogul, Popcuts, and Project Miso. What? You haven’t heard of them? Yeah, me neither.” In fairness, TubeMogul still exists, though in a different form than the one debuted at SXSW five years ago. Popcuts and Project Miso? Long gone.

All of which prompts Worley to say she “will bring a strong dose of skepticism to my consumption of hot trends here. Based on recent history, I expect some winners, some losers and a Texas-sized load of marketing bull to wade through before I crown a game-changing disruptive technology star.”",
http://www.jambase.com/Articles/120974/Hitting-The-Trunk-Road-SXSW-Music-Communal-Experiences,entertainment,"On Tuesday evening, the Interactive portion of the South by Southwest Music, Film and Interactive Festival, the annual business boondoggle that takes over downtown Austin, Texas each March, will slowly morph into its music portion. Unlike traditional festivals, which take place on fairgrounds over a small handful of stages, SXSW is defined by its sprawl. Over a thousand bands from all over the world come to Austin and from noon to 2:00 a.m. play hour-long sets at every available venue, bar and open lot. Epitomizing the idea of an event where there is something for everyone, it would seem statistically impossible for two festival-goers to have identical experiences.

Nonetheless, besides aching feet and sleep deprivation, there are some communal experiences:

At some point over the course of the week, you will have a small mental breakdown and pitch a notable hissy fit due to the exhaustion and physical strain of standing for hours on end. You just need to hope it will pass quickly and offend the least number of people.

You will sit down on the ground in an area that is not designed for sitting. You will be so happy to get off your feet that you will not care about social convention. Someone will appreciate your initiative and sit down next to you.

You will see bands play spaces smaller than you are used to seeing them play. The Hold Steady will play Cedar Street Courtyard and Red 7, Lady Gaga will play Stubb’s and Coldplay and Soundgarden will play ACL Live at the Moody Theater.

You will go see someone from a bygone era simply because you can. This year, Gary Numan, Blondie and Spandau Ballet will be putting their years of experience on display. (In fairness, Numan has continuously released albums since the ’80s and Blondie has a new album coming out this year).

You will gain a healthy respect for Lone Star beer. This will be unrelated to the little men Matthew McConaughey can make with the cans.

At least one band you’ve never heard of before will absolutely blow you away and revive your love and excitement of live music. At times, that band will be White Denim; at others it will be Brothers & Sisters or Built For The Sea.

Just because of their name, you will be tempted to see a band like Lindsay Lowend, Raw McCartney, Death By Unga Bunga or Ringo Deathstarr. Despite wondering why no one had the foresight to put Raw McCartney and Ringo Deathstarr on the same bill, you will not actually go see any of these bands.

You will eat a meal that has been prepared inside a truck and it will be one of the best things you have ever eaten.

Someone like Prince, Justin Timberlake or Kanye West will announce a show with little notice and surprisingly, you will have little interest in battling the crowds it will attract.

You may spend an entire week without being in the same room as a vegetable.

No matter how many bands you catch, there will be another two to three dozen you will regret not seeing.

David Schultz will be documenting his SXSW experience for a future Hitting The Trunk Road column. Follow along on Facebook for live updates from Austin. JamBase will present a pair of Les Claypool Duo de Twang “Pop-Up” sets on Thursday followed by our Official Showcase that night and a Day Party on Friday.

Steve Winter, special to wtop.com

AUSTIN, Texas — We all know that the International Consumer Electronic Show is a four-day, 96-hour non-stop party.

Sponsor bashes, media showcase events, nightclub soirees and all the enticements, libations and entrapments that only a city like Vegas can offer makes CES a dynamic round-the-clock attraction.

But South-by-Southwest – commonly referred to as SXSW – now that’s a party.

Day One was barely in the books at the Austin Convention Center Friday when the happy hours started sprouting like weeds.

It didn’t matter if you were in the Registrant’s Tent in the Marriott Parking lot, in the lobby of the Hilton Austin Downtown or in a meeting room that just hours earlier played host to an interactive session or a film seminar.

The carousing started early and continued well into the night. No question, the phrase “it’s 5 o’clock somewhere” took root right here in Austin.

Revelry aside, CES and SXSW mean business, and while there are dozens of similarities between the two, there are numerous differences as well.

What’s the difference?

While the Vegas event features educational sessions, keynote speeches and seminars, CES is primarily a technology and innovation trade show – the largest trade show, in fact, in North America.

If CES is all about technology, SXSW is truly all things to all people.

In addition to the interactive festival, which runs now through Wednesday, March 11, SXSW also features individual f",

AUSTIN, Texas, March 9 (Reuters) - It's OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so.

As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, ""Neighbors,"" that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.

Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes - including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump - the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron.

But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film's biggest battle turns out to be internal.

It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to ""get-off-my-lawn"" adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear.

""When you have a kid, that's great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,"" Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters on Sunday in an interview after the movie's first public screening. ""That's probably good in some ways, but it's also a bummer in some ways.""

Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie's nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as ""lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid"" than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theaters on May 9.

The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.

Mac and Kelly's frantic debate over how to say ""keep it down"" in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?

'I KNOW THESE GUYS'

The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are - not to mention their own fans.

""All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,"" Rogen said with a laugh. ""That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that's when the movie, I think, took a great shape.""

Byrne's likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the ""Bridesmaids"" actress.

Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy's girlfriend to betray him.

Efron, characterized by Variety's Barker as giving ""one of his most credible and intriguing performances"" as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character.

Where Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying - and that gives him depth, Efron said.

He credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy's multi-faceted character.

""We were able to kind of find the heart in it,"" Efron, 26, said. ""I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I've felt those feelings.""

It is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up. (Editing by Mary Milliken and G Crosse)",

Here’s 10 things that everyone’s bound to be talking about between guzzling margaritas and chowing down on BBQ.

UPDATE: Jay Z and Kanye West also will perform together at SXSW on Wednesday March 12

Coldplay preview new material…

Recently, Chris Martin’s Coldplay dropped a surprise new track, ‘Midnight’. Produced by Jon Hopkins, it hints at a cooler, more electronic approach to their forthcoming new album, ‘Ghost Stories’, due for release on May 19. SXSW should be the first chance to hear more from that record; the band are playing an iTunes Festival gig out in Austin, which will be live-streamed across the world so even if you’re not in Texas, you don’t have to worry about missing out.

… And so does Julian Casablancas

Last week, The Strokes frontman shared a video teaser for his new solo album. It prompted a few questions for us and, come next Saturday (March 15), he should be answering at least one or two. His new backing band The Voidz will likely join him, revealing their identities, while it seems inevitable he’ll play some fresh tracks in between material taken from his 2009 debut ‘Phrazes For The Young’.

Lady Gaga is this year’s Keynote speaker

Dave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen and the late Lou Reed have all taken a break from playing music to speak at SXSW and, this year, Lady Gaga will join that list. We don’t know what she’ll talk about yet but, as one of music’s more eccentric characters, it’s bound to be interesting. The night before, the singer will perform an intimate gig at the Stubb’s venue.



Meanwhile, Jarvis Cocker will be on hand to help out songwriters

The Pulp frontman is one of the finest lyricists of modern British music and he’ll be offering songwriting tips at a SXSW lecture on Wednesday, using his own lyrics to show his development as a musician, explaining the “meaning of artistic vision” and giving advice to budding stars. Sounds like one lecture you’ll want to take notes at.

Jungle will be a must-see band

Sure, we still don’t know what Jungle actually look like (think the pictures you’ve seen are actually them? Think again) but they’re shaping up to be one of the most talked about bands of the festival if the rabid reaction to their recent shows in the UK is anything to go by. The whole enigmatic schtick might be a bit tiresome these days but when you’ve got the tunes to back it up – just check out Jungle’s latest single ‘Busy Earnin’- you can almost get away with it. We’d suggest getting in the queue for their Austin shows now.

Green Day’s side project will play

The Californian punks formed their garage rock side project Foxboro Hot Tubs in 2007 and released their debut album ‘Stop Drop And Roll’ the following year. They played under the name at a secret show in Oakland, California last year and now they’ve promised to do a two hour set at SXSW. Expect songs from their one and only LP plus tracks from Green Day’s 2012 record, ‘¡Dos!’.

50 Cent’s comeback

It’s been five years since the rapper released any music but he’s set to make his comeback this year with new record ‘Animal Ambition’, due June 3. What better place to preview his new tracks? 50 Cent should have plenty of material to choose from too – he’s also got another LP, ‘Street King Immortal’, done and dusted although he’s yet to confirm any concrete details about that record.

Kelis’ food truck

As well as playing a show at the festival, Kelis will be previewing her new album ‘Food’ by serving up dishes from her very own food truck during the event. On the menu, she’s promising jerk ribs (obviously), duck confit sliders, shredded beef and wild cherry BBQ sauce and coleslaw. Sadly, it doesn’t look like milkshake’s on the menu.Trick well and truly missed.

Fat White Family take their riotous live show to the US for the first time

Another band bound to be causing a stir at SXSW is Radar Award winners Fat White Family. They had to sell their services to get themselves over the Atlantic (they raised money via PledgeMusic, offering massages, meals and private gigs in return for cash) so expect them to make that hard work worthwhile. Just how America will react to their sleazy, ramshackle punk remains to be seen but we’d bet our houses on them starting some sort of controversy.

Music films screened for the first time

SXSW isn’t just about music – there’s film and technology portions to the festival too. Bands and cinema collide for some of it though, with some hotly anticipated music flicks showing in Austin. Festival-goers will be able to catch the premiere of ‘Pulp’, a documentary about Pulp, and A$AP Rocky’s SVDDXNLY film, while the long-delayed André 3000-starring Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is By My Side is also screening.

Over the past few years South by Southwest interactive (SXSW) in Austin, Texas has been heavily focused on social media and mobile.

But this year there is no shortage of hardware on display, especially in the miniature trade show which forms part of the festival.

The BBC's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor caught an early look at a novel way of printing smartphone photos onto old Polaroid film.

With some 2,200 acts performing at the annual South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas, the roster is too varied and too deep to serve as an indicator of where rock and pop is headed. But it’s rich with clues.

For example, SXSW says hip-hop is still a force. Next-generation performers on tap include 20-year-old Chance the Rapper; Future, likely to showcase material from “Honest,” his next album; genre-smasher Jeremiah Jae; Gee Watts, whose debut album “199x” arrives in early April; 21-year-old Young Thug; and YG, whose debut full-length disk “My Krazy Life” is out next week. As for hip-hop’s present: Kendrick Lamar is headlining an iTunes-sponsored show that also features ScHoolboy Q and Isaiah Rashad. Action Bronson, Fat Tony, Wiz Khalifa and Mobb Deep are slated to perform during the week, and veteran rapper Nas returns, topping a bill that includes the A$AP Mob and B.o.B., who will perform with a live band, according to the festival organizers. (The Nas show also includes the hip-hop-influenced jazz trio BadBadNotGood, the DJ and producer Flying Lotus, and bassist Thundercat.)

“It’s definitely changed,” said Cannon, an Austin, Texas- based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP. “I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It’s just, ‘Sally, the engineer.’”

As startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female- focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.

The shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.

Bro-gramming Culture

Started in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year’s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named “breakout app” in 2011.

This year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry’s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as “brogrammers.”

“Part of that is the ‘bro-gramming’ and too-cool-for- school attitude that goes on,” she said in an interview before her meeting. “What women have to push really hard about is you don’t have to be successful in a man’s world — it’s just the world.”

Look Harder

Parsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference’s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.

Hugh Forrest, the symposium’s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.

“If I had a dime for everybody who said that’s a great rule but there just aren’t enough qualified women I’d be rich, rich, rich,” he said. “My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It’s impossible for me to believe that you can’t find a female speaker in the world who isn’t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.”

Man’s World

Among the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women’s issues this year was a March 7 talk “Starting Up in a Man’s World” that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.

The lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere. Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.

Parsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.

Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.

The Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.

C-Suite Women

Still, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book “Lean In” to inspire other females.

Carley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers — like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.

“The number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,” she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum. “They have the ideas, but they don’t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code.”",
http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1284260/sxsw14-day-three-technology-now-next-beyond,entertainment,"It’s busy here in Austin . Thirty thousand delegates have come together for SXSW Interactive 2014, and the breadth of sessions, topics and speakers is vast. In just one hour, Eric Schmidt will talk about the new digital age, alongside sessions about content and commerce, crowd-funded start-ups and music for video game marketing.

It’s inspiring but also a bit of a sensory overload, as sessions about the ‘big’ trends in technology (e.g. crypto currencies, robots, genetics or connected objects) rub up against topics that marketers and agencies are grappling with now (e.g. retail, content, mobile).

So, what, as a marketing community, should we take away from SXSW and put into practice? What ideas, themes, trends or technologies should we invest our time in? Here’s my take on how approach and prioritise the key areas I’ve seen emerge from SXSW Interactive this year:

1 - Now

There are four topics I’ve seen across the schedule at SXSW this year which we are all grappling with now: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing. Perhaps surprisingly, the conversation around these topics has not focused on the new and shiny, but on how to approach them in more mature ways.

There are four topics Iwhich we are all grappling with: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing.

For example, as the ‘mobile majority’ becomes a reality, Richard Ting of R/GA put forward a more strategic view of mobile marketing: not mobile screens as spaces for advertising, but planning for mobile to enhance product and user experiences, of which ads may be one part. This requires building mobile services and assets over the long-term (such as the excellent Nike Tricktree), not necessarily one-off ‘campaign hits’ for the sake of ticking a mobile box.

Content and real-time marketing have been two of the most prolific topics here at SXSW. And the key questions are being tackled: should every brand ‘do’ real-time marketing? What’s the strategic value of content? A particularly highlight was Kristina Halvorson, of Brain Traffic, who accuses the marketing community of being ‘drunk’ on the buzz of agile and real-time content - the ""Oreo effect"".

To whoops of support, she called on brands and agencies to focus their content efforts on serving customers at their points of real need, and to have clearly defined content strategies that focus on making content that really counts, not chasing every new opportunity that arises.

In fact, putting customer experience first is a big theme across SXSW. On this count, the marketing community and the developer community have something in common: to remember that we’re designing digital services for customers, not ourselves, and their needs are always paramount. Adobe’s ‘pipeline’ development team revealed how they build new products, and at the heart of their process is one key principle: that the customer experience of any prototype defines success or failure. We need to put customers (and their behaviours) first, and the technology second.

2 - Next: the near future

Yes, there are plenty of sessions about wearable technology. But there is one underlying, and more significant, trend here at SXSW that will play out over the next 2 years: what the Internet looks and feels like when it moves beyond phones, tablets and computers.

We are all familiar with responsive design. But in a session about next generation responsive, Sarah Rotman Epps of Forrester spoke compellingly about the need go beyond ‘responsive’ as a way to show webpages on 3 screens, to a new marketing design paradigm which cuts across any potential screen: digital signage, watches, in-car systems, connected TVs and others. When many more new screens are connected, design of marketing must be truly responsive: tailored to a customer need and the context they’re using a particular device in.

In fact, contextual user experience is another recurring theme of SXSW 2014. Partly driven by data, partly by new connected ‘ things’, and partly of the ubiquity of Internet access, designing how services (and marketing) help users in a particularly context and moment of need, is going to be a big challenge moving forward. Cliff Kuang of Wired sums it up by calling for ‘more context, less complexity’. By understand what people are doing on their devices at any point in time or place, we should tailor brand experiences that make life a little easier for them.

3 - Beyond: new waves of disruption

Staring into the distant future here at SXSW is exciting, and a little bit scary. The most fundamental trend I have seen is how technology reshapes manufacturing and our expectations of what products are. Ideo and Joi Ito of MIT Media Labs painted a picture of this potential new reality, where already in places like Shenzen, product designers are effectively ‘A/B testing’ physical products at scale by using advanced production and 3D-printing techniques.

They predict that everyday products will be embedded with sensors, such that almost anything, including our clothes, may respond to our emotional need-states. This points towards a future where mass customisation of products becomes a reality - where we expect the things we buy and use to respond to us. At this point, marketing really does meet user experience design.

There is one common thread I have seen that cuts across the now, next and beyond of SXSW: whether its content, context or customisation, the place is to start is with the needs of customers (and users) and build messages, experiences and products that improve their lives, even if just a little bit.",

A special event, Showcasing Scotland, backed by the nation's art body, Creative Scotland, and the Association of Independent Music will take place on Friday.

God Help the Girl and For Those In Peril will screen as part of The SXSW Film Conference & Festival.

Paul Wright, the director of For Those in Peril, said: ""It's really exciting for us all to be part of this year's SXSW festival. We could not have picked a better place for the film to have its North American premiere than at a festival known for showcasing exciting new talent from around the world.""

Bands are often spotted at the festival and signed by labels and agents, or improve their reputation within the US.

David Weaver, development officer at Creative Scotland, said: ""The seven acts we are supporting really showcase the diversity in Scottish music right now.

If you think you can just fit in at SXSW Interactive, you are wrong. Unless you normally only wear plain clothing with things like “Wordpress” or “Google” written across them, clear framed glasses and leather boots, you will stand out like a hipster in a Microsoft store.

Really the only thing you can do to prepare yourself for the SXSW Interactive experience is practice your buzzwords. This way you can at least communicate with everyone else around you in the Austin Convention Center.

This is a list of the five words you need to know before leaving your apartment to go mingle with the #TechNerds downtown.

1. Disrupt, verb: interrupt by causing a disturbance or problem

SXSWi definition: new technology that unexpectedly displaces an already established technology

Sentence: “Man, online video is one disruptive technology that really changed the whole television game, bro, man.”

If you don’t know this one, go home. Really, go home. It is apparently the most important word in the TechBro language. If we’re lucky, one of the dudes with spiky hair trying to find a cute little TechBabe to settle down with will invent the next form of disruptive technology soon. Personally, I hope it has something to do with pants that can produce identification cards when you lose yours downtown during SXSW.

SXSWi panel: Disruption of TV and the Future of “Online” Video

2. Wearable, adjective: able to be worn

SXSWi definition: some piece of technology that can be worn as clothing

Sentence: “This wearable is great for making calls but totally makes my wrist look fat.”

The Google Glassholes are only the beginning. From what I’ve heard walking around the Convention Center, there are big things coming the world of technological things you can wear on your actual body. Even Mindy Kaling is in on it — she talked about owning a calorie counter that can be worn on your bra.

SXSWi panel: Wearable Devices: The Future of Healthcare?

3. Platform, noun: a raised surface on which things or people can stand

SXSWi definition: some public service through which you can spread your personal brand

Sentence: “I used to love Facebook, but now Twitter is definitely my favorite platform.”

If you haven’t heard of platforms by now, you’re doing it wrong. How are you even ON the Internet at all? You probably don’t even have a ***Brand*** (see below).

SXSWi panel: Platforms vs. Publishers: A Big New Theory

4. Brand, noun: a product made by a certain company under a certain name

SXSWi definition: a person or company’s personality, essentially, presented in a marketable way

Sentence: “I don’t know, I just don’t think eating seven Cronuts in a row fits my Brand.”

If I’ve learned anything in three days of SXSW panels, it’s that you are nothing without your Brand. I’m in the process of figuring mine out, so you could say my Brand is “just trying to figure out my Brand.”

SXSWi panel: Life’s a Breach, Don’t Burn Your Brand

5. Startup, verb: the process of setting something in motion

SXSWi definition: a small, decently innovative company made up of mostly 20-somethings who don’t need real jobs

Sentence: “I was in a pretty good startup at last year’s SXSW, but we kind of ended a few weeks after the festival.”

In a few years, SXSW might start requiring all attendees to be a part of some kind of startup. That might actually be a requirement now and I’m just missing out. There hasn’t been a single day I haven’t heard someone mention their startup. The strange thing is, none of them seem to exist anymore. Hmm.

http://www.thestreet.com/story/12522329/1/south-by-southwest-means-big-spending-for-austin.html,entertainment,"AUSTIN, Texas ( TheStreet ) -- South by Southwest began on Friday and is already in full gear, prepped for 10 days of tech, film and music inundation. In the days leading up to the festival, organizers were busy finalizing shuttle routes and printing badges and the city of Austin was knee-deep in preparation and expectation as well.

Last year's South by Southwest festival was the biggest event yet, drawing 41,700 total registrants, 30,621 paying attendees, and 155,000 overall participants who engaged in at least one activity. Similar numbers are expected this year.

For Austin, the festival means business, literally.

Hotel bookings skyrocket over the festival period and prices rise accordingly. Last year, SXSW booked 13,000 individual hotel rooms for a total of 56,735 room nights. On top of those numbers, SXSW reported 12,926 hotel bookings independent of the festival's pre-registered rooms.

Those who waited to book accommodations are certainly feeling the effects of their procrastination. Hotels near the Austin Convention Center, the heart of SXSW, are pricing at upwards of $800 a night in recent searches, according to Travelocity.com . Even budget options are charging high fees -- a La Quinta motel nearly five miles from downtown Austin is charging $359 a night.

And for all the money put into housing, most attendees of South by Southwest know they'll be getting very little sleep. Last year, music, restaurant and bar revenues were 45% higher than the in next highest earning month.

Individual attendees, who more often than not find themselves surrounded by free food, drinks and gadgets, are not necessarily the ones doing the spending.

To stand out in the crowd, start-ups often find themselves fronting copious amounts of money, renting out bars and catering late-night parties in the hopes of attracting attention and, obviously, investors.

Once upon a time, this technique really did work. While Get Report ) didn't officially launch at SXSW, it is notorious for having gained great traction through the festival.was discovered and brought to popularity in 2009. These successes leave each new tech start-up wondering whether it will be the next big item.

However, with SXSW Interactive having more than tripled in size since 2009, many are concerned the festival has simply gotten too big. One thing's for sure, though -- the drinks will definitely be flowing.

On with the party.

That's the High School Musical variety, of course.

The Hollywood hunk has confessed he's keen to reunite with his all-singing, all-dancing pals for another round of fun-filled movies.

The 26 year old tells Eonline.com: ""We're all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School... It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. It brings you right back to those days.""

Zac and his former girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale and Corbin Bleu shot to fame as the plucky high school students in the hugely successful trilogy, which ran from 2006 to 2008.

Maybe Zac wants a return to a simpler time after a tough 2013, which saw him enter rehab for unknown substance issues and break his jaw in a nasty spill at his L.A. home.

Since his breakthrough role, the actor has appeared in gritty drama The Paperboy, The Lucky One, and new comedy That Awkward Moment.

High School Musical's first two instalments were made as TV movies, but the third film was given a theatrical release due to high demand, grossing £158 million worldwide on a £6.8 million budget.",

On the following year, a sequel was released following the same TV-movie format. In 2008, a theatrical film, the ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"" was released and grossed $50 million in North America and $40 million overseas during its third opening day.

After the ""High School Musical"" trilogy, Efron had a flourishing career and starred in films like ""17 Again"", ""Charlie St. Cloud"", ""The Lucky One"", ""Parkland"" and ""That Awkward Moment"".

In his latest film, ""Neighbors"", he plays a fraternity president who is the source of his next-door neighbor's problems. In an article on E!

President Trump's personal attorney is considering launching his own podcast about the impeachment inquiry, CNN reports.

A Giuliani spokesperson confirmed he had this discussion, saying, ""Many Americans want to hear directly from Rudy Giuliani.""

Giuliani reportedly said during the discussion he'd be looking to ""analyze the impeachment in every aspect,"" and CNN writes that he appears to want four episodes finished before a potential Senate trial begins. The impeachment inquiry is focused on whether Trump improperly withheld aid to Ukraine in order to secure investigations that might help him in the 2020 election, including into former Vice President Joe Biden.

This wouldn't be the first impeachment podcast from a Trump ally, with the president's former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, having already launched a podcast and radio show about the inquiry last month. Giuliani recently appeared on an episode of Bannon's show, which was released a day before this lunch conversation took place. Presumably, the appearance helped give him the podcast bug.

Once a regular presence on cable news, Giuliani has stepped back over the past month, with CNN noting his last TV interview came on Oct. 9, the day two of his associates were arrested on money laundering charges. In September, Giuliani infamously admitted in a cable news appearance that he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden moments after denying that he did. This kind of thing created frustration among Trump allies, with one former Trump campaign official telling Politico, ""Rudy Giuliani needs to stop talking.""

USA TODAY

AUSTIN – Move over Animal House, Seth Rogen and Zac Efron are staking claim to the top of the frat-boy party movie class.

They star in Neighbors, a raunchily entertaining comedy that pits Rogen as Mac, a young thirtysomething husband and father, against Teddy (Efron), the president of a hard-partying fraternity that moves in next door.

Even though the film with a May 9 release date is not completely finished, director Nicholas Stoller wanted to bring the film to the South By Southwest festival Saturday night. When he brought Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Austin in 2008 ""it was the best screening I've ever been at,"" Stoller told the audience before the film played.

Writer-executive producer Brendan O'Brien got the idea for the script when his wife called the police because some college kids who were being a nuisance next door. ""That is kind of the idea of where this actually came from,"" Rogen said on the red carpet before the film was screened. ""If you actually had to live next to that and you were someone who was trying to have some responsibility in their life it would just be a disaster. That idea was just really funny to us.""

At first, Mac and wife Kelly, played by Rose Byrne (The Internship) try to welcome the fraternity into the neighbor, even joining in on the festivities. But eventually the constant clamor derails their baby's sleep schedule and have to fight back.

There are plenty of homages to Animal House. An almost unrecognizable Lisa Kudrow plays the school dean, who like Dean Wormer (John Vernon) in the 1978 film, calls in the fraternity's leaders to put them on probation. And there's hazing of pledges, too, but here it gets a Google Glass-style twist. ""Everybody in comedy loves that movie on some level,"" said co-producer James Weaver.

But these Deltas go to new lengths to save their frat house. After Mac breaks a water pipe and floods the building's basement, the Deltas get creative in fund-raising and offer up a suggestive new use for 3-D printers.

Rogen (Pineapple Express) and Efron (That Awkward Moment) graduate to new roles in the film. As Mac, Rogen ""is the adult person in this relationship,"" Weaver said.

The former High School Musical star shows off his buff body and breaks new ground in other ways, too. ""Let's just say he uses a lot of four-letter words,"" said Evan Goldberg, who last year formed Point Grey Pictures with Rogen and Weaver.

Efron can still create a clamor of his own; shrieks of glee were heard upon his arrival at the Paramount theater before the screening. He gushed about Austin as a festival destination.

""There is an energy, man, a vibe about the town. People here really love movies and you just feel such support,"" Efron said. ""And the fellow artists you meet around town, casually, it's integrated with the people. Usually it's so separate,. Here I really feel like we're part of the world. It's really neat.""

When asked by an audience member if he was happy where his career has taken him, Efron said, ""this was awesome. It couldn't be better. When you get a call from Seth Rogen, you are in a pretty good place.""

No release date was announced. Neighbors needs ""a few trims and it's not mixed,"" Stoller told the crowd afterwards.

The almost-psychedelic party scenes will sound even better properly mixed, said Stoller who recommended viewers see the final cut. ""It will be dramatically different when you pay for it,"" Rogen riffed.

""And it's in 3-D,"" Stoller joked.",

Texas-It's OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so. As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, ""Neighbors,"" that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.

Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes and the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron. But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film's biggest battle turns out to be internal. It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to ""get-off-my-lawn"" adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear. ""When you have a kid, that's great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,"" Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters on Sunday in an interview after the movie's first public screening. ""That's probably good in some ways, but it's also a bummer in some ways.""

Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie's nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as ""lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid"" than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theaters on May 9.

The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.

Mac and Kelly's frantic debate over how to say ""keep it down"" in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool? The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said.",

But that doesn't mean the 26 year-old has forgotten what made him into a star.

Efron, who has since taken on much more serious roles such as 'Parkland' and 'The Lucky One', has confirmed that he is definitely keen on a reunion with his former 'High School Musical' cast mates.

While promoting his new comedy 'Neighbors', along with Seth Rogen, Efron stated that he is ""100 percent"" interest in shooting a reunion movie, if the offer was there.

The revelation came this Sunday (March 9th), at the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, and he told E!News that ""we're all thinking about it,"" referring to his fellow 'HSM' stars.

""I continue to see all the guys from High School,"" Efron said. ""Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.""

Zac also explained that when he gets together with the former cast members, ""It brings you right back to those days,"" which is when many of them were first exposed to a large amount of success.

The successful musical movie franchise began in 2006 with a straight-to-television movie for the Disney Channel, this was then followed by a sequel in 2007 and the final instalment was made into a feature film in 2008.

Rogen, who directed and starred in 'Neighbors, also commented on a possible 'HSM' reunion.

""You guys can make a really dirty, R-rated version of High School Musical,"" he joked. ""It would be so funny, wouldn't it?""

The upcoming R-rated comedy, which follows Rogen, his wife and baby clash an unruly gang of frat students who move in next door and take over the neighbourhood with their ridiculous antics, is set to hit theatres May 9th.

Zac Efron has dropped the biggest hint yet that a High School Musical 4 movie could well be on the cards.

He’s being lined up for a role in JJ Abrams upcoming blockbuster Star Wars Episode 7 but all Zac really wants is to reunite with his old HSM pals and bring out a fourth film in the Disney franchise.

The 26 year-old starred as jockey Troy Bolton in all three films and speaking of its possible revival, told E! News: ‘We’re all thinking about it.

‘I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do…there’s just this look between us.

‘It’s so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.

‘[As soon as I see them] it brings you right back to those days.’

Of course it might be slightly more awkward this time around seeing as he broke up with his on-screen girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens, who played Gabriella Montez, in 2010 after three years of dating.

The first of the three films came out in 2006.",
http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/news/zac-efron-teases-more-high-school-musical,entertainment,"In a recent interview with E! News, Zac Efron said that another High School Musical movie isn't out of the question. (Disney's previous plans for the series to continue with new, rival high schools and an all-new cast never panned out.) ""We're all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School, he said. ""Every time we do... there's just this look between us."" Obviously, the script for High School Musical 4: Reunion writes itself, so here are some quick character summaries:

Troy Bolton developed an addiction to painkillers after a knee injury derailed his basketball career — only the gift of upbeat song can set him back on the road to recovery/clean, musical living. He and Gabriela broke up because she put academics before true love; she's cured cancer already, but she's still insufferable — and refuses to take her lab coat off even for the dance numbers. Gabriela's best friend Taylor is also insufferable, mostly because she never left East High where she now takes out her frustrations on students in the athletic decathlon team she still runs as a teacher.

Despite what Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure may have suggested, everyone's secret favorite Sharpay Evans' career showbiz career never really took off — but she did appear on a recent season of The Bachelor. (Note: this allows for a cameo appearance from real-life Bachelor crazies like Erica Rose from that season with Prince Lorenzo.) She doesn't speak to her twin brother Ryan any more because he's big into the gay party circuit and so is basically never not at the gym. Corbin Bleu's character Chad is also really buff now, but that's about all the character development he'll get. And Troy Bolton is buff too, despite the pill-popping, did I mention that? REALLY BUFF:

Anyway, aside from that the most important thing is that this GIF will be recreated in a pivotal scene:

But the battle quickly escalates, with proceedings turning both nasty and hilarious, most notably during Delta’s insane end of year blow-out.Efron excels as the douchebag daddy of the frat, all cocksure arrogance in the film’s early scenes before becoming increasingly insecure as proceedings progress. Indeed you’re never quit sure exactly where he's coming from throughout the film, which is a testament to Efron’s talents and makes Teddy the film’s most interesting character.Seth Rogen is as good as ever as Mac, his inherent likeability ensuring you root for the character in spite of his stupidity. And Rose Byrne is something of a revelation as Kelly, with many of the film’s best moments revolving around the nasty plans that she concocts.Dave Franco, Chritopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael also bring the laughs as frat-boy fools, while Submarine star Craig Roberts delivers a wicked turn as a pledge who is simply referred to as Ass-Juice.All of which makes for a very silly film that that has little in the way of depth or substance, but enough jokes to ensure that such superficiality doesn't really matter.",

The stars of High School Musical, however, are an exception and are apparently not too big, old or famous to do a reunion.

While in Austin for SXSW, Zac Efron revealed that he would do another High School Musical movie ""100 percent.""

""We're all thinking about it,"" Efron said in an interview with E! News.

The High School Musical franchise took tweens and teens by storm when the first movie premiered in 2006. The Disney Channel movie also featured Vanessa Hudgens, now 25 years old, Ashley Tisdale, now 28 years old, and Corbin Bleu, now 25 years old.

""I continue to see all the guys from High School,"" Efron, now 26 years old, said. ""Every time we do ... there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.""

The television movie's two sequels, High School Musical 2 and High School Musical 3: Senior Year premiered in 2007 and 2008, respectively.

""It brings you right back to those days,"" Efron said about running into his former cast mates.

Efron is now promoting a raunchier film called Neighbors, which co-stars Seth Rogen. The film was received positively after its SXSW premiere.The film features infinitely more dirty scenes than all of the High School Musical movies combined.

""It was neat [to film the raunchy scenes],"" Efron admitted. ""For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.""

The movie features Efron as a frat boy who tortures Rogen and actress Rose Byrne's characters who just had a baby.

""For us, we really had a fraternity,"" Efron said.""We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.""

Neighbors hits theaters May 9, 2014.

Several months ago now, our Weekly Trailer Roundup was topped by a pair of R-comedies headlined by Zac Efron: That Awkward Moment and Neighbors. To me, they both had potential. The trailers did their job. I was excited for the movies. Then I actually saw That Awkward Moment, and “excited” is about the last thing I felt. Fairly or not, my excitement for Neighbors was seriously tempered (Efron is the only connective tissue betwee the two pics, but I didn’t think he was great in Moment).

That’ll teach me to whimsically equate unrelated productions.

To a sold out crowd, Neighbors made its premier Saturday night at SXSW, and it wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to say it had us literally rolling in the aisles. It’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the funniest and freshest R-comedies since The Hangover. Now if they can just avoid the impulse to serialize it to death.

The story follows two threads: Seth Rogen and Rose Byre as a couple with a new baby trying to come to terms with the realities of responsible adulthood, and a frat cohort led by Zac Efron and Dave Franco trying to make fraternity history by doing something epic, something on the level of say, inventing beer pong…and just maybe trying to cope with the impending conclusion of college as well. After burning a prior house down, the frat moves in next door to Teddy and Kelly (Rogen and Byrne), and through a series of events that I won’t go into here (but are pretty damn funny to watch), the two households begin an epic feud.

If that all sounds a little crazy, it’s because it is. But the movie absolutely nails the tone it’s trying for, consistently asking the audience not to suspend their disbelief entirely, but only to push the bounds of believable out a little ways. It’s what allows the movie to isolate Teddy and Kelly from the rest of the neighborhood by saying the frat bought out the rest of the block, but Teddy and Kelly can’t move because, being next to a frat, their home value has now plummeted. This is where the real fun of the movie is found. It gives itself license to do just about anything, but restrains itself just enough that the audience isn’t pulled in too many directions. It’s a lot like The Hangover, actually, by way of Home Alone. You want to believe all the craziness these characters do, and so it flies.



A big part of that is the way the characters themselves are drawn. As the old adage goes, keep it simple, stupid, and although I never thought I’d celebrate character arcs so skinny they’re practically anorexic, it’s exactly that this movie calls for. What sets it apart is that is that it doesn’t forsake its characters. Rogen is the formerly partying everyman he plays so well, taken to a new high here when he’s forced to couple that with actual responsibility for a wife and child. Byrne’s Kelly is a woman struggling to stay sane while staying home all day. Efron is the king who knows his reign must end. And Franco is the sidekick who points him the way. There’s not very much, but the way little bits of personality are sprinkled throughout the film contributes the grounding that the picture has. But those are also easy character arcs to complete. The most heavy-handed it gets is Efron confronting his own college mortality, and even that gets broken up by an amazing series of bros before hoes jokes.

Because really, that’s what we want from this movie – jokes – and thank goodness the script and the actors are good enough to give us an abundance of hilarity. Rogen, of course, is a known comic quantity, but Efron proves very capable and Franco fits his sidekick role well, although it does seem like some of the awkwardness of his character is less acting and more pure awkwardness. Byrne gets a chance to leave behind the stuck up nature of her character in Bridesmaids, and absolutely owns it as the desperate-for-a-party Kelly. And finally, a discussion of the cast cannot conclude without mentioning the sublime comic supporting turn of Ike Bairnholtz as Teddy’s friend from work, as well as an all-too-brief performance from Lisa Kudrow.

The Verdict: 4 out of 5

This review has ended up somewhat shorter than normal, but that’s because there’s a very limited amount to say. This movie knows what it is: an R-comedy the vein of Knocked Up, Superbad, The Hangover, etc., but it’s smart enough to remain engaging and well executed to a high degree. My patience for this kind of film can be limited, but Neighbors knows what it’s doing. It doesn’t outstay its welcome, it’s hilarious throughout, and it has all the character development it needs without an ounce more. Your enjoyment of this film is going to be entirely contingent on your enjoyment of others of its kind, as it is directly out of the Apatow circle of influence, but rest assured – this is among the better films this subgenre has to offer.

Zac Efron is ''thinking about'' a 'High School Musical' reunion movie.



The 26-year-old actor was catapulted to the spotlight in 2006's hit film where he played popular student and captain of the varsity basketball team, Troy Bolton, alongside Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale.



The hunk claims he still meets up with his former co-stars, who've never forgotten the experience they shared, and insists their reunions take them back to the days when they worked together.



He told E! News: ''We're all thinking about it [reunion movie].



''I continue to see all the guys from 'High School'.



''Every time we do [meet up]... there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. It brings you right back to those days.''



Efron will next hit the big screen in comedy 'Neighbors', where he plays the president of a fraternity, alongside Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne who have been cast as a married couple.



He added: ''It was neat. For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.



''For us, we really had a fraternity. We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.''",

Are you ready to get your head back in the game?

Zac Efron might be. Over the weekend, a reporter for E! asked the actor if he would ever return to the sacred (?) halls of East High — home of Disney’s High School Musical franchise. And instead of shooting down the rumors, Efron replied, “We’re all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do…there’s just this look between us.”

Right off the bat, I’ll acknowledge that while this isn’t a “no,” it’s also not confirmation of a reunion. But also: At this point, would a reunion be the worst idea? It’s not exactly surprising that Efron may be in, even though a year or two ago he wanted to graduate from East High for good. (UPDATE: When EW asked Disney Channel for a response to Efron’s comments, they sent this statement: “Everyone at Disney Channel takes pride in knowing that our wonderful ‘High School Musical’ cast has fond memories about their days as ‘Wildcats,’ and that each year, new audiences are introduced to the movies through our telecasts around the world, but we have no ‘new news’ to report.”)

If Efron did decide to return and give us “Scream Pt. 2,” it’s easy to see the rest of the cast following suit. They wouldn’t even have to carry a full movie: For a long time, Disney was developing a fourth High School Musical for TV. (And no, I’m not talking about SNL‘s High School Musical: New Senior Class.) The movie, called High School Musical: East Meets West, supposedly would have starred a new cast, and would have told a West Side Story-esque story about East and West High. (Real talk: What was Troy and Gabrielle’s love if not a millennial, significantly less high-stakes version of Maria and Tony?) The project keeps getting pushed back, but it hasn’t been canceled — Disney just put out Teen Beach Movie instead. But what if it got revved up again — and the original HSM gang came back for a little alumni number? (Efron has long said he would consider doing something like that.)

A return from the original six could give HSM4 enough buzz for the movie to get off the ground. After all, Efron — while clearly the star of the bunch — has seen his last couple projects disappoint (RIP, That Awkward Moment). And while he’ll still have no trouble booking future films, it could be in Efron’s best interest to remind people why they love him in the first place. Specifically, I’m talking about this:

http://variety.com/2014/scene/news/sxsw-zac-efron-seth-rogens-neighbors-cracks-up-premiere-crowd-1201128383/,entertainment,"AUSTIN — To premiere at SXSW, Universal’s “Neighbors” decided to forgo the end credits, a final mix, and the aspect ratio correction, but the sold-out crowd at the Paramount Theater didn’t seem to mind. The Seth Rogen-produced raunchy comedy starring Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, Dave Franco and an often-shirtless Rogen debuted to an audience content to heartily laugh.

While the weather outside was both frightful and wet, inside Rogen half joked that the only person out of the near dozen onstage that attended college was producer James Weaver, who also doubled as the sole member of a fraternity.

The film follows the Radnor family (Rogen and Byrne), who, after having their first child experience the unfortunate circumstance of having a fraternity move in next door (its president is played by Efron). In an attempt to both give their daughter a peaceful environment and yet prove to themselves that they are still cool and hip, the duo walk a fine line, both partying with and calling the cops on the frat. Things inevitably escalate into a frat-versus-new parent war.

Director Nicholas Stoller deadpanned to the SXSW crowd that he used Gaspar Noe’s “Enter the Void” as visual inspiration (“but just a visual touchstone, not for anything else,” he said) and the audience heartily clapped when Rogen said he drew his inspiration for a series of car airbag pranks from hours of YouTube videos.

“There is a zero percent survival rate and we thought it was so funny we put it in the movie 17 times, but don’t do it to your friends,” Rogen warned the audience.

After the film, “Neighbors” branded buses navigated through the rain to the “frat house,” a small space on the outskirts of downtown Austin that mixed ping pong balls, beer cozies and mud with live performances and brisket or soy tacos.

“We will take it back to college tonight,” Efron told the crowd prior to the party, however this reporter was unable to find the former Disney child star in the after party crowd.

News, High School Musical star Zac Efron revealed that he would be ""100 percent' up for doing a reunion of the hit Disney Channel film. Watch the interview here!

""We're all thinking about it,"" the actor told E! while promoting his new comedy, Neighbors, at SXSW in Austin. ""I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.""



He added that as soon as he does see any of his HSM co-stars, ""It brings you right back to those days.""



The High School Musical franchise began as a television movie on the Disney Channel in 2006. A sequel premiered the next year followed by a feature film in 2008.



The film's soundtrack was the best-selling album in the U.S. in 2006. In 2012, it was reported that more than 225 million viewers have reportedly watched the three HSMs.



Since HSM ended, Efron has gone on to star in a variety of big screen films, including 17 Again, The Paperboy with Nicole Kidman, Parkland and most recently That Awkward Moment opposite Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller.



It was revealed in the fall that Efron had done a stint in rehab in early 2013. Not only is he looking better than ever, but if buzz is correct, Neighbors is destined to be a box office hit when it's released on May 9. ""It was neat,"" Efron said about shooting the movie's many NSFW bits. ""For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.""



In the flick, Efron plays the hard-partying president of a fraternity wreaking havoc on their next door neighbors, a young couple (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) with a baby. ""For us, we really had a fraternity,"" Efron said. ""We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.""

I think she's literally Meryl Streep,"" director Nicholas Stoller told HuffPost Entertainment at SXSW on Sunday, one day after Universal debuted a work-in-progress cut of the comedy. ""She can do every kind of character and none of them are like who she is exactly. From the very beginning, when we were talking about this couple, she was at the top of our list.""

Byrne and Rogen star as that aforementioned couple, Kelly and Mac, new parents who have their lives thrown into further disarray when a fraternity house run by Efron and Franco moves next door. ""Neighbors"" tracks the escalating war between the two residences, as well as Byrne and Rogen's slow realization that they are no longer young and cool. (A hilarious conversation between Rogen and Efron's characters about whether Batman is most associated with Michael Keaton or Christian Bale puts the generational divide in pop-culture context.) Within that setup, Byrne's character is allowed to express just as much immaturity and confusion as her onscreen husband, yanking ""Neighbors"" out of the familiar pool of male-driven, arrested development comedies which have risen to prominence in the last decade.

""When I had my first baby, I had a nervous breakdown. As did my wife,"" said Stoller, who also directed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""The Five-Year Engagement."" ""It wasn't like she was fine with it. When I asked all my friends, they said the same thing: everybody has a nervous breakdown. Usually in movies, just the guy does. It's unrealistic.""

Eschewing those expected norms, however, may have an unintended consequence: exposing how audiences are now conditioned to expect the worst when it comes to the portrayal modern-day wives and girlfriends in studio comedies.

""There was a funny thing where we had a test screening, and there was a focus group afterward. Rose's character always tests really high. We were talking to the focus group and asked, 'Why do you like Rose?' And this guy was like, 'Because she was, like, not just yelling at her husband,'"" Stoller said before breaking into laughter. ""That's the lowest fucking bar. Rose does a great job, but we could do anything. Just be nice to Seth and we would get accolades.""

As Stoller recalled, crafting Byrne's character was a collaborative effort, one that started with Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien's script and extended to the actress herself.

""Rose helped us, too,"" Stoller said of making sure that Kelly was never, in his words, a ""shrew."" ""There was still even a little bit of that in the draft as we got closer to shooting. It was actually when they go over to the frat on the first night. We only had Seth sneaking out and lying about it to Rose. She was like, 'I think I would go.' We were like, 'Okay, you're right. Of course!' It takes you a while to figure very obvious things out.""

""Neighbors,"" which Stoller said was mostly locked in beyond some sound mixing and finalized end-credits, is out in theaters on May 9.",

Seth Rogen's new film Neighbours had the audience in stitches as it premiered at SXSW.

A nearly complete cut of the comedy - about a couple (Seth and Rose Byrne) whose peaceful life is ruined when a fraternity moves in next door - was screened at South By Southwest to a sold-out crowd.

Variety reported that Seth spoke to the audience and explained that his inspiration for a series of car airbag pranks came from YouTube videos.

""There is a zero per cent survival rate and we thought it was so funny we put it in the movie 17 times, but don't do it to your friends,"" he said.

The film's stars Zac Efron, who plays the fraternity's president, Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse also attended the event in Texas.

Discussing the shoot, Dave told the audience he had fun filming one of the saucier scenes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

He said: ""My favourite interaction with the director Nick Stoller was during my awkward sex scene. I did the first couple takes and Nick ran upstairs and he leans in and he's like, 'Hey Dave, just, uh, like, more jack rabbit'.""

After the movie, Zac told the audience: ""We will take it back to college tonight,"" and people then headed to the after party at a bar that had been decked out to look like a frat house.

However, Zac - who completed a stint in rehab in 2013 for unspecified reasons - wasn't seen at the bash.",

According to E! News, while at the film's premiere at the South By Southwest (SXSW) Fesitval in Austin the star admitted that he's shirtless ""a lot"" in the film.

He explained, ""I don't know how many times. It just seemed like whenever we felt like it-no hesitation,"" adding, ""It was like wake up, work out and then go to set and party all day.""

In ""Neighbors"" Zac Efron stars alongside Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne who play a young couple with a baby that get new neighbors who just happen to be a rowdy fraternity house.

The ""That Awkward Moment"" actor plays the fraternity president leading the group of trouble-making frat brothers that consist of Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael.

While on set Lily Collins' ex-boyfriend, Zac Efron made sure that he stayed fit and decided to workout between scenes. The actor even found a spot on set where he thought no one could see him doing a ""ton of pushups."" However, someone was watching him.

The ""Parkland"" actor revealed some details about the old man, ""He goes, 'Steve McQueen used to do that,'"" adding, ""He just looked like he had a lot of wisdom and I was like, 'Really, Steve McQueen did that?' He's like, ''Yeah, I saw him do that,' and then he goes, 'Don't do too many because you'll get sweaty.'""

Another interesting experience on set was Seth Rogen's shared shirtless scenes with Efron. The comedian described standing next to the young star.

He confessed, ""It was brutal,"" adding, ""I was just telling my wife there are a few scenes where he had his shirt off and people make a noise I've never heard before when they see him. It's crazy. It's a weird noise.""

Zac Efron got his big break in the hit Disney movie ""High School Musical"" alongside ex-girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens.

The actor mentioned that the cast has been considering a reunion. He admitted, ""We're all thinking about it,"" adding, ""I continue to see all the guys from High School.""

AUSTIN, March 10 — It’s OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so.

As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, “Neighbours,” that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.

Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes — including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump — the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron.

But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film’s biggest battle turns out to be internal.

It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to “get-off-my-lawn” adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear.

“When you have a kid, that’s great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,” Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters yesterday in an interview after the movie’s first public screening. “That’s probably good in some ways, but it’s also a bummer in some ways.”

Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie’s nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as “lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid” than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theatres on May 9.

The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.

Mac and Kelly’s frantic debate over how to say “keep it down” in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?

‘I KNOW THESE GUYS’

The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are — not to mention their own fans.

“All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,” Rogen said with a laugh. “That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that’s when the movie, I think, took a great shape.”

Byrne’s likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the “Bridesmaids” actress.

Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy’s girlfriend to betray him.

Efron, characterised by Variety’s Barker as giving “one of his most credible and intriguing performances” as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character.

Where Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying — and that gives him depth, Efron said.

He credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy’s multi-faceted character.

“We were able to kind of find the heart in it,” Efron, 26, said. “I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I’ve felt those feelings.”

http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/09/sxsw-2014-neighbors-review-seth-rogen-zac-efron,entertainment,"Seth Rogen’s being a grown-up again. Fear not, those who remember Ro-Bro’s crying scene in Take This Waltz – this time the relationship stuff is played way down in the dirt. Bad Neighbours – writer-director Nicholas Stoller’s smart, disgusting gutter-dweller – has little time for the intricacies of long-term love and commitment. Instead it crashes Project X into a Joe Swanberg movie, invites it to chug the drinks and throw up all over the rug.

Rogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, new parents who go to war against the college fraternity that have moved in next door. Head of the frat pack is Zac Efron as Teddy, a sweet-natured lunk who doesn’t want to keep the couple’s baby awake, but can’t pass up an opportunity to party.

Stoller – the long-term Apatow collaborator who also had a hand in 2011’s Muppets revamp – has always been good at mixing profanity and pathos. His directorial debut, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, hid a sincere romantic drama behind all the dick jokes. Neighbors is far less subtle, barely bothering to check if its dignity’s in place before leaping into the next filthy setup.

Rogen and Byrne have great chemistry as the thirtysomethings anxious to do right by their daughter, look cool in front of the kids and still get invited to party like they used to. Byrne’s role is meatier than most comedies – even Apatow comedies – allow their female stars. Kelly is as conniving as Mac, equally keen to get one over the college kids by doing something moronic. They’re a very likable couple, both as tempted by the hard partying lifestyle of Teddy and co as they are dismissive of it.

Efron is strangely blank for the alpha-male leader of a group of marauding teens, but his support – including Dave Franco as his big-brained lieutenant, Pete, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as “blessed” numbskull Scoonie – pick up the slack. Submarine’s Craig Roberts pops up in a charming little role as a wannabe frat member. He’s full of conflicted emotions about his place in the all-male society, unsure how the house’s intensely homo-social heirarchy chimes with his need for independence. His character is called Assjuice.



Bad Neighbours needs a tuck. The pacing is wobbly, the targets are too big. There are some lazy gags about post-natal sex (“she’s got these huge tits, but she insists on wearing a wife-beater. It’s like fucking Tony Soprano!”) and too much focus on Scoonie’s schlong. But it’s also an extremely funny comedy that pushes Rogen’s instinctive good nature to the limit. His stoner schtick helps to take the edge off much of the film’s crassness and gives it back some charm.

The VM cast was out in full force at SXSW.

First of all, there was Seth Rogen and Zac Efron’s Neighbors, which pits Rogen against Efron in a battle for dominance over a suburban street. In this comedy, directed by Nicholas Stoller from a script by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien, Rogen plays one half of a newly married couple, who are just settling into their cozy suburban nest. Efron and his band of frat boys, however, are there to ruin everything. According to THR, Neighbors got big laughs at its Paramount Theater premiere, so it might be one to look out for later in the year.

SXSW got off to a roaring start yesterday afternoon (well, start for me; the festival proper kicked off Friday) for a couple reasons. First was the rain, which wasn’t quite “roaring” but was plenty cold and wet enough to be despised by all in line. Second was Neighbors, a comedy of young couple meets frat house starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron. There are definitely traces of Judd Apatow influence, which makes sense given that the writer, director, and at least a plurality of the producers have been involved projects from the Apatow circle of friends, but Neighbors is probably the freshest, funniest R-comedy to appear since the first Hangover. The packed Paramount theater where the film was screened, not a small venue, was roaring through basically the whole debut.

And this was technically just a public debut, not a premier, because the version we were shown was called a “work in progress,” but some color and sound balance aside, this looks pretty much done. Some of the cast and production team did a short Q&A after the screening, and they said there are still a couple minor cuts to be made, but my guess is this is as much about cleaning up transitions as it is cutting material.

A full review is incoming in the near future, but for now suffice it to say that Efron and Rogen seem perfectly cast. That douche Efron was playing in That Awkward Moment? This is his funnier, dumber (literally, but also in a good way), crazier college doppelganger, and he actually fits the narrative this time around. Rogen is also treading somewhat familiar territory here as the adult who still wants to party every now and then, but he does it really well. Rose Byrne is a great addition as Rogen’s wife, as is Ike Bairnholtz as Rogen’s friend and coworker who absolutely steals a few of the scenes he’s in. Also a shout out to the baby as one of the cutest, most emotive film babies I can ever remember.

This movie strikes exactly the ridiculous tone you’d expect from a film with the premise of a war between a frat house and their slightly more…well, no not any more responsible neighbors, but that’s a really good thing. The production leans into the just-beyond-believable ridiculousness of it all, and – I can’t believe I’m saying this – should be commended for keeping its requisite character development and associated somber moments to a minimum and mostly out of the way. Guys, this was a really fun film.

Fun fact: of all the principle cast, none of them went to college, and of the main production team, only one was actually in a frat.",

http://www.thewrap.com/zac-efron-shops-dildos-neighbors-proving-hes-far-disney-star/,entertainment,"Don’t call Zac Efron a Disney star anymore.

In “Neighbors,” an irreverent comedy directed by Nick Stoller, Efron continues his transition from teen idol to mature actor — with a big push from Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. Efron plays Rogen’s neighbor, the president of a fraternity hellbent on making history by throwing the greatest party his college town has ever seen. He’s more than a just Rogen’s co-star, he’s the comedic foil to Rogen, one of the most successful comedy writers and actors of the past decade.

“These actors that grow up through the Disney system have insane chops,” Stoller told TheWrap Saturday. “[Zac’s] very funny and knows what makes him funny. He’s not afraid to play the straight man and he has some of my favorite impov scenes.”

The movie drew a raucous applause after a “work in progress” cut of the film premiered Saturday night at South By Southwest. Though Rogen taunted a few members of the crowd, labeling one “self-serving,” Stoller deemed the festival “the best place to play a movie.” He was in Austin six years ago with the crowd-pleasing “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” his directorial debut. That movie, which features a naked Jason Segel in an early scene, is tame compared to “Neighbors.” Rogen and Byrne play a married couple horrified by the arrival of a frat next door. Yet neither is ready to grow up — as in so many recent comedies — so they get caught up trying to fight their new enemy with juvenile hijinks.

The story was born when Brendan O’Brien’s wife described some youths in the neighborhood by telling a cop “I don’t’ know what they’re doing, but they’re up to no good.”

“We became old at that moment,” O’Brien, who co-wrote the movie with Andrew Jay Cohen, told the crowd.

The movie takes this concept to the extreme. During a friendly night of partying at the neighboring frat house, Rogen takes mushrooms and “crosses streams” with Efron — a bonding mechanism of sorts. Yet the relationship deteriorates from there as Efron and his buddies, including Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, exact retribution after Rogen and Byrne call the cops about a party. When Rogen retaliates by flooding the frat house with water, Efron devises a scheme to save it by having his brothers craft dildos from their own members and sell them. They get a hot tub out if it. All of these shenanigans are still tamer than the final party, which Stoller said was designed to be the “craziest party you’ve ever been at.”

See video: SXSW: Watch Live Interviews With Seth Rogen, Robert Duvall, Emmy Rossum, Paul Wesley, Kathryn Hahn and More

The writer-director learned a lot about shooting party scenes from “Get Him to the Greek,” his follow-up to “Sarah Marshall” starring Jonah Hill and Russell Brand. “Neighbors” features numerous memorable performances from comedy mainstays Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Franco, among others, but the two standouts are Byrne and Efron. Byrne plays a woman every bit as ferocious as her husband, defying the comedic trope of the controlling, bleating wife. She rejects Rogen when he tries to tell her she’s supposed to keep him in check. She even facilitates a fraternal betrayal by feeding shots to Efron’s girlfriend and Franco — and then kissing both of them. The next morning Rogen is obligated to milk Byrne’s inflated breasts.

“It was important to her that this character not be a nag in any way,” Stoller told TheWrap. “Usually the woman in these movies is not that fun. My movies have gone away from that. I’ve made the female characters as funny as the guys.”

As for Efron, he’s been on a mission to erase the Disney stigma and demonstrate his versatility, whether by flirting with Nicole Kidman in “The Paperboy” or palling around with Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan in “That Awkward Moment.” Kidman already peed on him in “The Paperboy,” but “Neighbors” takes the raunch to a new level. When an audience member asked him about the transition from Disney star to comedic foil, he gave the following reply, “When you get a call from Seth Rogen, you’re in a good spot.”

http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/neighbors-review-sxsw-2014/,entertainment,"Based on the merits of being a “How To” guide for aspiring parents, Neighbors is a one star movie about two adults selfishly putting their own insecurities before the well-being of their newborn baby. We’re talking some gratuitously debaucherous middle-aged partying including magic mushrooms, sword fighting, shot ripping, and every other fraternal stereotype possible. Wildly inappropriate, of course, but with Nicholas Stoller’s outlandish direction, Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien watch their screenplay turn into a riotous Greek life comedy that’ll make you question every responsible decision you made throughout your college career. Stoller himself admitted that only one member of his production team actually lived a fraternity life in college, so you can imagine the generalizations and stereotypes blown wildly out of proportion, but it’s all in the name of comedy – and the most epic rager that frat life could possibly imagine.

Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are new parents enjoying their more modest suburban lifestyle, embracing early nights and child care instead of raves and late night diner trips. Their life is your simple blue-collar affair, and their neighborhood equatable to Anywhere, USA – until a fraternity moves in next door. Led by President Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and his Vice President Pete (Dave Franco), this is your Animal House style fraternity with the dial cranked even higher, as it’s Teddy’s mission to earn his rightful place on the frat’s Hall of Fame board, along with the supposed inventors of the Toga Party and every college kid’s best friend, the Boot and Rally. This doesn’t bode well for the Radner’s humble lifestyle, so they decide to fight back. Can Mac and Kelly party hard enough to infiltrate the frat and get them evicted? If there’s one brotherhood you should avoid starting a war with, it’s an immature, vengeful frat – something that the Radners are about to find out.

Graduating from High School Musical heartthrob to full-blown college douche, Zac Efron was meant to play the testosterone-charged frat superhero Teddy Sanders. Efron has never been funnier, and getting away from his “good guy” persona creates a completely embellished caricature that’s entirely too much fun to ignore, pairing nicely with his second-in-command played by Dave Franco – another young actor who pops his collar and leaves us in stitches. The chemistry between these two is highlighted by a scene I can only dream was improvised on set, recording Teddy and Pete’s genius reinventions of the phrase “bros before hos” – only to have Pete heartbroken later when Teddy doesn’t acknowledge the “bropology” that took place, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT RHYMED! Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael round out our alpha dogs, one a certifiable porn star and the other a hopeless pothead, but it’s Teddy and Pete who ultimately win us over through wicked epicness – that’s what the kids say these days, right?

As for Rogen and Byrne – where do I start? Again, for any aspiring parents at home, you’ll have to understand the fact that Neighbors is meant to be nothing but drunken fun, and it succeeds mightily. The Radners leave their child at home for an entire night full of fraternity partying, and get sufficiently intoxicated, but everything is alright because Rose has her baby monitor. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME – but please witness the utter hilarity that our bored couple creates.

Neighbors is essentially pornography for adults who fantasize about reliving their glory years, now unable to slug Jager and take two story bong rips, as those viewers can live vicariously through Rogen and Byrne – a comedic dream couple. Whether it’s Rogen dancing his ass off while wearing a goofy gansta’ hat or Byrne turning from innocent housewife into manipulative female she-demon, these two talents riff off one another with perfect comedic ease, again aiding Stoller’s admittedly overplayed mentality. Oh, and Byrne – please stick to only horror and comedy from here on out. Please?!

As for the party-hearty shenanigans throughout Neighbors, Stoller and company create every college boy’s fantasy while also somehow addressing fears that come along with leaving college – albeit nothing but surface recognition. You’re here to laugh, and watching Rogen attempt to keep up with Efron delivers “first pot brownie” hilarity. Blacklights, kegs, drugs, sorority girls, bro bonding, tank tops, Robert De Niro themed parties – Neighbors goes for broke and succeeds in creating one of the funniest fraternal comedies since Animal House – the Holy Grail of college humor. Stoller’s complete disregard for reality is his greatest weapon, subduing audiences with masculine hugs and spot on sight gags that again live in some fantasy world where airbags can hide in chairs, launching unknowing victims into crumbly tile ceilings. Nothing will make you miss college more until you realize your college life was nothing like Teddy’s – and then you’ll just want to pull an Old School.

Neighbors is like walking into a frat party and witnessing a game of beer pong between Willie Nelson, Kenny Powers, and the Coors Light commercial twins – it’s probably just a hallucinogenic tease brought on by some “party favors” you popped earlier, but for the time being, it’s nothing but pure, entertaining bliss. Attacking “bro” culture with the energy of a ‘roided out grizzly bear, Stoller pushes comedy farther than he’s ever attempted, an easy achievement with such a star-studded comedic cast. Efron is a pastel plastered revelation, and has honestly never been funnier – the same goes for Byrne, minus the abs and plus a maternal surprise. Sure, there’s a paper-thin story that doesn’t really strike the serious notes of maturing, growing older, and accepting a more “normal” life – but with non-stop laughs and gut-busting highlights, Neighbors is a death cup victory on Team Stoller’s first pong shots.",

http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/03/neighbors-sxsw-premiere-recap,entertainment,"""Who here is a little bit drunk?""

And to that question, damn near everyone in attendance at last night's Neighbors world premiere screening at the SXSW Film Festival broke out in thunderous applause. And we're talking upwards of 1,000 rowdy cinephiles, too, being that Neighbors was unveiled at Austin's Paramount Theatre, a 1,100-seat venue that resembles one of those old-school opera houses, complete with side balconies and an upper seating level.

The man asking the question: director Nicholas Stoller, getting the crowd hyped up for his new movie's first-ever screening. Stoller's back at SXSW after the successful 2008 premiere of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his directorial debut prefacing Get Him to the Greek. Where Sarah Marshall was a raucous but often tender look at failed love and loneliness, Neighbors is a totally different beast. Foul-mouthed, kinetic, and lean (clocking in at a just-right 95 minutes), it's consistently hilarious—come May 9, when Neighbors officially opens theatrically, it will be the funniest movie a major Hollywood studio (in this case, Universal Pictures) will have released since 2012's Jump Street.

There was hardly a quiet moment throughout the screening, due in large part to the film's loaded cast, all of whom are on the entire time. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Mac and Kelly Rdner, a happily married couple trying to keep the flame going despite the fact that they're raising an infant girl, Stella (a natural born scene-stealer if there ever was one). To complicate their domestic life, Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity made up of mostly dim-witted meatheads, moves into the house next door, turning Teddy and Kelly's neighborhood into a 24/7 reenactment of National Lampoon's Animal House. Led by president Teddy (Zac Efron) and his VP, Pete (Dave Franco), the frat dudes go to the extremes of partying—at one point, they turn their entire home into a ""hotbox house,"" which, yes, is close what it sounds like, only much more set-design ambitious. It doesn't help Mac's situation that Teddy's beyond ripped, with arms that, as Mac puts it, look like ""two big veiny dicks.""

POST CONTINUES BELOW

Neighbors is, for the most part, a tightly connected series of sight gags and profane one-liners, but unlike most Hollywood comedies, very few of the film's jokes miss. It'd be too obvious to single out Rogen's performance, even though he hasn't been this funny on-screen since Knocked Up. An ensemble piece, Neighbors features two unexpected MVP performances from Dave Franco and Rose Byrne. Franco, playing off of the similarly impressive against-type Efron, gets just as many strong punch-lines as Rogen, while Byrne never lets the dominant comedic force who's playing her fictional other-half overshadow her. In fact, she got the premiere's biggest round of applause, coming after a set-piece in which Mac and Kelly strategically turn Teddy and Pete against each other by challenging the old ""bros before hoes"" conceit.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

Byrne's big moment happens in the midst of one of the film's many frat house raves, all of which radiate with flashing neon lights, energetic handheld camerawork, and unruly close-ups and camera angles. During the post-screening Q&A, for which the entire cast minus Rose Byrne participated, Stoller cited the 2009 French head-trip film Enter the Void as a ""visual touchstone"" used by he and director of photography Brandon Trost for the Neighbors party scenes, and it shows.

Not that Stoller or any of his cast were able to bring any personal experiences to those sequences, though. While introducing the film, Stoller dedicated it to producer James Weaver, the only person involved with Neighbors who was ever in a fraternity. ""The rest of us,"" said Stoller, ""were Jews and child stars. Thank you, James, for explaining to me what an elephant walk is.""

POST CONTINUES BELOW

Once the movie ended, Stoller hopped back on stage along with the entire cast. Unsurprisingly, that's when Seth Rogen took over the proceedings. The first question came from one rather enthusiastic audience member, a guy who stepped into one of the aisles to make sure Rogen and company could clearly see him. ""That was one of the best movies I've ever seen,"" he said, spending a solid 60 seconds repeating that sentiment with different phrasings. At his final ""best movie ever"" exclamation, Rogen didn't waste a second. ""I'm gonna fuck the shit out of that guy! The second this is over!""

The only time one of Rogen's responses earned a larger outburst of clapping than that? When another audience member cited a bit in Neighbors where Rogen and Efron's characters, both excessively drunk and high, discuss their personal favorite Batmans—the older Mac prefers Michael Keaton and the much younger Teddy likes Christian Bale. The question for Rogen was, simply, ""Who's Batman to you?"" Showing love to Keaton, he asked the crowd, ""Who here like the George Clooney Batman? Absolutely no one.""

The Q&A as a whole, not unlike Neighbors itself, maintained that kind of random humor. Barely any of the audience's questions pertained directly to the movie. One obnoxious guy, for shame, asked the cast and crew if they'd take an ""epic selfie"" like Ellen Degeneres' at the Academy Awards—fortunately, Rogen quickly shot that request down.

POST CONTINUES BELOW

The last question of the night: ""Will there be a sequel?""

""No,"" said Rogen. ""First this one needs to make money, and none of you paid to be here, as far as I know.""

""So, basically,"" continued Stoller, ""it hasn't made any money yet.""

He's certainly got more than a few adoring fans in Texas.

And they turned out to greet Zac Efron when he arrived at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Saturday.

The star was travelling to Austin for the world premiere of his comedy Bad Neighbors at the South By Southwest Film Conference And Festival, better known as SXSW.

Grabbing the attention: Zac Effron was mobbed by fans when he arrived at the airport in Austin, Texas, for the premiere of Bad Neighbors at SXSW

Say cheese! The 26-year-old smiled happily for one lucky fan who got a selfie with him

Fan favourite: Zac was greeted by a throng of adoring fans at the Texas airport

Also making the trek separately from Los Angeles were co-stars Seth Rogen and Dave Franco, who didn't get quite the same warm welcome.

Zac, 26, chose comfort over style for the flight, wearing a dark grey wool bomber jacket over a light grey T-shirt and well-worn jeans paired with brown shoes.



The That Awkward Moment star pulled a black beanie over his head and smiled broadly at fans who had gathered outside the airport to see him.

Write stuff: Seth Rogen didn't appear to get the same warm welcome as Zac but he must have got some love from fans as he was carrying a pen ready to sign autographs

It's not so bad: The 31-year-old actor looked surprised as he was handed a pen as he walked across the concourse



Film premiere: Zac, Seth and Dave teamed up at the premiere of Neighbors at the film festival

Fun role: Zac has a starring role in the comedy about a couple with a newborn who move next to a fraternity house

Fans galore: Zac posed for selfies with his fans at the premiere

The actor put his arm around one lucky girl as she reached up with her cell phone to take a picture as he walked along.

Seth Rogen also opted for casual clothing for the trip. The 31-year-old donned a black sweater over a grey T-shirt and light grey jeans. His flat cap added a splash of colour to his outfit and he slung a rucksack on his back.

The star must have got some love from fans at the airport as he appeared to be carrying a pen.

Cool and casual: Dave Franco rocked a black leather jacket, white T-shirt and dark blue jeans as he arrived at the airport in Austin

Before and after: The 28-year-old, pictured left at LAX, looked happy to have the flight behind him when he arrived in Texas



Meanwhile, a smiling Dave Franco, 28, arrived at Austin in a cool black leather jacket, white T-shirt, dark blue jeans and black boots.



Just a few hours later Zac, Dave and Christopher Mintz-Plasse sat down for an SXSW interview.



Zac posted an Instagram snap of the event with the message, 'Nothing better than a little @NeighborsMovie in the morning. #SXSW Press with #DaveFranco and @mintzplasse! - #TeamZE'



Fielding questions: Zac participated in a panel with his co-stars

Good times: Bad Neigbors director Nicholas Stoller joined Seth and Zac on the panel

Funny guys: Nicholas, Seth, Zac, Christopher and Dave enjoyed a laugh at the panel

Straight down to work: Zac posted this Instagram snap of him and Bad Neighbors co-stars Dave and Christopher Mintz-Plasse taking part in an SXSW interview on Saturday

In Bad Neighbors, directed by Nicholas Stoller, Seth and Rose Burn play a couple with a baby who are forced to live next to a noisy fraternity house, which brings them into conflict with Zac's character.



The movie, titled Neighbors for SXSW, is set to play at the festival today before a general release in the US on May 9.



SXSW, which runs until next Friday, has become an increasingly important showcase for studios to roll out films. Last year, nearly 75,000 people converged on Austin for the film festival, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Keeping it low-key: Things were a lot quieter when the heartthrob left Los Angeles International Airport

http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-neighbors-1201128376/,entertainment,"Lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid than anything its director Nicholas Stoller and star Seth Rogen have ever been involved with before, frat comedy “Neighbors” boasts an almost oppressive volume of outrageous gags, and provided that audiences don’t mind the lack of anything resembling a coherent story arc, its commercial potential ought to be enormous. Presented as a work-in-progress at SXSW (though aside from missing credits and a few continuity quirks, it appears largely finished), “Neighbors” is an unchecked riot that should go a long way toward selling antagonist Zac Efron as a credible adult actor, though as with anything involving the Greek system, a bit more moderation from the start might have prevented a few headaches afterward.

Rogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, a young married couple whose infant daughter has prompted a move into the suburbs. Aside from the disruption to their sex and social lives — their efforts to organize “baby’s first rave” notwithstanding — the couple seem to be managing the transition to parenthood well, until the property next door is taken over by the Delta Psi Beta fraternity, led by peacocking president Teddy (Efron) and his brainy, just barely sublimated love interest, Pete (Dave Franco).

The frat’s arrival forces Mac and Kelly to confront their own accelerating decline into old fogeydom, as they frantically debate the least-uncool way to deliver the phrase “could you keep it down?” to their new neighbors. The two parties extend some initial olive branches, with Teddy inviting the couple over for some magic mushrooms and Mac strenuously attempting to use the word “trill” in conversation, but when Mac and Kelly finally call the cops on one of the frat’s weeknight ragers, the two houses declare all-out war.

While the film’s first 15 or so minutes bear a notable resemblance to Stoller’s shaggier, more amiable previous efforts like “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “The Five-Year Engagement,” at this point the director allows chaos to reign supreme, with the pic quickly turning into “Revenge of the Nerds” by way of “Spring Breakers.” Mac and Kelly’s meeting with the university dean (Lisa Kudrow) reveals that the frat has only two disciplinary strikes left before it will be disbanded, and the couple instigates an elaborate campaign of sabotage, with Delta house responding in kind.

There’s little here that makes much sense from a narrative standpoint — indeed, Rogen’s 2013 hit, “This Is the End,” might as well be Bergman by comparison — yet only occasionally does it matter. Subplots involving Mac and Kelly’s best buddy (Ike Barinholtz) appear to be missing key establishing scenes. At times the film abandons all pretense of sketching a real dramatic arc altogether, simply lining up one outlandish, frenzied setpiece after another. And at the end of the day, there’s no real reason for Efron and Rogen to stage an epic kung fu battle using plaster casts of the Delta house members’ members. But sticklers will be few and far between.

Relegated to middling girlfriend roles for far too long, Byrne is here cast as the most foul-mouthed matriarch this side of “August: Osage County,” and she attacks the role with almost maniacal enthusiasm. But it’s the eternally shirtless ex-teen idol Efron, surprisingly, who delivers the film’s most intriguing performance, crafting a dime-turning combination of brotherly earnestness and Mephistophelean sadism that will ring true to anyone who ever found themselves on the losing end of a wooden paddle.

In some of the film’s best scenes, particularly a hysterical coda outside an Abercrombie & Fitch store, Rogen and Efron’s characters seem less nemeses than distorted reflections of one another. (On some level, Teddy seems to realize it’s only a matter of years before he’ll find himself on the other side of the fence, tormented by a jerk exactly like himself.) It might have been interesting to see a somewhat deeper, more Apatovian take on this theme, though “deeper” is not a direction the film ever seems interested in navigating.

There are a number of missed marks, however. A gag about infant HIV really needs to be funnier than this one is to justify its existence, while a woefully pointless breast-pump fiasco sequence feels almost cynically engineered just to give the film a “Bridesmaids”-style bodily function conversation-starter. (It may as well have been referred to in the script as “that scene.”) It’s an unnecessary but unsurprising move for a movie that values volume over consistency.

Technically speaking, the pic is much better shot and edited than a college comedy really needs to be, with the frequent party scenes in particular taking on an almost surrealistic timbre.",

Zac Efron.



I can hear you bitching and moaning already. Save it. Efron uses every tool in his box to keep up with (and often ahead of) a fast-and-filthy talking Seth Rogen as Neighbors works up a disgustingly funny lather. The raunchy rival comedy held a work-in-progress screening at the Paramount Theater during Neighbors opens this summer.



Stoller brought Forgetting Sarah Marshall to this fest back in 2008, and called that screening ""the best"" of his career. This one might top it. The Paramount crowd roared as Rogen and Rose Byrne stepped into the roles of new parents Mac and Kelly Radnor, suburbanites worried that their newborn baby girl (played by a ridiculously adorable and expressive infant) will drag them kicking and screaming into adulthood. As if parenting isn’t hard enough, the Radnors must contend with their new neighbors – the men of a local college fraternity led by cocky, manipulative Teddy (Efron).



Neighbors goes beyond the easy Geeks vs. Greeks, recognizing that it has some deeply funny people at its disposal… and those actors already are finding themselves at personal crossroads that come with age. Rogen and Byrne alternate from terrified to jealous as they leer at Efron, Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and the well-endowed frat dudes. (Why Rogen and his crew are obsessed with male genitalia remains beyond me.) But neither group is detestable because Stoller makes all of these characters relatable. Old fogies like myself will want Mac and Kelly to maintain the upper hand over these punk assholes. Byrne might have earned the film’s loudest cheer when a vengeance plan she enacts over Franco and Efron falls into place. But the Greeks get their laughs, as well… as when they sneak air bags into Rogen’s seats (a visual gag that made it into the film’s trailers).



Stoller could trim the run time of Neighbors, as the back-and-forth between the warring parties goes from inspired to childish and more than a bit exhausting. But the film has multiple, huge laughs. It plays extremely well with a crowd who is plugged in to the anarchistic rivalry. But it’s also one of those relentlessly dirty comedies that you’ll watch on cable months after you belly laughed through it with your friends and wonder what, exactly, was so hysterical.

http://www.worldtvpc.com/blog/house-of-cards-comes-to-comcast-xfinity-service/,entertainment,"It is a bit ironic that Netflix while locked in a battle with cable companies for viewers eyeballs, and depending on them for most of their content, are now making money by selling it back to them.

For Comcast subscribers who have resisted the temptation to get a Netflix account, hit shows such as House of Cards can now be watched, although you will need to pay for it through the Xfinity Store.

Comcast have signed a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, who manage international and home video distribution for the hit political series. But the show which convinced many viewers to sign up to a Netflix subscription plan, can now be accessed without joining up.

Comcast are making available the first season one of the political drama series starring Kevin Spacey, and they are not stopping there. They have also revealed that in a seperate deal with Lionsgate, they will be offering another Netflix original, Orange is the New Black in May.

The Xfinity Store is Comcast’s pay-as-you-watch service for streaming content, letting customers buy movies and TV shows and stream them on a number of connected devices.

The deal is important, because it means that Comcast viewers need not miss out on award winning shows that are now not exclusive to Netflix. Although looking deeper into the deal, it is not great value for money. Although exact prices are not yet known, Comcast will probably charge $1.99-$2.99 per episode, whereas Netflix costs $8 per month with unlimited streaming, and access to the second season.

But if it means Comcast can convince viewers to not ‘cut-the-cord‘ then it will be a job well done. House of Cards is also available on Blu-ray and DVD as well as from other online retailers such as Amazon Instant Video.",
http://advanced-television.com/2014/03/11/comcast-boosts-digital-store-with-sony-deal/,entertainment,"Comcast boosts digital store with Sony deal

Comcast is to sell Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (SPHE) titles through its Xfinity On Demand digital store. In the coming weeks, Xfinity TV customers will be able to purchase Sony Pictures movies and TV shows to own and access anytime, anywhere, on any device, often before the DVD release.

Michael Schreiber, Senior Vice President of Content Acquisition at Comcast Cable, described the Sony Pictures library as “a terrific addition” to its rapidly-expanding offering of hit films and TV shows available for purchase, “The response to the digital store has been encouraging and tells us our customers love the flexibility and ease of purchasing content directly from Xfinity On Demand to watch when and where they want it,” he added.

“Sony Pictures is pleased that this agreement brings significant titles to Comcast customers,” said Man Jit Singh, SPHE President. “We deeply value our relationship with Comcast and look forward to working closely with them to meet the needs of all audiences.”

Among the first titles available for purchase will be the multi-Academy Award nominated American Hustle which will be available to own digitally on March 11th.

Additional Sony Pictures movie and TV titles that will be available for purchase in the coming weeks include the critically-acclaimed TV series Breaking Bad, as well as popular movies such as Captain Phillips, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, The Amazing Spiderman and 21 Jump Street.

The Comcast catalogue now includes content from FOX, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros.",
http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/10/5490430/house-of-cards-now-available-to-comcast-subscribers,entertainment,"Comcast customers can now watch House of Cards without a Netflix subscription. Thanks to a new agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, the cable provider is selling season one of the political drama series through its Xfinity Store. Netflix holds exclusive streaming rights for House of Cards, which has become a staple of its original programming lineup. But Sony manages international and home video distribution for the series; the first season was quietly released on Blu-ray and DVD back in June — without any extras or a single piece of bonus content. The first season is also available to purchase digitally from Amazon Instant Video and Vudu, among other retailers. Episodes can be purchased from Comcast individually or as a bundle.

But Comcast's attempt to ride Netflix's coattails doesn't end with House of Cards. The company has also announced that it will be offering Orange is the New Black starting in May. That's possible through a separate distribution deal with Lionsgate. Comcast's Xfinity Store lets customers buy movies and TV shows and watch them across various devices. But videos aren't compatible with UltraViolet, and you risk losing access in certain scenarios if you terminate Comcast service. We'd recommend simply buying a Netflix subscription if you want to watch Netflix shows (especially since streaming speeds on Comcast should be getting better). Comcast's deal with Sony also includes early-release movies for the Xfinity Store, which will give its customers a chance to purchase select films before they reach Blu-ray and DVD.

Update: The article has been updated to mention that House of Cards is already available from other digital retailers.",
http://time.com/19350/netflix-comcast-speed/,entertainment,"Comcast broadband subscribers are already enjoying better Netflix streaming performance just two weeks after the companies struck an agreement to directly connect their networks — and Netflix says even better performance is on the way.

In its latest ISP speed index released Monday, Netflix said that prime-time video streams on Comcast averaged 1.68Mbps in February, up from 1.51Mbps in January, reversing months of steady declines and boosting Comcast’s ranking by two spots on the list. Prior to February, the average performance of Netflix streaming video content delivered to Comcast subscribers declined by more than 25% over the last few months. As recently as October of last year, Netflix was streaming at 2.07Mbps.

As part of the deal — known as a paid-peering or transit agreement — Netflix gained a direct connection to the Comcast’s network, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as third-party intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms. Financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed. The pact was announced on February 23 and the improved connections began several days before that, but the performance increases will take some time before they’re fully felt by all Netflix users with Comcast service.

(MORE: Comcast’s Traffic Pact With Netflix Is Shrouded in Secrecy)

Despite the boost in performance, Comcast remains below the U.S. streaming average of 1.95Mbps, but further improvements are on the way, per Netflix. “We do expect to see Comcast’s performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data as a result of the recent agreement between Netflix and Comcast,” Joris Evers, director of communications at Netflix, wrote in a company blog post.

Google Fiber, the tech giant’s gigabit broadband service, remains by far the fastest U.S. provider of Netflix streaming video, with average performance of 3.74Mbps, according to the company. In the blog post, Netflix called Google Fiber “the guiding North Star for broadband performance in the country.” Google has already launched fiber initiatives in Kansas City, Austin and Provo, and last month announced plans to work with nine more metro areas to expand the service.

Among major U.S. broadband providers, Verizon DSL is the slowest, with average performance of 0.93Mbps. Verizon’s high-speed FiOS service is slightly faster than Comcast at 1.76Mbps, but that service continues to decline in the rankings, as does AT&T U-verse, which clocked in at 1.66 Mbps.

In the wake of Netflix’s deal with Comcast, Verizon and AT&T both acknowledged that they are seeking to reach an agreement with the streaming video service. As high-bandwidth services like Netflix have exploded in popularity, the broadband companies are increasingly seeking compensation in exchange for direct connections to improve performance.

Netflix says its ISP speed index is “based on data from the more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide who view over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix each month. The listed speeds reflect the average performance of all Netflix streams on each ISP’s network and are an indicator of the performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network. A faster network generally means a better picture quality, quicker start times and fewer interruptions.”

This includes Netflix, since the movie and TV show rental and streaming service has created its own successful original programming that you must be a subscriber to watch.

""House of Cards"" is probably its biggest original hit yet, garnering a lot of praise and hype while featuring an A-list actor, Kevin Spacey. But, those who don't have access to a Netflix account have been locked out. Good news for any Comcast customers out there: you can now buy season one on your cable provider's Xfinity store through a deal with Sony.

I know, I know--it's not included just for being a customer like you may have been hoping. But since it won't be airing on any particular channel that you pay for or subscribe to in a package, it's not going to be given away for free.

A one-time purchase may be better for you if you really don't want to pay for a subscription, but it might really be worth it to join Netflix and get access to the next season as well, in addition to their other shows, rather than paying for seasons at a time. Plus, if you ever switch providers, it's more than likely your access to ""House of Cards"" will be no more.

Season one was actually quietly released on DVD and Blu-ray over the summer by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment without much fanfare, and didn't include any features or bonus content. It's also available as a digital download from Amazon Instant Video. Also anounced is that ""Orange is the New Black"" is coming to Comcast customers as well in May.

The cable provider now allows customers to stream the first season of House of Cards from its Xfinity Store, according to a report from Variety. The new partnership comes just weeks after Comcast successfully persuaded Netflix to pay to improve the quality of its service for Comcast subscribers.

House of Cards was one of the first original series produced for and streamed on Netflix in a bulk serving of 13 episodes. The series was paid for in part by Netflix, reportedly to the tune of $100 million, but the price it paid did not cover rights that would prevent it from falling into Comcast's hands.

Media Rights Capital is the studio that made up the rest of the cost of the show, and it's handling distribution through Sony. Currently, House of Cards is also available on DVD, but not on any other streaming services.

Through the Sony deal, Comcast will also get a slew of other movies and TV shows onto Xfinity, including American Hustle and Breaking Bad. For its next trick, Comcast will also make Orange is the New Black appear on Xfinity—but not until May 13.",

House of Cards, the popular Netflix original that snubbed HBO for the Internet video streaming service, will soon be available to Comcast Xfinity subscribers who don’t have a Netflix account. Such is the result of a recent deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, which handles certain elements of the show’s distribution.

The deal applies for the first season of House of Cards, which allows Comcast subscribers to download the show via the relatively new Xfinity Store service on to their set-top box — no Netflix subscription is needed, a perk for those who don’t want to double-down on their video subscriptions.

This joins the show’s availability through VUDU and Amazon, as well, which sells the show out part-and-parcel at about $2 per episode. Those who want to check out the second season will still need Netflix for the time being, though that season will likely also find its way onto the VOD services in due time as well.

Those who enjoy Netflix’s other popular original show “Orange is the New Black” will also be able to enjoy it through Comcast Xfinity starting May 13, which Variety reports is the result of a distribution deal with Lionsgate. Soon other Sony shows will be available through the service, as well, including The Amazing Spider-Man.

At $1.99 an episode, it’s not exactly a steal compared to a monthly Netflix subscription, but it’s another option for fans who want to keep up with Frank Underwood’s exploits on House of Cards.",
http://www.wired.com/business/2014/03/comcast-bites-netflix-snagging-big-show/,entertainment,"House of Cards may have made Netflix's name as a source of must-see original content, but millions of Comcast customers aren't going to need Netflix to watch the show anymore.

In a deal with Sony, Comcast will now sell its subscribers access to the first season of the political drama through its own Xfinity Store, Variety reports. In Hollywood terms, the arrangement might not be anything remarkable – just a new way of syndicating reruns. But cutting Netflix out of the picture for its signature show sends a clear signal that the entertainment and cable industries aren't about to let some Northern California tech company change television without exacting a price.

Thanks to the company's aggressive marketing, House of Cards is known as a Netflix show just as much as The Sopranos was an HBO show. But even the $100 million it reportedly spent didn't buy Netflix all the rights to Frank Underwood's Machiavellian rise. Apparently, that money gave Netflix only the exclusive right to stream two seasons online first, and it didn't even cover the total production costs of the first 26 episodes. The rest of the costs fell on Media Rights Capital, the independent studio that actually made House of Card, and it is free to sell other rights.

To make its money back, the studio has a deal with Sony to handle distribution of House of Cards internationally and for ""home video,"" a term that in the Netflix streaming-video era seems meaningless. In practice, it means Sony gets to sell House of Cards DVDs and other ways for couch surfers to pay a la carte for the show, such as on Amazon Instant Video. That appears to be the kind of agreement Comcast struck with Sony, which also lets the cable provider offer access to Sony movies such as American Hustle ahead of other video-on-demand services.

For Comcast, the movies seem like the meat of the deal, while the House of Cards arrangement is more about sending a message to Netflix and the general public. The rise of Netflix and other streaming services have encouraged the rise of ""cord-cutting,"" which threatens the cable business, and Comcast isn't taking this laying down. Recently, Comcast exercised its own leverage by getting Netflix to pay for more direct access to Comcast's network, and now, the cable giant to making another move with its House of Cards deal, showing that it can cannibalize Netflix's business right back.

Not that a swarm of Comcast customers are about to go out and spend money to watch House of Cards somewhere other than Netflix – or at least they shouldn't. It's not clear how much Comcast plans to charge. But on Amazon, for instance, high-definition episodes are $2.99 a piece, or nearly $39 for the whole season. That's almost as much as five months of Netflix, which also includes season two, as well as Orange Is the New Black, another Netflix hit coming to Comcast soon. But just by making House of Cards an option, Comcast is eating into the brand identity Netflix is trying to establish for itself as the only place to watch ""its"" shows.

Original programming has become crucial to Netflix's business model. By getting House of Cards, Comcast sends a subtle signal to Netflix non-subscribers that maybe they don't need to spend that extra eight dollars a month after all. They might not actually pay Comcast to watch House of Cards either, but just knowing they could get the show there might be enough. On the other hand, if anyone does watch the first season of House of Cards on cable, Netflix still has a powerful advantage: the siren song of season two.",

The deal with Sony is noteworthy because it allows Comcast customers to purchase digital copies of such Oscar-nominated movies as “American Hustle,” and “Captain Phillips” from Comcast’s Xfinity On Demand digital service.

“American Hustle” will be available beginning Tuesday, and “Captain Phillips” and other movies, including “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2,” will be available within a few weeks.

Television titles also are in the mix, including Netflix’s buzzed-about series, “House of Cards,” which is distributed by Sony, and AMC’s “Breaking Bad,” which ended its acclaimed television run last summer. Sony produced “Breaking Bad.”

Filling the shelves of its Xfinity On Demand store, which opened in November, has been one of Comcast’s corporate priorities.

The company has been rolling out upgrades and new services to try to retain cable customers and sign new ones amid increasing competition from telephone companies and digital streaming services.

The nation’s largest cable company last month announced a $45.2-billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable, which will give Comcast more than 30 million cable subscribers and operations in the nation’s largest markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia.

The Xfinity On Demand store offers Comcast customers with an alternative to streaming services such as Amazon.com and Netflix.

With the Sony deal, Comcast will go a step further by offering its customers an opportunity to watch Netflix’s highest-profile original production without signing up for Netflix.

“We launched [the electronic sell-through service] in November and it is growing at a great pace,” Comcast Cable Chief Executive Neil Smit told investors Monday at the Deutsche Bank media conference in Palm Beach, Fla.

ON LOCATION: Where the cameras roll

“We just signed Sony this morning where we will get movies like ‘Captain Phillips’ and back episodes of shows like ‘House of Cards’ and ‘Orange Is the New Black,’” Smit said. “We would like to extend that.”

Comcast has structured deals with most of the major Hollywood studios, including the studio it owns, Universal Pictures, as well as 20th Century Fox and Lionsgate. Last month, Comcast signed a deal with Warner Bros., which gave it the opportunity to sell copies of such films as “Argo” and “Gravity.”

Comcast has not completed deals with Walt Disney Co., Viacom’s Paramount Pictures or MGM.

Copies of the Sony-distributed TV shows will be sold for $1.99 to $2.99 per episode, depending on whether consumers want high-definition or standard-definition formats. The price to buy a digital copy of a movie varies, but typically ranges from $16.99 to $18.99 a movie.

Comcast subscribers will be able to purchase the popular Netflix series through the Xfinity store along with several other Sony titles.

Comcast and Sony have announced a deal that will give Comcast customers access to the first season of 'House of Cards' without a Netflix subscription. While the series remains a streaming exclusive to Netflix, viewers will be able to buy episodes of the show through Comcast's Xfinity store for playback on a variety of devices. The show has also been available for downloadable purchase from several other services like Amazon and Walmart.com.

The deal also grants Comcast the rights to sell several other Sony shows and films through its service, including titles like 'Breaking Bad' and 'Captain Phillips' which will be available in the coming weeks. Likewise, the cable provider will be able to sell and rent many upcoming titles ahead of their regular VOD releases. This includes 'American Hustle' which will be available for rent or purchase starting this Tuesday. In addition, Comcast has signed a separate deal with Lionsgate for the rights to sell another critically acclaimed Netflix series.The first season of 'Orange is the New Black' will be available in the Xfinity store on May 13 (the same date as its Blu-ray release).

Titles purchased through the Xfinity store can be viewed through the Xfinity On Demand service on a customer's set-top box, on a computer through the Xfinity website, or through the company's apps for Android and iOS devices.

Netflix just released the figures for its monthly Internet Service Provider speed and performance update. Comcast didn't crack the top five, placing at 11th.

A two-spot improvement sequentially, but there is still some work cut out for mass media conglomerate.

Readers only casually familiar with Netflix (subscribers or not) might be surprised considering the recent hubbub about the online rental giant and the cable company trying to merge with Time Warner, which ranked fifth on its own.

But don't worry as that's all about to change.

Under the agreement hammered out in February , Netflix will gain direct access to Comcast's broadband network -- an arrangement that could become the model for the first of many to follow for the digital streaming company .

Acknowledging that there wasn't much of a flux in North American ISP index rankings in February, Netflix communications director Joris Evers touted in a blog post on Monday that the company expects to see ""Comcast’s performance improve in the rankings next month"" as a result of the deal.

However, Evers refrained from offering a more specific forecast than that.

For reference, the Netflix ISP Speed Index covers the user experience for more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide and counting. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company asserted that its user base now streams over one billion hours of digital content on a monthly basis.

Evers also noted that Netflix extended its list of domestic ISPs to account for the top 60.

Soon you'll be able to buy season one of Netflix's original show ""House of Cards"" via Comcast cable.

Please don't.

""House of Cards"" will be available for purchase on Comcast within the next 30 days or so, a source with knowledge of the deal told The Huffington Post on Monday. Comcast is charging per episode: $2.99 in HD and $1.99 in standard definition, the source says.

That comes out to $38.87 for the first season in HD and $25.87 for standard definition.

Currently, all of ""House of Cards"" is available for just a $7.99 a month subscription to Netflix. There you can watch it anywhere you have an Internet connection at any time. Watch one episode. Watch all of them. Netflix doesn't care. You can also watch any of the thousands of other TV shows and movies, all for the same price.

""House of Cards"" is currently available to buy on Verizon Fios for the same price as Comcast, and on DVD elsewhere. If you get the feeling that you'd be interested in watching more than one or two episodes of ""House of Cards,"" it makes sense to just subscribe to Netflix for a month.

Of course, Netflix is betting that it will get lots of subscribers by creating original content like ""House of Cards"" that people can't get anywhere else. In fact, Netflix's chief operating officer, Ted Sarandos, has said that the company plans to double its original content this year. When ""House of Cards"" was first released, it was the most-watched show on Netflix. The fourth season of ""Arrested Development,"" which was released only on Netflix, arguably grew Netflix's membership.

Comcast will also get ""Breaking Bad,"" which is available on Netflix, and a bunch of movies, including ""American Hustle,"" ""Captain Phillips"" and "" 21 Jump Street,"" which are not currently on Netflix.",

The cable giant struck a pact with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, giving Comcast rights to sell the Emmy-winning first season of “House of Cards” through the recently launched Xfinity TV Store service. Netflix currently owns exclusive streaming rights to the Media Rights Capital-produced series, while Sony handles international and homevideo distribution.

Comcast’s plan to sell “HoC” season 1 — at $1.99 per episode — seems perplexing, given Netflix’s $7.99 per month price point. But it’s interesting body language from the No. 1 MSO, given Netflix’s desire to reach a deal to have its service embedded into Comcast set-tops. Meanwhile “House of Cards” first season has been available on other EST services, including Amazon and Walmart’s Vudu, also priced at $1.99 per episode for SD and $2.99 each for HD.

In addition, Comcast will add select Sony titles to its early electronic sell-through service, which offers access ahead of the traditional VOD-rental window. The first of these is “American Hustle,” to be available for rent or purchase starting Tuesday, followed by Tom Hanks-starrer “Captain Phillips” in a few weeks.

Other Sony pics and TV shows in the mix — to become available within the coming weeks — include “Breaking Bad,” “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2,” “The Amazing Spider-Man” and “21 Jump Street.”

Meanwhile, anther popular Netflix drama original, “Orange Is the New Black,” will be hitting the Comcast Xfinity Store on May 13, through the operator’s distribution deal with Lionsgate.

Comcast’s deal with Sony was announced by Neil Smit, Comcast Cable president and CEO, at Deutsche Bank’s 2014 Media, Internet and Telecom Conference on Monday.

Comcast launched the Xfinity Store service in November with partners Universal Pictures (owned by Comcast), 20th Century Fox and Lionsgate. Cable operator touted early success of the EST service, noting it was the No. 1 digital sales partner for Universal’s “Despicable Me 2″ for the week ended Dec. 3, according to the studio.

Warner Bros. signed on as a partner for Comcast Xfinity Store two weeks ago, Smit added.

“It’s surprised us how well the product has done,” Smit said. “The value of the product is the currency… It comes out before VOD, and you don’t have to go to a laptop or a smartphone — you can order it right from your TV.”

Comcast’s launch of Xfinity Store follows Verizon’s FiOS Flex View, which has offered movies for purchase and viewable on multiple devices since late 2010.

Comcast subs who buy a TV show or movie from their set-top box or from xfinity.com/store may watch the purchased titles in multiple ways: on TV through Xfinity On Demand; on a computer from the website; or with the Xfinity On Demand Purchases app for iOS and Android.

Comcast, the biggest U.S. cable operator, had 21.7 million video subscribers as of the end of 2013. The MSO last month announced an agreement to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion, a deal currently undergoing regulatory review. Comcast expects to achieve $1.5 billion in synergies by absorbing TW Cable, with 50% of that in the first year.",

There was a recent stir of controversy, as Comcast took a sudden nose-dive in the standings. This came, rather coincidentally, just before Netflix paid up for better service. In fairness, the deal was already in the works during the drop-off, so it was at best a negotiation tactic.

With that mess now in the rear-view mirror, Netflix announces it is expanding the list of ISPs that it plans to track and include on its monthly shame and fame list.

""We expanded the list to provide insight into the performance of many of the smaller providers in the US and to give credit where it is due. For example, Midcontinent, a regional cable provider in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, takes second place in the expanded rankings"", says Joris Evers of Netflix.

The service also took the opportunity to tweak its new cable partner just a bit, stating ""we do expect to see Comcast's performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data"".

The data is culled from more than 44 million Netflix customers worldwide, as the company also tracks ISPs in Mexico and The Netherlands, among other places. It's a bit of a wake-up-call for providers, as Neflix is calling out anyone who isn't living up to standards.

http://consumerist.com/2014/03/10/comcasttwc-netflix-speeds-improve-after-payoff-verizon-still-hasnt-bottomed-out/,entertainment,"After months of slowed-down data speeds for Netflix users on Comcast and Time Warner Cable’s network, speeds rebounded the very same month that Netflix agreed to pay Comcast money for more direct access to its network.

As you can see from the graph above, generated from Netflix’s monthly report, Comcast customers saw a dramatic turnaround in streaming speeds, going from about 1.5 Mbps to 1.7 Mbps.

Though that is still far off from the 2.1 Mbps speeds Comcast users were seeing before their ISP’s numbers started to tank, it is hopefully the beginning of an upward trend. Of course, there wasn’t really much worse Comcast speeds could get.

What’s interesting is that the Netflix deal wasn’t announced until late February, with only a few days left in the month. Had Comcast eased up on congested peering points in expectation of the agreement being finalized?

Likewise, since no paid peering deal with Time Warner Cable has been announced, we have to wonder if the sudden improvement in TWC’s speeds are tied to its proposed merger with Comcast. Granted, TWC’s speed results have been so erratic that it’s possible this uptick is just a matter of someone using the good duct tape to fix a loose connection somewhere.

Meanwhile, Verizon FiOS speeds have sunk from being the best and steadiest of the three providers to substandard levels. Netflix is reportedly in talks with Verizon for a paid-peering deal of some sort, so those numbers will likely improve; it’s just a question of when — and how bad Verizon will allow the connection to get before customers revolt.

For comparison’s sake, here is how these three providers look compared to Google Fiber, the fastest ISP on Netflix’s charts:

This Emmy winning series stars Kevin Spacey as a ruthless Congressman who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, and the best thing about it is that Netflix releases all episodes of the season on one day, so fans can binge for as long as they want. Naturally, Netflix subscribers have to pay for the service, but now Comcast subscribers have another way out. Comcast Cable president and CEO revealed today that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store soon.

From the Xfinity Store, Comcast subscribers will be able to buy access to House of Cards without requiring Netflix. Initially only the first season will be available, and it hasn’t been said when the second season, which came out last month, will be added. Orange is the New Black, another acclaimed Netflix original series, will also make its way to the Xfinity Store, albeit on May 13th.

Xfinity Store is quite similar to Netflix and Amazon Instant, launched last November, it lets Comcast subscribers stream movies and TV shows. Its not known right now how much both original series will cost on Xfinity Store.

http://vator.tv/news/2014-03-10-comcast-users-to-get-netflix-shows-sans-subscription,entertainment,"Comcast confirms that subscribers will now be able to purchase House of Cards in the Xfinity Store

While Netflix has spent the last several years dutifully trying to convince content providers to license TV shows and movies to the subscription video-on-demand service—all while simultaneously developing its own original content to draw in viewers HBO-style—now it looks as though the tables have turned.

Comcast subscribers will soon be able to watch House of Cards via their cable set-top box sans Netflix subscription. That’s according to a report from Variety, which notes that Comcast made a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, thereby giving Comcast the rights to sell the series through its newly launched Xfinity Store.

While Netflix owns exclusive streaming rights to House of Cards, Sony is in charge of international and home distribution.

Comcast also made a deal with Lionsgate that will give it rights to sell Netflix’s other highly acclaimed original series Orange is the New Black in May.

Comcast has confirmed the report, but Netflix could not be reached for comment.

This doesn’t mean that Comcast subscribers can stream Netflix free of additional costs. It’s the digital equivalent of buying the DVD set when it hits the shelves months after the season airs. Non-Netflix users have been able to watch House of Cards since season one was released on DVD last June. It’s also available in other digital stores, such as Amazon Instant Video, Walmart.com, and Verizon Fios.

A Comcast spokesperson says that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store within the next 30 days, and that it will only be the first season of the show. The second season will presumably become available in the Xfinity Store some time around or after it’s made available on DVD.

Previously, Netflix was in discussions with Comcast about the possibility of bringing a Netflix app to Comcast set-top boxes. Those discussions were reportedly put on hold (as were Netflix’s talks with Time Warner about the same thing) when Comcast acquired Time Warner for $45 billion. Meanwhile, Comcast has reportedly been working on a video-on-demand service that could “out-Netflix Netflix.”

Last month, Netflix and Comcast announced a deal in which Netflix will pay for direct access to Comcast’s subscribers. Net neutrality rules are meant to ensure that all digital content companies receive equal access to bandwidth. The problem is that Netflix is a notorious bandwidth hog, so Netflix’s deal with Comcast is not actually paying for prioritization. Rather, Netflix is paying to deliver its content directly to consumers rather than going through middlemen, like Cogent Communications. Essentially, it’s getting a direct route to Comcast Internet subscribers rather than driving on the same crowded freeway with all the other schmucks.",
http://www.techhive.com/article/2106362/comcast-gets-faster-netflix-offers-house-of-cards-without-netflix.html,entertainment,"As expected, Netflix’s deal with Comcast has produced a bump in speeds for the streaming video service.

In February, Netflix streaming speeds averaged 1.68 Mbps on Comcast, compared to 1.51 Mbps in February. It’s not a huge leap, but it’s the first sign of improvement after Netflix began paying Comcast for a direct connection late last month. Netflix said in a blog post that it expects Comcast to move up in the rankings starting next month.

Netflix has become noticeably slower on major Internet service providers, amid escalating disputes over how Netflix’s huge amounts of traffic should be handled. In many cases, Netflix pays third-party transit providers to deliver traffic from their networks to ISPs such as Comcast. Typically, no money changes hands in these “peering” arrangements between transit providers and ISPs, but because Netflix is responsible for so much incoming traffic, ISPs feel they should be paid by Netflix’s transit providers to add more capacity.

Under Netflix’s deal with Comcast, Netflix servers sit in the same data centers that connect to Comcast’s network, effectively cutting out the third-party transit provider. Although Netflix traffic doesn’t get special treatment on the network, the direct connection should still result in better service. (Dan Rayburn at StreamingMedia.com has an detailed explanation of how this works. He also points out that Netflix isn’t paying a new cost, but is simply paying a different provider, so the overall cost to Netflix may be negligible.)

Meanwhile, Netflix’s average speeds continue to decline on Verizon FiOS, Verizon DSL and AT&T DSL, while AT&T U-Verse speeds improved slightly. Both AT&T and Verizon are also seeking payments from Netflix, as Ars Technica points out.

Comcast subscribers can now get the first season of House of Cards through their cable box.

Although Netflix and Comcast now appear to be living in harmony, that’s not stopping Comcast from trying to give Netflix customers a way out. Under a deal with Sony Pictures, Comcast subscribers can soon buy the first season of the hit Netflix series House of Cards through their cable boxes. Another popular Netflix original, Orange is the New Black, will become available to Comcast subscribers in May, Variety reports.

Until now, Netflix has been the only place to watch House of Cards without purchasing the entire first season on DVD. But because Comcast’s deal only covers season one, subscribers will still need a Netflix subscription to see how Frank Underwood’s latest schemes play out. Update: Individual episodes of House of Cards are already available from other sources such as Amazon and iTunes.",
http://www.mediaite.com/tv/you-can-now-watch-house-of-cards-without-netflix-subscription/,entertainment,"Last month, Netflix agreed to pay Comcast for faster access to the cable company’s internet subscribers, allowing users to stream content like the Netflix original series House of Cards at more reliable speeds. How is Comcast repaying them? By licensing the political drama series directly from Sony Pictures so that anyone with Xfinity On Demand cable can watch the show without paying Netflix anything.

So far, Comcast subscribers will only be able to watch season one of House of Cards on demand, but they also have plans to add the first season of Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black on May 13th, through a separate deal with Lionsgate. Season two of House of Cards, which went up on Netflix in its entirety on February 14th can’t be far behind.

While Netflix will still holds the online streaming rights for House of Cards, Sony is in charge of “home video” distribution, which in 2014 means programs like this one with Comcast. The show will be available in the Xfinity Store as soon as Tuesday, March 11th for purchase and can be viewed on traditional television, online or on mobile through the Xfinity app in iOS or Android devices.

UPDATE (2:50pm ET): According to a representative from Comcast, House of Cards season one will not be available in the Xfinity Store for another approximately 30 days. However, the Oscar-nominated film American Hustle, which Comcast also acquired in its deal with Sony, will be available for purchase on demand starting tomorrow, Tuesday, March 11th.

Some may want to stamp Errol Childress with the label of redneck, or hillbilly trash. I fear those crude words cannot capture him. His proper introduction in the finale is a medley of contradictions. He is intelligent and crude at the same time. Beastly and— when it amuses him— urbane.

Let us focus a moment on his voice— or rather, voices. Thomas Harris' own Clarice Starling did everything in her power to lose her West Virginia accent, afraid it would paint her as white trash. Errol dances from voice to voice without apparent effort. While his scars are unfortunate, he has no problems passing as pleasant, humble, and likable in public. He is a chameleon. He chooses to remain where he is, the Yellow King of Carcosa. And that choice makes him horrifying.

Errol is in good company with fictional killers that seek transformation. But the quests of Jame Gumb and Francis Dolarhyde (again, from the works of Thomas Harris) have urgency. They're possessed of a pressing need to complete their task. Childress speaks of his own journey with fondness— almost as an errand he'll get to when he finds the time. Gumb and Dolarhyde were desperate to change, to grow, to be something other. Childress has been working toward his ascension for years, if not decades. He has all the time in the world.

On the state of his house: While his home is cluttered with filth, yes, think about his needs: He has very few. He has a lover who tends to his needs and fears him. His own personal labyrinth is in walking distance. His day job makes him all but invisible, and keeps him close to his prey. He wants for nothing.

Beyond the damage done to him in his formative years, consider the possibility that everything about this creature is a deliberate choice. The state of his house, his sloven appearance. He lives in a veritable sty, but strides through it like royalty. For all intents and purposes, it pleases him to be this. Such low beginnings make his ""ascension"" all the more meaningful.

Our minotaur delivers his last words to his father— a man he has every reason to hate— with dissonant serenity. He leads his prey into his labyrinth where he taunts them with a voice from the depths of hell. He unnerves them with his works. He very nearly kills them both.

Nic Pizzolatto, True Detective creator, says that the success of season 1 has taught him a lesson.

""It's informed exactly one thing,"" he said in an interview with HitFix. ""It's that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don't play the next one straight.""

Season 2 has big shoes to fill. It's a good thing that Pizzolatto already knows what the next season will be about.

""I am still fleshing it out,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""The basic idea: Hard women, bad men, and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system. I was well on my way in the writing but there's been a lot noise and work around the end of the first season that got in the way.""

Season 1's religious themes and undertones might also make an appearance in the show's next season.

""I lived in the rural south in a heavily religious family but the only thing I can point to there is this real sensitivity between knowing and wishing,"" Pizzolatto explained. ""We live in a culture that has a real hard time distinguishing fiction from reality. Even when they're told something is fiction ... and it reflects one of [the] things that fascinates me about our species and our culture ... what we do with stories. I mean, look at people did with this story! It was a nice lesson learned for me. The show is not anti-religion or anti-anything. The show is against not thinking.""

Unfortunately, Detective Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McConaughey, and Detective Marty Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, will not be returning. Michelle Monaghan is also not likely to return.

Season 2 will reportedly feature a new cast and storyline.

""We won't be back for season two,"" McConaughey said last week. ""Season one was finite.""

The story of Cohle and Hart could live on, however, as Pizzolatto has acquired the literary rights to the characters.

""So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out,"" Pizzolatto said. ""Always a possibility.""

True Detective type TV Show Network HBO Genre Crime,

Drama

After eight mystery-starting, meme-generating, McConaissance-confirming episodes, the first season of HBO’s True Detective has finally reached its conclusion. As we approached the end of the saga of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, tensions ran high. Would they finally solve the mystery of the Yellow King? Was last week’s revelation a confirmation of the killer’s identity, or a red herring? Could it be that the whole thing just one of Rust’s acid traps? And of course, the most important question of all: CARCOSA WTF? Well, the season is over. And now we know everything…or at least, as much as we’ll ever know. SPOILERS FROM HERE:

(UPDATE: Click here for our critic Jeff Jensen’s take on the finale.) Did True Detective have a happy ending? That might sounds like a strange description of an hour of television that prominently featured one of the freakier psychopaths to grace the small screen, the final revelation of Carcosa the Terror Temple, a druggy vision of what appeared to be an Event Horizon wormhole to hell, and both protagonists stabbed with various stabby weapons. But given the season of gloom that preceded it, the season finale of True Detective ended on a note of veritable optimism. “Once there was only dark,” said Rust Cohle The Nihilist Anti-hero as a closing line/epitaph. “You ask me, light’s winning.”

It took some time to get there. The boys finally managed to track down Errol Childress the Lawnmower Man. (With a hat tip to Marty: He’s the one who finally connected the whole “green-eared spaghetti monster” description to a new coat of green paint on a house from the old Dora Lange case.) That led Rust and Marty out to Errol’s house, which he shared with his aunt/girlfriend and his decaying dead father.

They chased him into what appeared to be some kind of overgrown ruined temple — or maybe there was some actual infrastructural use for it, in the days before it became a palace of all manner of satanic terror. “This is Carcosa,” intoned Errol. Rust had a vision straight out of a Guillermo Del Toro movie of a cosmic event in the darkness…and then Errol attacked. He stabbed Rust, and would have killed him…if Rust hadn’t used his Nihilist Headbutt Super Attack. That gave Marty enough time to shoot Errol a couple times. At which point Errol threw what appeared to be a tomahawk Marty’s chest. Marty barely survived — but Rust finally put the bad man down, shooting him in the head.

Rust looked halfway dead, and Martin not much better. But shockingly, they both survived. Rust seemed disappointed. They hadn’t tracked down every member of the Tuttle family, after all. “We ain’t gonna get them all,” said Marty. “That ain’t the kind of world it is. But we got ours.” Rust, despondent, explained that he didn’t think he belonged on this world. When he was near-death, he had a vision — of his daughter, his father, his dead loved ones. “It was like I was a part of everything I ever loved,” he said, near tears and then beyond them. Was this whole show about Rust learning to accept his daughter’s death? Learning to be human again? Marty guided him away from the hospital, half-carrying him.

It was a lot to take in — an hour that veered more towards philosophy than final-act thrills (although it had plenty of that, as well.) Check out our TV critic Jeff Jensen’s take on the finale.",
http://observationdeck.io9.com/is-true-detective-the-best-television-show-youve-ever-1541065971,entertainment,"For me, True Detective ticked boxes that no other television show could. The Wire was the closest show that came close to bringing the same amount of depth, and that was a different kind of depth.

Lots of anger was expressed for the ending, but also large praise; from what I've seen, you either loved it or hated it. It's difficult for a show to steal the crown of your favorite show, but I have a hunch that HBO's latest converted many.

http://www.hypable.com/2014/03/10/true-detective-season-finale-recap-the-light-wins/,entertainment,"True Detective’s season finale brought the right amount of closure to one of television’s best new dramas.

During episode 8, which aired Sunday night, Hart and Cohle finally caught up with their scar-faced monster name Errol at his home in the middle of the woods with his lady friend who’s just as messed up as he is.

It wasn’t the first time they’ve seen Errol. Cohle spoke to him ever so briefly back in 1995 when he was mowing a school yard, but missed the clues he needed to connect him at the time because A) he was sitting down – Cohle couldn’t see his height – and B) his face was too dirty for the scars to be noticeable. The fact that Hart was leaning on his horn while Cohle spoke to the man in ’95 didn’t help him focus on the fact that the suspect was right under his nose, either.

During the finale, the two detectives finally catch up with Errol after Hart connects the color of his “ears” in the sketch with the color of a house in a photograph from one of their files. After speaking to the woman who owned the house at the time, they dig into her tax records to find the business who did the paint job. They then make a few more connections and are led to the serial killer’s home.

They head to Errol’s house and try to call the new detectives investigating the case but there’s no cell phone service. Hart goes to the main house to ask for the phone. He’s greeted by Errol’s woman who says they have no phone, so he breaks in. He still has no luck making a call.

Cohle goes to the smaller house, where Errol’s just killed the family dog, and spots his man. A chase leads them deep into Errol’s massive compound, and Cohle gets directions thanks to a voice in his head. “Come die with me, little prince,” he hears.

Cohle enters a final, tall room with a hole at the top letting light in. He starts seeing a vision in the form of a night sky. Errol suddenly comes out and stabs him with a serious blow to the stomach, but Cohle’s still got his physical strength about him and head-butts Errol several times. Hart comes in and shoots him. It doesn’t do the trick, and Errol replies with a hammer to Hart’s chest. Cohle, on the ground, then delivers a bullet to Errol’s head. Moments later, cops arrive at the scene.

We flash forward to the hospital where Hart is being briefed by the ’12 detectives. Several pieces of evidence at the scene were linked to the various murders. Hart’s family comes in for a visit too which brings him to tears.

Cohle is alive, miraculously. He realizes that the man he saw riding the lawnmower in ’95 was his man all along, and he wishes he nabbed more of the people who were at fault (like the Tuttles). Hart reminds him that they got their man, and that’s all that matters.

With a few sweeping shots of locations we’d seen over the season, we jump to Hart – who’s healthy again – wheeling Cohle out of the hospital. The latter has something bothering him: When he was on death’s door, he could feel his father and his daughter with him. The people he loved were close to him. “All I had to do was let go” to see them again. And now? He can still feel his daughter’s love there. “Even more than before. Nothing but that love.”

“Dark has a lot more territory,” Hart says when admiring the night sky at the end of the episode. Cohle disagrees. “Once there was only dark. You ask me, the light’s winning.” The two leave the hospital for hopefully greener pastures.

True Detective’s eight episode season ended with a little bit of peace for both Hart and Cohle. The former was in good spirits as he wheeled his friend out of the hospital, while the latter was thinking on the bright side after feeling the love of his daughter and father beside him for the first time in a long, long while.

... HBO's True Detective looked into the stars last night during its season finale (which I reviewed!) and what looked back was a ton of eyeballs: 3.5 million people tuned in for the first airing, a very good number for a first-season show on HBO. By comparison, just over 3 million tuned in for the Season 1 finale of Game of Thrones, which is now HBO's biggest series. And the 11 million gross average viewers for True Detective's first season makes it the most-watched freshman series for HBO since the 2001 premiere of Six Feet Under. It's unclear how many of those viewers are paid subscribers, though. HBO GO, HBO's on-demand streaming service, broke under the weight of people trying to watch True Detective's finale, and many of those are believed to have been sharing passwords.

The season finale of the Nic Pizzolatto-created anthology series averaged 3.5 million viewers, up 50 percent from the premiere.

Mar 11, 2014

AceShowbiz - More than 3 million people were curious to find out who the killer was on ""True Detective"". The first season finale of the anthology crime drama series drew an average of 3.5 million viewers, up over 50|percent| from the premiere which posted 2.3 million viewers. Across three telecasts on Sunday, March 9, the episode lured a total of 4.9 million viewers.

According to HBO, the show averaged 11 million total viewers over the season across all airings plus DVR and On Demand. It marks the most-watched freshman for the premium cable channel series since ""Six Feet Under"" premiere in 2001 (11.4 million).

Due to high demand for the season finale, HBO GO crashed for a few hours. On Monday morning, HBO released a statement to explain the problem, ""Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of True Detective, HBO GO was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9:00 PM ET last night. The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal.""

In the season finale, %cMatthew McConaughey%'s Rust and %cWoody Harrelson%'s Hart caught the killer and they both survived after a showdown with the bad guy, Errol. Asked why he gave a happy ending for the show, series creator Nic Pizzolatto explained to Entertainment Weekly, ""A few reasons. We're never going to spend time with these guys again. And killing characters on television has become an easy short cut to cathartic emotion.""

He went on elaborating, ""So I thought killing the guys, or having something more mysterious happen to them ... would have been the same thing if the show had gone full-bore into the supernatural... To me, the challenge was to not only let these guys live, but show true character change through this journey. That passing through the eye of the needle in the heart of darkness has actually done something to them.""

""The challenge was to create an emotionally resonant ending that made the journey worthwhile,"" he continued. ""And it felt to me like my proper relationship to the characters should end with me allowing them to walk away into some kind of immortal life outside of this show... We don't know what kind of life they'll have. But I think we can be sure that each man is more willing to acknowledge the presence of grace... They are not healed, but now, for the first time, you can imagine a future where they are healed. And before that was never a possibility for Cohle and hardly a possibility for Hart. But now it's a real earned possibility.""

To HitFix, Pizzolatto said, ""This is a story that began with its ending in mind, that Cohle would be articulating, without sentimentality or illusion, an actual kind of optimism. That line, you ask me, the light's winning, that was one of the key pieces of dialogue that existed at the very beginning of the series' conception.""

HBO has not officially announced a second season for the anthology series, but Pizzolatto has begun working on the story. ""I am still fleshing it out,"" he shared. ""The basic idea: Hard women, bad men, and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system. I was well on my way in the writing but there's been a lot noise and work around the end of the first season that got in the way.""",

http://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/true-detective-review-form-and-void-season-1-episode-8/,entertainment,"It is hard to recall the last time a television series has gripped the cultural consciousness so quickly, spawning memes, a sprawling amount of Internet speculation and commentary, as well as divisive conversations about gender roles on television (check out Emily Nussbaum’s harsh, but terrific piece in The New Yorker for more on that) as much as True Detective has. At that rate, a season finale that was anything less than the finest 60 minutes of television would be doomed to succeed. Alas, the last of eight episodes from Nic Pizzolatto’s first anthology is a solid, but not quite shattering hour of television. Nevertheless, it is filled with the key elements that any True Detective viewer would hope for: strong acting, haunting music and art direction, sublime camerawork, unbearable suspense and a smattering of dark humour.

Since its start, True Detective has done so much to thwart our expectations of what a crime series can be that the rather conventional ending is bound to disappoint just about everybody. But, even if the episode does not fulfill the lofty hopes of its fans, I cannot imagine any Killing-like rage directed at HBO for failing to tie up some loose ends. One must remember that these eight episodes have always been more about uncovering the truth behind Hart and Cohle, rather than the suspect of Dora Lange’s murder. As a conclusion to suit the show’s character-driven nature, it was deeply satisfying.

The foreboding figure at the end of episode seven is Errol William Childress. He has burns in his back, scars on his face and a beer belly. He lives in a shackled home in the middle of the lurid Louisiana wasteland with his bedraggled aunt/lover (played by Ann Dowd) and his dead father. Glenn Fleshler, who plays Errol, is tense and terrific, able to show menace and vulnerability in a single glance during a scene when he peeps on some children at play during recess.

The first anti-climax that True Detective reaches in this hour is the brisk amount of time it takes Hart and Cohle to realize his identity. In a colourful drawing shown of Childress last week, the “spaghetti monster” had green ears. Well, in one of the case files connected to the Dora Lange case, one of the homes that was investigated was freshly painted green. One quick interview and a couple of web searches later, our detectives have an address. It may have been more gratifying for the duo to figure out his identity through a more labyrinthine process, but at least give Pizzolatto credit for, somewhat unpredictably, making Hart the one who connects the dots together.

However, as flat and formulaic as some of this procedural becomes, it all leads up to another tour de force sequence directed by the great Cary Joji Fukunaga that is almost as remarkable as that tracking shot from episode four. (Fans of the show should check out Fukunaga’s breathtaking debut feature, Sin Nombre, if they haven’t already.) Few sequences in small-screen memory have such a visceral atmosphere. We can almost feel the chill of the graveyard-like entrance, as barren, dry trees loom over the road. We can smell the foul stench that Marty breathes in as he moves deeper into Childress’s home.",

The show stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson and had the second highest premiere rating for an HBO show with 2.3 million viewers, following ""Boardwalk Empire"" with 4.8 million viewers in 2010.",
http://www.elle.com/news/culture/female-sexuality-on-true-detective,entertainment,"In some ways, True Detective is a great love story. Much like Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale on The Wire, Rust (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty (Woody Harrelson) find in each other an adversary, a counterpoint, and a literal, and figurative, partner in crime. ""You're obsessive,"" Marty informs Rust. ""You're obsessive, too,"" Rust retorts, ""just not about the job."" Marty's obsession, of course, is women other than the mother of his children, Maggie (Michelle Monaghan). At the beginning of True Detective, we are introduced to Marty's first mistress, Lisa (Alexis Daddario), a court reporter who, as Rust later observes, pretty much looks like a younger, bustier version of Mrs. Hart.

As critics have argued all over the 'net, True Detective is either infuriatingly, brutishly misogynistic (The New Yorker) or purposefully misogynistic, and therefore, thoughtfully dismissive of its female characters (Slate). Regardless of intention, creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Fukunaga have made a blanket statement regarding their purview on female sexuality. And it's pretty judgmental. A woman seeking sex is playing with fire. Over the course of the show's blistering eight episodes, we see a a variety of sexual situations, but none that resemble a realistically intimate moment. On True Detective, a woman who succumbs to sexual advances (or seeks physical satisfaction) is asking for humiliation, dismissal, or emotional ruin. If she wasn't asking for it, the show seems to suggest, she shouldn't have worn such a short skirt.

Whether we're privy to a spectacularly nubile young woman throwing herself at the paunchy, married Marty or a mentally disturbed woman begging her own deranged half-brother to ""make flowers"" on her, the women of True Detective have a uniformly peculiar relationship with the opposite sex. Even Maggie—who, based on her interactions with Detectives Gilbough and Papania has enough agency to withhold information, use deductive reasoning, and even drop the occasional feminist pronouncement regarding the uniform idiocy of men—falls victim to a familiar male gaze sex trope. After she's all but gotten a confession out of her philandering husband, Marty begins to whimper about being ""all fucked up."" Sure, he's cheated on her, several times and with sociopathic abandon, but he's also seen things on the job that he simply can't forget. Fucked up things. He's having a hard time reconciling his professional life and his work life. He's just, hell, he's just having a really hard time, Maggie! She can see the hurt in his eyes, and the evidence of too many long nights on the underarms of his threadbare wife beater, and feels compelled to soothe his pain with a flurry of passionate kisses. What about this scenario screams sympathy sex? Am I missing something?

Photo: HBO/Lacey Terrell

Then, there's Maggie's tryst with Rust. After making eyes at each other all season, Rust, who seems to appreciate and value Maggie's intelligence and sophistication, violently takes her from behind in perhaps the heartbreakingest seven seconds of TV sex. It was an especially gutting moment because, despite his erratic behavior and willingness to cover up for Marty's indiscretions, we think Rust is a good guy. We see him turn down advancements from drug-addled prostitutes; he drinks to drown out the memory of his slain daughter; and when he engages Maggie in conversation, it feels like her adores her. Until he degrades her. And then accuses her of Black Widow-ing her way between him and his partner. She's scarcely pulled up her underwear before she is cast out of his apartment like a leper. ""Get the fuck out of here!"" he bellows, any hint of tenderness and longing drained from his red-rimmed eyes. Et tu, Rust?

Related: Why Changing Your Hair Makes You a Sundance Cliché

""I like something wild. I always did,"" Marty tells Rust of his penchant for ""crazy"" women. ""Feels like it smoothes out the other parts of my life."" I'm sorry, but we're supposed to believe that an over-the-hill cop is a magnet for insanely gorgeous but totally unstable women? That, in the back country of Louisianna, there exists an enclave of job-holding psychowhores, who simply cannot resist Marty's butter blonde mop and Jameson breath? ""You're a good man,"" Lisa, a former teen prostitute who now works at a local T-mobile store, impresses upon Marty. He and his badge had, after all, come to her bunny ranch looking for a missing girl. Between swigs from a pony neck beer, he tries on a look of chagrined humility for size. Bingo. She becomes obsessed and sooon starts sending scantily-clad selfies and begging her married lover to ""put it in her ass."" Again, Where do these women get this stuff?

Photo: HBO/Lacey Terrell

The icing on the cake is Marty's own teenage daughter, Audrey (Erin Moriarty) who gets busted trying to attempt a threesome with two of the ugliest, strung out dudes south of the Mason-Dixon. Upon discovering what she's done, Marty slaps her and calls her a ""whore."" Whether the irony that his daughter is precisely the kind of woman he's been sleeping with is lost on him or suddenly glaringly obvious, all I could think was, She wanted to have a threesome with those guys? For real? In what world are these women falling victim to these men? What kind of dog-eared, graphic novel served as Pizzolatto and Fukunaga's sex ed primer? Despite their varying lots in life—incest-friendly love interest of a child murderer, suburban housewife, reformed sex worker, attention seeking high schooler—there's really only one type of woman on True Detective: the blow-up doll.

(Spoiler alert: If you are not up to date on “True Detective,” skip to the next item.)

“True Detective” had been the best new series of the year so far, a bizarre and engrossing tale that took the framework of a highly conventional police drama and overlaid it with flowery speech and philosophical ideas, most of them coming from Matthew McConaughey’s character, Rust Cohle, a person so badly damaged psychologically as to be almost non-functional.

The storytelling used parallel time tracks and unreliable narration to give the story extra layers of mystery. It was baffling and sometimes hard to follow, but it was always intriguing.

But it came in the guise of a police-buddy drama we had seen 1,000 times before. Cohle’s partner, Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), was a hard-working, philandering, family-ignoring homicide detective. Cohle and Hart were the mavericks, bucking the chain of command for ultimately noble causes. They tracked down a serial killer and – of course – found the trail leading through “respectable” society.

We assumed, all along, that at some point the archetype would be shattered in a new and clever way. Instead, we found Sunday that it was our assumptions that would be shattered, and convention would triumph because the show didn’t really know how it wanted to end.

Bad guy Errol Childress – there was no last twist – seemed almost laughably absurd and certainly not the sort of villain one expected at the end of the twisted road we had traveled. Worse, the post-climax sequence brought a happy ending and a rescued Rust, a transformation that seemed to come out of the blue.

The story of Cohle and Hart is over and McConaughey and Harrelson have moved on to other projects, but HBO may bring “True Detective” back next year, with a different cast and story altogether. Let’s hope creator Nic Pizzolatto thinks that one all the way through to the end.

YOUR ‘MOTHER’ SHOULD KNOW

The ending of another series, “How I Met Your Mother,” has been stirring up the fans before it even has happened.

The March 3 episode appeared to confirm a long-held but faintly embraced hypothesis about the Mother of the title: She’s dead.

The conceit of this mild-mannered sitcom is that the show takes place in 2030, and Josh Radnor’s character, Ted, is recalling the events of today for his children, explaining to them the torturously long process of how he met their mother. Some fans have speculated that the reason Ted is telling the story is because the mother recently died or is dying.

Like most such theories, it is internally consistent but doesn’t make a lot of sense in context. Why would such a light-hearted comedy spend nine years getting to the point of introducing Ted to the mother – whose name we still don’t know – just to reveal that she’s dead? In the all-time ranking of bad sitcom ideas, that would go near the top, somewhere between “My Mother the Car” and letting Joanie and Chachi have their own show.

Cristin Milioti, who plays the mother, poured a big pitcher of ice water on the notion, bluntly telling the Hollywood Reporter, “That’s crazy.”

Any show that has been telegraphing a surprise ending for nine seasons is bound to generate some theories about its finish. We’ve also heard that Ted is the one who is dead/dying, that there will be some switcheroo with the identity of the mother (it’s really Robin!) or that there is some other major twist regarding the veracity of Ted’s storytelling.

Most likely, though, is that Ted’s longing has to do with being separated from the Mother somehow, and she will return to him in the next-to-last scene, right before they meet for the first time on that train platform, in the rain.

In an interview with EW, Pizzolatto delves into the many themes and characterizations of season 1, but did offer this new insight into next season with this tagline:

The basic idea: Hard women, bad men, and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system.

Unless he’s kidding, though I’ve yet to see him kid around too much in his interviews, there’s our first glimpse of the future. The tagline’s inclusion of the word “women” is probably no accident and in direct response to some of the charges of sexism the first season 2 received – fairly or unfairly – and occult is certainly to be expected, but “transportation system”?

http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/true-detective-finale-crashes-hbo-go/,entertainment,"The demand for tonight’s season finale of HBO‘s True Detective was so great online, the network’s streaming service HBO GO temporarily crashed trying to fulfill all incoming requests for the closing episode. “Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for # TrueDetective, we’ve been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon,” HBO GO tweeted earlier tonight. Service was eventually restored. The disruption reaffirms True Detective‘s status as a pop culture phenomenon, which it has been able to achieve in only eight episodes. It also underlines how inherently irrelevant traditional overnight ratings are with that so many HBO subscribers preferring to watch online, they overwhelmed the network’s server. Of course, the streaming difficulties could have prompted True Detective fans who had no intention of watching the show on TV to do so, bringing extra viewers for the finale’s Nielsen ratings. While the first season of True Detective was conceived as a closed-ended arc with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, creator Nic Pizzolatto is already working on a premise for a second season with new characters and a new storyline in a new locale.

“Detective” added more than 1 million viewers from last week, when it went up against the Oscars and drew 2.33 million. Across the night’s three telecasts, the series also hit a high with 4.9 million viewers.

According to HBO, with an average gross audience of 11 million viewers, “True Detective” is the network’s most popular first-year series since “Six Feet Under,” which was drawing about 11.4 million viewers per episode in its 2001 premiere season.

Sunday’s tally is impressive considering the tough live drama competition “True Detective” faced at 9 p.m. from AMC’s “The Walking Dead” and ABC’s “Resurrection,” which opened very well.

“True Detective” bowed on Jan. 12 with 2.3 million viewers for its 9 p.m. telecast, making it the premium cabler’s most-watched debut since “Boardwalk Empire” drew 4.8 million in 2010. Among the shows that “True Detective” outperformed in its premiere are dramas “Game of Thrones” (2.22 million) and “The Newsroom” (2.14 million) and comedies “Veep” (1.38 million) and “Girls” (870,000).

HBO has already renewed “True Detective” for a second season.",
http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/true-detective/233676/true-detective-director-promises-to-keep-it-strange-in-season-2,entertainment,"True Detective ended last night but I’m not shutting up about it just yet. There will be a True Detective season 2 and I’m already jonesing for it. I keep looking over old trailers and teasers and getting ready to compare the unfinished versions I got against the ones I can watch on HBO Go.

The true detectives got their perp. They didn’t get everyone, but they repaid their debt. That was some sick sick shit they were dealing with and now that it’s over, what’s next and how are they going to top what they’ve given us already? True Detective’s creator Nic Pizzolatto has been throwing down hints. And one is that he’s got to keep pumping out the weird. He’s good with weird. He says “my wife read a comment the other day that said I live out in the desert, and I run some kind of cult. He says all the talk on the net ""informed exactly one thing. It's that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don't play the next one straight.""

He’s right. It was the supernatural suspense that kept me coming back hungry for a little of Carcosa’s time. Pizzolatto says “I'm interested in the atmosphere of cosmic horror, but that's about all I have to say about weird fiction. I did feel the perception was tilted more towards weird fiction than perhaps it should have been. “

True Detective's lead actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey aren’t coming back. Their commitment and easy rapport is going to be hard to replace. Pizzolato says his stories are usually heavy on the female characters and that next season is going to be about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.” The transportation system has an occult history? Did they put the Mass in Mass Transit?

I can see Pizzolatto pouring over old train manuals, finding the symbolic significance of the third rail. The way he referenced Robert W. Chambers’ King in Yellow and works by H.P. Lovecraft and the M-Theory. Or did we all read too much into that ? Pizzolatto says, “look, it's all good … my only interest in the Chambers stuff is as a story that has a place in American myth. And it's a story about a story that drives people into madness. … I wouldn't tell anyone to go buy Robert Chambers. It's not that great a book. Joseph Conrad and William Faulkner I think are in there far more than Chambers or Lovecraft.”

Pizzolato talked about the strange in the past season. That James Mason voice that Errol Childress slips into after seeing Cary Grant on TV in North by Northwest showed us that “he learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies. And that brings us back to the idea of storytelling, right? At one minute he can affect this Andy Griffith good ol' boy voice, the next he can sound like James Mason, and when he wants to use his real voice, he sounds like something wounded and damaged. And then when Cohle is in Carcosa, he sounds like something entirely different.”

True Detective returns to HBO next year. I’m watching. In my head I’m watching already.

http://www.thehdroom.com/news/True-Detective-Finale-Online-Streaming-Crashes-HBO-Go-While-Season-2-Prep-Commences/13873,entertainment,"HBO cracked the superb ratings code with True Detective, the immensely popular anthology whose season finale on Sunday night blew out the ratings and the HBO Go website in under an hour.

As the True Detective finale got underway last night, scores of viewers on pins and needles flooded the HBO Go website from their computers, iPads, phones and a variety of non-TV devices to live stream the final episode and learn the identity of the Yellow King. So many people tried to watch the True Detective finale live streaming at HBO Go that the website crashed for a period of time.

Setting aside a large number of HBO subscribers that chose to online stream the finale, a total of 3.5 million viewers settled onto their couch to watch it on the HBO channel per Nielsen. That’s the highest rated episode of the eight-episode run, easily besting the 2.3 million viewers who tuned in for the premiere.

A total of 11 million unique viewers watched True Detective over the course of its first season. That’s the most viewers to tune into a debut season of an HBO series since the Six Feet Under freshman season way back in 2001.

With as big a hit as True Detective has become, it’s no surprise that HBO is pushing creator Nic Pizzolatto to get busy on a second season. Pizzolatto and HBO have already confirmed that Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson will not return, and that the next anthology will be all new characters and a new story, ala American Horror Story.

Information is scarce about where the second season might head, but Pizzolatto did share the following with HitFix in an interview. “This is really early, but I’ll tell you it’s about hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.”

In case you missed True Detective last night, HBO Go is fully functional today and the season finale is waiting for you.",
http://mybroadband.co.za/news/internet/98366-streaming-glitch-spoils-hbo-go-true-detective-finale.html,entertainment,"HBO says its streaming service is running again, although disappointingly late for many anxious fans of the “True Detective” series.

Most fans who tried to log onto the “HBO GO” stream for the Sunday-night season finale of “True Detective” weren’t able to do so because the service crashed. HBO said Monday the service interruption was due to “an excessive amount of traffic” soon after the 9 p.m. Eastern start of the episode. Many viewers saw a spinning circle indicating the show was loading, but it didn’t.

HBO had similar issues with its service last year surrounding episodes of “Game of Thrones.”

Company spokesman Jeff Cusson (KEW-sahn) said Monday the service is now working.

This is why, I suspect, Rust Cohle would actually make a good dinner party guest (his total stuff up at Marty's place notwithstanding). With someone like him in the mix, other guests would suddenly appear a lot more fun, cheery and audible by contrast.

What's more, you can trust him to provide strange yet fascinating conversation nuggets that you can then marvel at and gossip over on the way home.

http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116959/true-detective-finale-recap-and-analysis-episode-8,entertainment,"But my central complaint against this argument is that it sidelines what was so touching and powerful about the ending; namely, that McConaughey was making a gesture towards his partner. In scene after scene over eight episodes, Marty mocked Rust's nihilism and showed impatience with his anti-religious rants. One, in particular, took place at a rural church, where McConaughey heaped scorn on the believers. I thus saw the final scene as McConaughey trying to establish a closer connection with Harrelson, and taking a step towards the latter's less cynical view of the world. None of this means that either man is going to become an optimist or a believer (or that, per Nussbaum, we are supposed to believe that Marty's ""fine"" line means all is in fact swell).

Moreover, it's not as if McConaughey is in the process of becoming a full-blown fundamentalist. It is thus odd for Spencer Korbhaber, on The Atlantic's excellent roundtable, to write that ""Rust scoffed at tent worshippers, and the Carcosa cult’s belief in the supernatural had terrible consequences, but Rust ends up joining all of them by buying into comforting, irrational mumbo jumbo."" So saying you are slightly optimistic about the course of humanity is the same as being a fundamentalist Christian at a (presumably very strict) church, or joining a cult that kills children?

To return to Nussbaum's complaint about the tidy wrap-up of Hart's personal journey, I also think many of the critics have been much too hard on the brief, awkward scene in which Hart's estranged family comes to see him in the hospital. It's true that this was another instance of peripheral, female characters given very little to do; but it was also sad and moving because it displayed the ways in which, even in his heroic moment, Harrelson's prior behavior left him wounded and alone.

For those who found the wrap-up too tidy and light (as opposed to dark, to use Rust's formulation), it is worth remembering that the show had one other ""light"" wrap-up three episodes earlier, in which the supposed killers were caught, the cops were heroes, and all seemed briefly well with the world. And how long did that last? It is certainly relevant that the creative team behind the show chose to end it on the note that they did, but I don't think we are meant to read too much into these final nice moments. This is still a dark show with two characters who are not going to be permanently cured of their difficulties.

Still, the more I read about the actual plot makes me think that the critics do have a point about the laziness of the wrap-up. The clue that led to the men cracking the case open was pathetically unbelievable; the actual details of what the cult was up to, and to what degree it interacted or steered clear of the central murders, was hazy in the extreme; and the personal story of the killer's connection to the Tuttle clan was underexplained. Not only did this slightly dampen the effect of the last half hour, but it will also, I think, make the idea of rewatching the series less compelling.",

There’s quite a bit of good stuff to get to here when we are talking about the ratings for Sunday night, in particular when it comes to some shows that really managed to both surprise and impress.

What’s one of those shows? “True Detective,” which was deceptively the biggest hit of 2014 so far. HBO’s live ratings have never really been a full indication of their shows’ success, but this is especially true in this instance. The finale drew a series-high 3.5 million viewers, but when you look at the average gross audience, which combines repeat viewings and streams on the HBO GO app (which gave some viewers trouble last night), the show brought in a pretty impressive haul of over 11 million viewers an episode. That’s the best for any HBO show in a first season since “Six Feet Under.” Pretty darn impressive when you remember that “Game of Thrones” and “True Blood” are also both in the network’s stable.

As for some other important ratings news:

1. Who expected that “Resurrection” was going to be the enormous beast for ABC that it was? Despite airing against “The Walking Dead,” the show brought in a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic and also 13+ million viewers. Let’s hope that the network sticks to keeping this a limited series, since that is probably what gets so many viewers to actually tune in.

2. “Once Upon a Time” delivered a solid 2.3 in its return to television, a sign that ABC got the scheduling right this time. “Revenge” also managed to actually win the 10:00 p.m. hour in its first go of things there with a 1.9, which was probably helped by its lead-in.

3. “Cosmos” on Fox delivered a solid 2.1 in its premiere, which was also yet another sign that Fox really loves anything on Sunday night that has Seth MacFarlane’s name on it.

"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2454794,00.asp",entertainment,"The final episode of HBO's breakout hit True Detective was watched by millions on their cable feeds last night, but many viewers tuning in online via HBO GO didn't have it that easy.

Complaints about poor service started popping up on Twitter and a Reddit sub dedicated to True Detective shortly after the 9 p.m. ET start of the eighth and final episode of the series. The show, created by Nic Pizzolatto, follows two detectives played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson during their decades-long search for a cultish killer in the Louisiana bayous. The narrative winds up being equal parts whodunit, nihilist bromance, and name check on obscure weird fiction tales from the 19th century.

As the Internet blew up Sunday night with kvetching about the no show by HBO GO, the network tweeted this:

Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014

Several hours later, everything seemed to be resolved, though not without leaving millions of True Detective fans gnashing their teeth about their own descent into an online Carcosa featuring the flat circle of time as an endless buffering loop:

And, for those of you who aren't stuck in HBO Go-Cosa, here is your True Detective GIFcap. Middle fingers forever: http://t.co/yVQx8eD1qa — Vulture (@vulture) March 10, 2014

So how many True Detective viewers were affected by the service disruption? The show has averaged nearly 11 million viewers a week over its eight-episode run, according to The Daily Beast. That's about 38 percent of HBO's estimated 28.7 million subscribers, the site noted, leaning on stats from media research firm SNL Kagan.

And how many of those subscribers tried to watch the series finale online? That's tough to say, though as Grantland's John Lopez quipped, perhaps the biggest revelation of True Detective turned out to be that ""HBO GO has a limit to how many people can share their passwords at one time: 11 million.""

Listen to our True Detective Spoiler Special, in which our critics debate the season finale:

Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece about True Detective’s relationship to its female characters, in which I argued that the superficial and sometimes exploitative way that it treated the women who appeared on the show—prostitutes, corpses, mistresses, a nagging wife—was intentional, a reflection of its heroes’ blinkered worldview and the very masculine, Southern cop culture they inhabited, and not the show’s own perspective.

Welp.

Last night’s finale made a hash of my case. Would that it had not. The series was not oblivious to questions of female representation—the show’s writer and creator Nic Pizzolatto has said as much—but women remained ancillary to the end. The women who appeared in the finale were Errol Childress’s damaged half-sister, a backwoods creature in lust to Errol—a man who, despite being a horrifying monster, was shown to be more than adequate at pleasuring her—and also Marty’s family, who appeared at his hospital bed, mostly as an excuse to give us a long close-up on Marty’s sobbing face. Like almost all the supporting characters on this show, the women were just sketches—occasionally naked ones—compared to our full-bodied detectives. The show’s major crimes involved endemic brutality against women and children, and victims is all that the women of this show remained, people against whom various wrongs were committed.

No TV show has an obligation to be everything to everyone. True Detective is a series I admired and enjoyed, and its treatment of women is not even the thing that irked me most about the finale, which left a number of niggling questions unanswered and finished on a ""let there be light"" riff. But it’s worth lingering on True Detective’s woman problem in part because that problem is closely, if not intentionally, tied to the show’s massive success: When it comes to prestige TV, there has yet to be a downside to out-bro-ing yourself.

In eight short weeks, True Detective has been granted greatest-show-on-television status on an extremely accelerated schedule. I understand why: McConaughey and Harrelson have been outstanding, their characters indelible. It looks great. It has been enticingly plotted, bread crumbs of Carcosa thick on the ground. If Rust’s banter hewed toward the dorm room, it felt authentically dorm-room: pretentious, sure, but also intelligent. And yet, there are other shows out there that traverse much of the same territory as True Detective—Top of the Lake, The Americans, Broadchurch, The Fall, to name a few—and none of them have gotten the frenzied attention of True Detective. None of those shows are on HBO. None of them feature movie stars. None of them seem explicitly built to appeal to Reddit users. But also—not unrelatedly—they are about women.

Last week, Mo Ryan published a piece about the number of dramas for premium cable that have been made by women. The number is completely laughable (except that it made me want to cry). Premium cable dramas, the prestige category par excellence, are shows created by men that are largely about men, the rare exceptions—Buffy, Battlestar Galactica, and Homeland—only proving the rule. (See also Brett Martin’s Difficult Men, a history of the recent golden age of television that makes this point with its title.) The “best dramas of all time,” that four-way race between Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Wire, and The Sopranos, with Deadwood or Twin Peaks or Buffy tossed in for variety on occasion, are all exceedingly male shows, playing around with male-centric cop, mobster, and druglord genres.

True Detective slots into the great drama conversation because it, too, is a great-looking, beautifully acted show that expands upon genre pleasures with very heady themes. But it also takes the machismo even further. The antihero may be played out, but he is an indictment of a certain kind of masculinity. We are drawn to Walter White and Tony Soprano (and Frank Underwood for that matter) even though we know we should be disgusted by them. Antihero shows are an enactment of unthinking hero worship, one that implicates its audience. But Rust and Marty are not antiheroes, whatever Rust says about being a “bad man.” They are just heroes. In the visual language of the finale, Rust is basically Jesus Christ. True Detective is not an interrogation of masculinity, it is a celebration of one, with none of the squishy girl stuff getting in the way. (There is no conversation to have about how the viewers of True Detective wrongly disparaged Maggie in the way that Breaking Bad fans misogynistically denigrated Skyler because True Detective never even let Maggie be enough of a character to get in Marty or Rust’s way.)",
http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/true-detective-where-things-stand-with-season-2-1201128796/,entertainment,"Now that the mystery of the Yellow King is solved, “True Detective” fans are turning their attention to figuring out the path for the show’s journey to season two.

At present, creator Nic Pizzolatto is said to be hunkered down writing scripts for the second season at his home in a picturesque area of Ventura County.

HBO execs have said they intend to order a second season of the anthology series, which will return with new characters and a new mystery to unravel. Speculation about the possible casting for the next batch of episodes is running rampant online, but those in the know say the plan is to wait until a script or two is completed before going out to actors.

As for the focus of the second season, Pizzolatto has been mostly mum but he dropped a good-sized hint in an interview following Sunday’s finale with Hitfix’s Alan Sepinwall.

“This is really early, but I’ll tell you (it’s about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system,” he told Hitfix.

Pizzolatto and execs at HBO and Anonymous Content, which co-produced the series with HBO, are expected to powwow this week to hammer out more details.",

http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/03/the-disappointing-finale-of-true-detective.html,entertainment,"Two weeks ago, I published a critical article about HBO’s “True Detective” in which I argued that, as stylish and as well acted as the series was, it had a hollow center. Beneath its auteurist trappings, the show boiled down to bickering cops hunting a sinister “rape club”—a plot that has been done to death, so to speak, on many better shows. “True Detective” also had a funky gender problem: it was about the evil of men who treat women as lurid props, but the show treated women as lurid props. And, though the dialogue was deeply, sometimes deadly serious, those layers of Lovecraft and nihilism just felt like red herrings.

Well, as of the finale, I’ve changed my mind about one thing, at least: Rust Cohle’s monologues weren’t window dressing. They were the whole point—but I don’t mean that in a good way. In the finale, we discovered that the Spaghetti Man—a.k.a. the lawnmower man, a.k.a. the hulking guy with scars—was indeed our serial killer. A perverted mastermind with a cave full of skulls and thorns, he was diddling his disabled sister inside their Grey Gardens wreck of a mansion; he also had some serious elder abuse going on, a plot that gave me flashbacks to the hilarious movie “Cold Comfort Farm” (“I saw something nasty in the woodshed!”). I relished this surreal, sick, and frankly nasty opening sequence, which led deep into the territory of the notorious “X-Files” episode “Home,” but after that everything went downhill.

To summarize: Our boys intimidated a corrupt cop with a videotape (he howled upon seeing the un-seeable, then screamed “Chain of command!”). They Googled documents and visited witnesses and had Sherlockian insights about green paint. There was a meeting with one of the African-American cops, who turned out to be the good cop. There were endless conversations in the car, about issues like whether Rust held back in that fistfight, and about Rust’s argument that Marty should be blamed for “pushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me.” (Of course, Maggie couldn’t have actually wanted to screw Rust, out of revenge or because the man had been flexing his arms at her for years; that would mean she had desires beyond being a plot device.)

About two-thirds of the way into the hour, there was an extended game of Marco Polo in the ruins, a truly ridiculous head butt, two stabbings, and a gunshot. No involvement of Marty’s father-in-law; no payoff on the goth daughter angle; no payoff on a lot of things, actually, like that mysterious convict who died in his cell. “Errol” was behind all the show’s central crimes: he’d participated in drugging a prostitute and decorating her in antlers; he’d helped organize the “Eyes Wide Shut” club with the girls in blindfolds; he was behind the kiddie-porn preschool molestation in the school basement; and then, of course, there was that ancient incestuous family to tend. He also got solid ratings as a housepainter. The masked figures behind the larger conspiracy went free, including the powerful Tuttle family—although I haven’t entirely sorted out the details, maybe because so many of them didn’t make any sense.

There was a hospital scene between Marty and his wife and kids that was so abstract, it might as well have featured a silent-movie card reading “Forgiven!” And, over the show’s last twenty minutes, as in the finale of “Lost,” the series became a meditation on how our heroes healed from their psychic wounds and became buddies again. Marty was “fine, just fine,” recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness. They were able to move on, to forgive themselves for their own mistakes (Marty) or find optimism in their nihilism (Rust).

I am certain there are people who found all this experimental and profound. To me, it was a near-total wash. And what was most striking was that every one of show’s gross-out victims—the dead “prosts,” the raped little girls with the blindfolds, the genderqueer hooker who had been raped as a boy and filmed for porn movies, Marty’s own screwed-up daughter—were just there to ease our heroes into these epiphanies. After all that talk about how the two men hadn’t “averted their eyes” to evil, the show did just that. And it ends with stories told in the stars? We’re in Successories territory here, and even great actors can’t pull that off.

As I said in the review, it’s no fun to pan a show that people love (pleasure is an argument for itself, after all). But I’ll certainly be relieved when this series stops blocking people’s view of the other television that’s out there, including the mysteries I touched on in my piece, like “Top of the Lake” and “The Fall,” as well as “Broadchurch,” “Spiral,” “The Returned,” and the terrific new season of “The Americans”—varied and excellent thrillers that got far less press than “True Detective,” in part because they didn’t have the imprimatur of HBO and manly movie stars. The second season of “Orange Is the New Black” is on its way, and so is “Game of Thrones.” Fingers crossed that there’s some other drama in my pile of screeners to show me fresh possibilities! Just spare me anything atmospheric: I’ve had enough hot air.",

Preacher Joel Theriot delivers the message, episode 3

(Image by HBO screen capture) Details DMCA



Tent preacher Joel Theriot's full sermon from episode three of True Detective provides a preview and explanation of detective Rust Cohle's conversion from a laconic nihilist extraordinaire who can barely live with himself to an enlightened soul with some prospect for peace.

In episode 7, Cohle laments his long journey through violence and depravity then says I'm ready to tie it off. Many suspected that this forecast death for Cohle in the final episode. In a very real sense, that theory proved correct but it was a different type of death.

As it turns out, True Detective is the story of a seeker of truth. Rust Cohle's moment of enlightenment in episode 8 came after years of searching and suffering.

The most elegant and revealing statement of Cohle's struggle and revelation is, in my opinion, the sermon delivered by Joel Theriot in episode 3, The Locked Room. The seemingly less than sophisticated preacher and an audience of those at the margins of life in rural Louisiana hide the profound message delivered for those willing to listen. Episode 3 shows only a portion of the sermon. The entire sequence is available on YouTube and is well worth watching (several times).

The sermon represent a narrative map for the broader story told throughout the series, which reaches a climax at the end of the season finale. Of note, preacher Theriot is of the evangelical school of Christianity. He both delivers the sermon to and experiences it with the congregation as indicated by their frequent, fervent interaction. There are no strictures, admonitions, or rules; just the presentation of a higher wisdom and path to inner peace available to everyone with ears to hear. Theriot's sermon is in italics along with my comments.

He saw you in those dark corners. He heard you. Oh brothers, he heard those thoughts.

The question, are you there?

Since the death of his daughter, Cohle has suffered unrelenting guilt for failing to protect her. For years, Cohle has been the only person listening to his thoughts. No one else is there. He is alone without comfort.

Would that we had ears to hear, because every moment, every now is an answer. Every beat of every heart, every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, every hour of every day is an answer.

And the answer is yes, yes, yes.

Theriot has a forceful answer to the question Are you there? He is and he is with us every moment. But what does he represent. Everything in the scene tells us that he is Jesus. But we don't hear the name Jesus until four minutes into the six-minute sermon. Cohle and partner Marty Hart are seen at the back of the tent watching Theriot preach. Cohle's nonchalant attitude, leaning against the tent post is more than disinterest. It represents contempt from the Cohle we know up to this point. (In the final airing of this episode, he says to Marty: What do you think the average IQ of this crew is? I see a propensity for obesity, poverty and fairy tales.)

Your sorrows pin you to this place. They divide you from what your heart knows. "" We bandaged our soft selves in hardness and anger. You are a stranger to yourself and yet he knows you. And, when your hard heart made you like unto the stone and broke you from his body - which is the stars and the wind between the stars - he knew you. He knew you yet and forever. Because I ask you, how could a father forget his children?

Cohle became a stranger to himself as a result of hardness and anger due to the death of his daughter. He was so hardened to the world, so profoundly skeptical and alienated, it broke Cohle from his body; separated him from the embrace and protection of the peace surrounding him at the time of his greatest need.

If ever your sorrow becomes such a burden that you forget yourself, forget this world, I want you to remember this truth""

This world is a veil and the face you wear is not your own.

The effectiveness and overall impact of HBO’s “True Detective” -- the first-arc finale of which proved such a draw last night that it crashed HBO Go -- should be a signal to the television industry that there is success to be had in exploring new programming models. Audiences seem less interested in prolonged seasons of any series, especially when they are presented with perpetual preemptions, or in fall and spring seasons with a prolonged break in between. That break is an annoyance that stalls the momentum a show may have built up from September through December or January before the annual scheduling challenges begin.That wasn’t a problem for “True Detective,” episodes of which premiered at 9 p.m. ET in mid-January and ran on eight Sundays with only one interruption (to avoid the Super Bowl) but otherwise without concern about such competitive programming blockbusters as the Grammy Awards, the Academy Awards or AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” HBO made one of the smartest scheduling moves in recent memory, running a drama series starring Matthew McConaughey right through an awards season punctuated by his many nominations for his role in the theatrical film “Dallas Buyers Club,” not to mention the added benefit of all the interviews and press opportunities that resulted from all the actual awards he received. (I suspect he’ll pick up a couple more for “True Detective.”)

This show ran for only eight episodes -- but they had a running time of approximately one hour each, which roughly equals ten episodes of a broadcast or basic cable series when factoring in time lost to commercial pods. That was just enough to build and maintain interest without the show becoming a chore to stay with, as sometimes happens with even the best series. It also made for easy catch-ups during the season and for comfortable aftermath binges. Eight hours might kill one day, but it won’t destroy a weekend. To look at it another way, with its episodes strung together the first arc of “True Detective” could be thought of as an eight-hour movie.

Regardless, series formats and models are suddenly in play as never before. One can forgive anybody who is feeling a sense of confusion about the issue. Perhaps this guide will help, especially as the Upfront season approaches and dozens of networks suddenly dump hundreds of new programs of many kinds into a massive heap that advertisers and critics are supposed to process with unlimited interest. (That worked in the old days of a three- or four-network Upfront, but now May has a madness all its own.)

A mini-series has always been -- and should continue to be -- a one-time closed-ended series that plays over several consecutive nights or weeks. Sundance’s “Top of the Lake” and BBC America’s “Fleming” are perfect recent examples, even if they were considerably shorter than such legendary miniseries of the past as “Rich Man, Poor Man,” “Roots” and “North and South.”

“True Detective” and FX’s “American Horror Story” are looked upon as mini-series simply because that is the most convenient definition, and I suppose it fits. But each season of “AHS” continues to build an over-arching brand, as I’m certain future seasons of “Detective” will also do. I think these are the true “event” series of our time, rather than mere “minis,” because the return of the brand each year does qualify as something new and special.

Ongoing broadcast series that are scheduled outside of the traditional broadcast season -- like CBS’ “Under the Dome” and “Extant” and Fox’s upcoming “24: Live Another Day” -- are currently being referred to as “event” series. But as long as they continue season to season with the same characters and continuous story lines they should be regarded as “regular” series -- as they would be on basic and pay cable -- and nothing more. (I haven’t seen it, but I’m already thinking of “Live Another Day” as a ninth season of “24,” rather than some kind of stand-alone “event,” even if it is only twelve episodes, a dramatic departure from its past model -- which, we shouldn’t forget, had gotten stale).

“Regular” series continue to be reshaped and rescheduled in all kinds of ways. I consider BBC America’s superb back-from-the-dead drama “In the Flesh” to be a regular series, because it has seasons that continue the same story lines with the same characters. It matters not that the first season was only three episodes long (which, minus commercial time, comes out to one longish theatrical movie). The same is true of BBC America’s “Broadchurch” and Sundance’s “The Returned” (a French import) with their eight-episode cycles of ongoing stories or new stories with ongoing characters.

Streaming series like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” are “regular” series masquerading as “events” because that’s exactly what they are for most people who adjust their lives around them to consume them in their entirety as quickly as possible. So, for now anyway, Netflix gets to have it both ways. I suppose it can be argued that any series anywhere can be gobbled up in so hurried a manner, making anything a potential event, but that’s not the intent of the original scheduling, which still counts for something, or ought to. I don’t think networks are ready to concede that their first-run prime-time real estate is nothing more than a shelf on which to display fresh product intended to be enjoyed at some non-specific future time, like DVDs on a shelf at Target or anything in a Netflix queue.",

“Watch now?” True Detective fans said through gritted teeth. “Why, I’d love to.”

Viewers who opted to watch Sunday night’s finale of True Detective via HBO Go, the pay channel’s streaming app, were treated to the kind of shocking twist they probably could have done without: The streaming service went belly up shortly after the final episode began airing at 9 p.m. ET.

And the reason you couldn’t watch True Detective on HBO Go Sunday night? According to HBO, it’s because too many of you were trying to watch True Detective at the same time.

Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014

To watch HBO Go, whether it’s viewing new episodes as they premiere or combing through the back catalog of HBO original programming, you’ve got to subscribe to the pay cable service—in theory. In practice, if you borrow the login information of a willing accomplice, you can watch HBO Go to your heart’s content. And you know what? HBO really isn’t going to stress about that.

Paying customers, however, may feel differently after Sunday night’s streaming snafu. An article on Hypable (which I spotted thanks to the Washington Post) wonders if it’s not time for HBO to start tightening up the rules for its streaming app, which is available on mobile platforms as well as set-top boxes and gaming consoles. Specifically, the Hypable article suggests that HBO think about restricting the number of people who can log into any one HBO Go account at a given time. After all, this is the second high-profile season finale where HBO GO went belly up—last year’s Game of Thrones season-ender suffered similar issues.

It’s also the second consecutive weekend in which your plans to stream a popular television broadcast may have gone awry. If you thought finding out the identity of the Yellow King was complicated, you should have tried streaming last week’s Oscar ceremony. Despite limiting the first-ever Oscar live stream to a handful of markets, ABC couldn’t deliver the telecast to viewers tuning in on mobile devices. The circumstances behind the Academy Awards and True Detective streaming failures are very different, of course, but both incidents go to show that traditional broadcasters are going to have to put in a lot more effort before streaming becomes as seamless as simply pressing the power button on your TV remote.

HBO did have some good news on Monday, though:

The issues affecting HBO GO last night have been resolved. Thank you for being patient. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014

http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/03/which-pulpy-genre-should-true-detective-plunder-season-two/359017/,entertainment,"This article is from the archive of our partner .

So, early reports (i.e. this interview) suggest that season two of True Detective is going to be about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system.” Whatever that means. Ghost trains? Devil-worshipping conductors? The satanically slow speeds on Amtrak? We’ll leave Nic Pizzolatto to his scripting, but in our eyes, what matters about True Detective season two isn’t so much the plot or the cast—it’s the genre. Season one captured the internet’s attention partly through its heady plumbing of Lovecraftian mythos and blending it with Southern Gothicism. There’s no use trying to repeat that formula, so where else can the show turn to capture lightning in a bottle?

Idea one: ‘70s conspiracy-theory thriller

Season one had a grand, governmental conspiracy weaved into its plot. Police reports were altered, Louisiana’s Senator was implicated, Rust Cohle was always fighting the system in one way or another. But as the show wound towards its conclusion, the big-picture stuff mostly fell away, and we were left with our two heroes going up against Errol in Carcosa. That’s fine, but why not go full Parallax View next time? Set it wherever you want—Washington, City Hall, some backwater town in Alaska. Get twisty and convoluted, but with that edgy, almost psychedelic element of madness that should come with any paranoia-based thriller. It really just sounds like I’m asking for HBO to produce season two of Rubicon. Well, that’s fine by me.

Idea two: Classic Poe

The Following did its best to ruin Edgar Allen Poe for everyone by having its chief villain, Joe Carroll, worship the macabre author and base a cult around his writing. His acolytes wandered around in Poe masks setting people on fire, and then Kevin Bacon would show up, point at a crime scene, and say, “Classic Poe.” This offense must be corrected, and while I’m sure Pizzolatto will feel the topic is overplayed, I wish he’d step in to draw from Poe’s writing in a much more thematically appropriate matter. The man wrote some of the earliest detective fiction, after all, and had the sense of atmosphere that proved so crucial to True Detective’s first season.

Idea three: The Wicker Man (but, y’know, good)

Season one of True Detective revolved around a Satanic Voodoo cult. What if next year we just go full pagan? The original 1973 Wicker Man is a deceptively creepy, shattering horror story disguised as a mystery, with a policeman investigating the disappearance of a girl on a remote British island. A bunch of no-good sex druids immediately start making trouble. It all sounds silly, and Neil LaBute’s horrendous Nicolas Cage-starring remake didn’t help that reputation, but there is something genuinely frightening and fascinating about being stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere. As long as there’s no Smoke Monster.

Idea four: Cyberpunk

Alright, this is as far-fetched as it gets. But a man can dream. If you really want to shake things up, nothing’s further from Carcosa than cyberspace, and there’s plenty of philosophical debate to plunder from the works of William Gibson or Neal Stephenson. Matthew McConaughey is coasting to a career revival partly on the back of True Detective—maybe it’s time for Keanu Reeves to enjoy the same renaissance? I look forward to much talk of “jacking in” and the “Metaverse.” Who am I kidding, there’s more of a chance that season two just ends up being about Rust Cohle and Marty Walsh chasing tail in an old folks home.

http://www.salon.com/2014/03/10/whats_going_on_with_true_detective_season_2/,entertainment,"It's rare for a television show -- especially a drama that becomes a hit in its first season -- to totally scrap its existing characters and story line to start anew in Season 2. But that's what ""True Detective"" is doing -- at least, that is what it seems to be doing, based on the few clues that show creator Nic Pizzolatto has shared with television critics in recent interviews.

HitFix's Alan Sepinwall notes that HBO hasn't officially ordered Season 2

yet -- again, a stalling that's rare for a hit series so popular that it brings down its hosts site -- but surmises that this is ""because I suspect HBO is waiting until they've signed the actors they want before announcing.""

Advertisement:

There are a few things we do know about Season 2 of ""True Detective,"" however: Pizzolatto is currently ""fleshing it out,"" he told EW, and it will be about ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.""

And the Chicago Tribune claims that Matthew McConaughey, who played detective Rust Cohle alongside Woody Harrelson as Marty Hart, won't be back:

The show was always intended as an anthology with a new story each season. The surprise survival of both Rust Cohle and Marty Hart at the end of Season 1 suggested at least one could return, someday. But McConaughey has said he never planned to stay beyond one season. “It was a 450-page film, is what it was,” McConaughey said of the show's first season during a January Television Critics Association panel. “It was also finite. It didn't mean we had to come back this year, next year if we were under contract. It was finite. So in that way it was exactly a 450-page film script.”

Cohle and Hart are probably not coming back, but Pizzolatto has retained the literary rights to his protagonists. ""So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility,"" he told EW.

Advertisement:

And it's not just the cast and story that will change -- the entire directorial style, overseen in Season 1 by Cary Fukunaga, is likely to change, too. Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed via email:

We don’t have any plans to work with one director again. It would be impossible to do this yearly as we need to be able to do post while we’re still filming, like any other show. There’s some great guys I’ve consulted, and we’re all confident we can achieve the same consistency. Going forward, I want the show’s aesthetic to remain determinedly naturalistic, with room for silences and vastness, and an emphasis on landscape and culture. And I hope a story that presents new characters in a new place with authenticity and resonance and an authorial voice consistent with this season. Dominant colors will change. South Louisiana was green and burnished gold.

It seems like the freshman show is already being gutted, left with skeletal remains that, once filled in again, might not even resemble its original form. One thing that we do know about Season 1 that will carry over from season 2 -- perhaps the most important thing -- is that the philosophical detective drama will continue with the same spirit -- ""keep being strange.""

""Don't play the next one straight,"" Pizzolatto told HitFix.",

What's more, the latest gross viewership for the show has an average 11 million viewers tuning in every week.

Nervously twitching and wired fans on the East Coast logged onto the HBO GO streaming service at 9 p.m. only to be faced with a spinning circle on a black screen. The streaming service, which is only available by subscription, login, and password, apparently just had too many users logging in a once.

HBO GO recognized the problem and send a tweet saying they were addressing the issue.

The people who watched the finale on television had no problem and the episode remains on HBO On Demand. The show stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson and had the second highest premiere rating for an HBO show with 2.3 million viewers, following Boardwalk Empire with 4.8 million viewers in 2010.

SPOILER ALERT! (So what happened?)

For those lucky ones who did get to watch the finale, we finally glimpsed the bizarre life of serial killer, Errol Childress, a member of the sickening cult that was terrorizing Louisiana. He was basically a nightmare come to life. His sprawling estate was home to his mentally unstable half-sister-turned-lover, and he clearly had a thing for baby dolls and talking to his dead father who was tied up on a mattress in the shed.

After confirming that Childress was the man they'd been looking for all season, they ambushed Childress' home and interrogated his half-sister-turned-lover. Rust chased after Childress and was lured into the center of Carcosa, a perverted underground maze built by the serial killer.

Once he reached the end of the winding maze, Rust was momentarily distracted by a vision. ​Childress suddenly appeared from behind and stabbed Rust in the stomach. A fight ensued, giving Marty time to catch up to his partner and, hopefully, shoot Childress dead. Marty did get a few rounds off but it didn't stop Childress altogether. In a stunning move, he threw his tomahawk straight into Marty's chest. However, as he stood over Marty, ready to finish the deed, a bleeding Rust shot Childress in the back of the head.

Okay, we won't give away everything. Just know that most of your lingering questions are answered in the heart-stopping finale that's earned a lot of praise from viewers!

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/true-detectives-journey-was-better-than-its-disappointing-destination/article17411255/,entertainment,"Before the finale of the first season of True Detective aired on Sunday, creator Nic Pizzolatto granted an interview about the ending to critic Alan Sepinwall of the website HitFix.

Among other things, he said: ""This is a story that began with its ending in mind, that [detective Rust] Cohle would be articulating, without sentimentality or illusion, an actual kind of optimism. That line, ['If ] you ask me, the light's winning,' that was one of the key pieces of dialogue that existed at the very beginning of the series' conception. For me as a storyteller, I want to follow the characters and the story through what they organically demand. And it would have been the easiest thing in the world to kill one or both of these guys.""

He also said: ""Considering what these characters had been through, it seemed hard to me to work out a way where they both live and they both exit the show to live better lives beyond the boundaries of these eight episodes. Now they are going to go on and live forever beyond the margins of the show, and our sense, at least, is they haven't changed in any black-to-white way, but there is a sense that they have been delivered from the heart of darkness.""

Story continues below advertisement

Yours truly was intrigued to read the ""heart of darkness"" reference, it being a continuing theme of my interpretation of the series. As it turned out, True Detective, if not a direct parallel to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, was in the end about encountering the darkest side of human nature, about stowing darkness in your heart – as Rust had done throughout in his cynicism – and transcending it.

To some it was an oddly uplifting ending – the killer caught, the heroes injured but surviving, and the most hard-hearted of the duo softened in his final, drawled remark: ""Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning.""

Yes, it was odd and disappointing: a conclusion so conventional that it seemed the previous abundant weight gave way to whimsy, an ending calculated to not disturb viewers who always saw the show as two cops on the trail of a killer who would be caught in the end, with the cops feeling good about it. The evaporation of Cohle's nihilism felt like a swindle in the story's end. The ending diminished Rust's cynicism to mere glumness and it seemed to suggest he was glad to be alive – even high on his almost-sunny new philosophy.

Here's the key thing about True Detective – the journey was more compelling, complex and fascinating than the destination it arrived at. For all the vacancy in the final scene, the series had heft in its probing of darkness. It brooded on the perversity that exists beneath the surface of religious belief; it dwelt on corruption, not just among the powerful but among the powerless. It presented male rage in all its stark, selfish obstinance and offered insight into the sort of society that nourishes that rage.

In his remarks about the finale, Pizzolatto didn't mention the ""post-industrial, end-of-empire thing"" in America that he articulated in January regarding the series's thematic substructure. But it was a relentless theme right to the end.

The episode opened at the killer's almost-inaccessible, backwoods family home of people off the radar, gone rogue, distant from civilization both literally and figuratively: a place where, we were much reminded, there's no cellphone service.

The warren of buildings and cave-like structures was overgrown with grass, a signal of decay and of a post-wealth, post-industrial situation. It all looked like the remnants of some ancient society now forgotten, near-buried by nature.

Story continues below advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

And what the crime came down to, in the end, was the work of people existing in the squalor of decay and in caves, limited to finding significance in structures made of sticks and in putting daubs on a wall: profoundly primitive, near-Stone-Age people in their limited sophistication.

We saw a landscape gorgeously rendered but desolate, some of it ravaged by hurricanes and floods, some of it destroyed by the end of old industries. It's that set of images and leitmotifs that we can take away from the eight hours of True Detective.

The creator of the series may well have planned the concluding flash of optimism from the beginning. But he ensured that getting to that point was an unforgettable encounter with pessimism and the negative, with sour themes and a grim view of a society receding to primitivism.

In that context, the ending remains disappointing, with its uplifting touch. And yet, from the journey to that point, we know how flimsy the optimism is.

http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/true-detective-unearths-record-hbo-ratings-in-finale/,entertainment,"HBO‘s True Detective finale bagged a series high of 3.5 million viewers Sunday at 9 PM — a 50% spike from the crime anthology’s premiere of 2.3 million. With an average gross audience of 11 million viewers season to date, True Detective becomes HBO’s most-watched freshman series since Six Feet Under’s 11.4 million viewers in 2001. Across the night’s three telecasts, the series also hit a high — 4.9 million viewers. Last night, demand for tonight’s season finale of True Detective was so great online, the network’s streaming service HBO GO temporarily crashed, which may have helped drive viewers to the TV viewing. The disruption played into True Detective‘s pop culture phenom image over its eight episodes. Two weeks earlier, an average of 2.6 million viewers watched the drama anthology at 9 PM, besting the premiere’s previous high of 2.3 million on January 12. It drew a then-series-best 3.6 million viewers across its three plays. While the first season of True Detective was conceived as a closed-ended arc with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, creator Nic Pizzolatto is already working on a premise for a second season with new characters and a new storyline in a new locale.

Also Sunday, HBO’s Girls, averaged just over 1 million viewers in its slot Sunday (and for the night tallied 1.5 million). After that, Looking logged 425,000 viewers.",
http://www.elliotlakestandard.ca/2014/03/09/poetic-finale-for-true-detective,entertainment,"True Detective ended its first season with a line I don’t think I ever will forget.

Aside from that line, the first-season finale of True Detective, which aired Sunday night on HBO Canada, kind of turned into American Horror Story.

Not that anything supernatural occurred. But atmospherically, things sure got spooky.

Obviously if you haven’t watched the episode yet and are intending to do so, consider this a SPOILER ALERT. If you have seen it, I wonder if you’ll agree with me that there were a few subtle surprises on the one hand, but no big surprises on the other.

Okay, first of all, the biggest pleasing subtle surprise for me came with the final line, when Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) displayed some optimism.

Fittingly if neither of them were going to die, the season ended with Rust and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) continuing their love-hate relationship by engaging in another one of their deep conversations. This one occurred outside Lafayette General Hospital.

Trying to cheer up the seriously injured but apparently on-the-mend Rust, Marty brought up the subject of how Rust used to gaze at the stars and make up stories when he was a boy in Alaska. But Rust replied he had come to believe there’s only one story, the oldest: “Light versus dark.”

Marty, glancing at the Louisiana night sky, made the cynically comical observation, “I know we ain’t in Alaska, but it appears to me the dark has a lot more territory.”

But then just a little bit later, Rust circled back. Rust ended the season by saying to Marty, “You know, you’re looking at it wrong, that sky thing. Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light’s winning.”

That is a great line.

I had to rewind three or four times to make it out, because Rust mumbled the words. But they’re in my brain for good now. I just know it.

A side comment I’ll make about that final scene: Was that not the quietest hospital you’ve ever witnessed? No activity just outside it, no ambulances, not even any sirens in the distance. Yes, it was night, but most hospitals are hubs of activity 24 hours a day. Not a criticism, just an observation. Hey, it’s TV, I get it.

As for the lead-up to that final scene, there really were no big surprises in the True Detective finale, as far as bizarre plot twists or sharp turns out of nowhere. That actually was kind of refreshing.

The most dramatic scene of the whole season, of course, was the final scene of the second-last episode, when the camera moved through the early-evening sunshine to reveal the scars on the face of the creepy dude who had been on the riding mower. As we now know, that was serial killer Errol William Childress.

The strange, isolated place where Childress was living, which we got to see throughout the final episode, was where the afore-mentioned memories of American Horror Story came into it for me. Honestly, that abode would have fit snugly into any of the three seasons of American Horror Story that have aired so far.

True Detective’s violent climax with Rust, Marty and Childress wasn’t particularly inventive. It was sort of standard stuff, to be honest. But I really liked the denouement. It was poetic and artistic.

So nothing crazy happened, but everything crazy happened.

Obviously you can just hand the Emmy to McConaughey. And with all due respect to his signature slogan, “All right, all right, all right,” I think his character’s last line in the first season of True Detective will stick with me far longer.

http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027461/true-detectives-carcosa-the-creepiest-set-design-in-tv-history,entertainment,"Those of you who missed last night’s finale of True Detective— thanks a lot, HBO Go !–should actually feel thankful; you were spared nightmares about perhaps the creepiest set design in television history. The serial killer’s lair, dubbed “Carcosa,” makes The Blair Witch Project‘s witch house look like a page in a Pottery Barn catalog.

In the short stories that inspired True Detective, Carcosa is a cursed city in an alien world. Until the finale, Carcosa is a mysterious part of the show’s elaborate mythology, a place mentioned reverently by various doomed and deranged characters. In the finale, Carcosa is finally revealed: an overgrown chamber of horrors used for all sorts of violent devil worship.

To build Carcosa, New Orleans-based artist Joshua Walsh created a satanic altar from human skulls, antlers, oyster shells, burnt driftwood, and, for an extra sinister touch, cutesy children’s toys. He rubbed the skulls with yellow turmeric and carved them with what’s essentially the killer’s logo–an angular spiral that will forever haunt our dreams. What Walsh calls “spirit bundles” hang from the altar like evil cocoons. “To distort the figure with a beast quality, I incorporated the spine of a cow,” Walsh writes on HBO Go’s site. He also noted that the oyster shells mixed with turmeric helped create a “spicy death smell.”

The serial killer at the heart of the show is a particularly artistic one–he leaves visual clues like eerie twig sculptures called “Devil’s Nests” and chilling graffiti on the walls of his decrepit haunts. Instead of using an in-house production team to create the show’s art, as is standard in Hollywood, the producers decided to cast an individual artist as the unseen killer’s hand in order to make the aesthetic consistent and authentic. They’d asked several artists to provide samples of their vision of the killer’s work, but none fit the bill.

It wasn’t until the producers noticed a sculpture of a hummingbird made from sinew and twigs on the desk of set decorator Cynthia Slagter, a gift from her friend Walsh, that they pinpointed him for the job. Walsh, an avid hunter and taxidermist and the son of a family who ran a funeral home, had to channel a killer’s mindset and imagine what sort of artistic slug trail he would leave in his wake. He worked full-time for nine months to create a collection of about 100 murals, paintings, and sculptures. It will take weeks of watching nothing but cute cat videos to get Carcosa out of our heads.",

So the True Detective finale last night was so popular it actually crashed the HBO GO system—but the service is now back to normal. So if you haven't watch it yet, GET ON IT, because we have a lot to talk about! In my opinion, in the end, True Detective was just an excellent ""buddy cop"" show (here's a list of the show's 31 cliches) with some fantastic acting and some great directing by Cary Fukunaga. But that doesn't mean I wasn't riveted, or didn't love it to death! Expect a lot of Emmys for everybody who worked on True Detective this coming year.

Now, Hitfix has a great and illuminating interview with True Detective creator Nic Pizzolato, in which he discusses the overarching theme, why the show ended the way it did, the often-maligned female characters, and why viewers should be careful to label Rusty Cohle's philosophy as ""hogwash"":

I don't want to restrict an audience by telling them that ""this means this"" and ""this means this."" My intentions are the inalterable definition of things. For people who thought Cohle's philosophy was simply hogwash, be aware that you're calling Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche hogwash. Just be aware of that. That is not, in fact, a college freshman stoned eating a pizza talking about life; that's Arthur Schopenhauer's thoughts on life. But I thought that was part of the tension within Cohle.

Nic also gave the faintest tease for the next season of True Detective:

Okay. This is really early, but I'll tell you (it's about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.

Okay! I AM THERE! But before we go, let's see what you thought of the whole shebang:",

During an interview with series creator Nic Pizzolatto, HitFix inquired about the direction next season will take. Has the fan and critical reception of season 1 influenced how Pizzolatto will approach True Detective's sophomore season?""It's informed exactly one thing,"" Pizzolatto said. ""It's that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don't play the next one straight.""When asked for more specific story details, the creator replied, ""Okay. This is really early, but I'll tell you (it's about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.""Of course, in text it's difficult to tell whether he's joking or not, so this synopsis should be taken with a grain of salt. Though, Pizzolatto did say that his prose is typically ""populated with rich female characters,"" so it might make sense for him to create a story based on women when the female characters in Season 1, like most characters this season, existed as ""mirrors to reflect some aspect of Rust (McConaughey) or Marty (Harrelson)."" Not to mention ""the secret occult history of the United States transportation system"" certainly sounds ""strange.""What do you think?

The highly-anticipated season finale to ""True Detective"" aired last night.

For seven episodes, we've followed Marty (Woody Harrelson) and Rust (Matthew McConaughey) as they re-opened a case about missing women and children they thought they solved 17 years ago.

your heart in your chest.





For 15 minutes we followed the two detectives as they chased and confronted the real killer, Errol Childress, in what was one of the most nauseating and heart-pounding sequences we've watched on live TV in awhile.

We made a few GIFs of the best moments from the strenuous scenes.

Again, if you haven't watched the finale, head back. There are a bunch of spoilers ahead.

Rust (Matthew McConaughey) spots Errol (Glenn Fleshler) and tells him not to move.



Obviously, that doesn't go well.

This leads to a man hunt through pretty vast pre-civil war tunnels

... ending at a creepy altar made with skulls, a cow's spine, oyster shells, and kid's charms.

Rust had a pretty deep, dark existential moment in the tunnels, and we wondered whether or not we were watching Fox's ""Cosmos"" premiere.

This resulted in him getting knifed.



You can rattle McConaughey, but you can't take the man down without a fight.

Marty comes to save the day ... or not.

Just as it looks pretty hopeless for both of the detectives - the only two people who know the identity of the real killer - Rust saves the day.

And just like that ... it's over.

The action culminated in the two ending up at the altar, leaving everyone to wonder Rust's fate.

As an anthology, we know by now that Rust Cohle and Marty Hart won't be back. Who would you like to see on the show next year?

(HBO)

It's over. HBO's massive watercooler drama ""True Detective"" was a multi-layered wonder not seen since their other must-watch series ""The Wire.""

As an anthology, we know by now that Rust Cohle and Marty Hart won't be back (although we'd die to see a series about their detective agency. Right??). And sure, the charisma between Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson was an effortless asset to the show, the entire audience is probably playing armchair casting director today and we're no different.

While he was sketchy on details, series creator Nic Pizzolatto told Hitfix that season 2 was about ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system. More occult? Oy...

We're also wondering if the show, which crashed its popular HBO GO app Sunday night, will keep its parallel narrative structure. If so, there's a multitude of scenarios Pizzolatto can draw from. That said, we figured it would be fun to whip up a short list of possible contenders as well as locales for next year.

Jon Hamm/Damian Lewis

Jon Hamm and Damian Lewis

The heat and horror of Hells Kitchen in '77 is the primary backdrop where our cops are dumped a case investigating an unsolved gang murder of a Westie which leads us to present day Madison Avenue. In the era of post 911 fear and trauma, red tape may be the biggest adversary to our gumshoes, especially when one of them can't play nice with big city brass.

Alexander Skarsgard/John Cusack

John Cusack & Alexander Skarsgård

What looks like a routine murder of a showgirl in Las Vegas in 1982, goes way deeper. As gangsters move on to greener pastures and corporate entities take over the hotels, there's a new threat that looms in the desert. When one of our heroes has hidden mob ties, everyone is a suspect in this Sin City tale.



Ed Norton/Robert Downey

Robert Downey Jr. & Edward Norton

Someone is killing Hollywood A-listers and two veteran cops are thrown a lead by a studio mogul who may or may not be involved. From the backroom editing bays of the early '90s to modern studio backlots, our heroes try to weed out who's telling the truth in a town filled with professional liars.

Michelle Williams/Jessica Chastain

Jessica Chastain & Michelle Williams

By now, everyone knows that meth is sweeping our nation. Walter White and ""Breaking Bad"" made sure of that. Our story here, though, kicks off in Portland, Oregon where two cops work the same case in different parts of the city. When they eventually pool their resources, they're shocked to find not only where their investigation leads, but who is behind it.

Hilary Swank/Elisabeth Moss

Hilary Swank & Elisabeth Moss

As the Golden State ramped up for one of the biggest tech booms in history, two police officers in 1999 unveil a real estate scandal in the heart of San Francisco that leads them all the way to Silicon Valley. The more they dig, the uglier it gets, especially when an emerging tech giant makes sure none of their questions are answered. Flash forward almost 15 years and the company is bigger than ever but that doesn't mean our two heroes didn't forget and when a new clue shows up, their case is reopened.

Question: Do you have a dream cast for next season? Let us know your scenario.

http://gothamist.com/2014/03/10/true_detective_finale_form_and_void.php,entertainment,"After weeks of frenzied speculation and argument and, let's face it, temporary insanity, True Detective's debut season finally climaxed last night (for some of us, anyway). Did episode 8, ""Form and Void,"" tie up all the loose ends spun out by writer Nic Pizzolatto's intricate script? Nope. But the finale brought resolution on its own terms, and was satisfying despite (or maybe even because of?) the plot questions it left unanswered.

No, Maggie wasn't involved in the horrifying kidnap pedophilia cult. Neither was her father, which some True Detective theorists were absolutely convinced of. Further, all of Audrey's childhood sexual turmoil apparently had nothing to do with the case, except insofar as her father Marty was a largely absent human tampon. The Five Horsemen theory remains a theory, and the sprawling depth of the conspiracy remains unplumbed. And the painting above Marty and Maggie's bed that matched the mural in the hospital was not as significant as we thought. It wasn't significant at all, in fact. Heh, we kind of lost it back there for a bit, didn't we?

It was a fun way to get lost, though, albeit highly disturbing. I don't think I'll be rewatching episode 8 any time soon—that whole opening sequence with Errol Childress's dead ""daddy"" chained to a bedframe followed by him fingerbanging his sister on his lap as she recalls the first time their grandfather raped her... yeah, I'm all set on that. I did however savor seeing ""that cocksucker"" rummy Steve Geraci eat dirt in a barrage of sniper bullets. (""L'chaim fat ass!"") And how about that gorgeous exterior shot of that overgrown Civil War-era fort that Childress turned into Carcosa? I've also got no complaints about the harrowing final confrontation between Childress and the detectives, which delivered a terrifying chase through dark tunnels.

And Cohle's last hallucination as he gazes up at a circular opening in the ceiling was breathtaking.

Pizzolatto has said in interviews that he's only interested in the serial killer aspect of True Detective in so far as it illuminates the relationship between Rust and Marty and their flaws, and Form and Void was certainly proof of that. As they pursue their Spaghetti Monster, their begrudging friendship is reestablished, coming full circle and then some with more of their classic carpool banter. (Don't these guys ever want to listen to some Creedence or something?)

Marty: It's hard to find something in a man who rejects people as much as you do, you know that?

Rust: I never told you how to live your life, Marty.

Marty: No, you just sat there and judged me.

Rust: Look, as sentient meat, however illusory our identities are, we craft those identities by making value judgments. Everybody judges, all the time. Now, you got a problem with that, you’re living wrong.

Marty: What's scented meat?

But it's the ending's ending that really delivers, and that I will rewatch. Matthew McConaughey's emotional breakdown outside the hospital is incredibly powerful stuff, and watching him talk about love with such vulnerability after eight episodes of stoic pessimism is astonishing. Rust has touched the darkness, the darkness touched back, and he reemerged transformed. He claims he shouldn't be there, but there he is, staggering away from the hospital with the help of his partner, and now he's the one sounding optimistic. When Marty remarks that the sky's darkness seems to be overwhelming the stars, Rust says, ""You're looking at it wrong, the sky thing. Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light's winning."" Light: kicking ass for 14 billion years and counting. It is one hell of a story.

So Marty and Rust hobble off into the sunset together in life-affirming defiance of all our darkest expectations. The monster at the end of their story was not a particularly compelling one in the annals of fictional serial killers, but it was their journey to him—and the intelligent yet passionate way their journey's story was told—that made the show so engrossing. Cary Fukunaga's masterfully sumptuous direction gave Harrelson and McConaughey all the room they needed to untangle Pizzolatto's dense narrative, with a pair of raw, pitch-perfect performances that will no doubt be seen as career peaks.

Pizzolatto's career is just getting started, and while last night marked the end of Marty and Rust's story, we can now start the countdown for True Detective's second season, which Pizzolatto says will concern ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.""",
http://www.cagesideseats.com/2014/3/10/5491768/why-last-nights-hbo-go-crash-should-scare-wwe,entertainment,"Last night at around 9PM Eastern Daylight Time, thousands of people settled down to their laptops, tablets and other streaming devices to watch the eighth and final episode of the first season of HBO's buzz-rific show True Detective.

They were greeted by the picture accompanying this post, and then this tweet from HBO Go's Twitter account:

Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014

For those unfamiliar with the HBO Go service, it's essentially HBO's streaming service. For the most part, HBO original programming and movies that HBO has the exclusive broadcast rights to do not appear on NetFlix of Hulu, but customers who subscribe to HBO through their cable or satellite television provider gain access to the service for use on other devices, like personal computers, tablets and phones.

So as to not put themselves in the position of competing with the partners from whom they collect massive fees and payments, the GO service is not ""stand alone"" like NetFlix or WWE Network. In theory, the only people it is available to are customers who subscribe to the television service through Comcast, Verizon, Dish and similar providers.

That's the idea, anyway.

Like WWE Network, HBO Go is accessed with a user name and password. A user name and password that can be, and frequently is, shared by many members of the same household. Or circle of friends. Or neighborhood.

There was already some concern raised about the service's ability to handle a large audience for a single event when NXT ArRIVAL hiccuped during it's live debut on WWE Network on Thursday, February 27th. That was just a few days into a launch that had more than a couple of bugs, though. And it was coming from a small venue that may had limited external bandwidth. And the company and their partners had six weeks to fine-tune and trouble shoot the service before WrestleMania 30.

All of those things are still true, and Vince McMahon's team and their partners at MLB Advanced Media are no doubt burning the midnight oil working to ensure that WWE Network is as stable as possible for April 6th.

The HBO issue raises another concern, though. WWE Network users have been openly discussing the sharing of login information on social media. Some of the launch troubles were due to international users trying to find ways into the system that wasn't yet scheduled for international support. Folks can still be found discussing ways that they have accessed the Network from overseas, almost two weeks since official word was that those holes had been patched.

Are WWE and MLBAM readying themselves for the million subscribers that they hope to have signed up to watch WrestleMania online? Or are they getting ready for the less predictable number that might hit their servers on that first Sunday in April with their friend's password, or from overseas via a proxy?

Wall Street and the press love what they have seen or heard about WWE Network so far. Early buzz has Vince at the forefront of a change in the way viewers consume sports and entertainment, as he was when the first WrestleMania birthed the modern pay-per-view (PPV).

But the launch of a new service was always going to be a risk, and having the biggest show in history be the first largely promoted event to air on it compounds that risk. The issue that HBO ran into last night (which was corrected in short order, but is still the subject of a fair amount of press coverage today) could prove an ugly black eye to the new service when it will not even be two months old.

A stressed and tired development and quality testing team probably just got a whole lot more stressed and tired when the HBO Go log-on wheel spun like a flat circle into the underneath last night.

For fans and investors of WWE, WrestleMania 30 and beyond may depend on their solving the case.",

wrapped up last night, giving an audience that had breathlessly devised so many complex and intriguing finale predictions an ending that was obviously on sale, the wrong color and not even from the more-far-away mall in the nice neighborhood.

And although McConaughey's country-fried Camel Lights drawl made his metaphysical babbling and ridiculous one-liners like 'l'chaim, fat-assso priceless, Woody Harrelson was the one who could draw out a vowel like nothing else, sounding like he had something large and squishy in his mouth for much of this season's eight episodes.

http://www.hypable.com/2014/03/10/true-detective-season-2-characters-location-story/,entertainment,"True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto spoke to HitFix to celebrate the season 1 finale, and for the first time we’re hearing some clues about season 2.

When asked what we can expect from the sophomore season (which HBO hasn’t officially green lit, but it’s a safe bet), Pizzolatto offered a couple of hints: It’s about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system,” he said.

He added that the reaction to season 1 has taught him one thing about what he needs to continue doing to captivate viewers: “I realize I need to keep being strange. Don’t play the next one straight.”

We don’t know much else about True Detective season 2 except for the following things:

1) Matthew McConaughey won’t be back. The actor confirmed this at the 2014 Oscars last week. It’s not necessarily a surprise because the series is an anthology, meaning the show will have new characters and stories every season. Chances are that Woody Harrelson won’t be back either. Or anyone else for that matter.

2) The story may be set in Southern California. Pizzolatto hinted at this in an interview with BuzzFeed when he said he’s been “reading about the last 40 years of Southern California government.” With the new location will also come new colors. “South Louisiana was green and burnished gold,” he noted.

We’ve also heard that the show will use a few directors for season 2. This is a departure from season 1 which was entirely under the direction of Cary Joji Fukunaga. Time will tell if this is a good decision or a bad one. Viewers have been so captivated by the story, thanks in part to all eight episodes being under the direction of one person, because it offered a cohesive feel.

The entire first season was penned by Pizzolatto, who will do the same for season 2.

True Detective season 1 wrapped last night on HBO and brought the story to an appropriate conclusion. Though Hart and Cohle weren’t able to nab all the bad guys, they did get the one who they’ve believed was the biggest threat. While Rust wished they were able to grab them all, Marty reminded him that “that ain’t the kind of world it is. But we got ours.” Check out our recap for more details.

The criminal drama's former detectives Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) finally caught their guy — if not everyone responsible for the heinous acts done to the many young victims.

Cohle and Hart were able to find The Scarred Man's — aka Errol Childress — den of horrors (and his aunt/girlfriend, along with his decaying father), where they engaged in a bloody showdown with the killer, nearly ending the two ex lawmen.

And in the end, fans witnessed something that had been missing for much of the show: the real friendship between the two men. Not only that, McConaughey's fatalist revealed he had some hope in his heart: ""Once, there was only dark. Ask me, the light's winning.""

It was a finale that delivered some answers, but not all. Who made those little twig sculptures and the video that sent Hart and Sheriff Geraci reeling? Who was The Yellow King?

But not everyone was able to watch the conclusion of the HBO drama as it aired. So many people logged onto the network's app during the show that the app crashed.

And without the program they were so looking forward to, fans took to social media to vent.



A spokesperson for HBO told TODAY on Monday, ""Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of 'True Detective,' HBO GO was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9 p.m. ET last night. The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal.""

In what may have been the second-biggest website failure of the young century, HBO Go, the cable channel’s online streaming service, crashed on Sunday night, deflating the anticipation of excited viewers settling in to watch the season finale of True Detective online.

True Detective, with Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, enjoyed fantastic popularity in its first season, racking up 10.9m weekly viewers by the end of February, according to the the Hollywood Reporter.

http://www.inquisitr.com/1166037/true-detective-finale-brings-hbo-go-to-its-knees-fans-overwhelm-server/,entertainment,"True Detective, the HBO cop series that brought a pair of Hollywood heavyweights to the small screen for an eight-episode mini-series blending brooding character study, vaguely existentialist philosophy, obscure literary references and a convoluted serial killer plot — oh yeah, and plenty of sex — turned out to be a winning formula for the pay cable network.

But HBO proved not quite ready for prime time when it came to delivering True Detective on the internet.

Despite being ahead of the game when it created its online HBO GO service four years ago, well before its competition started offering programming via the internet, HBO’s online app could not handle the overwhelming fan demand to watch Sunday night’s finale of True Detective on their iPads and Roku devices.

True Detective was HBO's biggest hit since The Sopranos, but the network proved not quite ready to handle the demand of viewers who preferred to watch online.

[Mild Spoilers Ahead]

With hundreds of thousands — even millions — of fans attempting to log in and see Woody Harrelson and freshly-minted Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey catch an overweight psychopath who in the end, seemed inspired as much by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre‘s Leatherface as by Robert W. Chambers’ “Yellow King,” the HBO GO service simply could not handle the workload. Thousands of would-be True Detective viewers saw the above message, telling them “some videos may not be available at this time.”

On its official Twitter account, HBO posted a somewhat friendlier, even a bit gloating message.

Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we’ve been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014

But not all True Detective fans were in an understanding mood.

In fact, Twitter itself felt like was about to be overwhelmed with tweets from dissatisfied customers, that ranged in tone from the outraged to the snarky.

Worried this is what I’ll look like by the time HBOGO loads the True Detective finale pic.twitter.com/pl9kTycI2j — Jake Laperruque (@JakeLaperruque) March 10, 2014

Actually not all of the frustrated True Detective viewers were, in fact, HBO customers.

HBO GO is supposed to be available only to people who have a cable subscription through a provider such as Comcast Xfinity or Time Warner Cable, and pay for a monthly HBO GO subscription on top of the basic cable package.

But the 41-year-old cable network has made no secret of the fact that it will tolerate, even encourage, “piggy back” viewers — that is, people who borrow log-in credentials from their parents, friends or any other HBO subscriber willing to share.

While some online services, such as Netflix, regulate this kind of log-in sharing rather strictly, HBO sees it as just another marketing gimmick.

“What we’re in the business of is building addicts, building video addicts,” said HBO boss Richard Plepler, “and the way we do that is exposing our product and our shows and our brand to more and more people.”

In other words, even though HBO might have been somewhat red-faced over its inability to stream the True Detective finale to everyone who wanted to see it, the network had to be delighted that the show had spawned a whole new level of addiction.

Fear not: Our trusty True Detective recapper Kenny Herzog is organizing his thoughts about the final episode and furiously typing away — we’ll run his recap first thing in the morning. Also coming tomorrow is an analysis of True Detective’s first season by our television critic Matt Zoller Seitz as well as a big interview with … well, check back tomorrow to find out. But for now, here’s a [obviously spoiler-heavy] place where we can discuss the events that just occurred in the finale. And clearly, there is a lot to discuss, including:

1. Errol’s British accent. So bizarre, yet as creepy as the millions of dolls lying around the house and his idea of foreplay. (What movie was he watching, by the way?) But he was an effectively menacing villain— a mix of Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs and the Peacock boys from the “Home” episode of The X-Files.

2. “L’chaim, fat-ass.” Rust’s closing salvo to Steve “Just Following the Chain of Command” Geraci, is among the better one-liners in the history of television. How much will it cost Geraci to repair the sniper holes in his Maserati?

3. They got their bad man. But any other insidiuously heinous men (Louisiana Senator Eddie Tuttle, et al.) will go unpunished/un-shot in the head. But getting even the one guy is part of Rust’s light vs. dark theory — the light is winning. Did the finale tie up all the loose ends? Did it create more questions than it answered?

4. Did anyone see an upbeat ending coming for this show? Marty and Rust, essentially moseying off into the sunset. Prediction: In 30 years, those guys will be the protagonists of Nic Pizzolatto’s remake of Grumpy Old Men.",

The former 'The Office' star launches expletives when an audience member at an SXSW panel asks her why there's only one female doctor on 'The Mindy Project'.

Mar 11, 2014

AceShowbiz - %cMindy Kaling% is frustrated with frequent complaints of diversity on her show ""The Mindy Project"". Thus, when an audience member at ""Running the Show: TV's New Queen of Comedy"" panel discussion at SXSW in Austin, Texas brought up the topic, she did not hold back with her response.

""You guys have a great, diverse set of characters, but was it a conscious decision for Mindy to be the only female doctor, and the only doctor color of show?"" the female audience asked. Kaling responded, ""I look at shows on TV, and this is going to just seem defensive, but I'm just gonna say it: I'm a f**king Indian woman who has her own f**king network television show, OK?""

She went on defending her sitcom. ""I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks any of the shows I adore-and I won't name them because they're my friends-why no leads on their shows are women or of color, and I'm the one that gets lobbied about these things. And I'll answer them, I will. But I know what's going on here. It is a little insulting because, I'm like, God, what can I-oh, I'm sitting in it. I have 75 percent of the lines on the show.""

""And I'm like, oh wait, it's not like I'm running a country, I'm not a political figure. I'm someone who's writing a show and I want to use funny people,"" Kaling added. ""And it feels like it diminishes the incredibly funny women who do come on my show...I don't know, it's a little frustrating.""

And the answer is, I always want to do more because people should always be doing as much as they can, but my full-time job is not casting The Mindy Projec-t,"" Kaling said. ""My life is constantly disappointing people, politically or something."" Kaling is the show's director, writer and producer. She is also its star, playing obstetrician Mindy Lahiri. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, her father is Tamil born and was raised in Madras while her mother is Bengali and was raised in Mumbai. Kaling identifies as an Indian-American, although she told the panel at South by Southwest that she tried not to focus on that. ""I think one of the things that's been helpful to me is [that] I try not to think that much about how I'm an Indian-American,"" she said.

""I can't think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive. It's a distraction. I don't want to stop being who I am, but I can't rely on it."" However, she said that being an Indian-American woman in the comedy world was not without challenges. ""People think that you're not funny because of the way that you look, [but] you can get so hung up and say, am I the victim of this situation? Or be like, I'm in charge of it."" A study compiled by the University of California, Los Angeles and released last year at the 27th annual National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications conference found that ethnic minorities and women remained ""woefully under-represented"" on cable and broadcast programs as lead actors, writers and show creators. The same study revealed, ironically, that shows with more diverse casts generally drew larger audiences.

To the credit of Fox – the US network that airs The Mindy Project – it has been a long-time advocate of diversity on television. The network's chief operating officer, Joe Earley, told a 2013 executive conference that more diverse programming was financially beneficial. ""Not only are you going to have more chances of a show being made here, more chances of a show being a success on TV, more chances of making it into syndication, more chances of a show selling globally and making you millions of dollars, but you are going to bring more viewers to our air and keep us in business,"" Earley said. In an interview given to the online publication Jezebel in 2011, Kaling said that gender and race were connected. ""Even though casting for pilots and movies are open to most ethnicity for parts, there's just a scarcity of female parts in general in stuff,"" she said.

""And then, if one of the cast members is a minority, there's such a relief with producers that there's very little incentive to cast two people of colour, if that makes sense? ""I wish there were more women of colour on-screen in comedy, for sure. But I do think that's changing. All my favourite shows now compared to, say, even 10 years ago, have more diverse casts. It's slow, though."" The Mindy Project was renewed for a third season last week. It airs in Australia on the Seven Network.",

But when the time came to field questions from the mostly female audience, one woman posed this query: “You guys have a great, diverse set of characters, but was it a conscious decision for Mindy to be the only female doctor, and the only doctor color of show?” There were a couple of minutes of pleasant response, with co-panelists and Mindy co-stars Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally earnestly praising their female cast members. But by then, Kaling had lost patience: “I look at shows on TV, and this is going to just seem defensive, but I’m just gonna say it: I’m a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network television show, OK?”

Good for her. It gets annoying when you hear a blithering idiot ask canned questions like that. This is why I couldn’t be famous. I can do the whole acting thing, but having to sit and listen to stupid questions without bludgeoning the interviewer with a sock full of quarters would be impossible. Keep going, Mindy.

The audience applauded, but Kaling was just getting started. “I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks any of the shows I adore — and I won’t name them because they’re my friends — why no leads on their shows are women or of color, and I’m the one that gets lobbied about these things. And I’ll answer them, I will. But I know what’s going on here.” Some laughter (some of it nervous) echoed through the ballroom. “It is a little insulting because, I’m like, God, what can I — oh, I’m sitting in it. I have 75 percent of the lines on the show.”

Man, you have to feel for the reporter for asking such a ridiculous question. But, no, you asked for it.

“And I’m like, oh wait, it’s not like I’m running a country, I’m not a political figure,” she continued. “I’m someone who’s writing a show and I want to use funny people. And it feels like it diminishes the incredibly funny women who do come on my show… I don’t know, it’s a little frustrating.” And at this point, Pally piped up: “Well, we took two different tacks in the answer.”

Note to self: Bring my A-game when attending SXSW next year. Also, bring some flip-flops, beer, 3 changes of clothes, a super soaker, fake mustache, and a Ninja Turtle helicopter that can also punch. I’m not very good at packing.

Photo credit: FayesVision/WENN.com

Fans of Mindy Kaling get ready, because another book is coming your way. The comedian is proving to be quite the force in Hollywood this month with the renewal of her FOX show, The Mindy Project, and the release of her second book.

Kaling was at Austin’s SXSW festival on Sunday when she announced the big news. The audience got excited, but Kaling, true to form, asked the audience to hold their applause until they read the book.

She revealed her next publication while talking with Marie Claire‘s editor-in-chief, Anne Fulenwider, about her role as a female showrunner in Hollywood.

She didn’t share any details about the second book or when it will be published, but readers of her first book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns), know it will be hilarious. Her first outing as an author resulted in a New York Times-bestselling memoir as it focused on her childhood and the beginning stages of her career in Los Angeles.

The 34-year-old star has become quite an icon for women in power in Hollywood, not only for her gender, but also as a minority. However, don’t single her out because of this.

During the discussion she said, “I’m a f***ing Indian woman who has her own f***ing network television show. No one asks any of the [runners of other] shows I adore why there are no women of color as leads, and I get asked this.”

The TV actress also offered up some great advice to young women who are rising in the entertainment industry.

She shared, “Be really good. Have a great work ethic. But also be like, ‘S***, Michael Fassbender is so hot.'”

Spoken like a true Hollywood success story.",

Special to USA TODAY

AUSTIN — Move over Justin Bieber. Newly crowned 'queen of comedy' Mindy Kaling proved one of the hottest celebrity sightings in town during Austin's SXSW festival this week, as Seth Meyers and other stars made appearances at the event.

Kaling is the creator, executive producer, writer, and star of The Mindy Project, which was recently renewed for a third season. She also revealed that she's working on a follow-up to her 2011 bestselling book Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?

With the Roku Lounge as the backdrop, Kaling spoke with us one-on-one, as a crowd of around 500 people gathered as closely as they could to listen in. At one point, a young woman sitting cross-legged on the floor about five feet away gushed over Kaling's brightly colored beaded necklace, before asking if she could sit on the star's pink pantsuit-clad lap.

Kaling responded demurely before shifting back to more burning hot topics, such as why she doesn't like watching TV shows on a smartphone or tablet, ""It's too small for me, I need to be surrounded [by a big screen] … I don't find it satisfying to watch an episode of say, Walking Dead, like I can't be scared if it's that little [size], and be like 'Rick run, run, it's a walker,' if it's on a screen that [tiny].""

Kaling also admitted that even though she's a prolific tweeter and loves to share her life experiences via Instagram (including a recent trip to the White House), she does not consider herself to be very tech savvy,

""The fact that I can stream things on TV with my little Apple remote and I haven't lost it -- it's the size of a thimble -- I'm like a B-minus level.""

http://www.austinmonthly.com/Austin-Amplified/March-2014/SXSW-2014-Day-3-Recap/,entertainment,"Here are some things we saw and experienced on the third day of SXSW 2014.

Running the Show: TV’s New Queen of Comedy

Marie Claire editor-in-chief Anne Fulenwider hosted this panel with actor, writer and producer Mindy Kaling and her fellow The Mindy Project cast members Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally. The ballroom was already half-full an hour before the panel, which speaks greatly to Kaling’s general popularity. Fulenwider and Kaling chatted about the fun-factor of Twitter, her creative process and how NBC, who she had worked for during her tenure as a writer for The Office, passed on her show before FOX picked it up. After a few question, Barinholtz and Pally were invited on stage to talk about how Kaling is as a boss, to which Barinholtz jokingly quipped that she’s like Kim Jong-un, but then said “she’s the best boss I’ve ever had.” The three castmates on stage together gave the audience a peek of what it’s like in the writing room and on set of The Mindy Project—they had the whole crowd cracking up with every one-liner and spot-on impression. A more serious moment came during the Q&A session when a audience member asked why the show doesn’t have more female doctors (Kaling plays an OBGYN) or doctors of color. Kaling was clearly frustrated with this question and said, “I know this is going to sound defensive, but I’m going to say it anyway: I’m a f**king Indian woman, who has her own f**cking show,” which elicited cheers from the audience and a regretful reply from the asker. Kaling also announced that The Mindy Project would be returning for a third season and that she’s writing a follow-up to her best-selling book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?.

The Secrets Behind Addictive Storytelling

This panel was already impressive before it started: It was packed to max capacity with people standing up in the back rows and sitting down on every square inch of floor space to hear what these industry experts had to say. The discussion, led by Hearst Magazine Digital Media president Troy Young, was an all-encompassing look at how different media industries, from magazine publishing to reality show production, create “addictive” and engaging content for consumers. Jonathan Perelman, the senior vice president of Buzzfeed, which is known for its highly clickable listicles and quizzes, spoke about successful brand-sponsored content, the popularity of the listicle and how Buzzfeed is trying to get it’s investigative and longform stories as highly shared as their cat videos. Joanna Coles, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan, touched on compelling stories that ended up being featured in the magazine, including one about a transgender musician, saying that in order for content to be addictive, it has to be good quality and it has to resonate with people in an emotional way. A&E executive Bob DeBitetto spoke from the successful television network’s perspective saying that part of the reason of why current shows, especially dramatic series like True Detective and A&E’s own Bates Motel, are particularly captivating is that great film and theater actors are migrating to television and producing an elevated level of content. He also revealed that his network spends a good amount of time discussing the shareability and the social media impact a show will have from research and focus groups, and having that addictive quality is important to networks with the proliferation of binge-watching shows that are available to viewers all at once like Netflix's House of Cards.

The Heart Machine

The Heart Machine, directed by Zachary Wigon, is a love story, or perhaps more of a heartbreak story, set in the digital age. The film takes place in present day New York City, where Cody and Virginia, who’ve never met in real life, are carrying out a relationship over Skype, because while Cody is in NYC, Virginia is doing a six-month fellowship in Berlin. Cody, played by John Gallagher Jr., who you may recognize from HBO’s The Newsroom, starts to become suspicious of Virginia’s whereabouts, believing that she’s lying to him and actually living in the East Village because of details he’s noticed during their Skype chats. His unconfirmed fears drive him to edge of madness: He stalks people who might know her and places she might frequent, hoping to get some answers, all while creeping out everyone he comes into contact with. Meanwhile, Virginia keeps up the ruse of being Berlin, but actually does live in the East Village like Cody suspects, and as the audience goes on this suspenseful journey to figure out the truth about this horribly messed-up relationship, the ending feels like a punch to the gut. Cody and Virginia, and everyone left in their relationship’s wake was incredibly well acted, and the point was driven home by the affecting ending: At the end of the day, it’s damaged, selfish people that ruin a relationship—not the often-demonized digital devices.

The American writer/comedian Mindy Kaling, whose credits include the US adaptation of The Office and her own series, The Mindy Project, has delivered a scathing assessment of the gender and race gap on television.

""I look at shows on TV, and this is going to seem defensive, but I'm just going to say it, I'm a f--king Indian woman who has her own f--king network television show,"" Kaling told a packed session at the film, music and interactive conference South By Southwest.

""I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks these other shows [run by white men] why there are no women or women of colour,"" she said.

Kaling was responding to a question about about ""race in the world of TV"" put to her by the session's moderator, Marie Claire editor-in-chief Ann Fulenwider.""People have a higher expectation for me. They say, why aren't you doing enough? And the answer is, I always want to do more because people should always be doing as much as they can, but my fulltime job is not casting The Mindy Project,"" Kaling said.

""My life is constantly disappointing people, politically. Or something."" Kaling is the show's director, writer and producer. She is also its star, playing obstetrician Mindy Lahiri.She was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Her father is Tamil born and raised in Madras and her mother was Bengali and raised in Mumbai.

""I think one of the things that's been helpful to me is I try not to think that much about how I'm an Indian American,"" she told the audience in Austin, Texas.""I can't think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive.

According to a study compiled by the American university UCLA, and released in 2013 at the 27th annual National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications conference, ethnic minorities and women remain ""woefully under-represented"" on cable and broadcast programs as lead actors, writers and show creators.

Mindy Kaling briefed the audience on her hot pink outfit immediately upon taking the stage at her SXSW conversation with Marie Claire Editor-in-Chief Anne Fulenwider yesterday: ""I dressed for the Austin I thought it would be,"" she said, acknowledging the unfortunately low temperature. ""This is Antarctica. I look crazy. I look like my plane got stopped in Miami.""

Kaling exudes comfort-in-her-own-skin and looks terrific in bright colors, so she quickly settled into conversation with the apparel update out of the way. Fulenwider opened the discussion by pulling out a quote where Mindy said she can assemble a tweet in 45 seconds, and made her do it on the spot—it took 17 seconds for Mindy to compose this (bonus points for the hashtag). The conversation covered Kaling's career and her experience in the world of media from the perspective of a young woman of color—questions she's answered again and again, which yielded some very honest frustration and fatigue on her part. After the jump, some of the most brilliant, genuine gems from the conversation.

Building the role of Mindy Lahiri: Because Tina Fey's Liz Lemon so perfectly captured the career that Mindy Kaling actually lives and breathes, she didn't want to mimic that for her show. It was important that her character have a job that echoed her own work life—long hours, hard work, and success—but in a different venue. She also noted that she had to ""give Mindy Lahiri a career where she was successful and helped people"" in order for the audience to take her seriously. ""Your character can't say 'I hate recycling' and be an assistant editor at Vogue because she'd be a horrible person."" Fulenwider paused and replied, ""No comment.""

Mindy Lahiri's suspiciously hot boyfriends: ""I hire men to make out with me. It's prostitution.""

Being constantly compared to all other women in television: It was evident that Kaling is weighed down from being measured against Poehler/Fey/Dunham, or any female who happens to write, produce, and act. ""They want to put you in a pageant you never wanted to be in. No one ever says 'Is Seth Rogan too Steve Carell-y?'""

Attaining role model status: She's constantly being asked to speak at engagements that discuss the novel prospect of women working, or women of color working (another topic she's been asked to death). ""I have to leave my job to go talk about how it's important for women to work."" When it comes to being patted on the back for the ""important strides"" she's making for women/women of color (depending on who's patting), Kaling notes that it's weird to be looked at like a political figure when all she's trying to do is write a funny TV show—and happens to be an Indian-American female. ""I can't stop to think about my 'legacy' because it's a distraction.""

The mood thus far had been jovial at “Running the Show: TV’s New Queen of Comedy,” a Marie Claire-sponsored panel discussion of The Mindy Project, spotlighting the show’s creator/runner/star Mindy Kaling, and the topics were fairly innocuous (her writing process, her next book, the recent Mindy/Danny cliffhanger). But when the time came to field questions from the mostly female audience, one woman posed this query: “You guys have a great, diverse set of characters, but was it a conscious decision for Mindy to be the only female doctor, and the only doctor color of show?” There were a couple of minutes of pleasant response, with co-panelists and Mindy co-stars Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally earnestly praising their female cast members. But by then, Kaling had lost patience: “I look at shows on TV, and this is going to just seem defensive, but I’m just gonna say it: I’m a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network television show, OK?”

And I’ll answer them, I will. But I know what’s going on here.” Some laughter (some of it nervous) echoed through the ballroom. “It is a little insulting because, I’m like, God, what can I — oh, I’m sitting in it. I have 75 percent of the lines on the show.”

“And I’m like, oh wait, it’s not like I’m running a country, I’m not a political figure,” she continued. “I’m someone who’s writing a show and I want to use funny people. And it feels like it diminishes the incredibly funny women who do come on my show… I don’t know, it’s a little frustrating.” And at this point, Pally piped up: “Well, we took two different tacks in the answer.”

You have to sympathize with Kaling, who has found herself in the position, throughout her show’s run, of doing much but being criticized (as in, say, the frequent criticism that her character only dates white men) for not doing more. It’s easy to grind an artist down with that kind of a barrage, and her argument that she just wants “to use funny people,” along with a later insistence that “my full-time job is not the casting director for The Mindy Project,” can sound like some kind of an (admittedly distant) cousin to Jerry Seinfeld’s recent comments about caring only about funny, to the detriment of diversity.

Does Kaling get off the hook because of the giant strides in television she herself represents? Sure thing. But the pressures of having to be all things to all people can take their toll — most obviously in the extensive retoolings and cast overhauls that have occurred throughout her show’s two-season run. Asked about her personal strategy for creating real change, Kaling certainly doesn’t come up short on ambition: “I feel that I can just be successful, hire people that I think are cool, and try to live my life in a way that doesn’t cause embarrassment or shame to people. And try to be, at this point, a role model, and be on good behavior… And try to do a show that doesn’t offend people too much and isn’t irresponsible.”

The sheer magnitude of that laundry lists prompted some chuckles from the SXSW audience; they were realizing, the more she added to it, that The Mindy Project might be a more accurate title than they’d previously thought.",

http://jezebel.com/mindy-project-picked-up-for-season-3-1540043222,entertainment,"Today, at the grand conference of cool pop culture SXSW, Editor in Chief of Marie Claire Anne Fulenwider ran a panel discussion entitled ""Running the Show: TV's New Queen of Comedy"" with Mindy Kaling. And! It was announced that there would indeed be a Season 3 for The Mindy Project! Kaling, who was later joined by her co-stars (and employees?) Adam Pally and Ike Barinholtz talked about all sorts of things from Twitter to navigating TV as a woman and an Indian-American:

""It's challenging to get your own show no matter what…One of the things that's been helpful to me is that I try not to think that much about the fact that I'm Indian-American. I've felt that constantly people assume I'm not funny. People will think that you're not funny because of the way that you look.""

Maybe one sweet day, brown people won't feel discomfort with being Indian and American and funny. While we were all sitting and waiting for that moment to come, Kaling attended a Marie Claire dinner in her honor because whatever, it's fucking Sunday.

http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2014/03/mindy-kaling-sxsw,entertainment,"When Mindy Kaling took the SXSW stage, she was wearing a hot-pink, sleeveless ensemble on an unusually cold and rainy morning in Austin, Texas: “I dressed for the Austin that I thought it would be,” she said, “I look like I went to Miami and my flight stopped here. It’s Antarctica here.”

The actress-comedian-writer-producer, currently the star and creator of The Mindy Project, started off the hour-long panel, led by Marie Claire Editor-in-Chief (and Vanity Fair alum) Anne Fulenwider, by proving another talent—speed tweeting. Kaling, who has said, “If you can’t tweet in 45 seconds, it’s not the medium for you,” tweeted out a message (Miami? Austin? Antarctica? Where am I? #sxsw) on Fulenwider’s phone in just 17 seconds. How does she feel about her social-media presence? “It’s mostly just for me to tease my writing staff,” says Kaling, who has 2.7 million Twitter followers and counting. “It’s just for fun. If it were to become more than that, I wouldn’t do it.”

The five-time Emmy-nominated actress, who says she always knew she wanted to write her own show one day, went on to discuss her creative process and what it’s like in the writing room of her successful Fox TV series, which was recently renewed for a third season. “People contribute and then things sprout from that,” she says of working with her writers. “It’s like having really creative conversations with your funniest friends.”

Two such friends—castmates Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally—joined Kaling and Fulenwider on stage to talk about their boss. “Much like Kim Jong Un…he rules with an iron fist, but sometimes in that fist is a rose,” joked Barinholtz of Kaling’s role as creator, director, and producer of the show, continuing, “She’s the best boss I’ve ever had.”

When asked if she liked being the person in charge, Kaling responded, “The one thing I do miss is being a part of the gang.__ __It’s such a fun job, there are hardly any complaints. The only complaint is that I want to be able to be like: ‘Fuck our boss!’”

So, what’s her secret to balancing her many roles on the show? “The reason I’ve been successful is my Richard Nixon-like focus,” she says.

An audience member asked Kaling, who published her best-selling book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns), in 2012, if she had another book on the way. “I’m writing a book right now,” she replied. “I’m very excited about it. I’m gonna be finishing it probably at the end of this year.”

Another audience member wanted to know more about the show’s mid-season cliffhanger, when Kaling’s on-screen character Mindy Lahiri and co-worker Danny Castellano (played by Chris Messina)finally kiss. “It became a matter of not if they should do it, but when,” Kaling said of the long-awaiting smooch. “The name of the first episode [after the mid-season break] is ‘French Me, You Idiot.’”

""I'm a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network show,"" exclaimed an exasperated Mindy Kaling at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, when asked by a member of the 2,000-person crowd why there aren’t more women of colour on “The Mindy Project.”

""No one asks any of these other shows that I adore -- and I won’t name them because they’re my friends -- why no leads on their show are women or women of colour, but I’m the one who gets all of these things.

“It is a little insulting. I don’t run the country, I’m not a political figure, I’m someone writing a show and I want to use funny people. What should I be doing? It’s a little frustrating to me,"" Kaling continued.

“People have a higher expectation for me. They say, 'why aren't you doing more?' The answer is: I always want to be doing more, because people should always be doing as much as they possibly can. But my full-time job is not a casting director of 'The Mindy Project,' my job is producer-writer-star.""

Being Kaling, she did this quite sweetly, and reassured the well-meaning questioner who was somewhat aghast at the response. But her gender and race are obviously issues that come up more than she'd like.

""I have to leave my job to go talk about how women need jobs as a woman of colour,"" she recounts at one point to panel interviewer Anne Fulenwider of Marie Claire. ""And if I say, 'I have to do my job,' then they say, 'but you're not supporting women then!' 'But I have to do my job.' 'Well, then screw you!' My life is constantly disappointing people politically.”

She adds that she's rather jealous of her male colleagues who aren’t incessantly compared to each other like women in entertainment are.

""You don't hear, ‘Is Will Ferrell too Steve Carell-y? Is Danny McBride too Aziz-like? There's this mentality that there can only be one woman who is successful and funny and running their own show and if there's more than that you must hate each other, and no.”

Kaling, who attributes her success to her ""singular, crazy Richard Nixon-like focus"" and said she’s currently working on a second book, has been on network television since she was 24. She began as a writer-star of “The Office” (Kelly Kapoor 4evah!) before graduating to become the boss of her own show, “The Mindy Project,” which she told the crowd has been picked up for a third season.

“It’s challenging to get your own show, no matter what. I’ve only lived my life once so I can’t compare it,” she said when asked earlier by Fulenwider about how much her race and gender may have hindered her.

“One of the things that has been helpful to me is that I try to not to think that much about the fact that I’m an Indian-American. So many people will look at me and think ‘you’re different from everyone else.’ But I can’t. I can’t think about my legacy, it’s a distraction. I don’t want to deny who I am, because it’s so important to me, but I can’t rely on it.

“In New York coming up as a standup, people will think you’re not funny because of the way that you look, so you say, 'I’m not going to think in these terms at all.' You have to ignore it. That’s my advice to people. You can’t get hung up on thinking, ‘Am I the victim of this situation?’ No, I’m in charge of it.”",

Sunday. ""And the only way to combat that is to just be really good and also be those other things ... and have a great work ethic.""",

Is there anything Mindy Kaling doesn't like about being the boss?

""I have to leave my job to talk about how important it is to have a job as a woman of color,"" Kaling said at SXSW in Austin, Texas where she spoke on a panel with her Mindy Project costars Adam Pally and Ike Barinholtz, moderated by Marie Claire editor-in-chief Ann Fulenwider. ""My life is constantly disappointing people, politically. Or something.""

Kaling spoke to a packed room of around 2,000 fans about how hard it is, not necessarily to be an Indian American woman showrunner, but just to get one's own network show period.

""I look at shows on TV — and this is going to seem defensive, but I'm just going to say it — I'm a fucking Indian woman who has her own television show,"" Kaling said. ""I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks these other shows [run by white men] why there are no women or women of color.""

Kaling continued, ""People have a higher expectation for me. They say, why aren't you doing enough? And the answer is, I always want to do more because people should always be doing as much as they can, but my fulltime job is not casting The Mindy Project."" (Though Kaling stars, directs, writes, and produces the show, she says she would call herself an ""actress"" if she had to put it in a word.)

But she did acknowledge success in television and comedy as an Indian American woman wasn't easy. When she was doing improv, she said, she noticed that ""people think that you're not funny because of the way that you look."" But, she added, ""You can get so hung up and say, am I the victim of this situation? Or be like, I'm in charge of it.""

Getting to her position now ""has been challenging,"" Kaling admitted. ""I think one of the things that's been helpful to me is I try not to think that much about how I'm an Indian American. I can't think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive — it's a distraction. I don't want to stop being who I am… but I can't rely on it.""

Kaling credits her success to her ""singular, Richard Nixon-like focus."" She said her approach to work is similar to her parents', who worked hard but didn't talk about ""being noble or hardworking.""

""They just did it,"" Kaling said. ""And I think there's something to that that I find very admirable.""

http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/10/lena-dunham-at-sxsw-2014-girls-women-are-being-typecast,entertainment,"The creator of HBO’s hit show compares lack of film work for female stars with that of co-star Adam Driver, who’s been offered roles by Spielberg and the Coen brothers

Lena Dunham has compared the recent success of Girls star Adam Driver with that of his female co-stars and cited the difference as symptomatic of Hollywood’s attitude towards women.



Dunham, giving Monday’s keynote lecture at the SXSW film festival, said she was happy for Driver, but that the variety of film roles he had been offered since appearing in Girls contrasted sharply with the parts offered to its female cast members.



“People are ready to see Adam play a million different guys in one year – from lotharios to villains to nerds. Meanwhile [co-stars] Allison Williams, Jemima Kirke and Zosia Mamet are still waiting for parts they can get interested in”.



Dunham said there were few opportunities for women of the Girls cast past being typecast as “high school ditzes”. Of the female cast members of HBO’s cult show only Mamet has taken film work. Her movie career predates the show’s 2012 launch and has included small roles in Lisa Cholodenko’s The Kids are All Right and Noah Baumbach’s Greenberg. Meanwhile, Driver has been offered large parts in films directed by the Coen brothers and Stephen Spielberg. He is rumoured to be playing the villain in JJ Abrams’s reboot of the Star Wars franchise.

Dunham’s own film career has been limited to starring roles in her own movies, a role in Joe Swanberg’s upcoming Happy Christmas and bit-part in Girls producer Judd Apatow’s This Is 40. “There’s no place for me in the studio system,” she said.

Tiny Furniture, Dunham’s second feature, won best narrative feature at the 2011 SXSW festival. During her speech at this year’s festival she thanked Janet Pierson, SXSW’s head of film, for launching her career and introducing her to “the only part of my life I’ve really enjoyed”.

Girls will return for a fourth season in 2015.

Everyone who watches HBO's ""Girls,"" and even those who actively try to avoid it, knows that the show's creator and lead actress Lena Dunham really likes to be naked onscreen.

When Dunham hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" this past weekend, the SNL writers lampooned her penchant for random nudity by relocating Dunham's character Hannah Horvath and her bizarre boyfriend Adam from Brooklyn to The Garden of Eden in a sinfully funny skit.

Hannah, as the first female in the world, refuses to put on a fig leaf, begs God to get her a book deal, and seeks advice from a serpent with Shoshanna's head and a typically weird Shosh hair-do.

The highlight of the parody is SNL cast member Taran Killam's dead-on impersonation of Adam.

Sample dialogue:

Adam: Aren't you going to put on a fig leaf or something?

Hannah: I don't see why that's necessary at all. I'm not going to conform to society's demands for me.

Enjoy this biblical send-up of ""Girls"":

www.youtube.com/embed/Y6dqA-KQ3kE?feature=player_detailpage

Girls creator, writer and star Lena Dunham made her debut on Saturday Night Live over the weekend. Amongst the many standout moments were Dunham’s biblical parody of Girls, the SNL take on Scandal and guest appearances from Liam Neeson and Jon Hamm. All in all, it was a magnificently entertaining episode… as long as you don’t mind seeing Dunham naked — again.

The newest SNL parody of Girls was by far the highlight of the night. The skit took place in the Garden of Eden with Dunham playing as Eve and Taran Killam as Adam Driver playing Adam. Killam’s hair flicking, twitchy and sighing version of Adam was a spot-on impersonation of Girls‘ leading man Adam. Meanwhile, Dunham brought all of Hannah’s sense of entitlement and immense slowness to Eve’s life as Adam’s wife. The standout moment came when God warned her to stay away from the Tree of Knowledge.

“Are you saying that in, like, a ‘I suggest you don’t?'” Dunham asks. “Or in like a ‘Definitely don’t’ but with a side of ‘Maybe do.'”

God’s response, “Well, Eve, you’re clearly gonna do whatever you feel like soooo, whatever.”

We definitely believe that’s how God handles any situation involving our generation.

Later in the night, SNL‘s new cast member Sasheer Zamata took on Scandal‘s Olivia Pope and assigned nearly impossible tasks to her team. Dunham played the chipper, idiotic “Kelsey,” incapable of handling any assignment on her own. It showcased Dunham at her most annoying… and we loved it.

www.youtube.com/embed/nT5CNaHchPY?feature=player_detailpage

The show even started with a message to Russia from Neeson. Later, Hamm stopped by and women everywhere threw their panties at the screen. You always know it’s time for Mad Men to return when Hamm starts showing up on Saturday Night Live! We’re just jealous that Dunham was there to meet him and not us.",
http://variety.com/2014/biz/news/sxsw-lena-dunham-on-women-work-and-the-tweet-she-regrets-1201128689/,entertainment,"AUSTIN — “Something has to change and I’m trying” — that’s the message “Girls” creator Lena Dunham delivered with her keynote at SXSW on Monday, addressing the differences in opportunities for male and female actors in Hollywood as well as her distaste for Republicans.

Adam Driver, a co-star of her HBO series, has been offered parts playing “villains, Lotharios and nerds all in one year,” she said of Hollywood’s gender imbalance, whereas “Girls” stars Zosia Mamet and Allison Williams have yet to see parts that offer them a chance “to stretch their legs,” Dunham said.

Dunham added that she does not care for ratings (though she admits HBO wishes she did), Deadline Hollywood and Republicans (“I’m sure there are some good ones. I just haven’t met them yet”).

Her 45-minute keynote largely ran though her life, growing up in New York with two artist parents (a painter and photographer) and her beg-borrow-and-steal mentality to filmmaking (she maxed out a credit card, donated her $5,000 worth of babysitting funds, borrowed money from her parents and her best friend’s parents to make her early DIY movies). The hyphenate constantly emphasized the importance of having a “ferocious work ethic” and to be perpetually working on something – a script, screenplay, short – anything. Creators should be creating, she said.

She traced her SXSW experiences, from having “Creative Nonfiction” rejected one year at the festival and then accepted the next, to feeling like her entree into the industry really began when she won an award in Austin for 2010’s “Tiny Furniture.”

The 27-year-old also made sure several times to apologize for the “molestation tweet” that she sent and promptly deleted. Her account tweeted, “I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy. SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.” In back-to-back tweets she added, “But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.”

Dunham also joked about the tweet, which the audience immediately forgave her for, a palpable “ooohhh” echoing through the auditorium.

The two-time Golden Globe winner also spoke about budgets, or the lack thereof, saying, “Lack of budget is no longer an excuse. (I realized) holding up a camera and letting people wander around documentary style is no longer acceptable.”

Dunham said she knows “there isn’t a place right now for me in studio-funded movies.” By holding down four jobs on “Girls,” she said she’s trying to change the role of women in Hollywood. To bolster her point she cited Cate Blanchett’s Oscar acceptance speech and a quote from dance legend Martha Graham.

She fielded questions for 20 minutes, ranging from her favorite “Girls” episode (the one that aired this past weekend because of the host of women, including June Squibb, with whom she worked) to a guy who admitted that he and his fraternity brothers watch her show every weekend looking for advice.",

She had a great weekend hosting on Saturday Night Live, but Lena Dunham caused quite an uproar on Twitter after her gig. The Girls creator responded to some of her fans who talked about her nude sketch about Adam and Eve with the hilarious spin on her HBO series.

When a fan tweeted, “you don’t always have to get naked,” the 27-year-old star sure had a comeback.

She quipped on the social media site, “Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me!”

That comment really got her followers in an uproar because it implied taboo topics like molestation and incest. As a result, Dunham quickly deleted the tweet and then had to write a few apologies on her account.

It isn’t easy being in the spotlight, but celebrities have to take into account that not everyone will find their humor funny. Since Dunham was so quick to see her mistake and pull down the offending tweet, she found a lot of supporters who applauded her.

It looks like Dunham knows how to control her own publicity and keep the fans in her court.",
http://www.contactmusic.com/article/critics-review-lena-dunham-hosting-saturday-night-live-jim-parsons_4103892,entertainment,"So, reviews for Lena Dunham’s stint hosting Saturday Night Live have been a very mixed bag. While her sitcom Girls has been met with international acclaim, Lena also has her fair share of critics out there. Particularly those who slam the 27 year old for her regular nudity on Girls and, well, pretty much every other appearance she does. Her SNL hosting job last Saturday to mark International Women’s Day was no exception.

Funny woman Lena Dunham hosted last weekend's Saturday Night Live

The highlight for us, and many others who reviewed the sketch show, had to be the ‘Biblical Movie‘ sketch. Appearing as Eve, Lena characteristically wears no clothes, alongside SNL’s Taran Killam, who played Adam (Driver). Genius. The result was a smorgasbord of feminism, while Lena also customarily poked fun at herself (appearing surrounded by decimated apples).

Sadly, Lena’s opening monologue wasn’t received with universal praise. The Daily Beast commented “From her opening monologue, Dunham was charming. But not effortlessly charming, which is usually the modifier when someone uses “charming” as an adjective. Dunham does this peculiar thing where her charm comes with very intentional effort. There’s something about her line delivery that makes the sort of sophisticated precociousness she gives off seem carefully crafted”. Ouch. Although they did admit that the rest of the show was, on the whole, stronger than recent episodes of the sketch show.

Watch Lena Dunham arriving for the Letterman show:



Screen Crush concluded that the episode overall scored a B- and felt ""‘like buying the generic brand ‘Saturday Night Live’"". Any comedian undertaking the task of hosting Saturday Night Live has got an extremely daunting job on their hands. Hosts of the show are scrutinised by the world and their performance is cited for years to come when people discuss whether or not they truly are a great comedian or not, depending on how their SNL played out.

Unfortunately for Lena, despite all the promo work that went in to bigging up her big night, Saturday’s SNL averaged a 4.1 household rating and a 2.1 in adults aged 18-49 with Local People Meters. This means that household ratings were down 11% and 19% in the 18-49 market (the younger half of which is Lena’s target audience) in comparison to Jim Parsons’ SNL the week beforehand.

Big Bang Theory's Jim Parsons hosted SNL the week before Lena

Lena's performance on Saturday had many pros and cons. Lena certainly proved herself able to pull off a successful sketch as well as adequaetly hosting, although doubts about her ability to play anyone other than a diluted or accentuated version of herself have been raised.

Did you watch Lena Dunham hosting Saturday Night Live? Do you agree with The Daily Beast that her charm isn’t effortless? What do you make of Lena's ability to play roles which are outside of her comfort zone, such as her Liza Minelli bit?",

And even though the episode left much to be desired, there were still some must see moments that will for sure keep the internet buzzing for at least the next few hours.

I really wanted to enjoy the Girls star during her first stint hosting the sketch show. I really did. But it just seemed as if everything was happening around her instead of because of or to her.

This happens often though and usually isn’t noticeable until a chameleon like Melissa McCarthy takes the reigns.

Here though, are a few of the moments in which Lena proved that she truly is a comedic genius.

THE OPENING MONOLOGUE

Lena started strong and quickly began making fun of the nudity she is so often criticized for. We were very happy that Ms. Dunham chose to avoid a musical opening, as that has been done to death people…TO DEATH.

“OHH CHILD” DIGITAL SHORT

This short is hysterical, because it’s so smart. You won’t see the end coming from a million miles away and Lena’s frustration throughout is spot on.

BIBLICAL MOVIE

Maybe it’s because I love Girls so much, but I would 100% see The Garden of Eden as interpreted by Shoshanna, Hannah, and Adam.

“SCANDAL”

I usually don’t like these sketches, because they alienate anyone who doesn’t watch the source material. This time around though, Lena plays a character who says exactly what the audience is thinking.

That wig though….not good.

WEAKEST SKETCH: THE KATT WILLIAMS SHOW

Lena as Liza seems like it should have been a good idea.

And, for the record, Ellen DeGeneresdid not call Liza Minnellia transvestite. She called her a Drag Queen. Yes, there is a difference.

SURPRISE GUEST

In a sketch that was kind of funny, Mad Men star Jon Hammdropped in to a very awkward situation.

Any follow-up questions?",
http://www.celebuzz.com/2014-03-10/lena-dunham-is-sorry-for-using-molestation-as-a-punch-line/,entertainment,"Lena Dunham isn’t afraid to leave little to the imagination as evidenced by her nakedness on Girls and stripping down yet again during her debut on SNL. And she equally isn’t afraid to speak her mind on Twitter. For example, when she defended Dylan Farrow’s allegations that her adopted father, Woody Allen, sexually abused her as a young child.

So, in turn, making fun of molestation may have been taking it too far.

And she’s willing to admit her mistake.

After taking it all off in an SNL skit about Adam and Eve over the weekend, an online fan tweeted, “you don’t always have to get naked!”– leading the 27-year old to quip: “Please tell that to my uncle, mister. He’s been making me!”

As you can probably imagine, the playful retort wasn’t well received among social media fans far and wide.

So, just as quickly as she made the ill-conceived joke, she took it down and apologized for offending anyone.
