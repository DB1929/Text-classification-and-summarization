It did not provide further details on their identities.\n\nAl Ain is near the border of Oman and is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) inland from the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi. The UAE is a federation of seven emirates that includes Dubai.\n\nThe five infected paramedics have been placed under quarantine and people who have recently been treated by them are being checked for infection. The agency said the five were found to have contracted the virus during routine check-ups.\n\nMERS belongs to a family of viruses known as coronaviruses that include both the common cold and SARS, which killed some 800 people in a global outbreak in 2003. It can cause fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure. It was first identified in 2012 in the Middle East, where most cases since have been diagnosed.\n\nWhile MERS does not seem to spread as quickly between people as SARS did, it does appear to be more deadly. Recent studies suggest that camels are the main source of the disease, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe WHO says a total of 212 people have been confirmed to have contracted the disease since September 2012, and 88 of them have died.\n\nAmong those recently infected is a 52 year-old man in Jordan with underlying medical conditions who recently visited Saudi Arabia and is now hospitalized in stable condition, the WHO announced Friday.\n\nSaudi Arabia is at the center of the MERS outbreak. It has recorded 66 deaths so far.\n\nHealth authorities in the kingdom earlier this week closed the emergency unit at one of the biggest hospitals in Jiddah for disinfection after 11 people in the city became infected, including two who later died. A nurse at the hospital was among those who fell ill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther Mideast countries that have reported cases of infection include Kuwait, Oman and Qatar. A small number of cases have been diagnosed in Europe and North Africa.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nAll PH missions on alert for coronavirus\n\nOFWs seek PH help on coping with new virus\n\nDOH asked to educate OFWs in Saudi about deadly virus\n\nRead Next\n\nLATEST STORIES\n\nMOST READ', 'Al Ain is near the border of Oman and is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) inland from the UAE capital, Abu Dhabi.\nThe five infected paramedics have been placed under quarantine and people who have recently been treated by them are being checked for infection.\nThe agency said the five were found to have contracted the virus during routine check-ups.\nWhile MERS does not seem to spread as quickly between people as SARS did, it does appear to be more deadly.\nAmong those recently infected is a 52 year-old man in Jordan with underlying medical conditions who recently visited Saudi Arabia and is now hospitalized in stable condition, the WHO announced Friday.']"

The majority of Mers infections in the UAE have occurred among elderly, chronically-ill people.\n\nThe announcement was made in order to ensure transparency and keep residents informed, the MoI announced on its Twitter page.\n\nIt added that people who have recently been in contact with the paramedics have also been reached to ensure that they are healthy.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO), as well as the Embassy of Philippines, has been informed about the latest cases, the MoH source said.\n\nAs of the latest update released by the WHO on Thursday, 211 people worldwide have been infected by Mers-CoV since September 2012, and 88 patients have succumbed to the disease.\n\nThis count does not include the Filipino paramedics in the UAE.\n\nHealth experts have said that the transmission of the virus, which has a 40 to 50 per cent mortality rate, is still limited.\n\nPrecaution urged\n\nBut the WHO urges healthcare workers to take strict precautions.\n\n“Health-care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control. It is not always possible to identify patients with Mers-CoV easily because some have mild or unusual symptoms.\n\n""For this reason, it is important that workers apply standards [and] precautions consistently with all patients — regardless of their diagnosis — in all work practices all the time,” the WHO’s disease outbreak report states.\n\nThe entity recommends that medical professionals guard against droplets when caring for all patients displaying symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and wear contact and eye protection when treating a probable or confirmed case of Mers-CoV infection.\n\n“Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test is negative,” the WHO report adds.\n\nIn July last year, four medical professionals from two hospitals in Abu Dhabi were also infected by Mers after they had taken care of another patient with the disease.\n\nThey were all aged less than 40 years, and two of them did not develop symptoms of the illness. The other two patients had mild respiratory symptoms and were soon declared to be in stable condition.\n\nSaudi Mers cases\n\n\n\nThe Mers death and quarantine in the UAE comes four days after the emergency unit at King Fahad Hospital in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah was shuttered as a precautionary measure amid reports that several people fell ill with Mers coronavirus.\n\nEarlier this week, Saudi health authorities reported the deaths of another two men and four new cases of Mers, bringing the death toll from the respiratory disease in the worst-hit country to 66.\n\nAt least 11 medical staff have been reported to have contracted the virus, a spokesperson at the King Fahad hospital said.', 'Abu Dhabi: Six paramedics have been infected by the Middle East Respiratory coronavirus (Mers-CoV) and one of them has died, the UAE Ministry of Interior (MoI) confirmed in a statement on Friday.\nAs of the latest update released by the WHO on Thursday, 211 people worldwide have been infected by Mers-CoV since September 2012, and 88 patients have succumbed to the disease.\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with Mers-CoV easily because some have mild or unusual symptoms.\n“Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test is negative,” the WHO report adds.\nThe other two patients had mild respiratory symptoms and were soon declared to be in stable condition.']"

The two survivors are both healthcare workers, according to a machine-translated statement that originally appeared in Arabic.\n\nThe paramedics worked for the same ambulance section in the city of Al Ain, according to a statement today from the UAE\'s interior ministry. It said the infections were detected during periodic medical exams.\n\nThe ministry said the surviving paramedics have been placed in isolation and that health officials are tracing patients transported to hospitals by the ambulance company to see if there are any other MERS-CoV infections.\n\nUAE\'s six new infections boost its number of MERS-CoV cases to 27.\n\nNews of more health workers sickened by the virus stokes more concerns about their safety and questions about how the virus is spreading in medical settings. The infections in the paramedics occurred as Saudi Arabia battles a cluster of MERS-CoV infections in Jeddah, which led one of the hospitals to temporarily shutter its emergency department this week.\n\nJordanian case\n\nJordan\'s health ministry notified the WHO of its latest case on Apr 9, which involves a 52-year-old man with underlying medical conditions who visited Saudi Arabia between Mar 20 and Mar 29, according to a WHO statement today.\n\nHe got sick on Mar 25 and visited a hospital in Jeddah, then returned to Jordan on Mar 29, where he visited a hospital in Amman the same day and returned on Apr 2.

The new cases bring the Saudi MERS-CoV count to 185, including 68 deaths.\n\nThe new cases add to a rash of Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV infections reported over the past week, and, like the ones announced today, some of the patients have been health workers in Jeddah. The cluster of infections in Jeddah prompted King Fahd Hospital to close its emergency department for 24 hours so that it could be disinfected, according to earlier reports.\n\nEarlier translated health ministry statements said 11 cases had recently been confirmed in Jeddah, while media reports said as many as 15 illnesses could be linked to King Fahd Hospital, including infections in three doctors and four nurses.\n\nThe WHO said since September 2012 it has received reports of 212 lab-confirmed MERS-CoV infections, 88 of them fatal. It repeated its advice to health facilities, urging them to take appropriate measures to the spread of the virus. Because it\'s not always possible to identify MERS-CoV patients early, health workers should apply standard precautions at all times with all patients, the WHO added.\n\nDispute over camels\n\nIn other developments, Saudi Arabia\'s agriculture minister is disputing the possible role of camels in the spread of MERS-CoV, according to Arabic media reports translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease and preparedness news blog.\n\nIn a Mar 27 summary of cases and scientific reports, the WHO said camels appear to be the main source of the virus, but it\'s not clear how the virus is jumping from animals to people.\n\nIn addition, two genetic sequencing studies of viruses from camels found high similarity to MERS-CoV viruses that have infected people. Another study in camels and other livestock in Saudi Arabia found evidence of the virus in camels, but not goats and sheep.\n\nA spokesman from the agriculture ministry Jaber Al-Shehri was quoted in two media sources as saying the transmission of the virus from camels to people has not been documented and that the treatment and eradication of MERS-CoV is the responsibility of the country\'s health ministry.\n\nSee also:\n\nApr 11 UAE interior ministry statement\n\nApr 11 WHO statement on Jordan case\n\nApr 11 Saudi Arabia health ministry statement\n\nApr 8 CIDRAP News story ""Saudi hospital MERS cases prompt temporary ER closure""\n\nApr 11 Avian Flu Diary post\n\nMar 28 CIDRAP News story ""WHO sees camels as MERS source, but route uncertain""', ""Also, late today Saudi Arabia's health ministry reported three more MERS-CoV cases from Jeddah, one of them fatal.\nUAE's six new infections boost its number of MERS-CoV cases to 27.\nThe new cases bring the Saudi MERS-CoV count to 185, including 68 deaths.\nThe WHO said since September 2012 it has received reports of 212 lab-confirmed MERS-CoV infections, 88 of them fatal.\nAnother study in camels and other livestock in Saudi Arabia found evidence of the virus in camels, but not goats and sheep.""]"

They work with the MoI in Al Ain, and were diagnosed after a routine medical check up.\n\nIt is still not known how the paramedics got infected, but it is likely that they were dealing with elderly patients, a source at the UAE Ministry of Health’s (MoH) Infection Control Committee told Gulf News. The majority of Mers infections in the UAE have occurred among elderly, chronically-ill people.\n\nThe announcement was made in order to ensure transparency and keep residents informed, the MoI announced on its Twitter page. It added that people who were recently in contact with the paramedics have also been reached to ensure that they are healthy.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO), as well as the Philippines Embassy, has been informed about the latest cases, the MoH source said.\n\nAs of the latest update released by the WHO on Thursday, 211 people worldwide have been infected by Mers-CoV since September 2012, and 88 patients have succumbed to the disease. This count does not, however, include the Filipino paramedics.\n\nHealth experts have said that the transmission of the virus, which has a 40 to 50 per cent mortality rate, is still limited. But the WHO urges healthcare workers to take strict precautions.\n\n“Health-care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control. It is not always possible to identify patients with Mers-CoV easily because some have mild or unusual symptoms.\n\n“For this reason, it is important that workers apply standards [and] precautions consistently with all patients — regardless of their diagnosis — in all work practices all the time,” the WHO’s disease outbreak report states.\n\nThe organisation recommends that medical professionals guard against droplets when caring for all patients displaying symptoms of acute respiratory infection, and wear contact and eye protection when treating a probable or confirmed case of Mers-CoV infection.\n\n“Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test is negative,” the WHO report adds.\n\nIn July last year, four medical professionals from two hospitals in Abu Dhabi were infected by Mers after they took care of another patient with the disease. They were all below 40, and two of them did not develop symptoms of the illness. The other two patients had mild respiratory symptoms and were soon declared to be in stable condition.\n\nThe Mers death and quarantine in the UAE comes three days after the emergency unit at King Fahad Hospital in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah was shuttered as a precautionary measure amid reports that several people fell ill with Mers.\n\nEarlier this week, Saudi health authorities reported the deaths of two men and four new cases of Mers, bringing the death toll from the respiratory disease in the worst-hit country to 66.\n\nAt least 11 medical staff have been reported to have contracted the virus, a spokesperson at the King Fahad hospital said.', 'Abu Dhabi: Five paramedics who worked for the Ministry of Interior (MoI) are in an isolation ward under strict quarantine following the death of a sixth co-worker, the ministry said.\nThe majority of Mers infections in the UAE have occurred among elderly, chronically-ill people.\nIt is not always possible to identify patients with Mers-CoV easily because some have mild or unusual symptoms.\nThe other two patients had mild respiratory symptoms and were soon declared to be in stable condition.\nEarlier this week, Saudi health authorities reported the deaths of two men and four new cases of Mers, bringing the death toll from the respiratory disease in the worst-hit country to 66.']"

Carried out in response to research revealing that 80% of women feel anxious about the way they look, the study highlights how the right state of mind can unlock a powerful feeling of beauty that lives inside all women. The results are documented in the short film Dove: Patches on YouTube.com/Dove.\n\nThe experiment was guided by psychologist and New York Times best-selling author Ann Kearney-Cooke, MD, who has spent 30 years conducting scientific research around women’s body image and self-esteem. During the experiment Kearney-Cooke invited the participants to wear a custom-made “beauty patch” for two weeks, which would help them feel more beautiful. The women were then invited to keep a personal account of their life-changing experience throughout the two week period. All the women agreed that wearing the “beauty patch” helped to improve their self-esteem and to change their personal lives in ways that they had not imagined. At the end of the experiment, however, it is revealed that the “beauty patch” contained nothing and that the power of believing in their own beauty influenced feeling beautiful.\n\n""When a woman feels beautiful, she radiates happiness and confidence, which inspires her life in a significant way,” said Kearney-Cooke. “These women, like so many others, struggle to recognize their own beauty and it severely affects their daily lives. This ground-breaking experiment was designed to illustrate that beauty is a state of mind and that the power to feel beautiful comes from within.”\n\nThroughout the Dove: Patches film, it becomes clear how low self-esteem affects many elements of the women’s lives. As the women become more confident about the way they look, personal relationships flourish and they develop a more optimistic outlook on their daily routine. One of the women who participated shared that she felt ashamed of her arms and had always avoided shopping. A few days into the experiment, she started to feel more beautiful and invited her daughter to go shopping for the first time. The two of them spent an unforgettable day together and they tried on dresses that she had never dreamed of wearing. Dove hopes that all of the women’s inspirational stories featured in the Dove: Patches film will serve as powerful examples and encourage all women to develop a stronger relationship with their own beauty.\n\n“We have heard from thousands of women how their complicated relationship with beauty affects their overall confidence and happiness,” said Jennifer Bremner, brand building director, skin cleansing. “By illustrating through the Dove: Patches film that a positive state of mind and openness can help them feel more beautiful, we hope to inspire all women and help change the way they see themselves.”\n\nDove invites all women to create a world where beauty is a source of confidence, not anxiety. When women look and feel their best, they feel happier, and Dove believes it is important for women to see the beauty in themselves so that they can inspire the next generation. The brand has set a goal of reaching 15 million young lives with self-esteem programming by the end of 2015 and has reached over 12 million to date.', 'Inside every woman is the power to feel beautiful, confident and radiant, according to an original social experiment conducted by Unilever beauty brand Dove.\nThe results are documented in the short film Dove: Patches on YouTube.com/Dove.\nDuring the experiment Kearney-Cooke invited the participants to wear a custom-made “beauty patch” for two weeks, which would help them feel more beautiful.\nThis ground-breaking experiment was designed to illustrate that beauty is a state of mind and that the power to feel beautiful comes from within.”Throughout the Dove: Patches film, it becomes clear how low self-esteem affects many elements of the women’s lives.\nDove hopes that all of the women’s inspirational stories featured in the Dove: Patches film will serve as powerful examples and encourage all women to develop a stronger relationship with their own beauty.']"

The new video is familiar terrain for the company that, for the last 10 years, has continuously built its brand on peddling a nebulous thing to women called ""real beauty.""\n\nDove has been incredibly successful branding itself as a beauty company that doesn\'t believe in beauty. Or, at least, one that doesn\'t believe in physical beauty. In 2004, Dove launched its much-lauded Campaign for Real Beauty, a media blitz that featured ""real"" women of different shapes and sizes all proclaiming that they love themselves just as they are. It was a profitable ploy for an advertising campaign designed to sell cellulite-firming cream: Dove saw a sizeable increase in revenue, and the viral ads became YouTube and Facebook favorites.\n\nIn 2010, Dove pivoted from the Campaign for Real Beauty to the Movement for Self-Esteem, of which ""Patches"" is the latest installment. The new campaign features a group of women who, for unknown reasons, are meeting with Dr. Ann Kearney-Cooke, a psychologist, diet book author, and Unilever consultant.\n\nKearney-Cooke prescribes the ailing women featured in the campaign an RB-X patch, the ingredients of which are unknown. The women are asked to wear the patch for two weeks and keep a video diary detailing how they feel. Over that absurdly short time frame, the women morph from their insecure selves into empowered, confident women. They then return to Kearney-Cooke, who reveals the contents of the patch — they are all shocked to find that the patch contains ""nothing.""\n\n""Patches"" strikes me as a fictional campaign conjured up in the writers\' room of Mad Men. Indeed, Dove has been Draper-like in its ability to create brand affinities instead of hawking an actual product.\n\nIts ads foster the belief that its products are more than just cosmetic, that they somehow enhance an inner beauty that exists in a place untouchable by beauty products. By marketing ""real beauty,"" Dove has forever branded itself as a cosmetics company that cares about women\'s well-being; an Oprah-esque leader ready with an inspirational platitude, a partner in the fight against negative body images, a feminist friend ready to guide you away from inauthentic beauty.\n\nDove\'s ability to intertwine ""real beauty"" with profit has been so popular that the selling of self-esteem is now ubiquitous. American Eagle\'s Aerie brand debuted a lingerie campaign featuring ""real unphotoshopped girls."" (The campaign is simply known as ""Real."") Special K\'s recent campaign ""Fight Fat Talk"" encourages women to embrace their bodies while selling diet food. Each of these campaigns capitalizes on a longing for authenticity, an undefined state of truth in which women\'s bodies aren\'t manipulated by glossy magazines and women are valued for attributes other than their physical beauty.\n\nBut they exist in a state of denial. While advocating empowerment and selling authenticity, these brands still position themselves as the arbiters of ""real"" beauty.\n\n""We have heard from thousands of women about how their complicated relationship with beauty affects their overall confidence and happiness,"" Jennifer Bremner, the brand building director for Dove, told Mashable. ""By illustrating through the \'Dove: Patches\' film that a positive state of mind and openness can help them feel more beautiful, we hope to inspire all women and change the way they see themselves.""\n\nBremner\'s ad-speak is drawn from an internal marketing study commissioned by Dove in 2004. The study is worth reading as it constitutes a near-perfect case study in how brands create crises. Dove\'s study found that only a small percentage of women identified themselves as beautiful, while the vast majority of women described themselves as ""average"" and ""natural."" From the study, Dove\'s marketing team, rather brilliantly, decided to emphasize the lack, to pitch to women that they should feel beautiful, and sell them the should as empowerment. Its underlying message is little different from companies that plainly create insecurity to sell their products.\n\nWe are led to believe that our brand loyalties are the result of a vital kinship between the consumer and the product — Dove soap is ""you,"" this shampoo is ""yours"" — and social media affords us endless opportunities to advertise and rationalize our brand loyalties. Dove\'s campaigns allow a consumer to ""like"" and purchase its products to explain ""this is who I am."" Buying Dove provides consumers with the opportunity to acquire empowerment, to simply swipe a credit card and buy iconoclastic social action abstractly meant to improve the lot of women. Empowerment, an amorphous feeling that signifies feminism-lite, is Dove\'s identity — but empowerment, or any other ideology, cannot be bought and sold.', 'In 2004, Dove launched its much-lauded Campaign for Real Beauty, a media blitz that featured ""real"" women of different shapes and sizes all proclaiming that they love themselves just as they are.\nIn 2010, Dove pivoted from the Campaign for Real Beauty to the Movement for Self-Esteem, of which ""Patches"" is the latest installment.\nDove\'s ability to intertwine ""real beauty"" with profit has been so popular that the selling of self-esteem is now ubiquitous.\nWhile advocating empowerment and selling authenticity, these brands still position themselves as the arbiters of ""real"" beauty.\nEmpowerment, an amorphous feeling that signifies feminism-lite, is Dove\'s identity — but empowerment, or any other ideology, cannot be bought and sold.']"

It may seem far-fetched, but that’s exactly what Dove set out to prove with the creation of its RB-X Beauty Patch. Women participating in a research group were asked to wear the Dove Patch for two weeks while maintaining a video diary summarizing their self-perception each day. The results of the test and the patch’s ingredients may surprise you.\n\nOn Day 1, all of the women involved in the study reported no change in their self-confidence. For the most part, it was a normal day. Come Day 4, some started to question the patch's effectiveness, while others noticed a difference in how the people around them acted. By Day 5, more of the women were starting to notice a difference in their appearance. For example, one participant who admitted to being self-critical about her arms said she purposely wore clothes that flaunted them.\n\nAt Day 10 of the study, an obvious change was starting to occur. Women who displayed close to no self-confidence 10 days earlier were starting to view themselves as beautiful. One even described feeling attractive through sickness, fatigue, and a pimple on her nose. In one woman’s words, on Day 12, they felt “comfortable in their own skin.” The results only got better as the days went on. Women were smiling at strangers by Day 12 and going dress shopping by Day 15.\n\nAt the end of the two week experiment, it was time for the participants to give a thorough review of what one woman called “a life-altering experience.” Another woman reported being more social with the patch on and some were comfortable wearing clothes that sat in the back of their closets before the experiment. Finally it came time to reveal the patch’s ingredients: nothing. After finding out their boost in self-esteem came by their own volition, the women were shocked and teary-eyed. The realization that their beauty was there the whole time slowly sunk in.\n\nAccording to Dove Research: The Truth About Beauty: Revisited, only four percent of women are able to use the word beautiful in describing themselves. Seventy-two percent feel pressure to appear beautiful, while 80 percent agree that every woman has something beautiful about her but are unable to see their own beauty. Over half of the women responding to the beauty assessment admitted they were their own worst critic when it came to their looks."", 'It may seem far-fetched, but that’s exactly what Dove set out to prove with the creation of its RB-X Beauty Patch.\nWomen participating in a research group were asked to wear the Dove Patch for two weeks while maintaining a video diary summarizing their self-perception each day.\nAccording to Dove Research: The Truth About Beauty: Revisited, only four percent of women are able to use the word beautiful in describing themselves.\nSeventy-two percent feel pressure to appear beautiful, while 80 percent agree that every woman has something beautiful about her but are unable to see their own beauty.\nOver half of the women responding to the beauty assessment admitted they were their own worst critic when it came to their looks.']"

Like 80 per cent of women (according to Dove research), all of the participants report anxiety about their looks, with one woman saying she avoids mirrors and another claiming her lack of self-esteem prevents her from approaching men.\n\nREAD: Dove\'s new beauty campaign confirms that we are more beautiful than we think\n\nIn the ad, Dr Kearney-Cooke prescribes each woman the \'RB-X beauty patch\', ""developed to enhance the way women perceive their own beauty"", and instructs them to wear it for 12 hours a day for the next two weeks, while keeping a video diary to document how they feel about themselves.\n\nThrough the video diaries, we see the women\'s confidence grow: one reports baring her arms (something she\'d never have done previously), another says she\'s smiling more and doesn\'t know why, one lady says she ""feels very comfortable in my skin today"", while Katelyn declares that she ""feels beautiful even with a pimple on my nose!"" Two weeks later, all return to Dr Kearney-Cooke brimming with newfound body confidence, all thanks to the miraculous beauty patch which, it turns out, was a placebo. It contained nothing.\n\nFor Dove the results send an empowering message that beauty and body confidence is all about state of mind: not magic patches, pills or potions. The women in the video echo this sentiment, describing the process as a ""life-changing experience"". ""I\'m beautiful, I\'m strong, I\'m independent and I can just be whoever I want to"", says Katelyn. ""I don\'t need something to make me feel that way, that\'s just who I am. It was hidden and now it\'s not any more, it\'s very empowering"", comes another on-message soundbite.\n\nREAD - Beauty Icon: Dove beauty bar\n\n""These women, like so many others, struggle to recognise their own beauty and it severely affects their daily lives.

""It\'s definitely true that positive thinking works miracles. But that\'s not what this campaign is really about; it\'s about teaching women that Dove knows better. Dove is smarter,"" was Jezebel\'s take.\n\nOther online commentators took offence at the \'beauty is all in the mind\' message, arguing that the idea that low self-esteem or even eating disorders can be cured by the power of positive thinking can actually be damaging.\n\nDove claims the campaign is ""part of the brand\'s ongoing campaign to make beauty a source of confidence, not anxiety for women"".

Most women in the world today would crave for such a product. This very desire forms the core of Dove’s latest advertisement.\n\nThe company has previously hit the spot with their brilliant viral video called ‘Real Beauty Sketches’ which released last year. It was viewed by millions and shared across all platforms.\n\nThe new video is an attempt to recreate the impact that the former ad did. The advertisement centers around women who are given beauty patches to be worn for two weeks, before telling them that the patches were placebos.\n\nThe advertisement is part of a new marketing campaign for Dove. It begins with Ann Kearney-Cooke, a psychologist and body image specialist who wishes to conduct a simple experiment. She gathers some women and presents them with the “RB-X” patch. According to her, this was a beauty patch which would enhance the way a woman perceived her beauty. After giving the patches to the women, she asked them to keep a video diary for two weeks, and record any changes that they felt while wearing the patch.\n\nSo how did each woman feel when she wore the patch? Well, in the ad’s final spot, all of them agreed that the patch made them feel more confident in themselves. This new found confidence had a positive influence on their choices and behaviour.\n\nHowever, what the women don’t know is that the beauty patch is a mere placebo. It never worked to begin with. Any change in attitude towards the world and oneself, or a positive change in one’s behaviour was thus not the work of the patch, but simply the change in mindset of the woman wearing it.\n\nTowards the end of the video, the psychologist meets each woman individually and hands them a paper containing the contents of the beauty patch. The paper is blank. The women then realize that there was nothing in the patch.\n\nThe women react positively, yet emotionally. Some begin to smile and then laugh, while some tear up, and some women do both. The women all expected there to be some contents to the patch, and were visibly shocked when they realized that there were none, and that they had helped themselves on their own.\n\nDespite controversy over the authenticity of the women used in the ad, Dove insists that they were not actresses. According to the company, the ‘real’ women were asked to audition for an undisclosed documentary. Then the women were presented with the experiment, which invited them to wear a patch which would make them feel more ‘beautiful’.\n\nThe ‘Dove Beauty Patch ad’ proves that women do have the power to lift themselves up entirely on their own. In this sense, the ad is empowering. The ad also makes them focus on their positive aspects, and tell them that they can be whatever they desire.\n\nHowever, the ad did have its drawbacks. The most prominent one was the fact that the women went through an experiment. The process of the experiment suggested that the women were being manipulated to believe that their lack of confidence could be cured with a patch. Even worse, when the psychologists tells the woman that the patch is a placebo, the ad suggests that within two weeks of believing in yourself, you can gain confidence. This is not true. Further, the ad campaign was less about positive thinking, and more about Dove teaching women. It gave off the notion that women need to be educated by the brand on how to increase their self esteem.\n\nThe new Dove ad has received its share of negative publicity, with news articles accusing them of portraying women as gullible. Further, there was not one woman participant who reacted negatively when she realized that the patch was fake. However, the company said that the campaign sought to communicate that the right state of mind could “unlock a powerful feeling of beauty that lives inside all women”.', 'What if there was a ‘beauty patch’ that you could attach to your skin, and instantly feel better about how you look?\nAccording to her, this was a beauty patch which would enhance the way a woman perceived her beauty.\nDespite controversy over the authenticity of the women used in the ad, Dove insists that they were not actresses.\nThe ‘Dove Beauty Patch ad’ proves that women do have the power to lift themselves up entirely on their own.\nThe new Dove ad has received its share of negative publicity, with news articles accusing them of portraying women as gullible.']"

(Although I suppose you could argue that these products do make me feel better about myself. On days when I forget to put on deodorant, it\'s borderline traumatic.) Dove\'s latest video campaign may be the least effective of the series, though.\n\nIn its latest ad, called ""Patches,"" a researcher meets with several women who don\'t feel beautiful. She tells them to wear Dove\'s new ""beauty patch,"" (a fake product that you can\'t actually buy) for 12 hours a day over a two-week week period and keep a video diary of how they\'re feeling. Turns out that they all started feeling better about themselves, nose zits and all. The punchline is: There was nothing in the patch! You did it all with the power of your mind!\n\nFirst of all, I\'m slightly concerned that no one thought to ask, ""What\'s in this thing before I stick it on my skin for 12 hours?"" (Not to be paranoid, but you can\'t always trust a soft-spoken, kindly woman in a white lab coat, amirite? Anyone who watches Homeland knows this.) To me, this little experiment is just confirmation to every other beauty company out there that hey, women actually really do buy into what we tell them about products. Woohoo! This eye cream will get rid of crow\'s feet. This toothpaste will whiten your teeth. This patch will make you feel more beautiful.\n\nI realize that Dove thinks its message here is, ""You don\'t need the patch to feel beautiful."" It\'s an admirable message, just not coming from a beauty company which sells products that are indeed intended make you feel more beautiful. I feel like these women got punk\'ed. It\'s like when models give their tips about how to have a better self-image or Gwyneth Paltrow talks about how hard it is to be a working mother: The source taints the message.\n\nTake a peek at the video above and let\'s chat about it in the comments. Maybe I\'m just too bitter.', 'It\'s also the reason I can\'t get behind Dove\'s various ad campaigns touting body acceptance and self-love.\nDove\'s latest video campaign may be the least effective of the series, though.\nIn its latest ad, called ""Patches,"" a researcher meets with several women who don\'t feel beautiful.\nShe tells them to wear Dove\'s new ""beauty patch,"" (a fake product that you can\'t actually buy) for 12 hours a day over a two-week week period and keep a video diary of how they\'re feeling.\nTake a peek at the video above and let\'s chat about it in the comments.']"

A new Dove ad teases that question with RB-X, a ""beauty"" patch. As part of a clinical trial, women wear the patch and keep a video diary recording their thoughts about how they feel from day to day. Will they soak up something from that patch that changes how they look?\n\nWell, because this is Dove, you know there\'s going to be a twist in there, somewhere. Remember the Dove ad that compares how women see themselves with how a stranger sees them? The twist has to do with women discovering the beauty they had all along. Can you guess what happens?\n\nNot much happens at first. But eventually the women report changes:\n\nOn Day 10 a woman (who looks like a young Phoebe Cates, for cryin\' out loud) says, ""I feel beautiful no matter if I\'m sick, tired, or the fact that there\'s a pimple on my nose.""\n\nOn Day 13 another woman says, ""I felt very comfortable in my skin today.""\n\nOn Day 15 another woman says incredulously, ""I went dress shopping today!"" She never would have done that before the patch.\n\nAfter the experiment the women reported feeling like they\'d had a life-changing experience -- they were more daring with their looks, and they felt like they had uncovered a more confident part of themselves. And then the researcher reveals what\'s really in the patch: Nothing.\n\nAh-hah! It\'s the power of a placebo, my friends. And it could work on the smartest of us. Just one simple psychological device to help us shift our perspective for the better.\n\nSo I understand the overall message here, and how transforming this experience would be for these women. I do cringe for them just a little bit. I think I\'d feel a bit silly if I\'d participated in the experiment only to find out the patch was a placebo. Oh Dove, playing a tricks on women again! You! (Wagging my finger at them.)\n\nBut we know Dove means well (and, of course, they\'re a company that sells self-care products). It\'s to these women\'s credit that no one gets mad and throws the table over. But if I were there, I think in addition to feeling silly, I\'d be wondering a few things. Did I really need this patch to turn around how I feel about myself? How much of beauty is something I feel inside and project outward? Does feeling more beautiful make me actually look more beautiful?\n\nThese are questions we sometimes ask anyway. The patch experiment just gives us another way to ask those questions. I\'m not going to get all righteous and say how other people see us doesn\'t matter to us, because it actually does matter to most of us, whether we want to admit it or not. But I think it\'s interesting to think about how much our beauty depends on how we see ourselves and how we bring that out.\n\nHow much of beauty do you think is something you project from the inside out?\n\nImage via DoveUnitedStates/YouTube', 'What if you could take a drug that would make you more beautiful -- or at least feel more beautiful?\nA new Dove ad teases that question with RB-X, a ""beauty"" patch.\nAs part of a clinical trial, women wear the patch and keep a video diary recording their thoughts about how they feel from day to day.\nThe twist has to do with women discovering the beauty they had all along.\nI think I\'d feel a bit silly if I\'d participated in the experiment only to find out the patch was a placebo.']"

The women were asked to keep a video diary for two weeks chronicling any changes they felt. Every woman featured in the final spot agreed that wearing the patch made them feel better about themselves, which in turn affected their behavior. One participant was more open to approaching guys, another dreaded shopping less than before, and another proudly wore clothes that revealed her arms -- something she would not have done before wearing the patch.\n\nAt the end of the video, Kearney-Cooke revealed to each woman that the patch was just a placebo -- and that any change in attitude simply came down to the wearers\' state of mind.\n\n""I was really expecting there to be something,"" participant Brihtney says through her tears. ""To see that there\'s nothing, it\'s just... it\'s crazy.""\n\nAfter watching the spot, The Huffington Post reached out to Dove\'s PR team to verify that the women featured are not actresses.

Dr. Ann Kearney-Cooke presented it as an experiment in which the women were invited to wear a beauty patch that was created to help them feel more beautiful.""\n\nIn one sense, the ad is empowering, proving that women do have the ability to change how they feel about themselves simply through the power of their mind. ""I\'m beautiful, I\'m strong, and I\'m independent... I can just be whoever I want to,"" participant Katelyn said on discovering the patch had no effect. On the other hand, the ""experiment"" framework of the ad seems slightly manipulative -- and suggests to women that their low self-esteem can be easily-cured with a couple weeks of positive thinking.\n\nKate Dries at Jezebel critiqued the commercial, arguing that its underlying message isn\'t about women\'s empowerment, but Dove\'s branding:\n\nIt\'s definitely true that positive thinking works miracles. But that\'s not what this campaign is really about; it\'s about teaching women that Dove knows better. Dove is smarter.

All of the ads and promotional materials center on the message that beauty isn’t a fixed image, but instead found in an accepting and positive lifestyle. The company has rebranded itself as a stalwart promoter of the idea that “Inside every woman is the power to feel beautiful, confident and radiant.”\n\n\n\nThat’s the message behind Dove’s social experiment, carried out in response to research revealing that an alarming 80% of women feel anxious about the way they look. According to Dove, “the study highlights how the right state of mind can unlock a powerful feeling of beauty that lives inside all women. The results are documented in the short film Dove: Patches,” which you can watch below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experiment was guided by psychologist and New York Times best-selling author, Dr. Ann Kearney-Cooke (Ph.D., Counseling Psychology) who has spent thirty years conducting scientific research around women’s body image and self-esteem.\n\n\n\nDuring the experiment Dr. Kearney-Cooke invited the participants to wear a custom-made “beauty patch” for two weeks, which – would help them feel more beautiful. The women were then invited to keep a personal account of their life-changing experience throughout the two week period. All the women agreed that wearing the “beauty patch” helped to improve their self-esteem and to change their personal lives in ways that they had not imagined.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the experiment, however, it is revealed that the “beauty patch” contained nothing and that the power of believing in their own beauty influenced feeling beautiful.\n\n\n\n“When a woman feels beautiful, she radiates happiness and confidence, which inspires her life in a significant way,” said Dr. Kearney-Cooke. “These women, like so many others, struggle to recognize their own beauty and it severely affects their daily lives. This ground-breaking experiment was designed to illustrate that beauty is a state of mind and that the power to feel beautiful comes from within.”\n\n\n\nBeauty is a State of Mind (as described by the company)\n\n\n\nThroughout the Dove: Patches film, it becomes clear how low self-esteem affects many elements of the women’s lives. As the women become more confident about the way they look, personal relationships flourish and they develop a more optimistic outlook on their daily routine. One of the women who participated shared that she felt ashamed of her arms and had always avoided shopping. A few days into the experiment, she started to feel more beautiful and invited her daughter to go shopping for the first time. The two of them spent an unforgettable day together and they tried on dresses that she had never dreamed of wearing. Dove hopes that all of the women’s inspirational stories featured in the Dove: Patches film will serve as powerful examples and encourage all women to develop a stronger relationship with their own beauty.\n\n\n\n“We have heard from thousands of women how their complicated relationship with beauty affects their overall confidence and happiness,” said Jennifer Bremner, Brand Building Director, Skin Cleansing. “By illustrating through the Dove: Patches film that a positive state of mind and openness can help them feel more beautiful, we hope to inspire all women and help change the way they see themselves.”\n\n\n\nDove invites all women to create a world where beauty is a source of confidence, not anxiety. When women look and feel their best, they feel happier, and Dove believes it is important for women to see the beauty in themselves so that they can inspire the next generation. The brand has set a goal of reaching 15 million young lives with self-esteem programming by the end of 2015 and has reached over 12 million to date.', 'According to Dove, “the study highlights how the right state of mind can unlock a powerful feeling of beauty that lives inside all women.\nThe results are documented in the short film Dove: Patches,” which you can watch below.\nDuring the experiment Dr. Kearney-Cooke invited the participants to wear a custom-made “beauty patch” for two weeks, which – would help them feel more beautiful.\nAll the women agreed that wearing the “beauty patch” helped to improve their self-esteem and to change their personal lives in ways that they had not imagined.\nAt the end of the experiment, however, it is revealed that the “beauty patch” contained nothing and that the power of believing in their own beauty influenced feeling beautiful.']"

At the start of the commercial, we meet several unassuming women who have been brought to meet with Dr. Ann Kearney-Cooke, who is a real doctor at The Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute specializing in eating disorders and body image issues. She ""prescribes"" the women RB-X, a patch that has an unidentified substance in it. The women are supposed to wear it and report back about how it makes them feel about themselves.

You put it on and instantly love the way you look, which in turn makes you more confident.\n\nIn a TODAY.com survey, 46 percent agreed you\'d take something that made you FEEL more beautiful.\n\nThat’s kind of the idea behind a new ad campaign, which premiered Wednesday on TODAY in a segment sponsored by Dove: A handful of women are told that they’re going to help test a “revolutionary” new beauty product: the very science-y sounding RB-X, a “beauty patch.” They wear the patch for two weeks and document how it’s made them feel, using video diaries. And they say the patch has made them feel more beautiful, and, subsequently, more confident.\n\n[Dove is a sponsor of TODAY.]\n\n""I\'ve been more comfortable in clothes I didn\'t wear before, more comfortable doing my hair differently, showing off my face more,"" said one of the participants, Tahnee, after wearing the patch 12 hours a day during the test.\n\n\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

It’s one of those warm-fuzzy ads that Dove does very well, highlighting the idea of “real,” inner beauty.\n\nThe science behind the social experiment is solid, experts say.\n\n“There’s quite a bit of science here – the idea of you believe it, and you can do it,” says Vivian Diller, a New York City psychologist and author.\n\nOne example: A paper published in 2010 essentially showed that lucky charms actually work: People who had their lucky items with them felt more confident, and actually performed better on a given task than those who didn’t have their lucky stuff with them. In one of the study’s experiments, the participants were asked to do an anagram task; for this task, the researchers had the participants set specific goals, and then they measured their persistence. “People who had their lucky charms were more confident, which made them set higher goals and persist longer, which improved performance,” said Jane Risen, an associate professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, in an email. (Risen was not involved with that study, but her work focuses on similar concepts.)\n\nThe reveal. Today\n\nRisen also thinks that the confidence the women in the Dove ad felt could also be related to the idea of “power posing.” Harvard Business School professor Amy Cuddy has led research showing that, quite literally, the way you carry yourself can improve your confidence, which improves your performance – and that, of course, improves the way people see you. “(A)dopting an expansive, open (high-power) posture before a performance task improves performance compared to people who adopt a contracted, closed (low-power) stance before the task,” Risen said. “For example, after doing a high power pose, participants gave a speech that was better on presentation quality … than if they performed the speech after a low-power pose.”\n\nBut there is also some evidence that simply feeling more attractive can boost confidence – and that that feeling can even change a person’s behavior, Risen said. “The most relevant study that comes to mind for me is a classic study looking at self-fulfilling prophecies,” she said. Men and women had a 10-minute conversation, via headphones and microphones so they couldn’t see each other. Before the chat, the men were given fake pictures, so half of them believed they were talking to an attractive woman, and the other half an unattractive woman.\n\n“The most remarkable finding was that an independent set of coders who listened only to the women (and didn\'t see a picture) also thought that the women who were supposedly more attractive were more friendly and sociable,” Riser said. “In other words, being perceived by the men as attractive lead the women to act differently such that other people came to believe the same thing that the men believed.”\n\nDiller, the NYC psychologist, said that she often advises women to talk to themselves the way they’d talk to a best friend. “How you talk to yourself is similar to this idea of the patch,” Diller said. “It’s the positive internal conversation.”', 'And they say the patch has made them feel more beautiful, and, subsequently, more confident.\nThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service""I\'ve been more social with the patch on,"" said Tracey.\nIt’s one of those warm-fuzzy ads that Dove does very well, highlighting the idea of “real,” inner beauty.\n“(A)dopting an expansive, open (high-power) posture before a performance task improves performance compared to people who adopt a contracted, closed (low-power) stance before the task,” Risen said.\n“How you talk to yourself is similar to this idea of the patch,” Diller said.']"

Now Michigan researchers say mathematical formulas suggest it’s possible to adjust to new time zones a bit faster than previously thought, and they created their own free app to help.\n\nDoctors have long said exposure to light is key. But how much, and when?\n\n“If you get light in the wrong time or wrong way, it’ll send you the wrong direction,” said University of Michigan math professor Daniel Forger, who led the research published Thursday.\n\nA master biological clock, called a circadian rhythm, regulates when we become sleepy and when we’re more alert. Travel across time zones and the body clock has to reset itself.\n\nLight is that clock’s strongest regulator. In a study partly funded by the Air Force, the Michigan team used two equations proven to predict someone’s circadian rhythm, and with computer modeling calculated different schedules of light exposure for more than 1,000 possible trips.\n\nIt’s possible to customize a block of time each day when you should be in light, the brighter the better, and another when you should avoid it, Forger’s team reported in the journal PLoS Computational Biology. (It didn’t address other potential remedies such as melatonin.)\n\nAn example: Fly from Detroit to London, five hours ahead, arriving at 11 a.m. London time. Generally, it’s thought to take a day per time zone to fully adjust. But the study suggests a three-day adjustment schedule, if you can stick with it: On the day after arrival, get light from 7:40 a.m. to 9 p.m.; from 6:20 a.m. to 7:40 p.m. on Day 2; and from 5 a.m. until 7:20 p.m. on Day 3.\n\nA free iPhone app named Entrain does the calculations. Stay indoors, or stay up later, and it adjusts the advice.\n\nThe app hasn’t been tested with travelers to see whether it really helps more than general advice, such as to seek morning light when traveling eastward. But after using it, travelers will be given a choice of submitting their data to a University of Michigan study.\n\n“Before we really believe it, it has to go through testing,” cautioned sleep-medicine specialist Dr. Steven Altchuler, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the project.

These fluctuations in behaviors and bodily functions, tied to the planet’s 24-hour day, do more than guide us to eat and sleep. They govern processes in each one of our cells.\n\nShort disruptions such as jet lag and its symptoms of fatigue and insomnia can affect mood and performance. And scientists have linked regular disturbances and disorders of the system to depression, certain cancers, heart disease and diabetes. Pilots, flight attendants and shift workers, which make up more than 10 percent of the American workforce, are particularly susceptible.\n\nThe shortcuts the app offers are custom schedules of light and darkness depending on the itinerary. The schedules boil down to one block of time each day when you should seek the brightest light possible and another when you should put yourself in the dark, or at least in dim light. You don’t even have to be asleep.\n\nIf you must go outside, you can wear pink-tinted glasses to block blue wavelength light, the researchers say. And if the app prescribes “bright outdoor light” in the middle of the night, a therapeutic lightbox can do the job—yes, its shortcuts sometimes require odd hours.\n\nThe study, published April 10 in Public Library of Science Computational Biology, relies on two leading mathematical models, or sets of equations, that have been shown to accurately describe human circadian rhythms. The researchers used these equations and a technique called optimal control theory to calculate ideal adjustment schedules for more than 1,000 possible trips.\n\nThe app gives users access to these schedules. Start by entering your typical hours of light and darkness in your current time zone, then choose the time zone you’re traveling to and when, as well as the brightest light you expect to spend the most time in during your trip (indoor or outdoor.) The app offers a specialized plan and predicts how long it will you take to adjust.\n\nSay you’re traveling from Detroit to London, five hours ahead. Your flight leaves at 10 p.m. Eastern Time and arrives at 11:05 a.m. London time the next day. It’s a work trip and you’ll have to spend most of your time in indoor lighting. Under those circumstances, the app says it can adjust you in about three days. That’s less than the rule-of-thumb one day per hour outside the starting time zone.\n\nThe entrainment clock for any trip starts at the beginning of the first light cycle in the new time zone. So for the London trip, on the day after your arrival, you’d want to get light from 7:40 a.m until around 9 p.m., and not after. Rise earlier on the second day, at 6:20 a.m. Lights out at 7:40 p.m. You may feel like going for an evening walk, but being in the light at a time when the app prescribes darkness would lengthen the adjustment period, the researchers say.\n\nTo get over jet lag most efficiently: Experience one block of light and one block\n\nof darkness each day.\n\nDuring the light phase, be in the brightest\n\nlight possible.\n\nDuring the dark phase, be in the dimmest\n\nlight possible. Even a short burst of bright\n\nlight at the wrong time can extend the time\n\nit takes to adjust.\n\nDark phases don’t have to be sleep phases.\n\nIf you must be outside during dark phases,\n\nblock blue light with rose-tinted glasses or a visor.\n\nFollow the customized, mathematically\n\noptimal schedule offered by the free app, Entrain.\n\nOn the third day, get up before sunrise, around 5 a.m. Stay in light until 7:20 p.m. Your body will be synched the following morning. If you veer from the schedule, you can tell the app and it will recalculate going forward.\n\nTo show how this new method is different, the researchers illustrate circadian rhythms as a clock with a point at the hour when your body temperature is lowest. This usually occurs about two hours before you wake up. If the point is usually at 5 a.m. and you travel overseas, it could abruptly swing over to, say, 3 p.m. in your destination. You’re likely to experience jet lag until your system adjusts and your body is once again at its lowest temperature just a few hours before your alarm goes off.\n\n“The way other approaches get these points to line up again is by inching along on the outside of the circle, sometimes pushing you towards and sometimes pulling you away from the target. But our schedules can just cut through the middle,” said Olivia Walch, a mathematics doctoral student who built the app. “This is almost like a body hack to get yourself entrained faster.”\n\nEntrain Yourself: www.entrain.org\n\nWritten by Nicole Casal Moore, U-M News Service', 'The shortcuts the app offers are custom schedules of light and darkness depending on the itinerary.\nIf you must go outside, you can wear pink-tinted glasses to block blue wavelength light, the researchers say.\nAnd if the app prescribes “bright outdoor light” in the middle of the night, a therapeutic lightbox can do the job—yes, its shortcuts sometimes require odd hours.\nBut our schedules can just cut through the middle,” said Olivia Walch, a mathematics doctoral student who built the app.\n“This is almost like a body hack to get yourself entrained faster.”Entrain Yourself: www.entrain.orgWritten by Nicole Casal Moore, U-M News Service']"

It can take days for a person to adjust back to a normal schedule while the body attempts to deal with the changes. Most experts believe that one day of adjustment is needed for each time zone that is crossed. For example, if you cross three time zones, then you need three days to feel normal again.\n\nSome of the common symptoms of jet lag are insomnia and headache, but travelers can experience a variety of other problems. One of the biggest issues is they often have a hard time adjusting their schedule, so they wake up too early or cannot fall asleep.

""We recommend closer monitoring of women with a history of eating disorders during pregnancy,"" Dr Milla Linna told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nShe said women who have either a current or past eating disorder should let the maternity clinic know about it. But another researcher pointed out that many women have trouble being open about such issues. Linna, from the Hjelt Institute at the University of Helsinki in Finland, led the study that was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.\n\nAdverse pregnancy and birth outcomes\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic, it\'s estimated that 1 to 2 percent of women in the United States suffer from anorexia nervosa and another 2 % or so have bulimia nervosa at some time in their lives. ""Eating disorders affect women often during their fertile years and behaviours typical of eating disorders interfere heavily with the metabolic and hormonal balance of the body, which may influence the course of pregnancy and childbirth,"" Linna said.\n\n""We wanted to see whether women with a history of being treated for an eating disorder were at risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes."" For the new study, Linna and colleagues examined the medical records of 2 257 women who were treated at the eating disorders clinic at Helsinki University Central Hospital from 1995 to 2010.\n\nSpecifically, they looked for any pregnancies from the time of their treatment onward, and any complications that may have occurred around birth. They found that through 2010, women with anorexia nervosa gave birth to 302 babies, women with bulimia nervosa had 724 babies and women with binge eating disorder gave birth to 52 babies.\n\nThe researchers compared data from those women to the medical records of 3 642 Finnish women who were not diagnosed with eating disorders. They gave birth to 6,319 babies during the study period.\n\nThe Apgar score\n\nMost of the pregnancy complications occurred at similar frequencies across all groups, but there were a few exceptions. For example, women with anorexia nervosa had greater odds of developing anaemia, and they also were more likely to have low birth weight babies and very premature births.\n\nWomen with bulimia nervosa were more likely to have babies who required resuscitation or had a low Apgar score.\n\nThe Apgar score is a simple assessment of how babies are doing right after birth. The women with binge eating disorder had greater odds of having high blood pressure during their pregnancies, and having babies that were born large.\n\nThe researchers also found that women with anorexia nervosa and women with binge eating disorder had greater odds of foetal and infant death.\n\nDr Nadia Micali told Reuters Health the new study adds more information on a topic that doesn\'t have much published research. Micali, from the University College London Institute of Child Health in the UK, was not involved with the study but has researched issues of eating disorders and pregnancy.\n\nLower birth weight\n\n\n\nShe said the evidence is strong enough to say that anorexia in mothers is linked to a lower birth weight for babies. ""Part of the reason is because the moms have lower weight themselves,"" Micali told Reuters Health. ""And that is obviously something that is very preventable,"" she said, ""so it is important for all healthcare professionals – and women – to know that if they get pregnant at a normal weight, the baby is much less at risk."" Micali also said most people seem to think women with eating disorders can\'t get pregnant – but that notion is obviously wrong. ""We published a study a few months ago that suggests that about 8%of women who are having their first ultrasound scan had probable eating disorders,"" she said.\n\nMicali said knowing whether a woman has or once had an eating disorder is not just important for the mother but also the baby. But, she added that women with a history of eating disorders may not want to admit it – even to their doctors.\n\nRead: Eating disorders up depression in pregnancy\n\n""I know from my clinical experience and my research experience that women with eating disorders might find it hard to actually say to healthcare professionals that they have, or that they have had, an eating disorder because they might feel stigmatized, so it\'s very important for us healthcare professionals to be aware that we can help women be open about it,"" she said.\n\nLinna said friends and family members can help by focusing on supporting the overall well-being of the woman. ""It is good to know that most women do fine during pregnancy and childbirth even when they have had an eating disorder,"" she said. ""However, if the pregnant woman starts to exhibit eating disorder symptoms, depressed mood, anxiousness or highly critical thoughts related to her changing body or gestational weight gain, it is crucial to seek professional help.""\n\nRead more:\n\nEating disorders affect fertility\n\nMen with eating disorders underdiagnosed\n\nSmart family, eating disorder risk\n\n', 'Eating disorders up risk of pregnancy complications A Finnish study found that women with a history of eating disorders were at higher risk of a range of pregnancy-related complications.\nWomen with a history of eating disorders were at higher risk of a range of pregnancy-related complications, a new study from Finland found.\n""We recommend closer monitoring of women with a history of eating disorders during pregnancy,"" Dr Milla Linna told Reuters Health in an email.\n""Eating disorders affect women often during their fertile years and behaviours typical of eating disorders interfere heavily with the metabolic and hormonal balance of the body, which may influence the course of pregnancy and childbirth,"" Linna said.\nRead more:Eating disorders affect fertilityMen with eating disorders underdiagnosedSmart family, eating disorder risk']"

All because men with eating disorders are underdiagnosed, undertreated and under-researched.\n\n“Our findings suggest that men may experience particular problems in recognising that they may have an eating disorder as a result of the continuing cultural construction of eating disorders as uniquely or predominantly a female problem,” researchers added.\n\nHow to recognize eating disorders\n\nAnorexia nervosa is an emotional weight-loss disorder characterized by physical, social and psychological symptoms. Chief among these are:\n\n* an intense drive for thinness\n\n* an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat\n\n* a disturbance in body image (misperception of body size and shape)\n\nWarning signs of anorexia. Most individuals with this disorder strongly deny it. Because early detection is important to successful recovery, it is important to recognize the common warning signs. These include:\n\n* significant or extreme weight loss with no known medical illness\n\n* reduction in food intake\n\n* reliance on low-fat, nonfat and low-calorie foods\n\n* ritualistic eating habits (such as cutting meat into very small pieces or excessive chewing)\n\n* denial of hunger\n\n* excessive exercise\n\n* insistence that she or he is too fat, even when this is not true\n\n* highly self-controlled behavior\n\n* criticism and intolerance of others\n\n* a tendency to hide feelings\n\nBulimia nervosa is an emotional weight-control disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by some form of purging or restriction. Binges are secretive periods of rapid consumption of high-caloric foods. The purging that follows bingeing usually takes the form of self-induced vomiting, but it may also consist of excessive exercise, fasting, or abuse of laxatives (medications that encourage bowel movements), emetics (medications that cause vomiting) or diuretics (medications that promote urination).\n\nThe binge-purge cycle is normally accompanied by ongoing feelings of isolation, self-deprecating thoughts, depression, and low self-esteem. Bulimics typically recognize that their behavior is abnormal and out of control, and they develop a complex lifestyle to accommodate it.\n\nBulimia typically develops in early to mid-adolescence, typically following dieting behavior. People with bulimia usually are of average or above-average weight, and their self-evaluation becomes unduly focused on size and weight.\n\nStatistics. Bulimia occurs in 0.5 percent to 2 percent of adolescents and young adults. Most of these people are women; bulimia is relatively uncommon in men.\n\nWarning signs of bulimia. Because most bulimics are within a normal weight range, the illness may go undetected by others for years. These clues may indicate a person has bulimia:\n\n* frequent trips to the bathroom after meals\n\n* eating of large amounts of food on the spur of the moment\n\n* purchases of large quantities of food, which suddenly disappears\n\n* evidence of frequent use of laxatives or diuretics (such as discarded packaging)\n\n* unexplained disappearance of food in a home or residence hall\n\n* unusual swelling around the jaw\n\n* mood swings\n\nBinge eating disorder is the consumption of unusually large amounts of food in a brief time period. This is similar to the bingeing done by people with bulimia, but bulimics follow binge eating with some type of purging behavior (i.e. self-induced vomiting, laxative use, etc.). Those with binge eating disorder do not practice purging, but they have feelings of lost control and marked distress over their eating behavior. Binge eating disorder is typically diagnosed in normal or overweight individuals who meet the criteria for bulimia but who do not practice purging or other compensating behaviors.\n\nStatistics. The prevalence of binge eating disorder in the general population is unknown, but studies suggest that approximately 25-50 percent of obese individuals eat in binges. Studies also suggest that those suffering from binge eating disorder have difficulties with impulse control in other areas of their lives.\n\nWarning signs of binge eating disorder. A person may have binge eating disorder if she or he:\n\n* frequently eats an abnormal amount of food in a limited period of time\n\n* eats rapidly\n\n* eats to the point of being uncomfortably full\n\n* often eats alone\n\n* shows irritation and disgust with herself or himself after overeating\n\n* does not use methods to purge', 'Despite popular misconceptions, people who suffer from eating disorders are not necessarily white, female, or thin, although anyone can develop an eating disorder.\n“Men with eating disorders are under diagnosed, under treated and under-researched,” stated Ulla Raisanen, team leader of the steady from the University of Oxford.\nThe researchers say that because there is poor recognition of symptoms of eating disorders in men, such estimates are likely to be higher.\nThe researchers interviewed 29 women and 10 men, aged 16 to 25, who had been diagnosed with eating disorders.\nFor all of these men took a long time – months and even years – to realize that these behaviors could be associated with eating disorders.']"

A recent study, however, reveals that men also have these eating disorders (EDs), without them fully recognizing or knowing they have it.\n\nThe study, titled The role of gendered constructions of eating disorders in delayed help-seeking in men: a qualitative interview study, enumerates four kinds of EDs: bulimia nervosa (BN), anorexia nervosa (AN), binge eating disorder and another eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS). Of all adolescent-related psychiatric disorders, anorexia nervosa records the highest mortality rate.\n\nThe study, published by the British Medical Journal, underscores the main reason EDs among men have been overlooked - stereotyping of ED as an illness only occurring among women.\n\n""The widespread perception of EDs eating disorders as uniquely or predominantly a female problem led to an initial failure by young men to recognise their behaviours as symptoms of an ED,"" the study says.\n\nAuthored by Ulla Räisänen and Kate Hunt, the study also finds out that men failed to recognize such illness for a number of reasons. One is because of the lack of awareness of the EDs among men. Second is the lack of gender-appropriate resources and information for men who have the illness. Third is health practitioners have been too slow as well in recognizing the symptoms just because the affected demographic were men.\n\nEDs are a common form of mental ill health, according to the study, and has become a clinical priority area for Youth Mental Health in 2013-2016 by the Royal College of General Practitioners in the UK because of the increasing number of affected individuals. Participants of the study were, in fact, 10 men from the UK, aged 16 to 25 years old who have various eating disorders such as BN and AN. This makes the study and its findings limited only to the younger bracket, thus does not constitute any understanding to cases of older people with said disorders.\n\nStill, EDs remain more prevalent in women. In the UK alone, 1 in 250 women has AN as opposed to 1 in 2000 men. However, men have more cases of BN and EDNOS than AN.\n\nBased on various estimates, 10 to 25 percent of clinical ED cases occur in men. Regardless whether such estimate is precise or not, the study says one thing is true: the incidence of EDs in men has been growing over the years.\n\nStatistics from the study likewise show that up to 70 percent of BN and AN cases have been caused by unfavorable events in life such as abuse or substance abuse in the family, specific personality traits, existing psychiatric conditions or complex sociocultural factors on body image. In some studies, homosexuality has also been identified as a risk factor for men with EDs. It has been identified as well that genetic factors can influence the onset of EDs.\n\nFurther, it has also been discovered in some studies that men with EDs are more prone to engage in obsessive exercise.\n\nStudy suggests, to prevent the development of potentially life-threatening illness, there should be early diagnosis and intervention. Otherwise, treatment includes dietary advice and pharmacological and psychological interventions.\n\nHowever, the problem with early detection comes in to the picture.\n\n""Yet, to date, very little is known about how men recognise ED symptoms and decide to seek professional help.

Mary, a parent who struggled with her own son\'s eating disorder learned that the hard way.\n\n“At the age of 3, he didn’t want to eat dead animals and he would only eat white rice and white bread and milk, but more and more as he got older he became more restrictive and selective in the way he would eat,” she said. “He ended up with only two or three things he would eat and he suppressed his hunger pains so much, he didn’t want to even come to dinner. Thanksgiving was horrible for him.” Mary, who for privacy reasons, did not want to use their real names, said the family had sought help from numerous doctors who did not recognize her son had an eating disorder –- one, who even suggested he had a heart ailment. “They basically shamed and scared him,” said Mary.\n\nBut this gendered confusion only hurts the guys who are trying to fight anorexia, bulimia, binge-eating and other non-specific eating disorders, reports ABC News.

Men can also suffer from anorexia, binge eating and other issues. Yet widespread perception may prevent men from getting the help they need. A new study reveals that men with these disorders receive far less support than women.\n\nAbout 1 in 250 women and 1 in 2,000 men in the UK suffer from anorexia nervosa, which is one of the four recognized types of eating disorders. Other disorders include bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS).\n\nIn order to find out how men are treated for eating disorders and whether they receive the support they need, the scientists interviewed 39 individuals between the ages of 16 and 25, 10 of whom were men, about their experience with eating disorders. In the end, the scientists found that the men were less likely to have signs recognized early and receive help.\n\n""Men with eating disorders are underdiagnosed, undertreated and under researched,"" wrote the authors of the new study in a news release. ""Our findings suggest that men may experience particular problems in recognizing that they may have an eating disorder as a result of the continuing cultural construction of eating disorders as uniquely or predominantly a female problem.""\n\nThe findings reveal the importance of highlighting eating disorders not only in women, but also in men. It\'s crucial in order to give men the support they need in order to combat eating disorders. Not only that, but slowly changing public perception will be especially important in this task. Men often didn\'t seek help because they thought they wouldn\'t be taken seriously.\n\nThe findings are published in the journal BMJ Open.', 'A new study reveals that men with these disorders receive far less support than women.\nOther disorders include bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS).\n""Men with eating disorders are underdiagnosed, undertreated and under researched,"" wrote the authors of the new study in a news release.\nThe findings reveal the importance of highlighting eating disorders not only in women, but also in men.\nIt\'s crucial in order to give men the support they need in order to combat eating disorders.']"

The young man is well-groomed, his narrow shoulders neatly contained within a pressed shirt highlighting the color of his eyes. “I didn’t really know where to go or what to do, to be honest,” he tells an off-camera interviewer. A new study conducted by researchers in the UK finds that eating disorders are not only increasingly common among young men, but unlike women, they are slower to recognize symptoms and so, too, slower to seek help.\n\n“I thought I made it up myself,” another young man says during his interview. “You know, something that only I did, you know, I never thought in a million years this was something that lots of people did, and deliberately did to cause damage to themselves.”\n\nTo understand how men recognize symptoms of an eating disorder (ED) and decide to seek help, the researchers launched a general study examining 39 separate experiences of having an ED. As part of their analysis, the researchers interviewed 10 men across the UK, all between the ages of 16 and 25, all suffering from anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and other disorders. “The widespread perception of EDs as uniquely or predominantly a female problem led to an initial failure by young men to recognise their behaviours as symptoms of an ED,” wrote the researchers. For this reason, many men only begin to seek help once their illness has matured and their behaviors and symptoms are already entrenched.\n\nWhy do these men fail to identify the symptoms of their illness? The researchers believe the main reason for this is the widespread perception of EDs as uniquely or predominantly a female problem. Worse, this perception may not exist only with the general community but also among medical professors, who in some cases consistently fail to provide gender-appropriate information and resources for men. A recent French study, for instance, found that a significant proportion of men with eating disorders also have moderate to severe symptoms of depression. These same men also demonstrated what the researchers referred to as inappropriate compensatory behaviors, including excessive exercising and fasting.\n\n“I can\'t obviously say oh [um] it\'s harder for men, but there\'s different experiences for men because, you know, ‘No I don\'t get ill, I\'m a man,\'"" another participant tells a researchers during the UK study. “You know, ‘I don\'t get ill, don\'t need treatment, I don\'t have emotions.’ Blah, blah, blah. Things like that.”\n\nIn an American study conducted under the auspices of the University of Illinois, researchers tried to identify which factors in adolescence predicted pathological eating behaviors in young adulthood, when for many signs of their ED bloom. (According to the National Eating Disorder Association, the rate of eating disorders among college students is anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of women and four to 10 percent of men.) Unsurprisingly, the researchers discovered that dieting, depression, and body image distortion in the early years predicted dieting or extreme weight loss behaviors later in life. Among the gender differences observed, the researchers found that early depression was a significantly stronger predictor of a later ED diagnosis in men than women. In the words of a participant in the British study, “I think people knew something was wrong. I think since talking to some of my friends … they knew I was depressed. They didn\'t know that I had an eating disorder because I don\'t think any of us knew anything about eating disorders really.” Meanwhile, another participant described tensions within his family that stopped short of an appropriate intervention, stating, “Dad would get angry if I hadn\'t had my breakfast. But it was never associated with any kind of eating disorder, ever, it was just, ‘Stop being silly.\'""\n\nUnlike young women with an ED, young men with an ED encounter an overwhelmingly hollow sound, in many cases a complete lack of response from their families, friends, teachers, and medical professionals. (For women, on the other hand, even the hint of anorexia, true or not, might propel health providers to take drastic action.) Simply, then, the researchers conclude, “Men with EDs are underdiagnosed, undertreated and under-researched.” Their main hope is to raise awareness so that young men, like young women, can receive early treatment when showing the earliest signs of behaviors that can ruin their lives.\n\nSource: Raisanen U, Hunt K.

But researchers say the assumption that eating disorders only affect women is preventing men with such disorders from receiving the help and support they need.\n\nThere is no doubt that eating disorders, such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa, are more common among women. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD), an estimated 10-15% of Americans with eating disorders are male.\n\nHowever, the researchers of this most recent study, including Ulla Räisänen of the University of Oxford in the UK, say that because there is poor recognition of symptoms of eating disorders in men, such estimates are likely to be higher.\n\nTo reach their findings, recently published in BMJ Open, the researchers interviewed 39 individuals between the ages of 16 and 25 years, of which 10 were men.\n\nAll participants had suffered some form of eating disorder and were asked about their experiences of the condition. The research team focused on men\'s responses only.\n\nFrom the surveys, the research team identified four themes:\n\nRecognition of early signs and symptoms\n\nRecognition of the problem\n\nGetting help, and\n\nInitial contact with health care and support services.\n\n\'Men with eating disorders are underdiagnosed, undertreated and under-researched\'\n\nSymptoms of eating disorders in the surveyed men included going for days without eating, purging and obsessive calorie counting, exercise and weighing. However, all of these men took a long time - months and even years - to realize that these behaviors could be associated with eating disorders.\n\nThe assumption that eating disorders only affected women was reported as the main reason as to why men took so long to realize they had symptoms of the disorders themselves.\n\nShare on Pinterest Researchers found that men with eating disorders took a long time to recognize they had symptoms of the condition, mainly because they thought it only affected women.\n\nThe researchers report that one man said he thought eating disorders only affected ""fragile teenage girls."" Another man said eating disorders were ""something girls got.""\n\nFor many of the men, it took a ""crisis point,"" such as an emergency hospital admission, to make them realize they had an eating disorder.\n\nSome of the men said they delayed seeking help for their condition because they thought they would not be taken seriously by health care professionals or they were unaware of where to go for help.\n\nWhen the men did seek help for their eating disorders, they reported mixed experiences. Some of the men said their experience was positive and they felt their doctor was helpful.\n\nHowever, many of the men said they had to visit their doctor several times before they were taken seriously.\n\nOne participant said his doctor told him he was ""going through a teenage fad."" Another man was told by a gastroenterologist, after experiencing severe weight loss and vomiting, that his problems were not physical. But instead of being referred to a psychologist, the gastroenterologist told him to ""man up"" and ""not be weak but be strong and deal with the problem.""\n\nCommenting on their findings, the research team says:\n\n""Men with eating disorders are underdiagnosed, undertreated and under-researched. Our findings suggest that men may experience particular problems in recognizing that they may have an eating disorder as a result of the continuing cultural construction of eating disorders as uniquely or predominantly a female problem.""\n\nRecognizing early symptoms is key\n\nAccording to the researchers, early detection of eating disorders in men is required to ensure prognosis is improved.\n\nThey note that primary care clinicians are key in recognizing early symptoms of eating disorders in men, and increasing awareness of such disorders in society is ""crucial"" to ensuring both men and women receive help and support before their symptoms become unmanageable.\n\n""It is important to decouple the experience and (self-)management of eating disorders from feminized cultural imagery, resources and clinical practice if we wish to prevent men from (dis)missing signs and symptoms themselves, and prevent health and other professionals (e.g., teachers) from overlooking signs and symptoms in boys and young men that they may readily recognize as indicative of eating disorders in young women,"" they conclude.\n\nHowever, the researchers note that their study does have some limitations.\n\nFor example, although the men surveyed openly spoke about their experiences with eating disorders, the participants were aged between 16 and 25. Therefore, the research does not provide an understanding of older men who have eating disorders. The team says this is something that needs to be explored further.\n\nEarlier this year, Medical News Today reported on research showing that it is not only teenage girls who have body image pressures. The study found that teenage boys who think they are underweight are more likely to be depressed than other boys - even those who think they are overweight.', ""But researchers say the assumption that eating disorders only affect women is preventing men with such disorders from receiving the help and support they need.\nThere is no doubt that eating disorders, such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa, are more common among women.\nAccording to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD), an estimated 10-15% of Americans with eating disorders are male.\n'Men with eating disorders are underdiagnosed, undertreated and under-researched'Symptoms of eating disorders in the surveyed men included going for days without eating, purging and obsessive calorie counting, exercise and weighing.\nHowever, all of these men took a long time - months and even years - to realize that these behaviors could be associated with eating disorders.""]"

Controversial Dutch virologist Ron Fouchier in 2011 found the virus could go airborne—something health officials fear could mean an overwhelming pandemic—with nine or more mutations in ferrets, whose immune systems react to H5N1 much as our own do. He and his fellow researchers set out to find the minimum number of mutations needed to make that happen, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nA ferret was infected with a genetically altered version of the virus and made to share air with another ferret—who eventually became sick. The researchers then uncovered the five mutations at play, two of which made the virus\' ability to adhere to respiratory tract cells more robust. The other mutations bolstered the virus\' stability and ability to replicate. Two big things to keep in mind: One, it\'s not known how likely these mutations are to occur outside a lab setting. ""This certainly does not mean that H5N1 is now more likely to cause a pandemic,"" says Fouchier. Second, the altered virus wasn\'t as deadly as H5N1; Fouchier suggests this is because it hit upper, not lower, airway cells. But critics still say toying with H5N1 is dangerous.

contain a built-in patchwork of defects, suggesting that the developmental disorder begins while they are growing in the womb, said a US study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers described their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine as ""direct evidence"" of a prenatal origin for autism, which affects as many as one in 88 children in the United States and has no known cure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""Building a baby\'s brain during pregnancy involves creating a cortex that contains six layers,"" said co-author Eric Courchesne, professor of neurosciences and director of the Autism Centre of Excellence at University of California, San Diego.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""We discovered focal patches of disrupted development of these cortical layers in the majority of children with autism.""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the study, researchers dissected brain tissue from 11 children, aged two to 15, who had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and who had died, most of them by drowning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for a specific set of 25 genes that had ""robust, consistent, and specific expression patterns in the cortex,"" they compared them to brain samples from 11 children without autism, said the study.\n\n\n\nResearchers found that 91 per cent of the autistic brains were lacking — or showed an unusual pattern — of the expected genetic markers in several layers of the cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe signs of disorganisation were found in patches across the different layers of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, the parts that are responsible for social function, communication, emotions and language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""The most surprising finding was the similar early developmental pathology across nearly all of the autistic brains, especially given the diversity of symptoms in patients with autism, as well as the extremely complex genetics behind the disorder,"" said co-author Ed Lein of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers said they still don\'t understand why these changes come about in some children, apparently leading to autism, but not in others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patchwork nature of the defects does, however, provide a clue as to why autism can affect people in various degrees, from severe to mild disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also may explain why some children respond to intensive therapy and become better communicators when identified early, since the brain may be able to rewire some connections to overcome the areas that are not working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""While autism is generally considered a developmental brain disorder, research has not identified a consistent or causative lesion,"" said Thomas Insel, director of National Institute for Mental Health, which funded the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""If this new report of disorganised architecture in the brains of some children with autism is replicated, we can presume this reflects a process occurring long before birth.""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same research team had previously found that the brains of children with autism were heavier than other children\'s, and that they had more neurons in the prefrontal cortex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brains sampled for this study ""represented nearly the entirety of tissue suitable for study at the Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Centre,"" said the article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the fact that only 11 were studied means that more research is necessary, said Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioural paediatrics at Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children\'s Medical Centre of New York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""This study would have been stronger if they had a larger sample and included a group of children who had neurologic deficits but not autism,"" said Adesman, who was not involved with the research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe nevertheless described the team\'s techniques for identifying microscopic brain abnormalities as ""extremely sophisticated.""\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some of the physical brain changes in autism were already known to science, the latest research provides a more detailed look at how this happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n""This study is particularly important as it

A key time is the transition-age period that we’re really trying to focus on with both expanded clinical care and research.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC report, released March 28, received widespread attention not just for showing the prevalence of autism but also for documenting its rise in the past decade from one in 150 children to one in 68. (The numbers are drawn from nationwide surveillance sites that do not include Cincinnati.)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one more decade, the current 8-year-olds will be facing the transition to adulthood. While they face the prospect of losing a school-based support system unless they are able to continue their education in college, Erickson emphasizes that help is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Autism Adolescent Assessment Clinic at the Kelly O’Leary Center led by Amie Duncan, PhD, at Cincinnati Children’s is geared toward people who are ready to launch into the adult world,” he says. “Some people with autism may not have been looked at in a detailed way since they were first diagnosed as a toddler, so we do an additional full assessment to try to help them with adult service planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n“The system just changes once someone with autism reaches adulthood, because everything is school-based when they’re in school, then developmental disability service-based afterward—and that’s a difficult transition because it can mean everything from a care provider in the home to no support at all.”\n\n\n\n\n\nErickson says problems faced by adults with autism include school failure, with higher-functioning people who otherwise could have gone to college failing because of social deficits, and co-morbid mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression that frequently occur as people get older.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) says persons who suspect they might have a high-functioning autism spectrum disorder such as Asperger’s syndrome should seek a diagnosis from a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. They might have been misdiagnosed previously, NAMI says (with schizophrenia, for example), and a firm diagnosis can help them understand for the first time why they are having difficulties with social interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Autism Society of Greater Cincinnati, a chapter of the Autism Society of America, sponsors several support groups and programs geared toward different needs, including those of transition-aged adolescents and young adults.

Autism is the fastest growing developmental disability and will affect one in 50 children this year, according to a recent U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention survey.\n\nThe Medina County Board of Developmental Disabilities wants to help parents learn the signs of autism and seek help as soon as possible if they have any concerns.\n\nWhile scientists do not know what causes autism spectrum disorders, they do know that autism does not look exactly the same in everyone. There is usually nothing about how a person with autism looks that sets him apart from others.\n\nAutism Awareness Month is a good time to become familiar with the characteristics of the developmental disorder that affects one in 50 American children.\n\nAutistic people may communicate, interact, behave and learn differently than most people. These characteristics can vary widely.\n\n""There\'s tremendous diversity in the symptoms and severity of autism spectrum disorders,"" said Dr. Fred R. Volkmar, director of the Yale Child Study Center.\n\n""Sometimes parents have a vision of autism a la \'Rain Man\' and it won\'t correspond to their child, and they\'ll think, \'this can\'t be autism,\'"" Volkmar said.\n\nSome common characteristics include:\n\n• Language and communication – some children with autism are uncomfortable carrying on a conversation, or don\'t use words and instead rely on hand gestures.\n\n• Social interaction – children with autism may not seem to know what to do or may act uncomfortable in social situations. This can range from avoiding eye contact to problems playing games and interacting with others.\n\n• Unusual repetitive behaviors – children with autism may repeat an unusual behavior, such as lining up toys or making body movements like rocking or flicking their hands over and over for long periods of time. They may prefer these behaviors to interacting with people or playing with toys.\n\n• Sensitivity to sensory stimulation – autistic children may have unusual reactions (either no reaction or an over-sensitive reaction) to loud noises, busy rooms, bright lights, etc.\n\nAutism spectrum disorders can usually be reliably diagnosed by age 3. But some signs are visible as early as 18 months, and new research is pushing back the age of diagnosis to as early as 6 months.\n\nOne of the most important things parents and caregivers can do is to learn the signs of autism and become familiar with typical developmental milestones that a child should be reaching.\n\nParents are usually the first to notice unusual behaviors or a child\'s delay in reaching those milestones.\n\nEffective early intervention can help autistic children develop communication, social skills and age-appropriate behaviors. In Medina County, MCBDD, Help Me Grow and local school districts work together to provide such programs and learning environments for children diagnosed with autism.\n\nFor more information, visit www.mcbdd.org.

Peterson, MD\n\nDirector of the Center for Developmental Neuropsychiatry\n\nDirector of the Center for Developmental Neuropsychiatry,\n\nNew York State Psychiatric Institute\n\nSuzanne Crosby Murphy Professor in Pediatric Neuropsychiatry,\n\nColumbia University, NY\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What are the main findings of the study?\n\nDr. Peterson: We detected the presence of lactate in the brains of 13% of 75 participants who had ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), compared with 1% of the brains of 96 typically developing control participants. The presence of lactate was especially more common in adults who have ASD. Lactate is a product of anaerobic metabolism, which generally should not occur in healthy, living brains under normal circumstances. The presence of lactate in the brains of persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder therefore suggests the presence of deficient production of energy stores by a component of brain cells called “mitochondria”. We detected lactate most commonly in the cingulate gyrus, a region that supports the higher-order control of thought, emotion, and behavior, and that has been implicated previously in Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n\n\nMedicalResearch.com: Were any of the findings unexpected?\n\nDr. Peterson: Diseases of the mitochondria are known causes of Autism Spectrum Disorder, but until now were thought to be responsible for less than 1% of all cases of ASD. Therefore, the large number of individuals in the ASD group who had detectable lactate was surprising. Moreover, this number was almost certainly an underestimate of those who actually had elevated lactate, because measuring lactate in the brains of living people is difficult — available techniques for measuring lactate are not yet very sensitive, which means that they will frequently miss the presence of lactate when it is truly present. Prior studies have reported high rates of lactate in the body tissues of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder, but not in their brains. Therefore, seeing these high rates in the brains of persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder was also surprising. We attribute our success in detecting brain lactate in Autism Spectrum Disorder largely to the use of technical advances that made our brain imaging measures more sensitive than the techniques used to assess lactate in past studies.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What should clinicians and patients take away from your report?\n\nDr. Peterson: Our strong evidence for the common presence of mitochondrial dysfunction in persons with Autism Spectrum Disorder suggests that patients should undergo clinical evaluation for the presence of mitochondrial disease. In addition, novel treatments for known mitochondrial diseases are under development and showing promise. These might one day prove helpful in the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction in persons who have Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\n\nDr. Peterson: Large-scale imaging studies that use sensitive techniques for the measurement of lactate in living persons should relate lactate levels to the clinical symptoms, clinical course, and treatment outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder. These studies are needed to use the identification of mitochondrial dysfunction for the improvement of clinical care in people who have ASD.\n\nCitation:\n\nGoh S, Dong Z, Zhang Y, DiMauro S, Peterson BS.

Sadly this April Fools' Day delivered us interpretations of the CDC's new autism rate. The new numbers, no matter how you want to interpret them, prove absolutely nothing.

They had been given a ten-day notice that their daughter would be moved to another NJ Developmental Center some 90 miles away.\n\n\n\nThe state law requires a 60-day Habitation Plan, that includes the families input but that law is being ignored. Because the parents lived in Old Bridge, NJ, we thought we had lucked out since I happen to be a friend of their Assemblyman Ronnie Dancer. Dancer was great reaching out as he could and also called his Districts State Senator Thompson. The story falls apart here because Thompson is in favor of closing the Developmental Centers and he decide to call me to explain his ignorance. I jumped ahead on purpose because the man was so uneducated on the issue he is championing I was left cursing him out of the phone after his responses left me shaking!\n\n\n\nTurns out he has never visited any of the States 7 Developmental Centers that he wants to close. He claimed to be unaware that NJ has over 300 people living in Developmental Center Settings out of state and that NJ Centers do not accept placements without a court order, which is why enrollment is not up."", 'By Geoff DubrowskyApril is autism awareness month, a month that I finally had decided to ignore.\nSince I am responsible for three adults with developmental disabilities I find that celebrating is no longer an option.\nThey had been given a ten-day notice that their daughter would be moved to another NJ Developmental Center some 90 miles away.\nThe story falls apart here because Thompson is in favor of closing the Developmental Centers and he decide to call me to explain his ignorance.\nTurns out he has never visited any of the States 7 Developmental Centers that he wants to close.']"

And now, researchers have found a link between binge drinking in teens and liking, owning or correctly recognizing the brand names of alcohol mentioned in songs.\n\nThe researchers - from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center in New Hampshire - have published their results in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research.\n\nThey note that alcohol is the leading cause of mortality in adolescents and young adults.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), excessive alcohol use - as in the case of binge drinking - has immediate effects, including injuries, violence, risky sexual behaviors and alcohol poisoning, which can cause loss of consciousness, low blood pressure and body temperature, coma or even death.\n\nLead author Dr. Brian A.

It is important that we understand the impact of these references in an age group that can be negatively affected by alcohol consumption.""\n\nThere is a need to examine influence of alcohol brand mentions in music\n\nTo investigate how pop music references to alcohol might impact adolescents, Dr. Primack and his colleagues used a random-digit-dial survey of over 2,500 young people in the US between the ages of 15 and 23 years old.\n\nShare on Pinterest Adolescents who accurately identified which alcohol brands were mentioned in certain songs were more likely to have binged on alcohol.\n\nOf these participants, the team found that 59% reported having had a ""complete alcoholic drink"" - which was defined as either 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of hard alcohol - and of these respondents, 18% reported binge drinking at least monthly.\n\nMeanwhile, 37% reported problems due to alcohol, such as injuries.\n\nAdditionally, in the survey, participants were given titles of pop songs that include alcohol mentions. They were then asked whether they liked or owned the song, and they were asked if they could remember what brand of alcohol appeared in the lyrics.\n\nResults showed that those who could accurately remember the alcohol brands were twice as likely to have had a complete alcoholic drink, compared with those who could not identify the brand, and they were also more likely to have ever binged on alcohol.\n\nThe researchers say this was the case, even after they adjusted for age, socioeconomic status and alcohol use by friends or parents.\n\nThey note that about a quarter of pop songs contain references to drinking or alcohol brands, which means the average adolescent is exposed to around 14 drinking references per song-hour.\n\n""Brand references may serve as advertising,"" says Dr. Sargent, senior author of the study, ""even if they are not paid for by the industry. This is why it is useful to examine the influence of brand mentions.""\n\nTeaching kids media literacy \'could help them make healthier decisions\'\n\nDr. Primack says they were surprised that the link they found between remembering alcohol brands in pop music and alcohol drinking in adolescents ""was as strong as the influence of parental and peer drinking and an adolescent\'s tendency toward sensation-seeking.""\n\nHe says this highlights just how much adolescents value the opinions and behavior of pop stars.\n\nDr. Primack suggests a solution could be to teach young people critical thinking skills, such as media literacy. Speaking with Medical News Today, he says parents can ask three key questions:\n\nWho made this message and why did they make it? (""By helping kids understand who is behind the message, we can help them begin to put less credence in the message."") What tricks or techniques do they use? (""How do they use techniques such as lighting, branding, testimonials, graphics, fonts and symbolism to get their point across?"") How is this different from real life? (""This is then the appropriate time to help them evaluate what the message is trying to say by looking into the truth."")\n\n""For example, a person in a music video who is chugging vodka might appear happy, wealthy and social, but if you Google \'alcoholic people,\' you will see very different images of the truth behind using that much alcohol,"" he added.', 'Every day in the US, the average adolescent is exposed to 2.5 hours of popular music and eight references to alcohol brands.\nAnd now, researchers have found a link between binge drinking in teens and liking, owning or correctly recognizing the brand names of alcohol mentioned in songs.\nShare on Pinterest Adolescents who accurately identified which alcohol brands were mentioned in certain songs were more likely to have binged on alcohol.\nThey note that about a quarter of pop songs contain references to drinking or alcohol brands, which means the average adolescent is exposed to around 14 drinking references per song-hour.\n""Brand references may serve as advertising,"" says Dr. Sargent, senior author of the study, ""even if they are not paid for by the industry.']"

""Shots, shots, shots, shots everybody!""\n\nAll that name-checking of alcohol brands encourages teens to drink, researchers say. Adolescents who liked songs like these were three times as likely to drink, and were twice as likely to binge than their peers who didn\'t like those songs.\n\nResearchers from the University of Pittsburgh surveyed more than 2,500 young people and asked them whether they liked or owned 10 randomly selected top 40 singles that referenced alcohol.\n\nThe kids who most enjoyed those hits were also the most likely to drink and binge, even after controlling for age and parental alcohol use. Only 8 percent could recall the specific brand names mentioned in the songs, but they were even more likely to drink than the rest.\n\nThe findings were published Tuesday in Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.\n\n""It is unclear how much very specific information adolescents do or do not get from popular music,"" says Dr. Brian Primack, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and the study\'s lead author. But, he says, it\'s clear that the music adolescents are listening to does have some impact on their drinking habits.\n\nParents and peers\' drinking habits can also influence young people, previous research has shown. But seeing people drink in real life is a lot different than seeing them drink in a music video, Primack tells Shots. In real life, you see the negative side effects of drinking. But most musicians don\'t talk about hangovers and addiction, he says.\n\nOf course, this study only shows that listening to certain types of music is associated with young people\'s drinking habits. It doesn\'t show that one causes the other. While it could be that the music is encouraging young people to drink, it might also be that young people who drink are more likely to listen to songs about parties and alcohol.\n\nThis isn\'t the first time researchers have looked at alcohol references in popular music. In December, researchers from Boston University and Johns Hopkins University combed through Top 40 hits from 2009 through 2011 and found that about a quarter referenced alcohol.\n\nThe most name-dropped brands of alcohol were Patron tequila, Hennessy cognac, Grey Goose vodka and Jack Daniel\'s whiskey. And that\'s not a coincidence, says David Jernigan, the director of Hopkins\' Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth, and one of the researchers behind that study.\n\n""There are some really lucrative deals being made between artists and particular brands,"" Jernigan tells Shots. Rapper and producer Sean Combs is a paid spokesperson for Ciroc vodka. Grey Goose sponsored a 2011 music tour featuring rappers like Lil Jon, the study points out, while Jack Daniel\'s sponsored a party celebrating top Nashville singers and songwriters. Many of these brands also sponsor musicians\' album release parties and music festivals, according to the study.\n\n""For at least some of these artists, promoting alcohol has become part of their business models,"" Jernigan says. Reversing that trend may be one way to reduce young people\'s exposure to alcohol in music.\n\nThe tobacco industry, for example, is banned from paying for product placements in movies. Jernigan says that kind of regulation is unlikely to happen with alcohol in the music industry. But he hopes the companies can be persuaded to exercise restraint.\n\nAnd he says teaching kids to beware of what they hear and see in the media couldn\'t hurt.\n\nWe here at Shots listened up and made a very unscientific remix of recent songs celebrating alcohol.

Neglectful parents? Forceful peers? Or Ke$ha bragging about brushing her teeth with a bottle of Jack?\n\nWhile there’s no simple answer, a new study in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research suggests alcohol brand-dropping musicians may be a lot more culpable than we’d expect. The study\'s authors polled 15- to 25-year-olds around the country about their musical preferences and drinking habits, and found a strong correlation between enjoying alcohol-reference-heavy jams and heavy drinking.\n\n""Youth tend to think that they are not influenced by media messages. Interestingly, they will tend to say that other people their age are influenced, but they themselves are not.""\n\nDuring the interviews, participants were told the titles of radio hits from 2005 to 2007 and asked if they liked the songs and could name any alcohol brands mentioned in them. After their responses were controlled for factors including sex, race, socioeconomic status, and friends\' and parents\' alcohol use, participants who liked the songs and remembered a number of brands were up to twice as likely as others to have binged at least once. Even simply liking alcohol-referencing songs was associated with more drinking.\n\nThe study\'s major caveat, of course, is that these results don\'t make the case that pop music on its own causes kids across America to get hammered on weekends. “While it may be that alcohol mentions in songs prompt adolescents to form more favorable attitudes about alcohol,"" the researchers note, ""it is also highly plausible that music-oriented adolescents who develop favorable attitudes about drinking for other reasons could be drawn to genres that promote drinking and often mention brands.""\n\nBut these results still suggest pop music contributes to the complex web of influences driving teen drinking, the researchers argue. The study includes some eye-opening statistics: Each day, the average adolescent listens to 2.5 hours of music, which includes about 35 references to drinking, eight of them brand-specific.\n\n""Youth tend to think that they are not influenced by media messages,"" says University of Pittsburgh professor Brian Primack, the study’s lead author, in a press release.

Heavy-handed educational efforts sometimes backfire by making drinking seem more rebellious and appealing, Primack says. And musicians’ close ties to alcohol companies—artists from Pitbull to Bon Iver have partnered with brands—discourage regulation of how drinking is portrayed.\n\nPrimack suggests programs that bolster media literacy may help teens think more critically about the messages they receive from music and movies.

""They are one reason, along with drug laws and mandatory sentencing, that most prisons and jails are overcrowded.""\n\nThe Treatment Advocacy Center, in partnership with the National Sheriff\'s Association, on Tuesday released a 116-page study on how corrections facilities nationwide incarcerate and medicate those with serious mental illnesses. A survey of state facilities found more than 300,000 prisoners with mental health issues, compared to just 35,000 patients receiving care in state hospitals.\n\n""It is a situation that is grossly unfair to both the inmates and the corrections officials,"" the study states, ""and should be the subject of public outrage and official action.""\n\nThe study argues corrections facilities are not equipped to provide the same level of care, and should not be expected to serve as psychiatric treatment centers. The number of patients in state hospitals peaked in 1955 at about 560,000 people, decreasing rapidly throughout decades of de-institutionalization and, more recently, budget cuts to state programs.\n\nWithout those state programs, many people have struggled to find treatment through community programs and instead make their way into the criminal justice system. We wrote earlier this year about the growing role of county jails in mental health treatment, including new medical risks and treatment delays.\n\n""The criminal justice system is not really the proper place for mental health treatment,"" Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich told the Inlander in February.\n\nIn this week\'s issue, we also examined multiple complaints regarding the Spokane County Jail\'s mental health medication approval process. Numerous inmates or their family members have filed complaints that it routinely took a week or more to receive meds essential to mental function or stability.\n\n""Whether it\'s got one cause or many causes,"" local attorney Jeffry Finer says, ""it\'s so evidently a pattern that people aren\'t getting proper medical care when they need it.""\n\nThe advocacy center study echoed common concerns regarding locking the mentally ill in corrections facilities. Many facilities resort to isolating mentally ill prisoners in solitary cells to avoid behavioral outbursts or their victimization at the hands of other inmates. But research shows solitary confinement has its own psychological risks.\n\nInmates with mental health issues also have trouble following jail rules, which leads to a disproportionate amount of discipline against them. The new study cites a Washington state prison survey that found mentally ill inmates accounted for 41 percent of behavioral infractions, but just 19 percent of the population.\n\nFinancially, a 2009 study of Washington inmates show they can cost more than three times as much to incarcerate and treat as other inmates, averaging about $101,653 a year compared to just $30,000 for other inmates. The study includes other findings on Washington.\n\nIn Idaho, the study finds the two remaining state hospital can house just 145 patients with more and more mentally ill finding their ways into the corrections system. The report notes the state remains near the bottom in mental health spending.\n\n""In fact, the quality of care in the two state hospitals is surprisingly good, if you can gain admission,"" the study states. ""But as these hospitals continue to be downsized, most mentally ill persons who need to be hospitalized are ending up in prisons and jails.""\n\nThe study cites a single month in 2013 in which four prisoners were found hanging from bed sheets in corrections facilities.\n\nIn hopes of moving communities away from corrections-based treatment, the study offers several recommendations to bolster prisoner care and work toward diverting individuals into treatment programs.\n\nSuggestions include changing state laws to ease diversion and medication processes. It also recommends new cost studies to define the expenses throughout the system.

Fuller Torrey noted.\n\n“We’ve basically gone back to where we were 170 years ago,” Torrey tells Kaiser Health News. “We are doing an abysmal job of treating people with serious mental illnesses in this country. It is both inhumane and shocking the way we have dumped them into the state prisons and the local jails.”\n\nTorrey and others have said an effort begun in the 1950s to deinstitutionalize the mentally ill sought to get patients out of large, public institutions and into community treatment programs, with support systems designed to get patients jobs and housing.\n\nAnd the numbers fell: from roughly 560,000 patients in state hospitals in 1950 to 154,000 in 1980, the new report says. But these days, too many mentally ill people end up in jail or prison, the report says.\n\nIn all, the Department of Justice has estimated that nationwide about 15 percent of state prisoners, and 24 percent in jails, ""reported symptoms that met the criteria for a psychotic disorder.""\n\nThe report offers a grim picture in Minnesota: ""The largest public institution for seriously mentally ill individuals in Minnesota is the Security Hospital at St. Peter. Its 400 patients are restricted to forensic cases and sex offenders. For mentally ill individuals who need brief hospitalization for medication stabilization, there are very few options, since the remainder of the state hospital system has been virtually closed. In Minneapolis, many end up in the Hennepin County Jail, which, \'on any given day holds 100 to 200 inmates with severe psychiatric disorders.\'""\n\nState leaders have taken note. ""We\'ve been using our criminal justice system as a substitute for a well-functioning mental health system – we\'ve sort of criminalized mental illness and addiction,"" Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said last year, as he introduced a bill to combat the issue.\n\nThe problem can be especially acute in rural areas. “In my opinion, we’ve gone back to the dark ages,” Kandiyohi County Attorney Jenna Fischer told the Star Tribune last year. “It’s a tiny segment of the mentally ill, but we are failing them.”\n\nThe Star Tribune noted that Minnesota spent several decades shifting patients out of huge state hospitals into more local programs, and for many, the change was largely successful. But for others with volatile mental states, the change has not gone smoothly – during one 18-month span, roughly 4,000 in the state with acute mental illness ended up in jail, where judges committed them to state facilities, the newspaper notes.\n\nThe issue of moving the sex offenders out of the state\'s St. Peter facility have been the subject of much debate and a class-action lawsuit in recent months.\n\nGov. Mark Dayton and a federal judge have urged state lawmakers to review whether roughly 700 sex offenders held at St. Peter and a facility in Moose Lake can be civilly committed indefinitely – or whether keeping them there violates their rights and amounts to further punishment after they have served prison sentences.', 'A national report released earlier this week contained an eye-popping statistic: State jails and prisons have 10 times more mentally ill inmates (an estimated 356,268) than state psychiatric hospitals have patients.\nThe numbers now are similar to the U.S. mental health system in 1830, before reformers like Dorothea Dix led efforts to push the mentally ill out of prisons and into hospitals, report author Dr. E.

In fact, there are far more people with severe mental illness in prisons than in hospitals.\n\nCorrectional facilities housed 356,268 inmates with severe mental illness as of 2012, according to a report from the nonprofit Treatment Advocacy Center. Psychiatric hospitals, on the other hand, housed only 35,000 patients, a tenth as many as are in prison.\n\nIn all of the states except six—Washington, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas and New Jersey— correctional facilities hold more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state hospital.\n\nThe Treatment Advocacy Center says the decision to turn prisons into de facto mental wards has cost governments substantial sums of money.\n\nIn 2009 it cost Washington state about $30,000 to house the average, non-mentally ill prisoner. But it cost more than three times as much, more than $100,000 a year, to lock up those suffering serious mental illness. Part of that is attributable to the mentally ill spending longer in prison because of rule violations and their inability to make bail.\n\nIn Orange County, Florida, the average stay of inmates is 26 days, unless they’re mentally ill, in which case the average jumps to 51 days. At Rikers Island jail in New York, the disparity is much greater: 42 days for non-mentally ill, 215 for those who are.\n\nOne solution for reducing the number of people with mental health problems in prisons and jails would be to expand Assisted Outpatient Treatment (AOT), according to the center. AOT programs allow judges to let the mentally ill to remain in their communities, as long as they keep taking their medication. If they fail to do so, the offenders can be involuntarily committed.\n\nA pilot project in Nevada County, California, reduced jail time for mentally ill people from 521 days to 17, according to Mother Jones. Likewise, a North Carolina study showed AOT cut arrests of mentally ill from 45% to 12%.\n\nMentally ill Americans were routinely thrown together with prisoners until the mid-19th century, when reformer Dorothea Dix began a movement to create state hospitals for the mentally ill.

Jails and prisons currently hold more mentally ill people than state hospitals in America.\n\nVox reported on the published study and the study found that 356,268 inmates have a severe mental illness, and there has been a major push for deinstitutionalization since the 1950s. Deinstitutionalization is the movement to remove the mentally ill from long-stay mental facilities and place them into community-based treatment centers.\n\nForty-four states and Washington D.C. have correctional facilities that house more mentally ill people than each of those states’ largest mental health facility. The TAC report outlined many problems caused by housing mentally ill inmates:\n\nOvercrowding from mentally ill inmates incarcerated longer than other inmates\n\nVictimization of prisoners with mental illness\n\nDecreased condition of mental state among mentally ill inmates who aren’t treated\n\nDisproportionate suicide rates\n\nIncreased tax burden\n\nFor instance, Florida jails and prisons have some of the toughest difficulties in properly caring for its mentally ill jail population. The Dade County Jail system in Miami incarcerates over 6,000 inmates, and the system has become known as the de facto largest “mental institution” in Florida.\n\nMentally ill inmates “screech and cower at unseen demons,” said a Dade County jail psychiatrist. “They pace furiously and rip their paper gowns off. They urinate on the floor and bathe in the toilet. I don’t even try to describe to people what’s going on here. It’s beyond talking about.”\n\nMentally ill inmates in Florida stay incarcerated eight times longer than other inmates, and 23 percent of mentally ill inmates are on psychotropic drugs. They cost 63 percent more to care for and house than other inmates, as well. But how do mentally ill people end up in jail in the first place? TAC reported that the reason is because there is a huge lack of community programs focused on treating these people.\n\nFlorida news organizations have reported that some mentally ill people within the criminal justice system have been arrested hundreds of times. Henry Farrell of south Florida has been arrested 190 times and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\nIf there were an abundance of community programs aimed a mental treatment, they would likely lessen this revolving-door effect visited upon many mentally ill people across the nation.\n\nStudies have found that a regular mental treatment would greatly decrease the chances of people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder getting arrested. However, the current system just perpetuates high crime rates, chronic recidivism, and wasted taxpayer money as these people go unhelped.\n\nJosh is a writer and researcher with Ring of Fire.

Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist who’s spent 40 years studying America's treatment (or lack thereof) of the mentally ill, hears from schizophrenic prison inmates. Prisoners in their own mind with no way out, they wreak havoc at jails across the nation: throwing feces at guards, singing for days on end, battling with the voices in their own heads. Worst of all, they’re alone.\n\nIn a new study by Treatment Advocacy Center (TAC), a nonprofit dedicated to eliminating barriers to treating the mentally ill, Torrey and his colleagues expose just how bleak America’s mental health situation has become. In 2012, an estimated 356,000 mentally ill inmates were being held in state prison, compared to just 35,000 in state-run psychiatric hospitals. In other words, the number of mentally ill people in prisons is ten times that of mentally ill in state-run psychiatric hospitals.\n\nTorrey’s basic tenet is nauseating: the majority of mentally ill in America are treated like monsters.\n\n“Being in prison if your brain is working normally can’t be easy, but being in prison when your brain isn’t working normally? It must be a living hell,” Torrey tells me. Torrey has himself borne witness to the locking up of the mentally ill, and he paints a grim picture of the scene. “Some throw feces at the guards, sing all night to keep others awake, assault other inmates out of paranoia that they’re in danger.”\n\nTorrey began the research for this project over a year ago when a visit to Erie County Jail in Buffalo, New York left him stunned. Upon arrival, he found what he believed to be a paranoid schizophrenic and bipolar inmate who had been sitting in his cell hallucinating for over a year. Without treatment he’d gone ballistic, cutting down tension polls that wiped out electricity in hundreds of homes nearby. Solitary confinement, Torrey says, was likely his next home.\n\nWhile TAC’s study—titled The Treatment of Persons With Mental Illness in Prisons and Jails—isn’t the first of its kind, it’s notable for two reasons: it’s the first to analyze the data by state, and it’s the most recent illustration that the problem is growing more acute. Some states, such as New York, operate satellite mental health units, providing treatment to upwards of 16,000 inmates at 28 different state prisons. A 2011 study estimated that of the 12,200 inmates at Riker’s Island, ⅓ of the men and ⅔ of the women are mentally ill.\n\nThe driving force behind the decrease in available beds, and thus reliable care, seems fueled entirely by money. In an effort to save taxpayer dollars, states have been decreasing the number of beds in their psychiatric hospitals for decades. It’s a practice Folley doubts saves any taxpayer money—and, owing to the high cost of prisons, may cost them more. “The idea that we’re saving money by emptying hospitals is a complete myth. Taxpayers are not saving any money this way.”\n\nA longstanding issue in America, the problem is undoubtedly reaching new highs. During the 50s, the total number of beds in America’s psychiatric state-run hospitals neared 559,000. Today, the number of beds is down to roughly 35,000. With a population almost double what it was in the 50s, this means that the majority of mentally ill are left with two options: jail or the street. “I know of police officers who have stumbled on homeless who are mentally ill and completed debilitated. They put them in jail—just to keep them safe,” Torrey says.\n\nAmong the roadblocks to providing beneficial treatment is getting the prisoners themselves to admit they need help. In 31 states, a provision is in place allowing the prison to forego consent and offer involuntary treatment that includes medicine and therapy. For the other 19, things are more complicated, often requiring a court order and approval from a committee to proceed.\n\nIn the past six months, The White House has displayed an increased concern for the issue. In September, Vice President Joe Biden announced a $100 million plan aimed at increasing the availability of mental health services, a direct result of the increase in mass shootings in America. It’s a smart move. A Gallup poll from September revealed that 48 percent of Americans blame gun violence on our flawed mental health system.\n\n“Why doesn’t anybody care?” Torrey asks aloud. “That’s more of a political issue. What most people don’t understand is that the great majority of mentally ill in prison don’t need to be there.”\n\nEditor's Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that New York state requires mentally ill inmates be sent to psychiatric hospitals. In fact, The New York State Office of Mental Health provides psychiatric care to thousands of individuals within prison-based settings and also operates a psychiatric center dedicated to inmate inpatient care, a facility which has no waiting list."", 'In 2012, an estimated 356,000 mentally ill inmates were being held in state prison, compared to just 35,000 in state-run psychiatric hospitals.\nIn other words, the number of mentally ill people in prisons is ten times that of mentally ill in state-run psychiatric hospitals.\nTorrey’s basic tenet is nauseating: the majority of mentally ill in America are treated like monsters.\nTorrey has himself borne witness to the locking up of the mentally ill, and he paints a grim picture of the scene.\n“I know of police officers who have stumbled on homeless who are mentally ill and completed debilitated.']"

The U.S. correctional system as a whole houses more persons with mental illness than all the other systems combined, that is nearly 1.3 million people diagnosed with a mental illness who are incarcerated and are receiving little to no treatment.\n\n\n\nMentally ill offenders in jail cost the tax payers nearly double of what a non-mentally inmate costs due to the services and medication that is required, that adds up to nearly $26,000 a year; that is more than a brand Honda Accord! In Santa Cruz County, the budget for medication alone is in excess of $100,000 a year, almost twice the median income in Santa Cruz. As we can see, the brilliant idea of the 1950’s deinstitutionalization didn’t quite pan out; the severely mentally ill just switched places from mental hospitals, where they actually received services, to jails, where they are denied treatment and the staff is not trained to work with them. It’s obvious that something needs to change!\n\n\n\nLucky for us, Santa Cruz County is blazing the trail for treatment for mentally ill offenders. We are known across the state for its innovative and collaborate efforts to provide treatment to mentally ill offenders rather than incarceration while addressing the needs and safety of the community. In 2012, the Health Services Agency partnered with Santa Cruz County Probation in an effort to develop the MOST program (Maintaining On-Going Stability through Treatment). This collaboration, along with contributions from the city and the Sheriff, provided the funding for the program for three years. This is not grant money or MHSA funding; this is our local agencies recognizing a problem and putting forth all available resources to serve the community.\n\n\n\nThe MOST program has proven to reduce incarceration and recidivism for mentally ill offenders who participate in the MOST program; in the 12 months prior to MOST participation individuals banked 8,661 jail days, 12 months after joining MOST the jail days have decreased to 1,392; that is a savings of more than three quarters of a million dollars, almost enough to purchase a home in Santa Cruz. The MOST program provides wrap around services for mentally ill offenders including intensive case management, jail crisis intervention team, jail discharge planner, treatment for co-occurring disorders, and alternatives to incarceration. The program also funds a downtown outreach worker who works closely with law enforcement, security firms, and merchants to identify those displaying at risk behaviors and get them the help they need, rather than being jailed, at the same time keeping the public safe.\n\n\n\nEvery year another program’s budget gets cut, and we are continually asked to do more with less. This has to stop. There is currently legislation in Congress, Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Act (H.R. 401/ S. 162) which will provide $50 million in grants made available to state, tribal and local governments to be used to develop and implement programs designed to improve the outcomes for individuals diagnosed with mental illness and involved with the criminal justice system, programs like the MOST program. Other states and counties do not have to reinvent the wheel, Santa Cruz is already showing them how it is done; they just need the money to get the wheel rolling. If this legislation is passed The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Act of 2013 will allow for these desperately needed services to remain funded and perhaps even expand over the next five years.\n\n\n\nBeing diagnosed with a mental illness is not an excuse to commit a crime or not pay for a crime committed, but it doesn’t mean that incarceration is the appropriate consequence; people should not be punished, they should be treated. Incarceration rather than treatment, in essence, is torture. In fact it is cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\n\nBrenda Olave Campbell, Sereena Wilks-Myrie, Douglas George, Luda Olson MSW Candidates at University of Southern California’s School of Social Work\n\n', 'Treatment for Mentally Ill Offenders by Brenda Olave CampbellWednesday Apr 9th, 2014 12:35 PMThis is an editorial regarding the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Act of 2013 (H.R.\n401/ S. 162) and the treatment of mentally ill offenders.\nTreatment For Mentally Ill OffendersThe Los Angeles County jail, a psych ward?\nIn Santa Cruz County, the budget for medication alone is in excess of $100,000 a year, almost twice the median income in Santa Cruz.\nLucky for us, Santa Cruz County is blazing the trail for treatment for mentally ill offenders.']"

The passage of the Affordable Care Act will make coverage of mental health and drug treatment one of the “10 essential health benefits” that all insurers must offer.\n\nAn historic shift in mental health care treatment from the states to federal government and local facilities beginning in the 1950s resulted in huge dislocation of the mentally ill, untold suffering by the most vulnerable in society, and a massive increase in the government’s overall cost.\n\n\n\nRelated: A New Push to Boost Spending on Mental Health\n\nNationwide, an estimated 356,268 people with mental illnesses including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are in prisons and jails, compared to just 35,000 who are being treated in state hospitals, according to the study by Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Sheriffs’ Association.\n\nAt their peak census in 1955, state mental hospitals held 558,922 patients. Today, they hold a tiny fraction of that number, and states are continuing to close beds.\n\nThe tenfold difference today between jailing and hospitalizing mentally ill people is similar to the Dickensian mental health system in the 1830s, before Dorothea Dix and other reformists agitated for legislation to move people with mental illness out of prisons and into hospital care, according to E. Fuller Torey, a psychiatrist and lead author of the new report. .\n\n“There’s been a fairly dramatic continuing increase in the number of severely mentally ill in jails and prisons,” Torrey said in an interview on Tuesday. “It’s gone up progressively since the 1970s. The fact is that in most states the largest de facto mental institution is a jail or prison.”\n\nMany of these mentally ill people end up in jail on relatively minor charges, such as trespassing, stealing food, or urinating in public. Others are arrested for more serious offenses, such as robbery or attacking someone in the street or even murder. And once they are arrested and incarcerated, their lives get swept up in a downward spiral, according to experts.\n\nRelated: The Mental Anguish of the Long-term Unemployed\n\nPrisoners with mental illnesses often are put in seclusion for long periods of time, remain incarcerated longer than other prisoners, and are disproportionally abused, beaten and raped by other inmates, the study found. In addition, prisoners with mental illness who are not treated often become sicker.\n\n“The conditions for people who are severely mentally ill living in jails and prisons are in many cases a living hell – and it’s very difficult to treat these people because of the way state laws are written,” Torrey explained.\n\nThe study confirms what many mental health care advocates and watchdog groups have been warning for years: that the grand experiment of deinstitutionalization is a massive failure – and a costly one at that.\n\nThe federal government spends an estimated $111.7 billion a year on public mental health efforts, including $45.7 billion in Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments, $60 billion in Medicare and Medicaid coverage, $5.7 billion for mental health programs under the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and $386 million for mental health block grants to the states.\n\nRelated: 6 Ways Obamacare Is Changing Mental Health Coverage\n\nSpending on incarcerating the mentally ill adds another $10 billion to the annual cost, according to computations by Torrey for his recent book, “American Psychosis: How the Federal Government Destroyed the Mental Illness Treatment System.”\n\nAdd to that the costs of law enforcement, courts and public shelters used by mentally ill and the government’s overall annual cost tops $140 billion.\n\nThe shift from treatment in state hospitals to community-based facilities initially began in response to complaints about inadequate care, overcrowding and horrible living conditions in the state hospitals. But the states’ primary motive was to offload their financial burden to the federal government.', 'A new report documenting that ten times as many mentally ill people are being incarcerated in jails and prisons as are being treated in psychiatric hospitals and community facilities highlights a massive breakdown in the nation’s mental health system that began a half century ago.\nAt their peak census in 1955, state mental hospitals held 558,922 patients.\n“There’s been a fairly dramatic continuing increase in the number of severely mentally ill in jails and prisons,” Torrey said in an interview on Tuesday.\n“The conditions for people who are severely mentally ill living in jails and prisons are in many cases a living hell – and it’s very difficult to treat these people because of the way state laws are written,” Torrey explained.\nThe shift from treatment in state hospitals to community-based facilities initially began in response to complaints about inadequate care, overcrowding and horrible living conditions in the state hospitals.']"

It also encouraged cost studies to compare the true cost of housing individuals in prisons or jails as opposed to treating them in the community.\n\nMentally ill Americans who are imprisoned often leave incarceration sicker than when they entered, according to the report, released by the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating barriers to the timely and effective treatment of severe mental illness.\n\n“The lack of treatment for seriously ill inmates is inhumane and should not be allowed in a civilized society,” Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center and lead author of the study, said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nIn 2012, there were an estimated 356,268 inmates with severe mental illnesses in U.S. prisons and jails. There were only 35,000 mentally ill individuals in state psychiatric hospitals.\n\n“In 44 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, a prison or jail in that state holds more individuals with serious mental illness than the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital,” the report said. “For example, in Ohio, 10 state prisons and two county jails each hold more mentally ill inmates than does the largest remaining state hospital.”\n\nSome mentally ill prisoners refuse treatment because they are unaware of their illness — which worsens their symptoms, the report said. Treatment for mental illness is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe incarceration of these individuals leads to increased taxpayer costs in the long run, according to the report. Mentally ill prisoners have higher rates of recidivism.\n\nThe National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) — the nation’s largest grassroots mental health organization — offers alternatives to incarceration on its website. NAMI suggests training programs for police officers who come into contact with people with severe mental illnesses in their communities to recognize the signs and symptoms and respond appropriately.\n\nState courts should also be given the authority to divert nonviolent offenders with severe mental illness away from incarceration and into appropriate treatment, NAMI said.\n\nIn December, the White House announced a $100 million campaign to increase access to mental health services.\n\n""The fact that less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health problems receive the treatment they need is unacceptable.

Instead, the hope was to give mental health patients the treatment they needed to integrate into the community, with a support system that encouraged access to jobs and housing.\n\nThe population in state mental hospitals fell to 154,000 in 1980 and, according to the TAC report out today, now hovers around 35,000.

The US prison population has steadily increased as mental health funding has decreased, the National Alliance on Mental Illness has found.\n\nPrisoners with mental health issues are often put in solitary confinement for long periods of time, stay incarcerated longer than other prisoners, and are disproportionately abused, beaten, and raped by other inmates, the new report noted.

The disparity is also a nationwide problem – only six states have psychiatric hospitals with more people in them than a prisons or jail.\n\nPrisons, according to the report, have become the nation’s “new asylums.” The number of beds available at hospitals for mental health patients has been dropping for decades. And as the population of incarcerated people has exploded, so has the number of people with serious problems. A 2012 report, also by TAC, found that state mental health agencies cut nearly 10% of their available beds between 2009 and 2012.\n\nThe report provided a breakdown of the number of mentally ill prisoners in each state’s correctional facilities, the laws governing treatment, and examples of how inmates are treated. Among others, they include a Mississippi prison designed for mentally ill inmates, overrun by rats, where “some prisoners capture the rats, put them on makeshift leashes, and sell them as pets to other inmates. There was also a case in which a schizophrenic man spent 13 of 15 of his years in prison in solitary confinement.\n\nIn addition to a dearth of resources outside of the criminal justice system, treatment inside has not kept up with that population increase, according to the report.\n\n“Inmates who linger untreated in jails and prisons become increasingly more vulnerable to their symptoms and the resulting victimization or violence,” the report read. Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center and lead author of the study, said in a statement, “The lack of treatment for seriously ill inmates is inhumane and should not be allowed in a civilized society.”\n\nGoing without treatment can also lead to prison sentences some people might not have received otherwise. An example comes from South Carolina where a Navy veteran in jail on minor charges became manic and threatened a judge and two police officers and spit and threw excrement at guards trying to give him medicine and food. After those incidents, he was sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nMany fixtures of modern prisons can make already sick inmates worse. In February, a Senate panel called for an end to the use of solitary confinement for mentally ill individuals, pregnant women, and juveniles. Human rights groups argue that extended solitary confinement constitutes torture.\n\nThe report’s authors admit that reducing the number of mentally ill inmates in jails would have to come along with a massive recommitment to high-quality mental health care in hospitals – a tall order in this age of austerity. In the interim, they advocate for more outpatient treatment and jail diversion programs, as well as more planning, both when inmates enter the system and leave it.\n\nIn the end, however, the report’s findings are likely to fit well with arguments from other prison reform advocates based around cost. Studies on the cost of incarcerating mentally ill people, the study said, “would provide public officials with a more accurate basis for making mental illness treatment policy and unmask cost savings that are illusory.” One recent study by the Urban Institute has shown prison costs exploding, and another found that 17 states stand to save up to $4.6 billion through reducing their prison populations.', 'America’s prisons house ten times more people with mental illnesses than its hospitals, according to a new report.\nThe report, released Tuesday by the Treatment Advocacy Center, found that state prisons and county jails house approximately 356,268 people with mental illnesses, while state mental hospitals hold only 35,000.\nPrisons, according to the report, have become the nation’s “new asylums.” The number of beds available at hospitals for mental health patients has been dropping for decades.\n“Inmates who linger untreated in jails and prisons become increasingly more vulnerable to their symptoms and the resulting victimization or violence,” the report read.\nIn February, a Senate panel called for an end to the use of solitary confinement for mentally ill individuals, pregnant women, and juveniles.']"

That’s resulted in the incarceration of about 356,268 people with mental illnesses — compared to just about 35,000 people who are receiving treatment in state hospitals.\n\nDr. E. Fuller Torrey, the founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center and the lead author of the group’s new report, believes that’s on par with with the mental health system that was in place in the 1830s. Back then, before advocates pushed to end the mass incarceration of mentally ill individuals, people suffering from mental health issues were often subject to deplorable conditions in prison. But Torrey doesn’t believe much has changed.\n\n“We’ve basically gone back to where we were 170 years ago,” Torrey told Kaiser Health News. “We are doing an abysmal job of treating people with serious mental illnesses in this country. It is both inhumane and shocking the way we have dumped them into the state prisons and the local jails.”\n\nAccording to the report, 44 states and the District of Columbia have at least one jail that houses more people with mental illnesses than the largest state psychiatric hospital does. Many of these people are funneled into the prison system because they have nowhere else to go. States have slashed billions from their mental health services over the past several years, and the number of available psychiatric hospital beds has recently dropped to the lowest level since 1850. As mental health funding has disappeared, the prison population has skyrocketed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of the prisoners who suffer from mental health issues are grappling with mood and psychotic disorders, like severe depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Some of them are resistant to treatment. But obviously, prison guards aren’t health care professionals. They’re typically ill equipped to work toward rehabilitation, and most states prohibit them from giving prisoners medication against their will.\n\n“We have placed more than 300,000 severely mentally ill individuals in prisons and jails that are neither equipped nor staffed to handle such problems. We subsequently have made it very difficult to treat the mentally ill inmates, put restriction on other options for controlling their behavior, and then blamed the prison and jail administrators when they fail,” the report concludes. “It is a situation that is grossly unfair to both the inmates and the corrections officials and should be the subject of public outrage and official action.”\n\nAlthough some states argue that jailing mental health patients is cheaper than funding state hospitals, giving psychiatric patients adequate mental health care actually saves states money in the long run. Researchers from North Carolina State University and the University of South Florida recently found that ensuring access to affordable outpatient mental health treatment, like medication and counseling, helps keep mentally ill people out of jail and lower state governments’ overall expenses.\n\nNonetheless, Republican lawmakers have enacted a major roadblock to expanding affordable access to mental health care. The GOP politicians who continue to resist Obamacare’s optional Medicaid expansion are preventing an estimated 1.2 million low-income Americans from getting coverage for the mental health services they need.', 'That’s resulted in the incarceration of about 356,268 people with mental illnesses — compared to just about 35,000 people who are receiving treatment in state hospitals.\nBack then, before advocates pushed to end the mass incarceration of mentally ill individuals, people suffering from mental health issues were often subject to deplorable conditions in prison.\n“We are doing an abysmal job of treating people with serious mental illnesses in this country.\n“We have placed more than 300,000 severely mentally ill individuals in prisons and jails that are neither equipped nor staffed to handle such problems.\nNonetheless, Republican lawmakers have enacted a major roadblock to expanding affordable access to mental health care.']"

Since 1970, Torrey says that percentage has risen from an average of about 5 percent to 15-20 percent.\n\n“There is not a single state in the United States where you want to go to a jail or prison and be severely mentally ill,” says Torrey. He adds that many jails and prisons are trying to improve their care of prisoners with mental illnesses, but they are hampered by state laws that make forced treatment difficult.\n\nIn 31 states, prisons can administer treatment over a prisoner’s objections by requesting a special treatment review committee, but the process is often difficult and the report calls such efforts “grossly underutilized.” Some people with mental illness refuse treatment, often because they are not aware that they are sick.\n\n“This causes major problems,” the authors write in the report. “Jail officials can thus be legally sued in many states if they forcibly medicate mentally ill prisoners without their consent, yet can also be held legally responsible for the consequences of such prisoners’ psychotic behavior,” including suicide.\n\nTorrey adds that there is often a fundamental mismatch between guards and prisoners with mental illnesses. “People who work in jails and prisons signed up because they wanted to take care of bad people. So you get some personality types that are not compatible with taking care of people with serious mental illnesses,” he says.\n\nPrisoners with mental illnesses often are put in seclusion for long periods of time, remain incarcerated longer than other prisoners, and are disproportionally abused, beaten and raped by other inmates. In addition, prisoners with mental illness who are not treated often become sicker.\n\nThe solution to the problem, according to the authors of the report, is to create a public mental health system that helps people with serious psychiatric problems “before they are so disordered they commit acts that result in their arrest.” This includes court-ordered outpatient treatment and jail diversion programs such as mental health courts.\n\nThe authors also recommend reforming jail and prison treatment laws to more easily allow staff members to administer involuntary medication for inmates with mental illnesses who are gravely disabled, deteriorating or pose a likelihood of serious harm to themselves or others.\n\nThe issue of court-ordered outpatient treatment divides the mental health community with organizations like The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and Mental Health America opposing it on the grounds that it violates the civil liberties of people with serious mental illnesses.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

That gap is significantly larger than it was just four years ago. when the group did a similar study and found the number of mentally ill individuals in prisons and jails outnumbered that found in state mental hospitals, three to one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, in 44 states, the largest institution housing people with severe psychiatric disease is now a prison or jail.\n\nThe group’s review of state and county correctional system policies for mental health treatment found some possible reasons why. In most states, treatment for mental illness is extremely difficult to obtain and inmates leave jail sicker than when they entered, due in part to an over reliance on solitary confinement.\n\nThe report had harsh words for some local correctional systems. It criticized the District over suicides at the D.C. Jail, and said that despite the city’s efforts to improve services, “the main beneficiaries appear to have been the private contractors who operate group homes and outpatient services,” the quality of which the study deemed, “mediocre, as can be measured by the abundance of untreated seriously mentally ill individuals among the homeless population and the high percentage of mentally ill inmates.”\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Maryland, the largest public institution for individuals with psychiatric illnesses is the 900-bed Patuxent Institution in Jessup. The largest state mental hospital, Spring Grove Hospital Center with 380 beds, holds fewer mentally ill inmates than the Baltimore County Jail, which has 2,200 inmates. The Treatment Advocacy Center criticized Maryland for requiring mentally ill inmates to go through a civil commitment process before getting involuntary treatment.\n\nIn Virginia, Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg, with 300 beds, is the largest remaining state psychiatric hospital. The Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt, the largest state prison, holds 3,006 inmates, about 15 percent of whom, or 451 are estimated to be mentally ill. The report said the dearth of treatment options behind bars “is consistent with a longstanding failure in Virginia to prioritize treatment for the sickest mentally ill patients.”\n\nThe federal prison system was not part of Tuesday’s study, but the Bureau of Prisons is facing lawsuits over its use of solitary confinement for the mentally ill at the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX) in Florence, Colo., a.k.a. the Alcatraz of the Rockies. Many of the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits, Cunningham v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, are District inmates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe report was released a couple weeks after a congressional hearing, where law enforcement officials from other parts of the country talked about their experiences working the front lines of the nation’s mental health system. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, as recounted in the blog of mental health advocate and former Post reporter Pete Earley, blamed “dramatic and sustained cuts in mental health funding” for criminalizing mental illness and turning prisons and county jails into mental health hospitals.\n\nAD', 'The center found that there are now ten times the number of individuals with serious mental illness in state prisons and county jails than in the nation’s remaining state mental hospitals.\nwhen the group did a similar study and found the number of mentally ill individuals in prisons and jails outnumbered that found in state mental hospitals, three to one.\nThe group’s review of state and county correctional system policies for mental health treatment found some possible reasons why.\nThe Treatment Advocacy Center criticized Maryland for requiring mentally ill inmates to go through a civil commitment process before getting involuntary treatment.\nCook County Sheriff Tom Dart, as recounted in the blog of mental health advocate and former Post reporter Pete Earley, blamed “dramatic and sustained cuts in mental health funding” for criminalizing mental illness and turning prisons and county jails into mental health hospitals.']"

A bunch of mathematicians say they can make the adjustment less painful with a smartphone app that calculates the swiftest way to adjust.\n\nUsers plug in the time zone they\'re traveling to, and the app will do the calculations before spitting out a schedule specifying when the user should stay in bright light, low light or be in the dark, says Olivia Walch, a graduate student at the University of Michigan who designed the app.\n\n""The conventional wisdom is for every hour you\'re shifting, it\'s about a day of adjustment,"" Walch says. So Washington, D.C., travelers going to Hong Kong — a 12-hour time difference — could take up to 12 days to adjust. The app can reduce that time to roughly four or five days, the inventors say.\n\nThere are other jet lag apps out there, but few actually have science to back them up. The Entrain app is based on the premise that the body\'s circadian clock relies heavily on light to know what time of day it is.\n\n""In your brain you have a central circadian clock ... [that] sends signals all throughout the body,"" says Danny Forger, a professor of mathematics and computational medicine at Michigan and the mastermind behind the app. And that central clock controls all of the body\'s biological functions.\n\nThe free app, which is named after that process of entrainment, recommends a schedule of light exposure to sync the body to a different time zone in the quickest way possible.\n\nThe app also can be customized based on the amount of light a person is actually getting. It then recalculates the schedule for the days ahead.\n\nUnlike with many of the apps out there, Forger and his colleagues have more than 80 pages of complex science and calculus in a study, published Thursday in PLoS Computational Biology, to support their product.\n\nUsing two mathematical equations that predict how light affects the human circadian clock, Forger and his colleagues simulated the optimal schedules for more than 1,000 possible trips. They then applied two basic principles. One is to be exposed to one big block of light and one big block of dark in your day, Walch says. Another is to be exposed to the brightest possible light.\n\nThe equations themselves aren\'t new; they have been used by NASA, the transportation industry and the military, according to Forger. But he says he\'s finally putting that technology in the palm of the average person\'s hand.\n\nThink about flying from the East Coast of the U.S. to Japan, says Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a sleep medicine and disorder researcher at Harvard Medical School. You can fly through each time zone one by one and have your circadian clock slowly adjust, or you can do what airplanes do.\n\n""They basically fly up to the North Pole and skip across multiple time zones and then go back down again rather than having to cross each intermediate time zone,"" Klerman, who wasn\'t involved in the study, says. ""Well, the equations that Forger used are able help you skip across time zones.""\n\nThe Entrain app hasn\'t yet been flight tested, but Klerman thinks it should work.\n\n""Theoretically, there would be ways to speed up re-entrainment, but you need to do experiments to make sure whether it works, because humans don\'t always respond the way mathematical models expect them to,"" she tells Shots. ""But he has based his model on decades of thorough experiment, and a model that has been tested very thoroughly.\n\nYouTube\n\n""So I would like to think that he\'s right,"" she says.', ""This Jet Lag App Does The Math So You'll Feel Better FasterEnlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphotoJet lag is nobody's idea of fun.\nThere are other jet lag apps out there, but few actually have science to back them up.\nThe Entrain app is based on the premise that the body's circadian clock relies heavily on light to know what time of day it is.\nUsing two mathematical equations that predict how light affects the human circadian clock, Forger and his colleagues simulated the optimal schedules for more than 1,000 possible trips.\nYou can fly through each time zone one by one and have your circadian clock slowly adjust, or you can do what airplanes do.""]"

Here\'s how it works: The app tells users when to manipulate their exposure to light so they can ""cheat"" their circadian clock and adjust to new time zones more quickly.\n\nLight has a significant influence on the way the circadian clock regulates people\'s basic bodily functions, such as sleep, said Olivia Walch, a doctoral student at the University of Michigan who built the app. [10 Technologies That Will Transform Your Life]\n\n""Light has different effects on your circadian clock at different times of the day,"" Walch said. ""Just a little bit of light can shift your clock.""\n\nThe app works based on two mathematical models that describe circadian rhythms. The models are outlined in a study published today (April 10) in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.\n\n""Overcoming jet lag is fundamentally a math problem, and we\'ve calculated the optimal way of doing it,"" said study author Danny Forger, a professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nThe app designs lighting schedules for its users, based on their itinerary. All of the schedules follow a basic rule: You should be exposed to the brightest light possible at one point during the day and to darkness at another point.\n\nDepending on your destination, exposure times can be inconvenient. For instance, the app may suggest that you be exposed to bright outdoor light late at night. The researchers said people could use a therapeutic light box to help. And if you need to go outside into intense daylight at a time when your schedule is telling you that you should be in the darkness, it may help to wear pink-tinted glasses, the researchers said.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhen you first launch the app, it prompts you to enter the times you usually get up in the morning and go to sleep at night. The app offers only hours, not minutes, for users to enter their times.\n\nThen, the app prompts you to select your typical light exposure from the four options: low indoor (200 lux), bright indoor (500 lux), low outdoor (1,000 lux) and bright outdoor (10,000) light. Based on the time and light-exposure criteria, the app models your circadian clock.\n\nUsers can then enter a destination, and the app models a new lighting schedule in accordance with the new time zone. The schedule is saved in the app\'s Schedule icon and can then be accessed anytime you want to check whether you\'re supposed to be exposed to light or darkness.\n\nEven if you don\'t follow the recommended schedule, you can always adjust your lighting history to reflect any changes, and the app will create a new optimal schedule.\n\nIn general, the app is easy and intuitive to use. It also includes an FAQ section that explains how it works, and provides detailed information about the mechanism of circadian rhythms.\n\nFollow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter.

Hold the coffee and reach for your mobile phone. A mathematical tool promises a full recovery in just a few days, even for extreme time zone shifts. While the model has not yet been proven in the real world, a recently released app will let people try it out for themselves.\n\nYour daily activity is usually aligned with your circadian rhythm, a roughly 24-hour cycle controlled by exposure to light and darkness. But a sudden change in schedule caused by travelling to a different time zone can throw off this internal clock.\n\nTimed exposure to bright lights can trigger biological markers associated with sleep patterns, such as levels of the sleep-related hormone melatonin and body temperature. That can help get the body in sync with a new schedule. Previous work on adjusting to jet lag showed that people who experience a 12-hour time shift but forgo light therapy will still be off-schedule after 12 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMathematical models that recommend exposure patterns already exist, and the best current versions require more than a week of carefully adjusting your light exposure to get you over a 12-hour shift.\n\nWith help from Kirill Serkh at Yale University, Daniel Forger at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor used techniques from a branch of maths called optimal control theory to reengineer a model that Forger designed in 1999. “The equations are very hard to solve numerically, that’s what has taken so long,” he says.\n\nDeep darkness\n\nThe pair produced more than 1000 schedules for different scenarios, which they say are mathematically proven to beat alternative methods. The updated model prescribes alternating between complete darkness and full daylight, which can be simulated as needed with specialised lamps. The hardest part may be staying in total darkness longer than you might like.\n\nIf you have travelled 12 hours from your original time zone and want to start your day at 7 am local time, the model says you must stay in the dark until 1.10 pm on your first day, and then stay in the light until 9.50 pm. The schedule shifts each subsequent day until you are synchronised to your new time zone, which should happen by the fourth day.\n\nThe team has just released an iPhone app called Entrain that can do the number-crunching on behalf of a weary traveller. The app recommends optimal schedules and will track how well you are doing, adjusting the pattern if you make a mistake.\n\n“Let’s face it, everyone will deviate from the schedules somewhat, no matter how hard they try,” says Forger. “We can show you how to adapt.”\n\nHow well travellers can stick to this kind of schedule in real life depends on the person, says Elizabeth Klerman, a sleep researcher at Harvard Medical School who has designed similar models for adjusting to jet lag. But she says Forger does gorgeous work, and he has built this tool on one of the better, more physiologically accurate models available.\n\n“It becomes a choice: Do you do something inconvenient on the first day to adjust, or do you have jet lag for longer,” says Klerman. “At least now you will have the information to decide whether to follow the recommendations and then live with the consequences.”\n\nJournal reference: PLoS Computational Biology, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003523', 'A mathematical tool promises a full recovery in just a few days, even for extreme time zone shifts.\nYour daily activity is usually aligned with your circadian rhythm, a roughly 24-hour cycle controlled by exposure to light and darkness.\nBut a sudden change in schedule caused by travelling to a different time zone can throw off this internal clock.\nPrevious work on adjusting to jet lag showed that people who experience a 12-hour time shift but forgo light therapy will still be off-schedule after 12 days.\n“It becomes a choice: Do you do something inconvenient on the first day to adjust, or do you have jet lag for longer,” says Klerman.']"

The study of nearly 40,000 youth around the country also found that e-cigarette use among middle and high school students doubled between 2011 and 2012, from 3.1 percent to 6.5 percent.\n\n“Despite claims that e-cigarettes are helping people quit smoking, we found that e-cigarettes were associated with more, not less, cigarette smoking among adolescents,” said lead author Lauren Dutra, a postdoctoral fellow at the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.\n\n“E-cigarettes are likely to be gateway devices for nicotine addiction among youth, opening up a whole new market for tobacco,” she said. The study was published online on March 6 in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nA trade group took issue with the study, saying it ""is implying conclusions that simply aren\'t borne out by the data.""\n\nIn a prepared statement, Cynthia Cabrera, Executive Director, Smoke Free Alternatives Trade Association (SFATA), said: ""As the survey summary itself states, it wasn\'t designed to derive any insight about motivation or a possible causal relationship between use of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes. What the survey data does show is that cigarette smoking among teens has decreased.""\n\nFDA action expected\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been considering regulations that could restrict advertising and sales of the popular battery-powered devices, which look like cigarettes and deliver an aerosol of nicotine and other chemicals.\n\nSeveral states and cities, including New York and Los Angeles, have banned the use of e-cigs, generally treating them as though they were tobacco products.\n\nIn Congress, five U.S. Senators introduced the ""Protecting Children from Electronic Cigarette Advertising Act"" last month. It would prohibit the marketing of e-cigs to children and teens.\n\n“We cannot risk undoing decades of progress in reducing youth smoking by allowing e-cigarette makers to target our kids,” Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said. “This bill will help protect our children from an industry that profits from addiction.”\n\nManufacturers promote the devices as safer alternatives to cigarettes and as smoking cessation aids. They are sold in flavors such as chocolate and strawberry that are banned in conventional cigarettes because of their appeal to youth.\n\nCabrera denied that the e-cig industry is targeting children.\n\n""Our industry does not sell or market to minors, and it is our view that no one under 18 should use electronic cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes and vaping products are intended strictly for adults who smoke cigarettes. We fully support limitations on the sale of these products to youth at retail to further reduce access to anyone under 18,"" she said.\n\nStudents studied\n\nIn the new UCSF study, the researchers examined survey data from middle and high school students who completed the National Youth Tobacco Survey in 2011 and 2012.\n\nThe authors found that the devices were associated with higher odds of progression from experimenting with cigarettes to becoming established cigarette smokers. Additionally, adolescents who smoked both conventional cigarettes and e-cigarettes smoked more cigarettes per day than non-e-cigarette users.\n\n“It looks to me like the wild west marketing of e-cigarettes is not only encouraging youth to smoke them, but also it is promoting regular cigarette smoking among youth,” said senior author Stanton A. Glantz, PhD, UCSF professor of medicine and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.\n\nContrary to advertiser claims that e-cigarettes can help consumers stop smoking conventional cigarettes, teenagers who used e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes were much less likely to have abstained from cigarettes in the past 30 days, 6 months, or year. At the same time, they were more likely to be planning to quit smoking in the next year than smokers who did not use e-cigarettes.\n\nThe new results are consistent with a similar study of 75,000 Korean adolescents published last year by UCSF researchers, which also found that adolescents who used e-cigarettes were less likely to have stopped smoking conventional cigarettes.\n\nIn combination, the two studies suggest that “e-cigarettes may contribute to nicotine addiction and are unlikely to discourage conventional cigarette smoking among youths,” said the scientists.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that the majority of adolescents who have ever smoked e-cigarettes also have smoked regular cigarettes. An estimated 1.78 million U.S. students have used the devices as of 2012, the CDC reported.', 'In what is said to be the first analysis of the relationship between e-cigarette use and smoking among adolescents in the United States, UCSF researchers found that adolescents who used the devices were more likely to smoke cigarettes and less likely to quit smoking.\nThe study of nearly 40,000 youth around the country also found that e-cigarette use among middle and high school students doubled between 2011 and 2012, from 3.1 percent to 6.5 percent.\nWhat the survey data does show is that cigarette smoking among teens has decreased.""\n“We cannot risk undoing decades of progress in reducing youth smoking by allowing e-cigarette makers to target our kids,” Sen.

According to a study by national representative case control in 2010, over 1 million deaths happened due toin India.A country that has been proactive in implementing the ban on smoking in public, is now facing a new intruder. The dreaded e-cigarette, which is currently threatening to undo all the good work that a solid legislation against tobacco had achieved, has already entered the country and may soon have a solid footing here in India.But where are these e-cigarettes coming from? The neighbouring China, of course!These attractive-looking long sticks, resembling some kind of shamanistic tools, are probably the worst news India is facing now. Electrical cigarettes are increasingly used by youngsters as a ‘safer’ alternative to regular cigarettes. This product, which does not adhere to any safety standard set by theStandard Act of India (2006), has been banned in only two states. But other states are yet to wake up to its dangers as these are over-the-counter products and are freely available at all malls that sell imported stuff.What’s more, it is rumoured that even Bollywood starlet Sonam Kapoor did an ad for this product, which was scrapped later.This small gadget, which looks innocent and even fairly harmless with its shimmering red tip, contains liquid nicotine and may easily cause serious health hazards. The device mimics the real act of smoking by producing hot vapour with the flavour of smoke. A circuit to produce heat is embedded within an e-cigarette, which vaporises the glycerine-based liquid solution upon inhaling. This ‘alternative’ to cigarettes is primarily meant to deliver pure nicotine, which is present in tobacco-based cigarettes, too, but in camouflaged form.The west is already battling the e-cigarette mania and the number of people being poisoned by e-cigarettes has gone up considerably in the recent years. In fact, the number of calls to emergency services reporting e-cigarette poisoning in the US went up from 1 per month in September 2010 to 215 per month in February 2014.And it is just a matter of time before India catches up with the US in this respect. Currently, the market for e-cigarettes seems to be piping hot. As far as the numbers go, more people smoke in India today as against five years ago. Around 110 million Indians are confirmed smokers although the number of male smokers had gone down to 2.8% from 3.2% in the past. However, more women are smoking nowadays and the situation is becoming increasingly alarming. India had around 12.1 million smokers in 2012, compared to 5.3 million in 1980s.Indian women are only second to the US in reaching out to the cancer stick. Now, with e-cigarettes entering the Indian market, this convenience product not only eases the nicotine craving, it also does not leave a trace in the air and it isn’t difficult to dispose like the conventional cigarettes.Looking at the numbers, you will find that the IT superpower, which provides top-notch technical services to big corporate houses all over the globe, is also home to 12% of the world’s smokers. For a country that takes pride in its youth and the vibrancy they bring to its democracy and, it is, indeed, a disturbing phenomenon. Nearly 275 million of India’s 1.2 billion-strong population are at high risk due to the consumption of nicotine and tobacco-related products that often result into killer diseases like cancer. The country banned the use of tobacco products, with a strong legislation against smoking in public places in 2008.But the attempts to save the country’s youth from falling prey to this deadly habit, can be easily undone by a convenient gadget called e-cigarette. Incidentally, smokers have easy access to these gadgets and need not rush out to buy them every time the craving sets in.Efforts to curb smoking have just started to pay off with reduced tobacco consumption, fewer licences to tobacco growers and ban on smoking in public to restrain those who simply lit up in anyone’s face, unmindful of the discomfort and health hazards. But it may still take a long time to wean them off the nicotine sticks.While the government is yet to take effective steps, India's national carrier, Air India, had been selling e-cigarettes on-board and that too, at ‘reduced’ prices. It is bound to create an embarrassing situation and thehas already complained to the Civil Aviation Ministry.With no laws regulating sales of e-cigarettes, the central government now plans to come out with a legislation that will prohibit sales of these electronic inhalers, which are freely available online, apart from being sold at shops in big cities. Although e-cigarettes were originally developed as smoking-cessation devices, they turned into consumer commodities with no health regulations attached to them. Currently, India allows sale of 2 mg and 4 mg nicotine patches, which are sold legally to those who want to kick the butt.The government is well aware of the fact that these products are being pushed by tobacco companies that have suffered due to smoking and tobacco ban across the country. But suitable legislation could well complete the picture of saving the youth from the claws of death."", 'cancersmokingFood SafetyeconomyIndian Health MinistryHaving faced the threat of losing a lot of its population toand other related fatal health conditions, India had just begun to ‘breathe easy’ when the news struck.\nThe neighbouring China, of course!These attractive-looking long sticks, resembling some kind of shamanistic tools, are probably the worst news India is facing now.\nAround 110 million Indians are confirmed smokers although the number of male smokers had gone down to 2.8% from 3.2% in the past.\nIndia had around 12.1 million smokers in 2012, compared to 5.3 million in 1980s.Indian women are only second to the US in reaching out to the cancer stick.\nAlthough e-cigarettes were originally developed as smoking-cessation devices, they turned into consumer commodities with no health regulations attached to them.']"

First there was the revelation that the liquid nicotine in the device is poisonous and potentially deadly if consumed. Then there was the horrifying story of an e-cig exploding in a bar in the UK—not the first time this has happened.\n\nNow to cap it off, one of the first studies to look at the biological effects of the digital nicotine sticks found ""striking similarities"" between the effect of vaporized e-liquid and tobacco smoke on human cells. Further study is needed, but the similarity suggests vaping could increase the risk of cancer, despite being tobacco-free.\n\n""They may be safer [than tobacco], but our preliminary studies suggest that they may not be benign,” said study author Avrum Spira, a genomics and lung cancer researcher at Boston University. The study was published in Nature and presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting this week.\n\nResearchers studied bronchial cells in a culture medium. They found that when the cells were exposed to e-cig vapor containing nicotine they showed similar gene mutations as the cells exposed to tobacco smoke, and determined to be at risk of becoming cancerous.\n\nThe next step is to test the genes altered by e-cig vapor to see if they too show potential carcinogenicity.\n\nIt\'s just the latest study complicating the controversial question of over whether e-cigs should be embraced as a healthier alternative to traditional smokes or banned outright. The answer to that largely hangs on a more specific question: Is nicotine itself a carcinogen, or is it just the super-addictive delivery system for the more toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke?\n\nResearch on the health effects of vaping is still in early phases, so there’s no conclusive answer just yet. But previous studies have found that nicotine can, at least, promote or exacerbate certain types of cancer. At the moment, general perception in the medical community is that it\'s not the most dangerous toxin in tobacco, but it\'s not off the hook either.\n\nWhich doesn\'t help much for the moral quandary health experts find themselves in when it comes to e-cigs. Are they OK because they\'re less dangerous than traditional cigarettes, even if they\'re still a little dangerous?\n\nSpira said more research is needed.

107380,http://theconversation.com/autism-at-school-how-teachers-can-help-24528,health,"['High school can be difficult for youths with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders, who often have IQs superior to the general population, but can struggle with communication, social skills, and regulating their emotions. Compared to primary school where students only have one teacher, high school involves dealing with a number of different teachers and teaching styles every day, not to mention there are more students, more homework, and more rigorous grading policies. Considering the social challenges they face, problems associated with teen years such as puberty, friendships, and hormonal changes, are exacerbated. Because each youth on the autism spectrum has very different needs, there is no one-size-fits-all policy for assisting students with autism. However there are basic things teachers can do to make their time at school run smoothly.\n\nProvide a home base\n\nA home base is a place in the school where the student can go to plan or review the day’s events, escape the stress of the classroom, prevent a meltdown, or regain control if a meltdown has occurred. The location is not important, but it is essential that the home base is viewed as a positive environment. It is not a “naughty corner”. Nor is it an escape from classroom tasks; the students take their classwork with them to home base. Some students need home base to be scheduled as a regular part of their day. A home base at the beginning of the day can serve to preview the day’s schedule, introduce and get familiar with changes in the typical routine, ensure the student’s materials are organised, or prepare for specific subjects. In addition, home base can also be scheduled after particularly stressful activities or classes.\n\nMinimise handwriting requirements\n\nMany students with autism have difficulty with handwriting, and with listening and writing at the same time, due to motor problems. If writing is problematic for the student, don’t force them to do it. If handwriting itself is not being tested, another mode should be used.\n\nGet organised\n\nLack of organisation often prevents students with high-functioning autism from demonstrating their full competence. It is not uncommon to hear of students who have completed an assignment but weren’t able to find it to hand it in on time. Organisation entails knowing which papers to keep and which ones to throw away; being able to open a locker; organising backpacks and other school supplies; and remembering money for lunch.\n\nCreate a program that works for them\n\nThis requires creating a balance between what they have to achieve academically, and their levels of stress and anxiety. Programs have to have a predictable structure to avoid anxiety about something the student wasn’t prepared for, and so students know they can achieve what their teacher and parents are expecting them to do. While predictability is important for the student, they are not always predictable themselves, and changes in mood can happen in an instant. For this reason it’s also important for classroom teachers to be flexible. The student’s need to de-stress should come before completing an activity in the way that was planned. If the teacher has planned a specific lesson but notices the student is experiencing anxiety, they should be able to quickly change the planned routine. Some options include offering the student some time alone before class begins, letting them complete a task with just one other student rather than in a small group, or giving them the choice to observe rather than participate.\n\nGive them a reason to come to school\n\nTeachers need to put in greater effort to make school relevant for students with high-functioning autism, as they think differently to the majority of other kids. Incorporating special interests into the curriculum is often key to these students wanting to attend school, engage and participate. Students with high functioning autism often develop special interests that become much more than a hobby, but a way of life, so this is a great way to get them interested in school. Focusing on a student’s strengths and interests can increase confidence and engagement, especially when the student has other skill areas that need to be addressed. Testing content before it is taught allows the teacher to find out the student’s strengths and weaknesses. The student can then take part in activities that explore their strengths in greater depth.\n\nStudents should gradually be taught to assume responsibility for requesting and monitoring the things they need to prepare for adulthood. It’s here they will ultimately be responsible for structuring their own environment for success.', 'Compared to primary school where students only have one teacher, high school involves dealing with a number of different teachers and teaching styles every day, not to mention there are more students, more homework, and more rigorous grading policies.\nBecause each youth on the autism spectrum has very different needs, there is no one-size-fits-all policy for assisting students with autism.\nHowever there are basic things teachers can do to make their time at school run smoothly.\nSome students need home base to be scheduled as a regular part of their day.\nTesting content before it is taught allows the teacher to find out the student’s strengths and weaknesses.']"

107389,http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/04/how-much-does-your-doctor-really-make/360555/,health,"['Not really. Even if we ignore the $9 million in fraud that he is currently being investigated for (and will likely lose), and if we ignore the $700,000 in super PAC money he donated to support New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez (who is also now facing a federal probe for potentially interfering to protect Melgen), and if we ignore the likely fortune he must have paid to get the former head of the Justice Department\'s Medicare fraud task force, Kirk Ogrosky, to be his attorney—Melgen was never getting close to that $21 million.\n\nThis is not salary information. Medicare reimbursements do not simply go straight to doctors, but instead must also be used to pay the costs associated with the treatment. The $2,000 drug (Lucentis) that Melgen infamously exploited cost roughly $1800 to obtain from the pharmaceutical manufacturer, Genentech. Somehow the pharmaceutical and medical device companies have quietly escaped much of the blame as the public picks apart the physician\'s final bill. Talk about killing the messenger.\n\nOf course Melgen is being prosecuted for lying about dosages that he gave in order to quadruple charge Medicare for a single dose, which is clearly fraud. However, especially for most doctors who are not frauds, it is a mistake to look at the final Medicare payout and assume that these doctors are all running away with government money.\n\nYet somehow people seem fixated on figuring out which specialties get paid the most by Medicare, with ophthalmologists, radiation oncologists, and cardiologists getting the most hostile attention. The New York Times and Washington Post have provided online tools that allow people to track their physician\'s by name and location without much guidance on how to interpret the payment totals.\n\nThese approaches to looking at the new payment records suffer three major flaws.\n\nMedicare payments are not profit; the money often must be split amongst other physicians, nurses, and specialized support staff in addition to paying for actual drugs and medical devices. Think of it like paying for a meal at a restaurant--even though the waiter serves you the food, he\'s not taking home the whole bill for himself. An analysis by The Washington Post estimates that only 23 of the 4,000 ""Medicare millionaires"" are likely to actually keep at least $1 million in profit after all the other mouths are fed. Several outlets have posted that oncologists receive the highest average payments at nearly $365,000 per physician. This is misleading, given that over 80 percent of Medicare payments to radiation oncologists go to office overhead. Without knowing what procedures cost, seeing how much doctors are being reimbursed does not tell us enough about their incentives or whether they\'re delivering efficient care.\n\nIt\'s also critical to remember that, in addition to omitting ""costs,"" this data only includes Medicare patients (i.e. patients predominantly 65 and older). Income doctors receive from private insurance (or other forms of public insurance besides Medicare Part B) is completely absent. So if two doctors see the same number of patients, and one of them has a greater proportion of Medicare (older) patients, that doctor will appear to be paid much more in this dataset because only Medicare patients are included. Is it any wonder then that many of the high payment totals go to specialties which treat ""age-related"" afflictions, such as eyesight (ophthalmologists) and cancer (oncologists)? Pediatricians are near the bottom of the charts.\n\nMaybe most concerning, little of this information is useful without considering some measure of patient outcomes. When deciding how much is ""too much"" to pay my surgeon, I consider it relevant whether most of his patients leave the operating table alive and well, for example. If a doctor treats me well, I\'m happy for her to earn more, within reason. A lack of data on outcomes and patient satisfaction undermines declarations that this new data will allow patients to make better choices about which doctors are performing best.\n\nThere are still some genuinely good uses for the data. At seventh on the list of top reimbursed physicians is David Fata, who is currently under arrest for accusations that he intentionally misdiagnosed patients in order to deliver and charge them for unneeded chemotherapy. Corrupt physicians are more easily identified with this data. Payment records can also expose the kinds of behaviors that are simply unreasonable to explain away (for example, billing for more procedures in a day than is physically possible). In addition, seeing which doctors perform certain procedures more frequently could inform one\'s decision before a major surgical operation (research shows that doctors that perform certain surgeries with increasing frequency become less likely to make fatal mistakes). Unfortunately, performing a lot of the same procedures is also being used to demonize physicians for being greedy or duplicitous rather than efficient and experienced. Short of extreme cases, it\'s not always possible to know which scenario is correct.\n\nSuch is the curse of this data. We can\'t go back. This release is a good first step towards transparency in healthcare costs, but it\'s not enough on its own. These records\' strength will lie in their combination with other data sources (e.g. those with info on outcomes, costs, or private health records). It\'s like we\'ve discovered a valuable ancient text, but don\'t yet have the Rosetta Stone to translate it fully. While we wait for more information to trickle in, it\'s important not to misinterpret or dramatize the results.', 'These approaches to looking at the new payment records suffer three major flaws.\nWithout knowing what procedures cost, seeing how much doctors are being reimbursed does not tell us enough about their incentives or whether they\'re delivering efficient care.\nIt\'s also critical to remember that, in addition to omitting ""costs,"" this data only includes Medicare patients (i.e.\nSo if two doctors see the same number of patients, and one of them has a greater proportion of Medicare (older) patients, that doctor will appear to be paid much more in this dataset because only Medicare patients are included.\nIf a doctor treats me well, I\'m happy for her to earn more, within reason.']"

That is chipping away at the popularity of products like Diet Coke, Lean Cuisine and Special K, which became weight-watching staples primarily by stripping calories from people\x92s favorite foods.\n\nPart of the problem: \x93Low-calorie\x94 foods make people feel deprived. Now, people want to lose weight while still feeling satisfied. And they want to do it without foods they consider processed.\n\nKelly Pill has been dieting since her son was born in 1990. But the 54-year-old resident of Covina, Calif., made changes to her approach in recent years. She doesn\x92t eat Lean Cuisine microwavable meals as often because she doesn\x92t find them that filling. She also switched to Greek yogurt last year to get more protein.\n\n\x93Regular yogurt is really thin,\x94 Pill said. \x93It was low in calories, but it wasn\x92t filling.\x94\n\nIt\x92s not that people don\x92t care about calories anymore. Nutrition experts still say weight loss comes down to burning more calories than you eat.\n\nBut dieters are sick of foods that provide only fleeting satisfaction and seem to make them hungrier. The new thinking is that eating foods with more protein or fat keeps will make dieters less likely to binge later, even if they\x92re higher in calories.\n\n\x93People are recognizing that it\x92s not enough to just go on a diet and lose weight. Nutrition comes more into play,\x94 said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a health advocacy group.\n\nMany top brands are trying to keep up with the trend:\n\n\x97 Special K cereal\x92s sales are down 7 percent in the past two years, according to IRI, a market research firm based in Chicago. Kellogg last year rolled out \x93Special K Nourish\x94 hot cereals that tout a blend of grains such as quinoa and barley. A Kellogg executive noted at the time that people are looking for nutritional benefits rather than just reduced calories.\n\n\x97 Nestle\x92s Lean Cuisine saw a 27 percent drop in sales in the past four years, according to IRI. So the company introduced an \x93Honestly Good\x94 line that boasts of natural ingredients and offers more generous servings at about 390 calories per box, rather than the 300 calories for regular Lean Cuisine meals.\n\n\x97 Both Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi saw sales volume fall by nearly 7 percent last year, according to the industry tracker Beverage Digest. That was steeper than declines for their full-calorie counterparts.\n\nExecutives at Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. blame customers\x92 move away from artificial sweeteners and say they\x92re working on sodas using natural low-calorie sweeteners. The drinks are likely to have more calories than traditional diet sodas, but the thinking is that people will accept the tradeoff to avoid artificial ingredients.\n\n\x97 Weight Watchers updated its famous \x93Points\x94 system in 2010 to consider the protein content of food; the new system is called PointsPlus. It also introduced a \x93Simply Filling\x94 option that lets people eat from a list of \x93power foods\x94 without counting points.\n\n\x93We know that while calories are calories, how satisfied you are with eating those calories makes a difference,\x94 said Karen Miller-Kovach, chief scientific officer at Weight Watchers.\n\nPerhaps most emblematic of calorie counts as a marketing gimmick are the 100-calorie snacks that flooded the market a decade ago.

Dutch researchers at the Erasmus University Medical Center tested lab ferrets to see just how many changes were necessary to make the flu airborne and transmissible through coughing or sneezing rather than through birds. Study co-author Ron Fouchier emphasized that the findings do not mean a pandemic is more likely but do highlight the possibility that H5N1 could change itself over time to spread easily through humans. It remains unknown whether these mutations would happen beyond a laboratory setting.\n\nAbout 386 people worldwide have died and 650 have sickened from the H5N1 bird flu, a disease first discovered 17 years ago in Hong Kong. The bird flu was known to transfer only through contact with sick or dead poultry infected with the virus.\n\nThe new study, published Thursday in Cell could help health officials identify and track the gene mutations in birds and eventually prepare in advance for a possible outbreak. In the study, Fouchier and his team placed two ferrets — one with H5N1 virus and one without — in one cage. They designed the cage in such a way that the birds shared the same air but did not come in direct contact with each other — a simulation of airborne transmission. The researchers had sprayed a version of the H5N1 virus strain that they had altered through the nose of the infected ferret.\n\nThe healthy ferret began to show a loss of appetite, decreased energy, and ruffled fur — the tell-tale symptoms that the ferret had caught the H5N1 virus from its cage mate. The researchers were then able to identify five key gene mutations in the virus strain. According to Fouchier, two of the mutations helped the virus replicate more efficiently; one increased the stability of the virus, and the last two allowed the H5N1 virus to bind to cells in the upper respiratory tract of mammals.\n\nBut these gene alterations — which were produced deliberately by the researchers in the lab — may not necessarily occur naturally outside of the lab.\n\n""The biggest unknown is whether the viruses are likely to gain the critical mutations naturally,"" Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital in Memphis tells The Week. ""If they can appear readily, then it is very worrisome. If not, then there\'s still a major hurdle that these viruses have to get over to become human-transmissible.""\n\nThe publication of H5N1 research has previously been controversial. In 2011, Fouchier’s research on H5N1 shows how to increase the strength of the virus; these studies were blocked from publication for several months because U.S. officials thought it might be a biosecurity risk. Should the research fall into the wrong hands, it might be used for terrorism.\n\nCurrently there have been no reported instances of poultry, birds, or people with H5N1 viruses in the United States, though outbreaks have occurred in the Middle East and parts of Asia. Human infection is rare, the risk being highest for people who come into direct contact with sick or dead poultry. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and shortness of breath, with the most serious cases resulting in seizures, organ failure, decreased mental health, and death.\n\nSource: Linster M, van Boheemen S, de Graaf M, et al.

There are few cultures on the planet where alcohol isn’t a staple at most celebrations and gatherings. In 2012, a survey of U.S. adults aged 18 and older revealed that 87.6 percent of people had drank alcohol at some point in their lives, 71 percent had drank in the past year, and over half the people surveyed had drank in the past month. Binge drinking, on the other hand, is a dangerous habit that is defined as having five or more alcoholic drinks during one occasion. According to The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, nearly a quarter of the American population admitted to binge drinking in the last 30 days. For those who binge drink while injured, it’s a common observation that wounds take longer to heal. A recent study has found that this is because heavy alcohol use lowers levels of beneficial immune system cells, inhibiting your body’s ability to heal itself.\n\nThe study was carried out by researchers from Loyola University in Maywood, Ill., and published online in Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. In the study researchers exposed wound-healing mice to either alcohol or a saline solution. Based on the press release, researchers replicated a typical binge drinking pattern in the mice that were given alcohol for three days of heavy drinking, after which they drank no alcohol for four days, and then continued drinking heavily for another three days. The scientists mirrored the mice’s blood alcohol level to be about twice the legal limit for driving.\n\nResults from the study showed that binge drinking caused significant reductions in levels of immune system cells that play an important role in healing wounds. These cells, called macrophages, clear away bacteria and debris, and in turn protect us from infections. According to The Huffington Post, the study also found that binge drinking also lowers the production of a protein which recruits macrophages to the wound site. On top of this, alcohol was also found to reduce levels of cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide, a protein on the skin’s outermost layer that kills bacteria. “Together these effects likely contribute to delayed wound closure and enhanced infection severity observed in intoxicated patients,” explained authors of the study, in a press release.\n\nThis study will help scientist better understand alcohol’s effect on the human body, especially in regards to wound healing. In the United States, 20 to 40 percent of all hospitalized patients have drinking problems. Alcohol increases the risk of infections in hospitals, including surgical site infections.

Oneida County has the third lowest enrollment rate upstate, seventh lowest in the state.\n\nAs authorized by the state budget, the New York State Department of Health is working on a request for proposal to find a nonprofit to organize, maintain and promote the registry through which state residents consent to donate organs and tissues after they die.\n\nAdvocates have pushed for the change for years.

At 41.4 percent, the county with the highest enrollment – Tomkins – still falls below the national average.\n\n“We have the third highest need for transplant and we just can’t get the organs available for transplant to the people who are waiting,” Tator said.\n\nIn Oneida County, 18.1 percent of adult residents have signed up as donors.\n\nNo one knows for sure why enrollment rates are so low in the county. But one thing is clear; Utica’s hospitals are working to raise donor rates with awareness events, including registry drives, educational booths and a Memorial Donor Garden at Faxton St. Luke’s Healthcare.\n\nAnd Faxton and St. Elizabeth Medical Center will conduct a Donate Life flag raising April 23 on the St. Luke’s Campus to honor Kathleen Warzala, the city’s most recent organ, tissue and eye donor.\n\nLike the flag, officials are hoping donor registration rates in the county will go up.\n\nFollow @OD_Roth on Twitter or call her at 792-5166.', 'The state is hoping to get more residents to sign up as organ donors by having a nonprofit run its donor registry.\nThe state is hoping to get more residents to sign up as organ donors by having a nonprofit run its donor registry.\nNonprofits run eight of the top 10 state registries, said Aisha Tator, executive director of the New York Alliance for Donation.\n“I think that’s one of the things that’s hindered New York state a little bit,” she said.\nLike the flag, officials are hoping donor registration rates in the county will go up.']"

Siegel, Ph.D., of Claremont Graduate University.\n\n“We wanted to figure out why there is such inconsistency between peoples’ attitudes toward organ donation and donor registration.”\n\nFor the study, researchers conducted two experiments involving 516 people. None of them were registered organ donors.\n\nIn the first experiment, 358 people completed an online survey. For the other, 158 college students answered a paper survey in class.\n\nThe researchers found that among the online group, specific attitudes as opposed to general attitudes were 75 percent more predictive of organ donor registration (10 percent vs. 17 percent).\n\nFor the students in the classroom, specific attitudes were 150 percent more predictive of registration behavior than general attitudes (18.5 percent vs. 42.6 percent), according to the study.\n\nResearchers measured participants’ attitudes based on their responses to questions on the surveys.\n\nThe students were asked two questions: “In general, how do you feel about organ donation?” and “How do you feel about registering yourself as an organ donor?” Their responses were rated on a continuum from negative to positive.\n\nThe online participants were asked to respond to a series of comments, such as “I support the idea of organ donation for transplantation purposes.” They also were asked to complete the sentence “Would registering yourself to be an organ donor …” with various phrases, such as “be a rewarding act?” or “be a source of anxiety?”\n\nAll participants then had an opportunity to register as an organ donor when they completed the survey. Of the online participants, 10 percent clicked on the link to a donor registration form, while 13 percent of the students completed registration forms.\n\nIf participants said they felt positive specifically about signing up as an organ donor they were much more likely to register than if they simply said they strongly support the general idea of organ donation, according to the study’s findings.\n\nThis illustrates a psychological principle that specific attitudes are more likely to predict behavior than general attitudes, the researchers noted.\n\n“It’s a concept researchers need to keep in mind to gather more helpful data to support actions to change behaviors. Research on health issues has had a tendency to rely on global measures of attitude to predict behaviors such as smoking, drinking, taking medication, or keeping doctor’s appointments,” Siegel said.\n\n“We should instead measure specific attitudes, whether they’re about organ donations or any health-related behavior, from brushing teeth to binge drinking.”\n\nBut of course there’s more to it than that, he said.\n\n“Positive attitudes are often not enough on their own to increase donor registration rates,” Siegel said. “Often what people need is ready access to a registration form.”\n\nThe study was funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Division of Transplantation.\n\nSource: The American Psychological Association\n\n\n\nOrgan donation photo by shutterstock.\n\nWhy Don’t More People Register As Organ Donors?', 'In a 2005 Gallup poll, 95 percent of Americans said they “support or strongly support” organ donation, yet only 40 percent of eligible donors have registered, according to a study published in the American Psychological Association journal Health Psychology.\n“We wanted to figure out why there is such inconsistency between peoples’ attitudes toward organ donation and donor registration.”For the study, researchers conducted two experiments involving 516 people.\nThe researchers found that among the online group, specific attitudes as opposed to general attitudes were 75 percent more predictive of organ donor registration (10 percent vs. 17 percent).\nThis illustrates a psychological principle that specific attitudes are more likely to predict behavior than general attitudes, the researchers noted.\nWhy Don’t More People Register As Organ Donors?']"

Two multi-center clinical trials led by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center show promise for a new option that could help lead to both an increase in patients cured with a much more simple and tolerable all oral therapy.\n\nA new 12-week single tablet regimen of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir have proven to be highly effective in treating a broad range of patients with HCV genotype 1, a form of the virus found in up to 75 percent of infections, according to results unveiled today at the European Association for the Study of the Liver and published simultaneously online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nBetween 94 percent and 99 percent of patients were cured of hepatitis C and results were similar in patients who have never been treated and for those who had previously been treated with a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin, the current course that carries sometimes significant side effects.\n\n""Eliminating interferon and ribavirin from treatment regimens is expected to reduce the incidence and severity of adverse events, to simplify the treatment of patients with HCV infection and to provide an option for patients who are ineligible for the current interferon-based treatments,"" said Nezam Afdhal, MD, the senior author of the studies, Director of the Liver Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\nHepatitis C is an infectious disease primarily affecting the liver and which can lead to scarring and cirrhosis and is transmitted primarily through blood transfusions (prior to 1991), intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment and sexual transmission. After exposure 80 percent of patients develop a chronic hepatitis which can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer and hepatitis C is the most common cause for liver transplantation in the US.\n\nPrior treatments have been with interferon which is an injectable cytokine released in response to viral infections. Interferon is combined with other antiviral agents and needs to be used for up to 48 weeks to cure hepatitis C. but is associated with number of side effects, including influenza-like symptoms depression and anemia. Many patients are ineligible for these interferon-based therapies.\n\n""The real advances seen in the ION trials is that the sofosbuvir-ledipasvir combination tablet enables us to treat almost all genotype 1 patients with a short duration of 8-12 weeks of treatment expanding the treatment pool and increasing the overall cure rate,"" said Afdhal.\n\nRecent recommendations by the CDC and endorsed by the USPHS Task force have recommended screening of baby boomers (persons born between 1945 and 1965) for hepatitis C since up to3 percent may have silent infection without symptoms.\n\n""Screening for HCV needs to be associated with a safe and effective treatment for these ""baby boomers"" with newly identified HCV and the ION trials clearly give an exciting new option for these patients"" stated Afdhal.\n\nION-1 (865 patients) and ION-2 (440 patients) evaluated 12 and 24 weeks of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir single dose treatment for 12 versus 24 weeks either with or without ribavirin in patients who had never been treated (ion 1) and in prior treatment failures (Ion 2).

Kowdley said a 4-week regimen would be the ""holy grail"" for clinicians -- because it would mean a single prescription -- but that so far has eluded researchers.\n\nDi Bisceglie said most people getting the combination were negative for the virus by 4 weeks: ""How much consolidation beyond that does one need?""\n\nBut even 8 weeks, he said ""makes this very manageable for patients.""\n\nSofosbuvir, approved last year, is one of the so-called direct-acting agents against HCV; it\'s a nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor that targets part of viral replication process. Ledipasvir, which blocks the action of the viral nonstructural protein 5A, remains under investigation, but the drugs have been put together as a single pill.\n\nThe so-called ION-3 trial is one of several phase III studies here reporting how the fixed-dose combination of the two drugs worked in different patient populations.\n\nION-3, Kowdley said, enrolled 647 previously untreated patients and randomly assigned them to get ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 8 weeks, the combination plus ribavirin also for 8 weeks, or the two drugs alone for 12 weeks.\n\nThe primary endpoint was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of therapy, or SVR 12 , defined as a lack of detectable HCV RNA at that point. The SVR 12 is regarded as tantamount to a cure because few patients relapse after they have achieved that milestone.\n\nKowdley and colleagues found that the SVR 12 rate was:\n\n94% with 8 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir alone\n\n93% if ribavirin was added for 8 weeks\n\n95% with 12 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir alone\n\nThe minimal differences suggested that the 8-week ledipasvir-sofosbuvir regimen had efficacy that was noninferior to either of the other two, Kowdley said.\n\nIn each of the three arms, he said, response rates were high and similar based on subgroups defined by such things as sex, race, HCV sub-genotype, and baseline HCV viral load.\n\nThe proportion of patients reporting adverse events was numerically higher in the ribavirin-containing arm, he reported, as were grade 3 and 4 lab abnormalities.

In some cases, taking once-a-day pills for as little as eight weeks will be enough to cure patients with the virus, with minimal side effects.\n\n“The amount of progress in a single generation is absolutely phenomenal,” says William Carey, MD, Director of the Hepatology (Liver) Center in the Department of Gastroenterology at Cleveland Clinic.\n\nHe says the development of oral medications is a big leap forward from current interferon injection treatments, which cause severe side effects, including depression, nausea, and lethargy.\n\nInfection trends show progress\n\nHepatitis C is transmitted through infected blood from sharing needles to inject drugs or accidental needle sticks. Before 1992, people also could become infected from blood transfusions and organ transplants. Then widespread screening of the blood supply began in the United States.\n\nOf all the people currently infected with hepatitis C in the U.S., about two-thirds are baby boomers.\n\n“Most people infected with hepatitis C have no symptoms, or very mild ones,” Dr. Carey says.\n\nThis is why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that baby boomers born between 1945 and 1966 get screened.\n\nDr. Carey says patients who learn they have the infection are often very anxious, but he stresses that great strides have been made in treatment.\n\n“Patients ask, ‘Am I going to give it to somebody else? What about my partner? What about my kids?’ These are common concerns,” he says.\n\n“I spend the first 30 minutes with patients trying to bring them down from the notion that hep C is a death sentence. Making sure the rhetoric doesn’t get spun up too high is a very important step. Treatment has become so much better.”\n\nThe cure rate has spiked to more than 90 percent, and the overall rate of infections has fallen dramatically since the 1980s — from about 200,000 per year to only 25,000 today.\n\nWhile all this is good news, Dr. Carey says, “We also need to keep in mind that 25,000 new cases is not a small number, and the effects of this infection can show up years later.”\n\nSerious liver problems\n\nA risk associated with hepatitis C is that people may develop cirrhosis of the liver, or a scarred liver. This happens to one out of every five people infected with hepatitis C and is the most common reason they come forward needing a liver transplant.\n\nIt’s also one of the most common reasons people get primary liver cancer.\n\n“The rate of liver cancer in the United States is going up fairly dramatically, related to all those hep C infections people acquired in the ‘70s and ‘80s,” Dr. Carey says.\n\nTreatment progress ‘phenomenal’\n\nDr. Carey was one of the authors of a New England Journal of Medicine study in the 1980s that led to the use of interferon injections in the first place.\n\n“The amount of progress in a single generation is absolutely phenomenal,” he says. “The basis for most therapy involves the use of injections of interferon that have all kinds of side effects.”\n\nThat’s where the oral therapy comes in: In November and December 2013, the FDA approved two drugs that can be used with oral therapy for certain types of Hep C — including Genotype 1, the most common type in the U.S.\n\nStudies published in January in the New England Journal of Medicine showed promise for yet another pill combination that had a 90 percent plus cure rate for Genotype 1. And those pills could, in addition, be combined into a single pill.\n\n“We expect all oral therapy will become the norm over the next 12 or 24 months,” Dr. Carey says.\n\nEffective, but expensive\n\nThe drug combination is not inexpensive, he says. “They’re highly effective, and they’re relatively free of side effects,” he says.\n\n“But few people can afford them unless they have insurance that covers medications. As more of these highly effective oral drugs come to market, the large cost hurdle that currently exists may become less of a barrier.”', 'Impressive new oral therapies are now available to combat hepatitis C infections, a growing problem for the baby boomer generation.\nOf all the people currently infected with hepatitis C in the U.S., about two-thirds are baby boomers.\n“Most people infected with hepatitis C have no symptoms, or very mild ones,” Dr. Carey says.\nDr. Carey says patients who learn they have the infection are often very anxious, but he stresses that great strides have been made in treatment.\n“We expect all oral therapy will become the norm over the next 12 or 24 months,” Dr. Carey says.']"

According to the medical journal, “The Lancet,” that day may have finally arisen. They reported a new new study that has shown that vaginas and noses can be regrown using cells taken directly from the patient.\n\nThis technique could help treat disorders that disfigure the body, such as cancer, injury, and serious burns. This technique could potentially replace reconstructive surgery.\n\nHowever, this technique is not quick. According to “The Lancet,” the study followed four Mexican teenagers for three years, taking tissue the size of a postage stamp from each. Each teen was born without a functioning vagina and this tissue was used to craft a new one.\n\nThe article stated that the new vagina showed …”variables in the normal range in all areas tested, such as desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and painless intercourse.”\n\nThis breakthrough technique took three years of work to craft each vagina. It required culturing the cells, expanding them, and creating what the study called “biodegradable scaffolds” on which to build the vagina. The vaginas were then allowed to mature in an incubator before being surgically grafted to the body of the teens.\n\nEach patient was followed up for a period of eight years. The vagina appeared to function properly at each follow up examination.\n\nIn addition, the patients’ responses to a Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire showed they had normal sexual function after the treatment, including desire and pain-free intercourse.\n\n“Tissue biopsies, MRI scans and internal exams using magnification all showed that the engineered vaginas were similar in makeup and function to native tissue, said Atlantida-Raya Rivera, lead author and director of the HIMFG Tissue Engineering Laboratory in Mexico City, where the surgeries were performed.\n\nNo long-term postoperative somplications were noted. A different study noted in the same issue of “The Lancet” discusssed new noses built in Switzerland for two men and three women.\n\n“Although this is a small pilot study, the results show that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully in people,” said study author Anthony Atala, director of the institute for regenerative medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Centre in the US.\n\nThe potential of this technique is already being throughly explored by doctors around the world. Various doctors around the world have crafted windpipes, bladders, and even blood cells and implanted them in patients. This process could be expanded to more complex organs, such as the lungs.\n\nSource\n\nhttp://www.thestar.com/life/2014/04/11/vaginas_and_noses_can_be_grown_from_cells_studies_find.html\n\nDoctors implant lab-grown vaginas in four teenage girls with rare disorder\n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/doctors-implant-lab-grown-vaginas-teen-girls-article-1.1753415#ixzz2ybPJbKcH\n\nLab-Grown Vaginas, Noses Herald New Options for Patients\n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/women/news/20140410/lab-grown-vaginas-noses-herald-new-options-for-patients?page=2&rdspk=active', 'A New Study Shows that Vaginas and Noses Can be Successfully GrownThe possibility of growing new limbs and body parts has fascinated scientists and doctors for centuries.\nThey reported a new new study that has shown that vaginas and noses can be regrown using cells taken directly from the patient.\nIt required culturing the cells, expanding them, and creating what the study called “biodegradable scaffolds” on which to build the vagina.\nVarious doctors around the world have crafted windpipes, bladders, and even blood cells and implanted them in patients.\nSourcehttp://www.thestar.com/life/2014/04/11/vaginas_and_noses_can_be_grown_from_cells_studies_find.htmlDoctors implant lab-grown vaginas in four teenage girls with rare disorderhttp://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/doctors-implant-lab-grown-vaginas-teen-girls-article-1.1753415#ixzz2ybPJbKcHLab-Grown Vaginas, Noses Herald New Options for Patientshttp://www.webmd.com/women/news/20140410/lab-grown-vaginas-noses-herald-new-options-for-patients?page=2&rdspk=active']"

Vaginal reconstruction can be very challenging and the complications associated with the use of non-vaginal tissue raises concerns. The use of tissue-engineered autologous vaginal organs in patients is therefore a major breakthrough.\n\nThere is no doubt that reconstructive techniques for which non-vaginal tissue is used may be associated with complications, reports The Lancet. Researchers assessed the use of engineered vaginal organs in four patients who had vaginal aplasia which was caused by a disorder known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS).\n\nThe patients in this study were aged 13—18 years. The researchers obtained a vulvar biopsy of autologous tissue from each of the patients. They than cultured, expanded, and seeded epithelial and muscle cells onto biodegradable scaffolds.These organs were than constructed and allowed to mature in an incubator which was located in a facility which has been approved for human-tissue manufacturing. A perineal approach was used to surgically implant these organs. MRIs demonstrated the extent of the vaginal aplasia prior to surgery and the absence of abnormalities after surgery, as confirmed with yearly vaginoscopy. The patients conveyed variables in the normal range dealing with:\n\n1: Sexual desire\n\n2: Arousal\n\n3: Lubrication\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow eMaxHealth on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Please, click to subscribe to our Youtube Channel to be notified about upcoming health and food tips.\n\n4: Orgasm\n\n5: Satisfaction\n\n6: Painless intercourse\n\nIt was concluded that vaginal organs which were engineered from the patient's own cells and implanted demonstrated normal structural and functional variables with a follow-up of up to 8 years.\n\nClearly, these technologies could be useful for patients who require vaginal reconstruction.\n\nScientists have reported on the first human recipients of lab grown vaginal organs, reports Wake Forest School of Medicine. Anthony Atala, M.D., director of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center’s Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and his research team have described the long-term success in four teenage girls who received vaginal organs which were engineered from their own cells.\n\nAtala said, “This pilot study is the first to demonstrate that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully in humans.” Patients who need vaginal reconstructive surgeries now may have this new option. As noted, the girls in the study were born with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This is a rare genetic condition in which the vagina and uterus are not developed well or are absent.\n\nThe treatment demonstrated in this study may also potentially be applied to patients suffering from vaginal cancer or injuries. The engineered vaginas were observed to be similar in makeup and function to native tissue. Furthermore, the patients’ responses to a Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire demonstrated that they all had normal sexual function after the treatment, which included desire and pain-free intercourse. The researchers said that with conventional treatments, the overall complication rate has been seen to be as high as 75 percent in pediatric patients. The\n\nsuccessful use of lab grown vaginas is therefore a significant breakthrough.\n\nClearly, the need for vaginal reconstructive surgery in a young girl can be very tension producing. This coupled with high complication rates with orthodox therapy is troubling. This new finding of the success of lab grown vaginas for such procedures should add new dimensions to not just medical but also psychological success with this intervention."", 'Women who are in need of vaginal reconstruction due to such problems as congenital abnormalities, injury, or cancer, should be pleased to learn of the success of implanting lab grown vaginas in patients.\nResearchers assessed the use of engineered vaginal organs in four patients who had vaginal aplasia which was caused by a disorder known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS).\nScientists have reported on the first human recipients of lab grown vaginal organs, reports Wake Forest School of Medicine.\nThesuccessful use of lab grown vaginas is therefore a significant breakthrough.\nThis new finding of the success of lab grown vaginas for such procedures should add new dimensions to not just medical but also psychological success with this intervention.']"

Both cases used the patients’ own tissue.\n\nWriting in The Lancet*, Professor Ivan Martin from the University of Basel in Switzerland, says scientists report having engineered a human cartilage graft from patients’ own nasal septum cartilage cells to successfully rebuild the nostrils (alar lobule) of five individuals whose noses were damaged by skin cancer. One year after reconstruction, the report says that all five recipients were satisfied with their ability to breathe, as well as the cosmetic appearance of their nose, and did not report any local or systemic adverse events.\n\nThe nose is the most common site of non-melanoma skin cancer, because of its cumulative exposure to sunlight, with the highest frequency of cancer occurring on the alar lobule. Currently, when removing skin cancers, surgeons often have to cut away parts of cartilage, (for instance from the nasal septum, ear, or rib) as grafts to functionally reconstruct the tumour excision site. However, this painful and invasive procedure involves major additional surgery, and has been associated with complications at the site from which cartilage has been removed.\n\nThe researchers investigated an alternative approach using engineered cartilage tissue grown from patients’ own cells. They extracted chondrocytes from the nasal septum of each patient, and multiplied the cells by exposing them to growth factors for two weeks. The expanded cells were seeded onto collagen membranes and cultured for two additional weeks, generating cartilage 40 times larger than the original biopsy. When the engineered grafts were ready they were shaped according to the defect and implanted.\n\nIn another article** scientists in the US and Mexico, led by Professor Anthony Atala from Wake Forest School of Medicine, USA, report on the long-term success of tissue-engineered vaginal organs implanted in four women, aged 13–18 years, with a condition known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome that causes the vagina to be underdeveloped or absent. Eight years after transplantation, the organs continue to function as if they were native tissue and all recipients are sexually active, report no pain, and are satisfied with their desire/arousal, lubrication, and orgasm.\n\nThe team obtained a vulvar tissue biopsy from each patient from which they grew smooth muscle cells and vaginal epithelial cells in the lab. The cells were then placed onto specially designed vagina-shaped biodegradable scaffolds and left to grow for 7 days. The researchers then surgically implanted the engineered vaginas, which remain structurally and functionally normal 8 years on.\n\n* Martin et al.

Women with MHRK are born without a vagina, cervix, or womb. It affects one in every 5,000 women.\n\nExisting treatments for women living with MHRK include stretching the small amount of vaginal tissue present, and women are usually able to have comfortable sex but are unable to become pregnant.\n\nThe new technique, which has been trialled by a team of scientists in the USA and Mexico, led by Professor Anthony Atala of the Wake School of Medicine, saw the four patients undergo a biopsy to remove tissue from the vulva, which was used to cells in the lab. The cells were then placed on a biodegradable, vagina-shaped “scaffold”, hand-sewn and tailor made for the patient, and left to grow.\n\nResearchers then surgically implanted the scaffolds, which once implanted, lead to expansions of nerves and blood vessels, which form tissue. As the biodegradable material is absorbed into the body the cells form into a permanent organ.\n\nAs many as eight years later, patients reported normal sexual function, and no pain. Because women with MHRK do not have a developed womb, the patients were unable to become pregnant. However, women with the condition can produce eggs, which can be used for IVF treatment.\n\n“This technique is a viable option for vaginal reconstruction and has several advantages over current reconstructive methods because only a small biopsy of tissue is required and using vaginal cells may reduce complications that arise from using non-vaginal tissue, such as infection,” said Professor Atala.\n\nEngineering organs for transplant from patients own tissue is a growing field of science which some experts believe could one day replace the need for organ donors. However, the procedures carried out by Professor Atala and his team represent only the first successful attempts and widespread clinical use is a long way off.\n\nIn another first, scientists in Switzerland have used similar techniques to reconstruct the nostrils of five patients, using cells from their nasal septum. The technique could be used to treat people who have had parts of their nose removed to prevent non-melanoma skin cancer, which commonly occurs on the skin of the nose, the researchers said.\n\nA year after the procedure, all five patients said they were happy with both their ability to breathe with the engineered nostrils, and with their appearance.\n\nBoth studies are published in The Lancet medical journal today.\n\nMartin Birchall, professor of laryngology at University College London and one of the UK’s leading ear, nose and throat surgeons, said that the findings “start to edge tissue engineering towards the mainstream of organ and tissue replacement needs”.\n\n“These authors have not only successfully treated several patients with a difficult clinical problem, but addressed some of the most important questions facing translation of tissue engineering technologies,” he said, adding it was time for the healthcare industry to take the new tissue engineering techniques seriously and speed their development.', 'Scientists in the USA have completed the first successful implants of “lab-grown” vaginal organs, in four women with a rare condition who were born without a vagina.\nWomen with MHRK are born without a vagina, cervix, or womb.\nExisting treatments for women living with MHRK include stretching the small amount of vaginal tissue present, and women are usually able to have comfortable sex but are unable to become pregnant.\nBecause women with MHRK do not have a developed womb, the patients were unable to become pregnant.\nIn another first, scientists in Switzerland have used similar techniques to reconstruct the nostrils of five patients, using cells from their nasal septum.']"

A research team led by Anthony Atala, M.D., director of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center\'s Institute for Regenerative Medicine, describes in the Lancet long-term success in four teenage girls who received vaginal organs that were engineered with their own cells.\n\n""This pilot study is the first to demonstrate that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully in humans,"" said Atala. ""This may represent a new option for patients who require vaginal reconstructive surgeries. In addition, this study is one more example of how regenerative medicine strategies can be applied to a variety of tissues and organs.""\n\nThe girls in the study were born with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare genetic condition in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent. The treatment could also potentially be applied to patients with vaginal cancer or injuries, according to the researchers.\n\nThe girls were between 13 and 18 years old at the time of the surgeries, which were performed between June 2005 and October 2008. Data from annual follow-up visits show that even up to eight years after the surgeries, the organs had normal function.\n\n""Tissue biopsies, MRI scans and internal exams using magnification all showed that the engineered vaginas were similar in makeup and function to native tissue, said Atlantida-Raya Rivera, lead author and director of the HIMFG Tissue Engineering Laboratory at the MRKH in Mexico City, where the surgeries were performed.\n\nIn addition, the patients\' responses to a Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire showed they had normal sexual function after the treatment, including desire and pain-free intercourse.\n\nThe organ structures were engineered using muscle and epithelial cells (the cells that line the body\'s cavities) from a small biopsy of each patient\'s external genitals. In a Good Manufacturing Practices facility, the cells were extracted from the tissues, expanded and then placed on a biodegradable material that was hand-sewn into a vagina-like shape. These scaffolds were tailor-made to fit each patient.\n\nAbout five to six weeks after the biopsy, surgeons created a canal in the patient\'s pelvis and sutured the scaffold to reproductive structures. Previous laboratory and clinical research in Atala\'s lab has shown that once cell-seeded scaffolds are implanted in the body, nerves and blood vessels form and the cells expand and form tissue. At the same time the scaffolding material is being absorbed by the body, the cells lay down materials to form a permanent support structure – gradually replacing the engineered scaffold with a new organ.\n\nFollowup testing on the lab-engineered vaginas showed the margin between native tissue and the engineered segments was indistinguishable and that the scaffold had developed into tri-layer vaginal tissue.\n\nCurrent treatments for MRHK syndrome include dilation of existing tissue or reconstructive surgery to create new vaginal tissue. A variety of materials can be used to surgically construct a new vagina – from skin grafts to tissue that lines the abdominal cavity. However, these substitutes often lack a normal muscle layer and some patients can develop a narrowing or contracting of the vagina.\n\nThe researchers say that with conventional treatments, the overall complication rate is as high as 75 percent in pediatric patients, with the need for vaginal dilation due to narrowing being the most common complication.\n\nBefore beginning the pilot clinical study, Atala\'s team evaluated lab-built vaginas in mice and rabbits beginning in the early 1990s. In these studies, scientists discovered the importance of using cells on the scaffolds. Atala\'s team used a similar approach to engineer replacement bladders that were implanted in nine children beginning in 1998, becoming the first in the world to implant laboratory-grown organs in humans. The team has also successfully implanted lab-engineered urine tubes (urethras) into young boys.\n\nThe team said the current study is limited because of its size, and that it will be important to gain further clinical experience with the technique and to compare it with established surgical procedures.', 'Scientists reported today the first human recipients of laboratory-grown vaginal organs.\n""This pilot study is the first to demonstrate that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully in humans,"" said Atala.\nThe treatment could also potentially be applied to patients with vaginal cancer or injuries, according to the researchers.\nCurrent treatments for MRHK syndrome include dilation of existing tissue or reconstructive surgery to create new vaginal tissue.\nBefore beginning the pilot clinical study, Atala\'s team evaluated lab-built vaginas in mice and rabbits beginning in the early 1990s.']"

There are often no early signs of detection which makes it even more difficult to be diagnosed.

Their cancer was not restricted to prostate gland but had spread to other parts of the body as well. This raises doubt on the active surveillance strategy. Prostate cancers are graded by their biopsy samples, and such mistakes are can cost life of the patient. The researchers from the Cancer Research Department, in Cambridge had confirmed their findings with 800 patients whose tumors were staged and graded before they underwent surgery to remove prostate. A total of 415 patients were previously classified under slow growing cancers. However after surgery, it was confirmed that 209 of them had aggressive cancer even before surgery and unfortunately for 131 of them the cancer had spread throughout their body and beyond prostate gland.\n\nThere is an urgent need to develop new diagnostic and biopsy techniques. Counseling will be proper if the techniques involve MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) techniques, where men can understand the severity. More than one third of men would undertake radiotherapy and undergo surgery within five years of detection, without any further delay. It is also a relief to know that older men when diagnosed with slow growing cancers may not even develop full blown tumors in their lifetime.

Humans rarely contract the disease and those who did were known to have been in close contact with dead and infected birds.\n\nStill, it has been feared that H5N1 will evolve and become highly infectious to humans. In 2005, David Nabarro, then newly appointed senior UN system coordinator for avian and human influenza, said that health officials generally think that the risk of the bird flu virus jumping to humans is high. Now, a team of Dutch researchers has an overview on how this could be possible.\n\nIn a study ""Identification, Characterization, and Natural Selection of Mutations Driving Airborne Transmission of A/H5N1 Virus"" published in the journal Cell on Thursday, researchers from the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands studied the ability of the H5N1 to attain airborne transmissibility between mammals.\n\nThey found that the virus is a mere five mutations away from being airborne-transmissible between ferrets. The ferrets were chosen for the study because the anatomy of their airway is similar to that of humans. Their bodies also respond similarly when infected with flu, making them good human proxies for lab studies.\n\n""We found that as few as five [mutations] were sufficient to make the virus airborne,"" the researchers said. ""For each of these five mutations, we have investigated exactly what the biological traits were that were associated with those mutations."" The researchers, however, noted that it isn\'t clear whether the mutations would happen outside of the laboratory.\n\nStudy researcher Ron Fouchier, from the viroscience department of the Erasmus Medical Center, said that while the H5N1 may not cause a pandemic, the possibility of this happening should not be ignored.\n\nTo prevent H5N1 infection, health experts recommend avoiding contact with sick and dead poultry, as most of the humans who have contracted the virus had contact with H5N1-infected poultry. Travelers who visit affected countries are particularly advised to avoid live poultry markets as well as sick individuals who may have been infected with the H5N1. Handling and cooking poultry and eggs properly is also advised to avoid H5N1 virus infection.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

109290,http://blog.seattlepi.com/timigustafsonrd/2014/04/12/food-poisoning-most-often-from-restaurant-visits-study-finds/,health,"['Americans love to eat out, preferably several times a week, according to the Nation’s Restaurant News, a publication for the restaurant industry. At the same time, there is growing concern that restaurant food may not be as healthy as it should be. On top of worries over portion sizes and excessive fat, salt and sugar content – all believed to contribute to weight problems – a new study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) warns consumers about the heightened risk of food poisoning from restaurant fare.\n\nEach year, nearly 50 million Americans fall ill from contaminated food, according to the National Institute of Health (NIH). Harmful bacteria are the most common cause of foodborne illness. Symptoms can range from mild irritation to severe reactions, including stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and dehydration.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2011, more than 1600 outbreaks of food poisoning, affecting over 28,000 people, were connected to restaurant visits, based on the CSPI study. By contrast, only about 13,000 people became victims of such ills originating in their homes.\n\nUnfortunately, the numbers are vague because not all outbreaks are reported, nor are their causes always clearly identified. Reporting has decreased by 42 percent, the researchers say, not necessarily because there are fewer cases but rather because of budget cuts for public health investigations.\n\nBesides restaurants and private homes, food poisoning can take place just about anywhere, including in the workplace, at catered events, in schools, and at picnics. Most vulnerable among the afflicted are children and the elderly.\n\nTo prevent foodborne illness, experts recommend a number of precautions. Especially animal food products are susceptible to spoilage if not stored properly. You want to make sure items like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy foods are fully cooked or pasteurized before they are eaten. Raw meat or fish (e.g. steak tartar, sushi) may be fashionable, but the potential health threats are significant. If you love uncooked animal foods, be sure to patronize only reputable establishments.\n\nRaw vegetables can also spoil and wreak havoc on your digestive system. Uncooked plant foods should always be thoroughly washed and stored in the refrigerator until consumption.\n\nDairy products like cheese and yogurt should always be kept refrigerated. Some types of cheese have bacteria and molds that add to their flavor and character. Hard varieties typically last longer than soft ones, but all require appropriate storage and should not be left exposed to warm temperatures for extended periods of time.\n\nPreventive measures must also include proper cooking techniques and personal hygiene. Washing hands before and after touching food is imperative, especially when it involves uncooked animal foods like meat, poultry, and seafood.\n\nOf course, when you eat out, you are at the mercy of those manning the kitchen. The only advice one can give is that if you have encountered problems in the past, you may not want to go back for seconds. On the other hand, if you are a regular at a particular eatery and you trust the place, you may want to stick with it. Of course, that is still not a foolproof strategy. All you can really do is minimize the risk by using your best judgment.\n\nConnect with us on Facebook, Twitter and Google+\n\nTimi Gustafson R.D. is a registered dietitian, newspaper columnist, blogger and author of the book “The Healthy Diner – How to Eat Right and Still Have Fun”®, which is available on her blog and at amazon.com.

Researchers have drawn conclusions after analyzing the data from Centre for Disease control and Prevention based on a nine year study. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) has observed more than 10408 food poisoning outbreaks that had taken place from 2002 to 2011. In 1610 outbreaks around twenty eight thousand people had suffered from food poisoning due to eating outside in restaurants. For those who ate at home, only thirteen thousand people had suffered during that period in 893 outbreaks that took place. This new study is clearly a warning to those who prefer eating outside home food on a regular basis.\n\nThe CSPI researchers have reasons to believe that the actual number of patients who suffer from food poisoning every year may go undetected as every case is not even registered. The health official still estimates that each year around 128,000 patients are hospitalized on grounds of stomach upset and food poisoning which accounts to one in six Americans affected. As many as 3000 people also face fatal consequences and are not able to survive. Health officials are now planning to outline food safety policies and also concentrate on outbreaks other than meat related food borne outbreaks.\n\nContaminated seafood, fresh produce and packaged foods are also sources of outbreaks. CSPI researchers have revealed that restaurant meals have high risks to be contaminated with E. coli, hepatitis A, Botulism, salmonella and listeria than homemade food. The bacteria listeria is the third leading cause of deaths in food poisoning cases and is particularly deadly in pregnant women.

LePage, who petulantly refused to submit a budget this year and has indicated that he would probably veto this one. Lawmakers will have to work without his leadership if they are going to show that responsible government through compromise is still possible in Maine.\n\nAdditional Photos One of the key weaknesses in the short-term plans, experts say, is the plans don’t have to cover pre-existing conditions, such as high blood pressure. shutterstock.com\n\nAnother test, however, will likely come sooner, when the governor’s third veto of a MaineCare expansion bill comes up for an override vote.\n\nThe debate has devolved into partisan semantics over whether Maine-Care is “welfare” or “health insurance,” and if adults with incomes near the poverty line are “truly needy.” But the real question is whether lawmakers will defy the governor and act in the best interests of the state.\n\nThis bill is also a bipartisan compromise that moves a Republican policy initiative – using managed care to control MaineCare costs – along with a Democratic priority of using federal funds to cover as many as 70,000 Mainers who do not have health insurance.\n\nExpanding MaineCare would attract $1 million a day in federal funds to pay 100 percent of the program until the end of 2016.\n\nAt that point the federal share would start to decline, never going below 90 percent. Under the compromise bill, Maine’s participation ends when the full federal support ends, requiring legislative action for the state to continue taking part.\n\nThe nonpartisan Office of Fiscal and Program Review determined that accepting the funds would have a net positive effect on the state budget, even when accounting for the administrative costs of managing the increased caseload. The governor counters with the highly partisan Alexander Report, written by an anti-Medicaid expansion activist.\n\nThe governor insists that covering more people by expanding MaineCare would divert resources from elderly and disabled Mainers who are currently not receiving all the services to which they are entitled. But that’s not true. The people on the waiting lists would lose nothing if the state expanded MaineCare, and they would gain nothing if it didn’t. The issues are linked only by his rhetoric.\n\nAnd the governor claims that we can’t afford to expand MaineCare because it would result in huge unpaid hospital bills that would increase the cost of care for everyone else.\n\nIf this were true, the Maine Medical Association and the Maine Hospital Association would not be supporting the expansion. Leaving tens of thousands of people with no way to pay their hospital bills is much more likely to drive up costs throughout the health care system than expanding MaineCare.\n\nThe governor has decided that no bill is better than a compromise. Responsible lawmakers should reject that kind of leadership and vote to override this veto.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.', 'LePage, who petulantly refused to submit a budget this year and has indicated that he would probably veto this one.\nshutterstock.comAnother test, however, will likely come sooner, when the governor’s third veto of a MaineCare expansion bill comes up for an override vote.\nExpanding MaineCare would attract $1 million a day in federal funds to pay 100 percent of the program until the end of 2016.\nThe people on the waiting lists would lose nothing if the state expanded MaineCare, and they would gain nothing if it didn’t.\nResponsible lawmakers should reject that kind of leadership and vote to override this veto.']"

Through fewer prescriptions and smaller doses, the number of pills dispensed was cut 27 percent, or 6 million pills for 15,000 fewer patients.\n\nAdditional Photos Ernie Merritt of Saco holds his back brace on April 1. The pain management support group leader says some who suffer chronic pain find that alternative treatments are not adequate. The Associated Press\n\nMaineCare may also have influenced doctors to write fewer painkiller prescriptions covered by private insurers, which decreased by 10,000 patients and 3.3 million fewer pills.\n\nWith the state experiencing “an epidemic in regards to opioid prescriptions,” the tighter guidelines are necessary to fight addiction trends, said Roy McKinney, director Maine’s Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nUnintended consequence\n\nMcKinney said an unintended consequence of the Medicaid rules – along with other state and national efforts – is that they dry up the source of illegally sold narcotics and may be contributing to a rise in heroin use as addicts seek the similar but cheaper alternative.\n\n“There is a lot going on, but I think this data tells a very positive story because it’s not just cutting off access to a treatment,” said Kevin Flanigan, director of MaineCare services. Unlike past state efforts to cut painkiller use, the new guidelines require patients with lasting pain to use smaller doses and to try physical therapy, chiropractic work or pain acceptance therapy.\n\nMaine’s new rules limit patients to painkillers for just two weeks a year, allowing renewal in two-week intervals with special permission. Patients with chronic pain lasting beyond eight weeks fall into a different category and are required to try alternative treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and chiropractic for pain relief.\n\nCancer and AIDS patients and others with lasting pain from end-of-life conditions still receive coverage for narcotic painkiller prescriptions. Hospice patients and those in nursing homes are also exempt.\n\nIn some cases, these guidelines have also been applied to non-Medicaid patients, resulting in fewer prescriptions for patients with private insurance, said Stephan Hull, director of the pain management center at Mercy Hospital in Portland.\n\n“I think there are a number of physicians out there that are relieved to have those restrictions,” regardless of the insurance providers, he said.\n\nTroubling trend\n\nBut the data showed a troubling trend: some Maine physicians appear to be applying a different standard for patients whose pills are paid for by Medicare, workers’ compensation, and by the patients themselves. Those categories showed significant increases in the numbers of patients and pills prescribed.\n\nPhysicians can petition MaineCare on behalf of their patients, addressing concerns that those who need the medication for pain relief, including common back pain and neck pain, would be unable to get it.\n\n“There are a number of situations where use of opioids is not only appropriate, it is the primary treatment,” said Flanigan. “Someone who is enrolled in hospice care and cancer has spread through their body and they have horrific pain. They need this medication in order to have a dignified life,” he said.\n\nFormer MaineCare patient Jeanie Devoe, 52, says her morphine prescription, along with 14 other medications, helps her manage full body pain and headaches stemming from three failed back surgeries.\n\nThe Westbrook resident was part of a pilot program at Mercy Hospital in Portland that is covered under the MaineCare guidelines. That program weans patients off medication by helping them cope with depression, anxiety and limited mobility that can accompany pain.\n\nDevoe was able to cut her daily dose of morphine in half and quit using other opioid drugs.\n\nSome need more help\n\nSome patient advocates are critical that the new alternative treatments aren’t enough for some people.\n\nErnie Merritt, who runs a pain management support group in South Portland, says the six physical therapy sessions and the 12 chiropractic sessions covered by MaineCare “are definitely not enough.” He said he needed twice-weekly physical therapy for months for injuries he incurred as a pipefitter that led to multiple back surgeries.\n\nFlanigan says Maine’s Medicaid guidelines are far ahead of other states by curbing opioid usage and offering alternative treatments. He said he knows of no similar efforts by other states.\n\nMaine’s success is especially notable because Medicaid programs across the country have been blamed in recent years for overprescribing narcotics.\n\n“There is certainly interest in this type of approach,” said Matt Salo, director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.', 'Through fewer prescriptions and smaller doses, the number of pills dispensed was cut 27 percent, or 6 million pills for 15,000 fewer patients.\nThe pain management support group leader says some who suffer chronic pain find that alternative treatments are not adequate.\nThe Westbrook resident was part of a pilot program at Mercy Hospital in Portland that is covered under the MaineCare guidelines.\nSome need more helpSome patient advocates are critical that the new alternative treatments aren’t enough for some people.\nFlanigan says Maine’s Medicaid guidelines are far ahead of other states by curbing opioid usage and offering alternative treatments.']"

The findings could help millions of people worldwide who are infected. Researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center announce clinical trial success for a single oral medication taken for twelve weeks. The medication that is a combination of two drugs cured 94 percent and 99 percent of patients with HCV genotype 1 that is found in 75 percent of people with the virus. In another study, a Chinese herb derivative was shown to block entry of the hepatitis C virus into liver cells pre-treated with the compound.\n\nCombination pill for HCV\n\nThe two drug combination tested by Beth Israel Deaconess researchers includes the drugs ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Compared to interferon combined with the antiviral drug ribavirin the single pill medication has fewer side effects with a shorter treatment time. The medication is also an option for patients who are not candidates for treatment with interferon.\n\n""Eliminating interferon and ribavirin from treatment regimens is expected to reduce the incidence and severity of adverse events, to simplify the treatment of patients with HCV infection and to provide an option for patients who are ineligible for the current interferon-based treatments,"" said Nezam Afdhal, MD, the senior author of the studies, Director of the Liver Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in a press release.\n\nSide effects of interferon and antiviral drugs include depression, anemia and flu-like symptoms. Treatment to cure hepatitis C takes up to 48 weeks.\n\n""The real advances seen in the ION trials is that the sofosbuvir-ledipasvir combination tablet enables us to treat almost all genotype 1 patients with a short duration of 8-12 weeks of treatment expanding the treatment pool and increasing the overall cure rate,"" said Afdhal who adds that the the treatment is safe and effective, providing a ""new and exciting"" new option for hepatitis C treatment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow eMaxHealth on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Please, click to subscribe to our Youtube Channel to be notified about upcoming health and food tips.\n\nThe findings were presented at the European Association for the Study of the Liver and published by the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday.\n\nCould a Chinese herb stop HCV?\n\nIn other findings presented at the International Liver CongressTM 2014, a new compound, SBEL1, was found to stop entry of hepatitis C virus into liver cells pretreated with the compound.\n\nProf. Markus Peck-Radosavljevic, Secretary-General of the European Association for the Study of the Liver and Associate Professor of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria, said: ""People infected with hepatitis C are at risk of developing severe liver damage including liver cancer and cirrhosis.\n\nIn the past, less than 20 percent of all HCV patients were treated because the available treatments were unsuitable due to poor efficacy and high toxicity. Recent advances means that we can now virtually cure HCV without unpleasant side effects. However, the different virus genotypes coupled with the complexity of the disease means there is still a major unmet need to improve options for all populations.""\n\nOnce hepatitis C enters the cells it spreads by making copies of itself by releasing DNA inside the host cells.\n\nSBEL1 halted virus activity by 95 percent, compared to controls. Researchers noted ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels were 78 percent lower in HCV infected cells treated with the compound, suggesting the Chinese herb derivative might stop spread of the virus to other parts of the body.\n\nThe two new treatments are major advances in understanding hepatitis C. Baby boomers are encouraged to be screened for the virus. The sofosbuvir-ledipasvir combination tablet could be especially effective for anyone newly diagnosed with the virus that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure.

Even in patients with the most stubborn infections, the new drugs were capable of suppressing the virus completely at rates well over 90 percent.\n\nThe treatments, however, have a steep price tag.\n\nOnly further research will establish that these cures will endure, averting an estimated 15,000 deaths a year from liver disease in the United States.

The cost of treating even half of the Americans chronically infected with HCV would exceed the amount currently spent on all radiological imaging, said Tice, who helped assess the cost and accessibility of the new medications for the California Technology Assessment Forum.\n\nInsurers probably will limit their use to patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver, a group that represents about one-third of those infected in the United States.

Goethe University Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany, and lead researcher on the ABT-450 study.\n\nHis research pairing ABT-450 with other interferon-free medications showed ""almost all patients with chronic hepatitis C can be cured even if previous treatments were unsuccessful,"" Zeuzem said.\n\nThe report was published online April 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with presentation of the findings at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver in London. The drug trial was funded by the drug\'s maker, AbbVie.\n\n""Hepatitis C is a big, bad problem,"" said Dr. William Carey, a liver specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\nThis new drug represents ""one among many breakthroughs in our ability to deal with hepatitis C,"" Carey said.\n\nAn advantage to this treatment is that it is a pill, while interferon is given in weekly injections. Also, older treatments went on for a year, while this new therapy takes only three months to work, Carey said.\n\nInterferon treatment also has severe side effects, including fatigue and flu-like symptoms.\n\n""This is not the only drug combination that is interferon-free, but it\'s a very promising one,"" he said.\n\nOne drawback to the therapy is that some pills are taken once a day and some twice, which might make following the treatment tricky. Carey hopes that treatment eventually is simplified. ""Wouldn\'t it be great if we could take one or two pills once a day and be done with it?"" he said.\n\nSince many people with hepatitis C remain symptom-free, the medical community has not agreed on whom to treat.\n\nWith these new cures, that question becomes easier to answer, Carey said. ""When you have a treatment that is this simple, effective and free of side effects, there are fewer and fewer reasons to think about withholding treatment,"" he noted.\n\n""The major barrier is cost,"" he added.\n\nWhether the new drug will be priced like Sovaldi, the $1,000-a-day medication, is still unknown.\n\nWith Sovaldi, the necessary three-month course costs $90,000, plus any other drug expenses and medical care.\n\nCarey said some insurance companies cover the cost of the drug, while others have denied it.\n\nCost is even more significant in light of the millions of Baby Boomers who are five times more likely to be infected with hepatitis C than other adults, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n""It\'s going to get harder as time goes on for insurance companies not to cover the cost of these drugs,"" Carey said. ""This is a curable disease.""\n\nAccording to a CBS News report, lawmakers and insurance companies complain that Gilead Sciences, the maker of Sovaldi, is trying to ""milk desperate patients."" Gilead says that, despite the high price, Sovaldi is cheaper because it ""cures patients quickly and eliminates a long and expensive treatment using other drugs.""\n\nFor this phase 3 trial of ABT-450—typically the last trial needed for FDA approval—nearly 400 patients were randomly assigned to take a placebo or a pill containing ABT-450 plus the drugs ombitasvir and ritonavir. These patients also took two additional drugs, dasabuvir and ribavirin.\n\nAll patients had been treated before, but saw their diseases return or had a poor response or no response to treatment.\n\nTaking the ABT-450 combination, 96.3 percent of the patients responded, the researchers said.\n\nPrevious research showed that patients who had never been treated also responded to this combination.\n\nDr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, New York City, said the results look promising for the millions of people with hepatitis C.\n\n""Hepatitis C is under-diagnosed,"" said Siegel.\n\nThese new treatments, with their high cure rates, make it important to diagnose and treat hepatitis C early to prevent cirrhosis and liver cancer, he said.\n\nHepatitis C can be spread by injectable drug use or sexual contact with an infected person.

Genotype 1b tends to be more common in Europe and 1a is more widely seen in the United States.\n\nSeveral drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences Inc, AbbVie and Merck & Co are developing a new generation of all-oral hepatitis C treatments that do not include interferon or ribavirin, which cause miserable side effects that have led thousands of patients to put off treatment to wait for the highly touted new drugs.\n\nIn clinical trials, the new drugs have demonstrated cure rates in excess of 90 percent while cutting treatment duration to 12 weeks with few side effects, leading to Wall Street forecasts of multibillion-dollar annual sales in what is shaping up to be a fiercely competitive market.\n\nPrior to the recent approval of the first of Gilead’s new drugs, standard treatments cured about 75 percent of patients and required either 24 or 48 weeks of therapy.\n\nBristol this week applied for U.S. approval of the two drug combination and said it expects to file for approval of a three-drug combination early next year.\n\nBased on earlier studies, Bristol’s three-drug combination is likely to further boost cure rates with 12 weeks of treatment, which would be more competitive to results seen so far from rival drugmakers.\n\nPatients in the Hallmark-Dual trial received 60 mg of daclatasvir once a day and 100 mg of asunaprevir twice daily. The drugs belong to new classes of medicines that work in different ways to prevent the virus from replicating.\n\nThe discontinuation rate due to adverse side effects was between 1 and 3 percent, the company said. Headache was the most common side effect, and serious side effects, such as elevations in liver enzymes, were seen in 5 percent to 7 percent of patients.\n\nLiver enzyme elevations were reversible and resolved following treatment, the company said.\n\nAbout 170 million people are believed to be infected with hepatitis C worldwide. If left untreated the disease can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or need for a liver transplant.

Dr. Jose Cordero, the founding director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities conveys this fervor.\n\n""For healthcare providers, we have a message that\'s pretty direct about ASD. And the message is: The 4-year-old with autism was once a 3-year-old with autism, which was once a 2-year-old with autism.""\n\nMany researchers are now on the hunt for atypical behaviors cropping up in infancy that could be telltale signs of ASD. For instance, a team of experts led by Dr. Karen Pierce at the Autism Center of Excellence at the University of California, San Diego, has used eye-tracking technology to determine that infants as young as 14 months who later were diagnosed as autistic showed a preference for looking at movies of geometric shapes over movies of children dancing and doing yoga. This predilection for being engaged by objects rather than ""social"" images is thought to be a marker for autism.\n\nEven the quality of infants\' crying has come under scientific scrutiny as a possible sign of the disorder. Dr. Stephen Sheinkopf and some colleagues at Brown University compared the cries of a group of babies at risk for autism (due to having an autistic sibling) to typically developing babies using cutting-edge acoustic technology. They discovered that the at-risk babies emit higher-pitched cries that are ""low in voicing,"" which is a term for cries that are sharper and reflect tense vocal chords. Dr. Sheinkopf, however, cautioned parents against over-scrutinizing their babies\' cries since the distinctions were picked up by sophisticated acoustic technology, not by careful human listening.\n\n""We definitely don\'t want parents to be anxiously listening to their babies\' cries. It\'s unclear if the human ear is sensitive enough to detect this.""\n\nWhat gets lost in the debate is an awareness of how the younger in age we assess for problems, the greater the potential a slow-to-mature kid will be given a false diagnosis. In fact, as we venture into more tender years to screen for autism, we need to be reminded that the period of greatest diagnostic uncertainty is probably toddlerhood. A 2007 study out of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that over 30 percent of children diagnosed as autistic at age two no longer fit the diagnosis at age four. Since ASD is still generally considered to be a life-long neuropsychiatric condition that is not shed as childhood unfolds, we have to wonder if a large percentage of toddlers get a diagnosis that is of questionable applicability in the first place.\n\nThe parallels between a slow-to-mature toddler and a would-be-mildly- autistic one are so striking that the prospect of a false diagnosis is great. Let\'s start with late talkers. Almost one in five 2-year-olds are late talkers. They fall below the expected 50-word expressive vocabulary threshold and appear incapable of stringing together two- and three-word phrases.', 'And the message is: The 4-year-old with autism was once a 3-year-old with autism, which was once a 2-year-old with autism.""\nDr. Sheinkopf, however, cautioned parents against over-scrutinizing their babies\' cries since the distinctions were picked up by sophisticated acoustic technology, not by careful human listening.\n""We definitely don\'t want parents to be anxiously listening to their babies\' cries.\nA 2007 study out of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that over 30 percent of children diagnosed as autistic at age two no longer fit the diagnosis at age four.\nThe parallels between a slow-to-mature toddler and a would-be-mildly- autistic one are so striking that the prospect of a false diagnosis is great.']"

111441,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-b-peters-phd/autism-and-anxiety-common_b_5126895.html,health,"['April is Autism Awareness Month. A recent article in the Washington Post quoted a 30 percent increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism over the last two years. It is now estimated that 1 in 68 children have an autistic spectrum disorder. It remains unclear whether the increase in diagnoses is based on an actual prevalence of spectrum disorders, the increased spectrum causing milder versions to be diagnosed, and/or more accurate and comprehensive approaches to diagnosis.\n\nTerminology and understanding of autism has changed over the years. Individuals with autism where once thought to consist only of individuals with low intelligence, severe language problems, and social deficits. It is now commonly understood that autism is a ""spectrum"" and that children can range from mild to moderate to severe, as well as may have either low, average, high, or even superior intellectual abilities.\n\nChildren on the spectrum tend to be rigid in their thinking, have trouble understanding verbal and nonverbal social cues, may engage in repetitive behaviors, have a specific and narrow interest area, and have challenges with understanding the perspective of others -- both what they may be thinking and feeling (aka ""theory of mind""). Children on the spectrum also tend to have sensory integration challenges -- trouble processing all of the information coming at them through their senses. While children can vary in their degree of challenge in the aforementioned, a key commonality to kids on the spectrum are their on-going challenges with anxiety.\n\nIt is not hard to understand why a child on the spectrum may experience anxiety if we try to see things from their perspective. Imagine you feel comfort in routine and in fact, you need it to manage your anxiety. If everything happens the way it does every day and the way it is ""supposed to,"" you feel fine. If something changes or is done in a different order you feel upset inside and feel out of control. Now imagine your parent changes the plans on you and instead of going to your tutor after school, you have to go to the busy and loud store to get groceries. Or, instead of your regular math class at 10:00, there is a surprise assembly -- with lots of people sitting close together. Unplanned activities or a change in schedule turns your world upside down and causes you to feel anxious.\n\nNow imagine you don\'t understand why people get mad at you or what they really want from you. All you are trying to do is mind your own business and do what you are interested in or need to do to feel ""okay."" What does everyone want from you? Why are people teasing me? Why can\'t I just sit by myself and finish my book? Not knowing when others will be mad at you, or understanding what is expected of you increases anxiety because you just can\'t predict what you are supposed to do -- unless it is always the same.\n\nNow imagine you get overwhelmed with loud noises, bright lights, lots of people in a space, and different people doing different things -- all at once. Another word for the above is called classrooms, restaurants, parks, grocery stores, movie theatres, sports teams, and enrichment classes. You have a sensitive sensory system and the environments you are in are overwhelming to you -- and cause anxiety.\n\nLiving on the spectrum comes with daily challenges for the child, his parent, and his teachers. Here are some tips that can help a child on the spectrum experience less anxiety in their day and feel calmer inside.\n\n• Stick to Routines: When at all possible, avoid surprises or changes in schedule. While we want to help children on the spectrum become more flexible over time, honoring their need for structure and predictability is key.\n\n• Visual Schedules: Have a board that has a written and/or picture schedule of what is to take place each day and the corresponding times. Color-code the different activities.\n\n• Create a Safe Zone: Co-create a safe place in your home (and in your child\'s classroom or school) where they can go when they are feeling anxious or scared. This place can have toys or objects that bring your child piece of mind and distract him or her from feeling worried our scared.\n\n• Teach Yoga and Deep Breathing: Children on the spectrum benefit from learning ways to calm their body and mind. These are skills they can keep in their toolbox and use whenever they are upset -- at school, at home, or in their safe place.\n\n• Teach Your Child about Anxiety and Worry and the ""Fight or Flight"" Response: For some children that are not high-functioning the idea of a worry monster might not work (may frighten those kids) but for others more highly functioning the concept is very helpful. Teach them about how their worrisome thoughts trigger their survival response which makes their body feel bad and scared (stomachaches and headaches). They can use their thinking brain to change their thinking and turn down their scared body feelings.\n\nParents of children on the autism spectrum understand the need -- and benefit -- of keeping their child\'s anxiety under control, and they constantly help their children learn self-regulatory and adaptive strategies. Of course, each child on the spectrum has his or her own sets of strengths and challenges. If you help your child use his or her strengths to keep calm and to keep their anxiety under control you\'ll give your child a lifelong gift.', ""Terminology and understanding of autism has changed over the years.\nIndividuals with autism where once thought to consist only of individuals with low intelligence, severe language problems, and social deficits.\nIt is not hard to understand why a child on the spectrum may experience anxiety if we try to see things from their perspective.\nHere are some tips that can help a child on the spectrum experience less anxiety in their day and feel calmer inside.\nParents of children on the autism spectrum understand the need -- and benefit -- of keeping their child's anxiety under control, and they constantly help their children learn self-regulatory and adaptive strategies.""]"

Genotype 1b tends to be more common in Europe and 1a is more widely seen in the United States.\n\nSeveral drugmakers, including Gilead Sciences Inc, AbbVie and Merck & Co are developing a new generation of all-oral hepatitis C treatments that do not include interferon or ribavirin, which cause miserable side effects that have led thousands of patients to put off treatment to wait for the highly touted new drugs.\n\nIn clinical trials, the new drugs have demonstrated cure rates in excess of 90 percent while cutting treatment duration to 12 weeks with few side effects, leading to Wall Street forecasts of multibillion-dollar annual sales in what is shaping up to be a fiercely competitive market.\n\nPrior to the recent approval of the first of Gilead\'s new drugs, standard treatments cured about 75 percent of patients and required either 24 or 48 weeks of therapy.\n\nBristol this week applied for U.S. approval of the two drug combination and said it expects to file for approval of a three-drug combination early next year.\n\nBased on earlier studies, Bristol\'s three-drug combination is likely to further boost cure rates with 12 weeks of treatment, which would be more competitive to results seen so far from rival drugmakers.\n\nPatients in the Hallmark-Dual trial received 60 mg of daclatasvir once a day and 100 mg of asunaprevir twice daily. The drugs belong to new classes of medicines that work in different ways to prevent the virus from replicating.\n\nThe discontinuation rate due to adverse side effects was between 1 and 3 percent, the company said. Headache was the most common side effect, and serious side effects, such as elevations in liver enzymes, were seen in 5 percent to 7 percent of patients.\n\nLiver enzyme elevations were reversible and resolved following treatment, the company said.', 'Patients for whom the virus was undetectable in the blood 12 weeks after completing 24 weeks of treatment were deemed to have achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured.\nThe study results were presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in London.\nPatients in the Hallmark-Dual trial received 60 mg of daclatasvir once a day and 100 mg of asunaprevir twice daily.\nThe drugs belong to new classes of medicines that work in different ways to prevent the virus from replicating.\nLiver enzyme elevations were reversible and resolved following treatment, the company said.']"

In a report on 2013 drug prices, the pharmacy benefits manager projected spending on hep C treatments will rise 1,800% from 2014 through 2016.\n\n""No major therapy class has experienced this high of a rate increase in the 21 years Express Scripts has recorded drug trend data,"" the report said. Taking a swipe at the price of the highly anticipated and recently approved Sovaldi, it said: ""With new medications costing more than $80,000 for a 12-week course of treatment,"" spending on hep C drugs would push up spending on all specialty products by 63% in that time period.\n\nThe big jump would come after spending on hep C treatments actually fell so much in 2013 that the category was no longer in the top 10 for specialty drug spending. But that is likely because doctors were holding off on treatment for some patients until the new, oral drugs from Gilead Sciences, AbbVie ($ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY) started to arrive on the scene. These oral treatments can cure the disease and are expected to be added into cocktails that will mean patients will no longer need to take the oft-dreaded interferon, and so it is anticipated they will be widely prescribed.\n\nExpress Scripts, which handles drug reimbursement for a big chunk of the U.S. private insurance market, has already staked out its position on the $84,000 price of Sovaldi. It is trying to form a coalition to refuse to use it after a competitor hits the market, which might be as soon as this fall. Since millions of people in the U.S. have hepatitis C, the cost of treating them could be $300 billion, Express Scripts CMO Steven Miller told Bloomberg this week, more than what the U.S. currently pays for all medications. ""What they have done with this particular drug will break the country,"" Miller told the news service. ""Companies just aren\'t going to be able to handle paying for this drug.""\n\nThere has been pushback by others, including states that believe the cost of treating hep C patients could overwhelm their Medicaid programs. The World Health Organization is trying to figure out how to make the drug available in countries that won\'t be able to afford it.\n\nGilead Sciences has defended the price of Sovaldi as appropriate and countered by saying that if it can cure the chronic disease, it will save money for everyone in the long run. The company has claimed that payers get that and have been accepting of its price. Sovaldi is already seeing big sales.\n\n\n\nBig sales, that is, in the U.S. But Gilead is plotting a different strategy in developing countries. The drugmaker told Reuters that it is negotiating with several Indian generic drugmakers to produce it at lower costs so that it can be sold at a fraction of the U.S. cost in 60 developing nations. That would include India, many Sub-Saharan countries in Africa and some countries in Asia. It is working on tiered pricing for other countries. Egypt has already negotiated a deal to get Sovaldi for $300 for a 28-day bottle, compared with the $28,000 that it would cost in the U.S.\n\nWhile the Express Scripts report shined a spotlight on the hep C treatments, it also included information about drug spending last year. It said that spending on prescription drugs was up 5.4% in 2013, higher than in recent years, but far less than the increases seen a decade ago. It said the spending increase was pushed up by higher prices for branded drugs, and greater use of specialty drugs. Specialty drug spending grew by 14.1%.\n\n- read the report\n\n- here\'s the Bloomberg story\n\n- get more from Reuters\n\n- still more from PharmaPhorum', 'In a report on 2013 drug prices, the pharmacy benefits manager projected spending on hep C treatments will rise 1,800% from 2014 through 2016.\nThe big jump would come after spending on hep C treatments actually fell so much in 2013 that the category was no longer in the top 10 for specialty drug spending.\nThere has been pushback by others, including states that believe the cost of treating hep C patients could overwhelm their Medicaid programs.\nWhile the Express Scripts report shined a spotlight on the hep C treatments, it also included information about drug spending last year.\nSpecialty drug spending grew by 14.1%.']"

However, ticks also come along with the warm weather. These parasites can bring with them such illnesses as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which could really put a damper on your summer vacation.\n\n\n\nHere are a few tips from Governor Cuomo on dealing with ticks this spring and summer. Anyone in a wooded area should do the following:\n\nMake sure shirts are tucked in and also tuck pants into socks to prevent ticks from accessing the skin.\n\nWear long sleeve shirts and pants, when practical.\n\nWear light colored clothing that will make it easier to spot and remove ticks.\n\nCheck for ticks every two to three hours while outdoors and brush off any ticks you find before they attach.\n\nBathe or shower as soon as possible after coming indoors (preferably within two hours) to wash off and more easily find ticks on your body.\n\nPerform a full body check multiple times during the day and at the end of the day to ensure that no ticks are attached.\n\nNew York State averages more than 5,500 new Lyme disease cases each year. Lyme disease will spread after an infected tick is attached to a person for 36 hours or more. If a tick is found, it is critical to remove it immediately. The best way to remove a tick is by using a pair of tweezers and grasping the tick as close to its attachment to the skin as possible.\n\n\n\nBe sure to keep an eye on the area where any tick bite occurs. If an expanding rash more than two inches apart appears or if an expanding rash more than two inches across appears, contact your health care provider immediately. Also contact your health provider if you notice flu-like symptoms over a 30-day period following a tick bite.\n\n\n\nTicks can also be a danger to your pets. Remember the following rules to keep your pets safe:\n\nCheck your pets for ticks daily, especially after they spend time outdoors.\n\nIf you find a tick on your dog, remove it right away.\n\nAsk your veterinarian to conduct a tick check at each exam.\n\nTalk with your veterinarian about using tick preventives on your pet.\n\nAlways follow label instructions when applying tick preventives to your pet.\n\nRemember that cats are very sensitive to certain tick-preventative chemicals. It is important to consult a veterinarian before using them on cats.\n\n\n\nFor more information on ticks, see the New York State Department of Health website.\n\n\n\n[Source: Governor Andrew M.

Lyme disease – carried by tiny deer ticks commonly found in long grass and wooded areas — is the second fastest-growing infectious disease in the United States. You’re at highest risk for the disease if you live in the Northeast, upper Midwest, or Pacific Northwest regions, where deer ticks are more common.\n\n\n\nLyme disease begins subtly, with a red, ring-shaped rash — but, in some cases the rash never appears and the victim’s first symptom is arthritis of the joints. Untreated, Lyme disease can lead to muscoskeletal, cardiac and central nervous system disorders. With early treatment, the more severe effects of Lyme disease can be averted. But prevention is your best weapon against the disease.\n\nSince the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is passed to humans through ticks, preventing the little bloodsuckers from latching themselves onto your body is the only sure way of preventing Lyme disease. These ticks commonly live in wooded areas with dense brush and high shrubs, where they are more prevalent during spring and fall months; ticks are much less likely to be found in open or grassy areas.\n\nProtect yourself with these anti-tick tips:\n\nAvoid tick-infested areas such as long grass and dense, wooded areas especially in May, June, and July.\n\nWear long pants tucked into your socks or boots, and a long-sleeved shirt tucked into your pants, if you plan to enter a wooded area.\n\nWear white or light colored clothes so ticks are easier to spot.\n\nUse an insect repellent that contains DEET on your clothing, but sparingly and with caution.\n\nKeep the areas around your house and garden clear of leaves, brush, and tall grass and your lawn mowed short.\n\nRemove vegetation close to your home that attracts deer and construct physical barriers to prevent deer, and accompanying deer ticks, from coming near your house.\n\nPlace birdfeeders away from your house to keep the ticks they carry at bay.\n\nIf ticks are a particularly pesky problem in your area, you may consider having tick pesticides (acaricides) applied to your property.\n\nWhen you leave a high-risk tick area, inspect yourself carefully and remove any ticks.\n\nIf a tick bites you, save the tick and bring it to your doctor for analysis to determine whether the tick was carrying Lyme disease.\n\nIf you think you may have been infected with Lyme disease, look for the telltale signs and see your doctor fast.

Health Department, offered the following tips:\n\nUse an insect repellant containing DEET on exposed skin, and treat clothing and footwear with a permethrin-based repellant that provides weeks of protection and remains through several washings.\n\nTuck your pants into socks to reduce the amount of exposed skin. When hiking, stay on well-worn paths and out of tall grass or bushy areas.\n\nCheck for ticks immediately after being outdoors. The longer a tick is attached, the greater your risk of infection.\n\nIf you discover a tick, use tweezers to remove it as close to the skin as possible. Don\'t grab it with your fingers and squeeze it. That injects the tick fluids into you and increases the risk of infection, Ohl warned.\n\nIf you suffer a tick bite and develop a fever one to two weeks later, see a doctor. The incubation period for tick-borne diseases is eight to 14 days, he said.\n\nProtect your dog with tick collars or monthly treatments.

111489,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/04/13/how-to-prevent-lyme-disease-in-children/,health,"['As the weather improves and your kids go outside to play, protecting them from Lyme disease is more important than ever.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 300,000 Americans are diagnosed with Lyme disease annually. However, only approximately 30,000 cases are reported to the CDC.\n\nOf those reported cases, approximately 37 percent are children, according to the Lyme Disease Association.\n\nLyme disease is an infection transmitted by ticks— the deer tick and the western black legged tick. While other ticks can carry Lyme bacteria, their bites have not been shown to transmit the disease.\n\n“The vast majority of tick bites do not cause Lyme disease,” according to Dr. Benjamin Luft, the Edmund D. Pellegrino professor of medicine at Stony Brook University School of Medicine on Long Island.\n\nWhen it’s found early, Lyme disease can be effectively treated, but if left undetected, it can cause a host of symptoms in kids that can affect their health, their behavior and their school performance.\n\nUnfortunately, the disease is difficult to diagnose in children because they aren’t always able to explain their symptoms. Lyme disease affects the brain and can look like mononucleosis, migraines and the flu.\n\n“Lyme disease is such a complex set of infections that involves all of the body’s systems, and in particular, the nervous system,” Andrea Caesar, author of “A Twist of Lyme: Battling a Disease That ‘Doesn’t Exist,’” said. In 2011, Caesar was finally diagnosed with Lyme disease after 26 years of dealing with countless symptoms.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that there are ways you can prevent your child from being infected with Lyme disease. Follow these eight tips:\n\n1. Do regular tick checks.\n\nA daily tick check, especially after playing outdoors, is one of the best ways to prevent Lyme disease. Scan your child’s body and pay special attention to creases—on the ankles, in between the toes, behind the ears and the knees, in the groin, and on the neck and head.\n\n2. Look in the hair, too.\n\n“Deer ticks are like little pieces of dirt—they’re very hard to see,” Caesar said. She recommends a “look and feel” approach by using a comb to separate the hair as you look for ticks. Or use a combination magnifying glass and tick remover tool.\n\n3. Wear the right clothes.\n\nWhen your child is playing outside, consider dressing him in light-colored clothing, which will make identifying ticks easier when you do your regular checks. If possible, tuck pants into socks, pull the hair back, and have your child wear a hat.\n\n4. Consider a repellant.\n\nInsect repellants with DEET are very effective but studies show they’re also toxic. What’s more, “with children, it’s hard to measure the ratio of toxicity to benefit,” Luft said. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends products used on kids should have no more than 30 percent DEET.\n\nDEET should be sprayed on clothing, never on the face or hands, and not used daily, Luft said. A non-DEET repellent should always be labeled “safe for children.”\n\n5. Remove the tick immediately.\n\nTicks are usually found in wooded areas but they can also show up in your backyard. It takes 48 hours to be infected with Lyme, so if you can remove the tick within that time period, you eliminate the possibility of infection, Luft said.\n\nUse tweezers or a tick removal kit to remove the tick from its head, not the body, which might push the contents of the mid-gut into your child’s skin. Pull the tick upward, without twisting, to avoid breaking off the mouth-parts.\n\n6. Look for symptoms.\n\nOne early stage of Lyme disease is a bull’s-eye rash— a red, round patch at the site of the bite. This occurs in 80 to 90 percent of people, yet it’s only reported in 35 to 60 percent, the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society estimates.\n\nIf your kid has flu-like symptoms, a low-grade fever, feels tired or sluggish, make an appointment with the pediatrician.\n\n7. Call the doctor.\n\nDiagnostic tests for Lyme disease may be more reliable a few days after infection, but it’s best to consult your doctor as soon as possible.\n\n“At the time of the tick bite, the test will invariably be negative because Lyme disease takes 7 to 10 days to develop and the immune response may be quite delayed,” Luft said.\n\nYour child’s doctor may take a wait-and-watch approach or start your child on medication right away.\n\n8. Get the tick tested.\n\nIf you do find a tick, send it to a lab to see if it’s a carrier for Lyme disease. “It’s much easier to test a tick than it is to test a person,” Caesar said. If it’s positive, find a Lyme disease specialist at www.ilads.org.', 'As the weather improves and your kids go outside to play, protecting them from Lyme disease is more important than ever.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated 300,000 Americans are diagnosed with Lyme disease annually.\nOf those reported cases, approximately 37 percent are children, according to the Lyme Disease Association.\nThe good news is that there are ways you can prevent your child from being infected with Lyme disease.\nOne early stage of Lyme disease is a bull’s-eye rash— a red, round patch at the site of the bite.']"

That’s patently obvious due to essentially everything she’s been saying about vaccines for years. Yet in an op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times on April 12, 2014, she tries to ignore all that, and wipe the record clean.\n\nIn case you think I may be misquoting her, here is the first line of that op-ed: “I am not ‘anti-vaccine.’”\n\nSo, there you go.\n\nShe says she’s never told anyone not to get vaccinated. Assuming that’s true, great! But that’s hardly the entry-level position for being anti-vax. For example, you can say things that are grossly incorrect about them that would scare parents into not vaccinating their children. That would fit the moniker “anti-vax,” I’d think.\n\nSo, for example, saying vaccines have toxins in them—as she has said for years, and as she reiterates in her op-ed—is a clear sign of being anti-vax. After all, if someone tells you you’re putting toxins in your body, that sounds awful, doesn’t it? Doesn’t that make you want to stop doing whatever it is that’s putting them inside you?\n\nYet as doctors say, dosage makes the poison. The amount of, say, formaldehyde in a typical vaccination is much less than you’d get eating an apple. The same can be shown for the other ingredients claimed to be toxins in vaccines as well. The truth is vaccines contain far too small a dose of any of these things to cause any of the problems McCarthy and other anti-vaxxers claim exist.\n\nAlso, botulinum is the single most lethal toxin known to humans. Yet McCarthy has enthusiastically praised injecting this toxin into her face. How can anyone possibly say that and also say vaccines have dangerous levels of toxins in them with a straight face?\n\nWhich brings us to autism. McCarthy is still claiming that there is a link between vaccines and autism. However that is simply not true. Again and again and again and again this has been shown. McCarthy asks us to talk to families of people who have children with autism. That’s certainly a good place to start, but it’s the first step to an answer, not the last. Anecdotes are not data. We know people are subject to dozens of different biases that lead them down the wrong path when trying to determine cause and effect. That’s why medical studies are done so carefully, to make sure we aren’t fooling ourselves. And the studies clearly show no connection between vaccines and autism.\n\nAnd finally, let’s take a step back and look at the claim that she’s not anti-vax itself. Jeffrey Kluger is a science writer for Time magazine. He interviewed McCarthy in 2009 about this issue, and she mentions that interview in her op-ed piece. Kluger disagrees vehemently with what she wrote in the op-ed, to say the very least.\n\nI can see why. Here is what she writes in the op-ed:\n\n“People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines,” I told Time magazine science editor Jeffrey Kluger in 2009. “Please understand that we are not an anti-vaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins.”\n\nBut Kluger points out that she left the last line out of that quotation. Here’s the whole thing:\n\nPeople have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines. Please understand that we are not an antivaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins. If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f–king measles.\n\nHuh. That last line rather changes the tone of her position considerably, wouldn’t you agree? That’s a difficult stance to square with someone who is not anti-vaccine. As Kluger points out, her entire premise is false; since vaccines don’t cause autism, no one has to make the choice between measles (and other preventable, dangerous diseases) and autism.\n\nKluger finishes with this:\n\nJenny, as outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough continue to appear in the U.S.—most the result of parents refusing to vaccinate their children because of the scare stories passed around by anti-vaxxers like you—it’s just too late to play cute with the things you’ve said. You are either floridly, loudly, uninformedly antivaccine or you are the most grievously misunderstood celebrity of the modern era. Science almost always prefers the simple answer, because that’s the one that’s usually correct. Your quote trail is far too long—and you have been far too wrong—for the truth not to be obvious.\n\nHe’s right. She has gone on and on and on and on and on and on about it. She can claim all she wants that she’s not anti-vax, but her own words show her to be wrong.\n\nAnti-vax is as anti-vax does. And she does.', 'That’s patently obvious due to essentially everything she’s been saying about vaccines for years.\nHow can anyone possibly say that and also say vaccines have dangerous levels of toxins in them with a straight face?\nAnd finally, let’s take a step back and look at the claim that she’s not anti-vax itself.\nShe can claim all she wants that she’s not anti-vax, but her own words show her to be wrong.\nAnti-vax is as anti-vax does.']"

She now writes that her views are actually in a ‘grey’ area. Read on.\n\nJenny McCarthy has been under fire for years from top doctors and other parents ever since she spoke out on the Larry King Live show in 2008, saying that child vaccines caused her son, Evan’s autism. At the time, she said “that vaccinations triggered Evan’s autism,” but now in a new column for the Chicago Sun Times, she asserts that she’s “pro-vaccine,” but she doesn’t believe in a “one size fits all” schedule.\n\nJenny McCarthy On Vaccination — There’s A Grey Area\n\n“For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, ‘pro-vaccine’ and for years I have been wrongly branded as ‘anti-vaccine,'” she wrote in a Chicago Sun-Times column published April 12.\n\nNow, Jenny says that despite all the medical research and recommendations by the World Health Organization for a life-protection series of childhood vaccination given at set ages, Jenny thinks parents should make their own decisions for vaccinations.\n\nAfter years of being attacked for her beliefs, Jenny, 41, is speaking out again about vaccinations.\n\n“For my child, I asked for a schedule that would allow one shot per visit instead of the multiple shots they were and still are giving infants,” she wrote. “I am passionate about important conversations on how we can improve health care for our children and generations to come. This is an extremely important discussion and I am dumbfounded that these conversations are discounted and negated because the answers are not black or white. Again I ask, what happened to critical thinking?”\n\nJenny: ‘One Size Does Not Fit All’\n\nEven though she doesn’t have a medical degree or any medical training, Jenny clearly feels that she and other parents know better than doctors do on how to prevent children from contracting and potentially dying from some diseases like polio and chicken pox. Before childhood vaccinations, thousands of children died every year from these diseases.\n\nJenny also says she’s demanding “safe vaccines” but does not explain what makes the vaccine safe or how they aren’t safe. The 1998 case study written by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, in which Jenny referred to as linking autism to childhood vaccinations, was later proved to have been fake — now no study has ever shown that there was a link . But Jenny still writes that she believes every child should be vaccinated differently.\n\n“I’ve never told anyone to not vaccinate,” she continued. “Should a child with the flu receive six vaccines in one doctor visit? Should a child with a compromised immune system be treated the same way as a robust, healthy child? Shouldn’t a child with a family history of vaccine reactions have a different plan? Or at least the right to ask questions?”\n\nShe insists that there should be a “grey” area in vaccinations.\n\n“I will continue to say what I have always said: ‘One size does not fit all,'” Jenny wrote. “God help us all if gray is no longer an option.”\n\nHollywoodLifers — what do you think of Jenny’s new comments? Do you think she’s always felt that way or that she’s backtracking because of all the negative reactions she’s received?

Unfortunately, that age of dis-enlightenment is upon us: there are a group of people who are against vaccinating their children -- causing a resurgence in diseases that were once eradicated, such as measles -- because they heard from Jenny McCarthy that vaccines cause autism.\n\nBut now, in a new op-ed piece, the former Playboy model is claiming that her words have been taken out of context -- and, in fact, she\'s NOT ""anti-vaccine."" She wrote a piece for the Chicago Sun-Times, where she explained her position.\n\n""I am not \'anti-vaccine,\'"" McCarthy, 41, wrote. ""This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, \'pro-vaccine\' and for years I have been wrongly branded as \'anti-vaccine.\'""\n\nThis is a complete about-face from her previous proclamations -- most notably, she went on Larry King Live in 2008, where she argued that certain early childhood vaccines against disease cause autism in children. At the time, she said that she came to this conclusion after her son, Evan (who is now 11), was diagnosed with autism shortly after receiving a vaccine. (If she\'d received any sort of scientific training, she\'d know that correlation does not imply causation: just because the two events happened in the same time frame, it doesn\'t mean that one caused the other. If, for example, I fall down while eating an ice cream cone, it doesn\'t mean that eating ice cream cones causes people to fall down; it means I\'m clumsy, it means I tripped over a rock, or it means my dog wandered between my legs and tripped me. But it\'s irresponsible, and scientifically bogus, to conclude that ice cream cones caused me to fall down -- and that\'s basically what Jenny McCarthy has done when it comes to vaccines...)\n\nSlate, of course, is quick to point out Jenny\'s hypocrisy about ""toxins"" (which she claims that vaccines have, though various studies have concluded that there are more toxins in the average apple you buy at a supermarket than there are in a vaccine), considering she\'s enthusiastic about Botox, made from one of the most deadly viruses on Earth (the botulinum toxin, which causes fatal paralysis).\n\nAnd Jeffrey Kluger of TIME Magazine -- who was one of the first to give Jenny McCarthy an interview wherein she explained her anti-vaccine stance -- had the best quote about her hypocrisy. ""Jenny, as outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough continue to appear in the U.S. -- most the result of parents refusing to vaccinate their children because of the scare stories passed around by anti-vaxxers like you -- it\'s just too late to play cute with the things you\'ve said. You are either floridly, loudly, uninformedly anti-vaccine or you are the most grievously misunderstood celebrity of the modern era.

The levels of alcohol exposure were equivalent to twice the legal driving limit.\n\nBinge drinking drives away infection-eating macrophages\n\nThe researchers discovered that binge drinking reduces levels of a type of white blood cell - called macrophages. The job of these macrophages is to ""chew up"" bacteria and dust - thus cleaning our wounds of infection.\n\nFast facts about binge drinking Approximately 79,000 people die each year in the US because of heavy drinking - a total of 2.3 million years of potential life lost.\n\nBinge drinking is associated with a raised risk for type 2 diabetes, stroke, sudden cardiac death and heart attack.\n\nIn 2011, it was estimated that binge drinking costs the US economy $224 billion each year.\n\nThe macrophages were reduced during binge alcohol exposure because of impaired production of a protein. This protein - called macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, or MIP-1α - ""recruits"" the macrophages to the wound site.\n\nAs well as MIP-1α, the production of another protein - called ""CRAMP"" - was inhibited. An antimicrobial peptide, CRAMP is found in the epidermis (the top layer of the skin) where it kills bacteria and signals immune system cells to help fight infection.\n\n""Over the last decade, researchers have come to appreciate the critical role the skin has in modulating systemic responses to various stressors,"" lead author Katherine A. Radek, PhD, told Medical News Today, when we asked why this interaction between macrophages and binge drinking has not been documented before.\n\n""Thus, the relationship between skin macrophages and binge alcohol exposure was likely overlooked,"" she continued, ""due to a lack of understanding about the interdependence between the skin and systemic responses to stressors, such as binge alcohol exposure.""\n\nDr. Radek hopes that her research will influence clinical process when diagnosing and treating binge drinking patients:\n\n""We hope that intoxicated patients will be subject to more defined protocols and additional diagnostic testing for vulnerable organ systems, and perhaps an altered antibiotic regimen to prevent infection. Furthermore, the traumatic injury itself may act as a \'window of opportunity\' to implement minor interventions that can help the patient alter his or her binge drinking behavior.""\n\nRecently, Medical News Today reported on an analysis from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), which found approximately 5,000 US youths under the age of 21 die from unintentional injuries, homicides and suicides related to alcohol consumption every year.\n\nFrom this data, the NIAAA were able to conclude that the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 - where all US states are required to prohibit the sale of alcohol to people under the age of 21 - saves lives and should not be revoked.', 'Binge drinking drives away infection-eating macrophagesThe researchers discovered that binge drinking reduces levels of a type of white blood cell - called macrophages.\nFast facts about binge drinking Approximately 79,000 people die each year in the US because of heavy drinking - a total of 2.3 million years of potential life lost.\nBinge drinking is associated with a raised risk for type 2 diabetes, stroke, sudden cardiac death and heart attack.\nIn 2011, it was estimated that binge drinking costs the US economy $224 billion each year.\n""Thus, the relationship between skin macrophages and binge alcohol exposure was likely overlooked,"" she continued, ""due to a lack of understanding about the interdependence between the skin and systemic responses to stressors, such as binge alcohol exposure.""']"

All that’s needed is a home win over Liechtenstein, one of the world’s weakest teams, in Helsinki and the Finns will take their place in next year’s European Championship.\n\nAfter so many past disappointments, it is a day many in this Nordic country of 5.5 million inhabitants – better known for its hockey team, rally drivers and javelin throwers – thought would never arrive.\n\nIt is one that could transcend soccer, changing the mentality of a nation.\n\n“There are always skeptics – with a sort of `Ah, they are never going to do it anyway’ feeling – in more or less everything we do, whether it is music, anything,” said former Finland player Aki Riihilahti, who is now CEO of Finnish champion HJK Helsinki. “The Finnish nature is that only when there comes an external acknowledgement of an achievement do we go and support it.\n\n“For what this will mean, it is more important mentally than factually.”\n\nFinland has had better teams down the years, on paper anyway. They’ve had more celebrated players, too – think of Jari Litmanen, the silky playmaker for Ajax and Barcelona, and Sami Hyypia, the defensive stalwart at Liverpool. Yet getting to a World Cup or European Championship has been beyond them, despite more than 80 years of trying.\n\nFinland remains, somewhat embarrassingly, the only major Nordic country to have never qualified for a major tournament.\n\nSo what’s changed? The hiring of a former primary school teacher as coach has plenty to do with it.\n\nMarkku Kanerva was promoted to the job in December 2016, having previously been an assistant with the team and a former player in the 1980s and ’90s. He inherited a team that had gone all of 2016 without a win and also one that was about to lose some of its best players. One midfielder, Roman Eremenko, received a two-year ban for testing positive for cocaine in 2016; another, Perparim Hetemaj, would go on to retire in early 2018 to focus on his club career.\n\nKanerva took a pragmatic view of the team, picking players according to their individual strengths rather than a pre-existing style and reverting to a straightforward 4-4-2 formation. His approach was based on hard work and strong defensive shape, and relied on the country’s most high-profile player – striker Teemu Pukki – poaching some goals at the other end.\n\nKanerva also approaches coaching like he would teaching, encouraging his players to interact more, take responsibility, and learn what they have done wrong so they can improve.\n\nThe results have been striking. Finland won its group in the inaugural UEFA Nations League competition after winning its opening four qualifying games, earning promotion to League B and guaranteeing a playoff spot for Euro 2020 that might not be necessary.\n\nIn Euro 2020 qualifying, the Finns reacted to an opening loss to Italy by winning four straight Group J games without conceding a goal. After eight games, they are in second place, behind already qualified Italy but five points ahead of both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenia. With two teams advancing automatically, Finland needs one win from its final two qualifiers over the coming days, starting with last-place Liechtenstein, to make history.\n\n“This is the missing piece of the puzzle,” said Marco Casagrande, general secretary of the Football Association of Finland. “All the other things in our sports we have managed to do, but this is something that’s still separating us from being a real sports country.”\n\nFinland’s underperformance on the international stage was bought into sharp focus by Iceland, a tiny Nordic brother with a population of just 330,000, reaching both Euro 2016 and last year’s World Cup.\n\nCasagrande recalls speaking to his colleagues at the Icelandic FA, asking them: “So what’s your secret?”\n\n“It didn’t help,” Casagrande said, “when everyone was saying, `You are losing all the games and Iceland is going to the Euros. Come on guys, what are you doing?”‘\n\nIceland’s rise was based on a strong collective effort combined with a sprinkle of stardust by its one standout player, Gylfi Sigurdsson, and Finland is pretty much the same.\n\nWhile goalkeeper Lukas Hradecki, who plays in Germany for Bayer Leverkusen, gets plenty of plaudits, most of the spotlight falls on Pukki, the hard-working striker who has scored seven goals in qualifying and made a strong start to his first season in the Premier League with Norwich.\n\n“Teemu Pukki is really somebody who everybody seems to love,” said Riihilahti, who also played in England’s top division with Crystal Palace, “and has been adopted as the Finnish savior who is bringing us to the promised land.”\n\nWhen Finland won the men’s hockey world championship this year for the first time since 2011, there were wild celebrations in central Helsinki as champagne-swilling fans braved the cold weather by stripping off and taking a swim in the fountain and climbing on the famous Havis Amanda statue.\n\nExpect more of the same if the country’s soccer players finally make the long-awaited international breakthrough.\n\n“Finnish people would all celebrate like a big festival,” Riihilahti said. “It will go crazy.”\n\n—\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\n—\n\nSteve Douglas is at http://www.twitter.com/sdouglas80', 'Expectations around the country’s soccer team are rising, though, like never before.\nOn Friday, Finland could seal a place in the finals of a major soccer tournament for the first time in its history.\n“The Finnish nature is that only when there comes an external acknowledgement of an achievement do we go and support it.\nYet getting to a World Cup or European Championship has been beyond them, despite more than 80 years of trying.\nExpect more of the same if the country’s soccer players finally make the long-awaited international breakthrough.']"

For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, “pro-vaccine” and for years I have been wrongly branded as “anti-vaccine.”\n\nThere is a smidgen of truth in McCarthy’s claim. In a Q&A in Time almost exactly five years ago, McCarthy, while plugging a new vaccines cause autism book stated, “People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines. Please understand that we are not an antivaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins. If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f___ing measles.\n\nMcCarthy has an 11-year-old son, Evan, who was diagnosed with autism in 2005. McCarthy has, in her own mind, linked the autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR).\n\nMcCarthy is notorious for saying, “The idea that vaccines are a primary cause of autism is not as crackpot as some might wish. Autism’s 60-fold rise in 30 years matches a tripling of the U.S. vaccine schedule.” And it’s true that the CDC just reported that Autism spectrum disorder now affects one in 68 children; however Jenny, could this increase in autism be due to a change in the disease definition and not the MMR?\n\nWhy is it that McCarthy, who has been so outspoken over this topic over the years, feels the need to pen this article? Could it be that the scientific community has over and over again shown their is no link? Maybe she just wants for people to not think she’s a kook? Maybe the unnecessary resurgence of whooping cough, measles, mumps and other vaccine preventable diseases has struck a chord with the former playmate?\n\nMcCarthy once said, “I do believe sadly it’s going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe.” Well Jenny, you got your wish.\n\nThere was an important article written by infectious disease expert, President of the non-profit Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, Dr. Peter Hotez two weeks ago. Hotez, who also an adult child with autism, wrote:\n\nFor me, the issue is completely straightforward. From a scientific perspective, there is no scenario where it is even remotely possible that vaccines could cause autism. Instead everything I know both as a parent and as a scientist points to autism as a genetic or epigenetic condition. A new paper just published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Eric Courchesne and his colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, confirms that the brains of children with autism have distinct patches of architectural disorganization in their prefrontal and temporal cortical tissue. Because the organization of the cortex begins in the second trimester of pregnancy, Dr. Courchesne concludes that the events leading to the malformation of the cortex must begin around this time or perhaps before then, certainly well before a child is born or ever receives a vaccine.\n\nHotez concludes the piece, which is well worth the read, The results of not vaccinating your child can be devastating citing the following numbers– “worldwide 125,400 children died from measles in 2010, in addition to 81,400 from pertussis, 61,300 from tetanus, and almost one million from pneumococcal disease. We have safe and effective vaccines for each of these diseases and sadly, most of these deaths could have been prevented!\n\n“So on this day I hope to continue to educate the public both about our safe and effective vaccines, while focusing national attention on autism where it belongs, namely the urgent need for research on the autism spectrum disorders.”\n\nMs. McCarthy, I am very sorry for the condition of your son. However, sadly and clearly your statements over the past several years, your TV appearances and books have done nothing but damage, and without an iota of evidence mind you.\n\nThe numbers don’t lie.', 'Former playmate and current hostess of The View, Jenny McCarthy got the opportunity to “clarify” her thoughts on vaccines and autism Saturday in an Op-Ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times.\nIn a Q&A in Time almost exactly five years ago, McCarthy, while plugging a new vaccines cause autism book stated, “People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines.\nWe are demanding safe vaccines.\nMcCarthy has, in her own mind, linked the autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR).\nMcCarthy is notorious for saying, “The idea that vaccines are a primary cause of autism is not as crackpot as some might wish.']"

The former Playboy model has repeatedly promoted the danger of vaccines and asserted, despite a total lack of evidence, that they can cause autism. In an op-ed for the Chicago Sun Times on Sunday, she proclaimed, ""I am not \'anti-vaccine.\' This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted.""\n\nHowever, in 2009, she claimed of her own son\'s condition: ""Without a doubt in my mind, I believe that vaccinations triggered Evan\'s autism."" She is also on record as saying, ""So, you ask any mother in the autism community if we\'ll take the flu, the measles over autism any frickin\' day of the week -- So, I think they [pro-vaccine doctors] need to wake up and stop hurting our kids."" As noted by the National Geographic in 2013, ""In April, researchers published a study that looked at nearly 1,000 children and concluded that exposure to vaccines during the first two years of life was not associated with an increased risk of developing autism.""\n\nNational Geographic writer Susan Brink added:\n\nIn 2001, a panel of 15 experts from the Institute of Medicine, which advises Congress, found no connection between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. In 2004, a comprehensive review by the Institute of Medicine found no causal relationship between vaccines and autism.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control concluded:\n\nBecause some parents have chosen to either not vaccinate their children at all or to not follow the recommended CDC childhood vaccination schedule, the CDC Immunization Safety Office conducted a study that compared the vaccination history of children with autism spectrum disorder with children without. The central idea behind the study was if receiving multiple vaccines on the same date raises the risk of autism, then children who received more vaccines early in life or on a single day should show a higher risk of autism.\n\nThe sample population was 1008 children, 256 of whom had a diagnosis placing them on the autism spectrum, and 752 of these children were not on the autism spectrum. The researchers used the vaccination records of the children to determine the amount of antigens to which the children had been exposed. Then, the children were subdivided into groups based on the amount of antigen received from birth to three months, birth to seven months, and birth to two years old.\n\nAfter analyzing the data, CDC scientists determined that the amount of antigens received over any of the time periods was not linked to the child’s risk of developing autism. Exposure to multiple vaccines on the same day also had no link to the development of autism disorders. Finally, the researchers looked at vaccination history and whether the child developed regressive autism, and, again, no link was found. The study data and results were published in the April 1, 2013, issue of the Journal Pediatrics.\n\nAgain, there is no link between autism and vaccinations.\n\nYet, in her op-ed McCarthy spun:\n\nMy beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother to question the “one size fits all” philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule. I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines.\n\nI believe in the importance of a vaccine program and I believe parents have the right to choose one poke per visit. I’ve never told anyone to not vaccinate.\n\nThis is the same person who panicked Americans by insisting: ""People are also dying from vaccinations."" What conclusion are people to make from that?\n\nIn July of 2013, veteran journalist and View co-host/co-creator Barbara Walters gushed over the newly-hired McCarthy: ""She can be serious and outrageous. She has connected with our audience and offers a fresh point of view. Jenny will be a great addition to the show as we usher in an exciting new chapter for The View.""\n\nWalters picked McCarthy, despite well-known views. Clearly, she doesn\'t have a problem with conspiracy theories. This is the woman who hired 9/11 truther Rosie O\'Donnell. Liberals often mock conservatives as anti-science. What does it say about a prominent ABC News journalist like Walters that she has now picked two anti-science conspiracy theorists?', 'View co-host Jenny McCarthy is now attempting to backtrack on her anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.\nIn 2004, a comprehensive review by the Institute of Medicine found no causal relationship between vaccines and autism.\nThe sample population was 1008 children, 256 of whom had a diagnosis placing them on the autism spectrum, and 752 of these children were not on the autism spectrum.\nJenny will be a great addition to the show as we usher in an exciting new chapter for The View.""\nWhat does it say about a prominent ABC News journalist like Walters that she has now picked two anti-science conspiracy theorists?']"

In a scathing editorial published by the Chicago Sun-Times, McCarthy denies the label “anti-vaccine” in describing the case-by-case consideration many choosy moms undertake for every inoculation, large or small.\n\nHowever, McCarthy’s Wikipedia page begs to differ. The biography continues to describe the co-host of ABC’s The View as an “anti-vaccine advocate.”\n\nIn the editorial, McCarthy wrote she’d been “wrongly branded” as an anti-vaccine activist. “I am not ‘anti-vaccine,\'” she wrote. “This is not a change in my stance, nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted.” McCarthy says Americans should question the “one size fits all” ethos of childhood immunizations, arguing that “vaccine injuries” are affecting a growing number of children in the developed world.\n\n""What happened to critical thinking? What happened to asking questions because every child is different?"" McCarthy wrote.\n\nMcCarthy first claimed her “beautiful son Evan” — perhaps the most wussified adolescent boy in America — had developed ASD after receiving childhood immunization shots. In 2008, she told CNN that although she wasn’t “anti-vaccine” she supported alternative vaccine schedules.\n\n""For my child, I asked for a schedule that would allow one shot per visit instead of the multiple shots they were and still are giving infants,” she told CNN in 2008. ""I believe in the importance of a vaccine program and I believe parents have the right to choose one poke per visit. I’ve never told anyone to not vaccinate, she said. ""I will continue to say what I have always said: One size does not fit all.” God help us all if gray is no longer an option.""\n\nYet “gray” is an option that continues to alarm epidemiologists who say the anti-vaccine movement has led to recent outbreaks in measles, an infectious disease eradicated from the United States and most of Western Europe. In 2011, a 22-year-old theater employee transmitted measles to at least four other people in New York City, two of whom had not been immunized against the disease.\n\nSimilar outbreaks in the U.S. and United Kingdom have occurred sporadically as global travelers return home with the infectious disease, among others. Though most of the population is vaccinated, small holes in “herd immunity” provide a disease reservoir threatening a significant portion of the human herd, as evidenced by a 2011 study. Even a relatively small vaccine failure rate of three to five percent would devastate a large American high school, says Robert Jacobson, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. As people age, they naturally lose immunity developed through childhood vaccinations, leaving an opening for disease. But “the most important ‘vaccine failure’ with measles happens when people refuse the vaccine in the first place,” he told Science magazine this month.\n\nThe “anti-vaccine” movement, promulgated by McCarthy and others, began with a now debunked article published in 1998 by The Lancet, whose author Tim Wakefield used faulty data to establish the supposed connection between ASD and the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine known as the MMR. Still, scientists cannot fully explain the rising prevalence of ASD in America, with as many as one in 88 children falling along the spectrum.\n\nSource: Rosen JB, Rota JS, Hickman CJ, Sowers S, Mercader S.

The autism activist, model, and comedic actress has been quoted numerous times questioning the safety of vaccinations, and is considered a leading anti-vaccination activist by the general public.\n\nIn an article published in the Chicago Sun Times, McCarthy refers to vaccinations as a ‘gray area’ and begins her article by saying she is not anti-vaccine.\n\nI believe in the importance of a vaccine program and I believe parents have the right to choose one poke per visit.

Or at least the right to ask questions?\n\nSponsored Links\n\n\n\nMcCarthy’s current stance on vaccinations is being heavily challenged by many.

115585,https://news.nationalpost.com/2014/04/14/sorry-jenny-mccarthy-you-totally-are-anti-vaccine/,health,"['COMMENT\n\nJenny McCarthy is claiming she is not anti-vaccine.\n\nHere’s the problem with that claim: Yes, she is. That’s patently obvious due to essentially everything she’s been saying about vaccines for years. Yet in an op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times on April 12, 2014, she tries to ignore all that, and wipe the record clean.\n\nIn case you think I may be misquoting her, here is the first line of that op-ed: “I am not ‘anti-vaccine.’”\n\nSo, there you go.\n\nShe says she’s never told anyone not to get vaccinated. Assuming that’s true, great! But that’s hardly the entry-level position for being anti-vax. For example, you can say things that are grossly incorrect about them that would scare parents into not vaccinating their children. That would fit the moniker “anti-vax,” I’d think.\n\nSo, for example, saying vaccines have toxins in them—as she has said for years, and as she reiterates in her op-ed—is a clear sign of being anti-vax. After all, if someone tells you you’re putting toxins in your body, that sounds awful, doesn’t it? Doesn’t that make you want to stop doing whatever it is that’s putting them inside you?\n\nYet as doctors say, dosage makes the poison. The amount of, say, formaldehyde in a typical vaccination is much less than you’d get eating an apple. The same can be shown for the other ingredients claimed to be toxins in vaccines as well. The truth is vaccines contain far too small a dose of any of these things to cause any of the problems McCarthy and other anti-vaxxers claim exist.\n\nAlso, botulinum is the single most lethal toxin known to humans. Yet McCarthy has enthusiastically praised injecting this toxin into her face. How can anyone possibly say that and also say vaccines have dangerous levels of toxins in them with a straight face?\n\nWhich brings us to autism. McCarthy is still claiming that there is a link between vaccines and autism. However that is simply not true. Again and again and again and again this has been shown. McCarthy asks us to talk to families of people who have children with autism. That’s certainly a good place to start, but it’s the first step to an answer, not the last. Anecdotes are not data. We know people are subject to dozens of different biases that lead them down the wrong path when trying to determine cause and effect. That’s why medical studies are done so carefully, to make sure we aren’t fooling ourselves. And the studies clearly show no connection between vaccines and autism.\n\nAnd finally, let’s take a step back and look at the claim that she’s not anti-vax itself. Jeffrey Kluger is a science writer for Time magazine. He interviewed McCarthy in 2009 about this issue, and she mentions that interview in her op-ed piece. Kluger disagrees vehemently with what she wrote in the op-ed, to say the very least.\n\nI can see why. Here is what she writes in the op-ed:\n\n“People have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines,” I told Time magazine science editor Jeffrey Kluger in 2009. “Please understand that we are not an anti-vaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins.”\n\nBut Kluger points out that she left the last line out of that quotation. Here’s the whole thing:\n\nPeople have the misconception that we want to eliminate vaccines. Please understand that we are not an antivaccine group. We are demanding safe vaccines. We want to reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins. If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f–king measles.\n\nHuh. That last line rather changes the tone of her position considerably, wouldn’t you agree? That’s a difficult stance to square with someone who is not anti-vaccine. As Kluger points out, her entire premise is false; since vaccines don’t cause autism, no one has to make the choice between measles (and other preventable, dangerous diseases) and autism.\n\nKluger finishes with this:\n\nJenny, as outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough continue to appear in the U.S.—most the result of parents refusing to vaccinate their children because of the scare stories passed around by anti-vaxxers like you—it’s just too late to play cute with the things you’ve said. You are either floridly, loudly, uninformedly antivaccine or you are the most grievously misunderstood celebrity of the modern era. Science almost always prefers the simple answer, because that’s the one that’s usually correct. Your quote trail is far too long—and you have been far too wrong—for the truth not to be obvious.\n\nHe’s right. She has gone on and on and on and on and on and on about it. She can claim all she wants that she’s not anti-vax, but her own words show her to be wrong.\n\nAnti-vax is as anti-vax does. And she does.', 'COMMENTJenny McCarthy is claiming she is not anti-vaccine.\nThe same can be shown for the other ingredients claimed to be toxins in vaccines as well.\nHow can anyone possibly say that and also say vaccines have dangerous levels of toxins in them with a straight face?\nMcCarthy is still claiming that there is a link between vaccines and autism.\nShe can claim all she wants that she’s not anti-vax, but her own words show her to be wrong.']"

No, this is a tactical retreat to a less outrageous anti-vaccine position, motivated by the total scientific and ethical collapse of the purported vaccine-autism link. Because despite her attempted whitewash of history, McCarthy is still effectively scaremongering about vaccines:\n\nI believe in the importance of a vaccine program and I believe parents have the right to choose one poke per visit.

But in many areas, there is no gray zone. Do vaccines cause autism? No... Do they overwhelm the immune system? No... She\'s conflating totally different things here... She asks if a sick kid should get vaccines. If they\'re not more than mildly ill, yes. Maybe if they\'d gotten the flu vaccine they wouldn\'t have the flu. She brings up immunocompromised kids, but they absolutely do get considered differently already. No decent physician would not consider a child\'s individual medical history. Same with those kids with a history of adverse reactions. We consent people for vaccines, and ask if they\'ve had bad reactions before.\n\nAnd no one, absolutely no physician I know, refuses to answer the questions of parents. [The Incidental Economist]\n\nYet again, she\'s been sowing scientific controversy where there is none. Sorry we hurt your feelings, Jenny, but lives are literally at stake here.

The biotech selloff, which started late last month, resurfaced late last week, with the NYSE ARCA Biotech Index (^BTK) dropping 6% on Apr 10. The Nasdaq suffered its largest decline in two and half years. Other major indices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), too registered steep declines on that day, driven by the biotech selloff.\n\nThe negative momentum from the Thursday sell-off continued on Friday with major indices falling on the last day of the week. Big names in the biotech sector like Alexion Pharmaceuticals ( ALXN ) and Biogen Idec ( BIIB ) dragged the biotech index down.\n\nAmidst the second round of biotech selloff, Gilead Sciences ( GILD ) gained on Friday mainly due to a report in the Reuters that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (THHSC), which oversees Medicaid, has agreed to reconsider its initial strict recommendation to Medicaid pertaining to the company's potential blockbuster hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Sovaldi.\n\nThe THHSC had initially recommended that the use of Sovaldi should be restricted to treat only the sickest HCV patients (with advanced stages of liver damage). The recommendation was due to the high price tag associated with Sovaldi in the U.S. ($84,000 for a 12-week treatment period). The THHSC agreed to reconsider its recommendation after consultations with outside advisors on the issue. Following the move by the THHSC, plans to initiate offering coverage from July have been put on hold.\n\nThe THHSC move caused Gilead to gain almost 4% in early trading on Apr 11. However, most of the gains were eaten away during the course of the day and each share of Gilead gained 0.84% at the end of the trading session to close at $66.03.\n\nSovaldi's High Price Triggered Initial selloff\n\nSovaldi was approved in the U.S. in early December last year, as a combination therapy for treating patients suffering from HCV. While the drug's benefits are unquestioned it is the pricing which has attracted criticism. Since HCV is more prevalent in the low-income strata of the society, Gilead's pricing policy has attracted severe criticism from all quarters. The first major attack on the price of Sovaldi came from U.S. lawmakers with the Congress' Committee on Energy and Commerce shooting off a letter last month to the company raising concerns about the pricing of the drug. It was this letter which triggered off the initial round of biotech selloff.\n\nPricing Concerns Overdone?\n\nWe believe that the furor surrounding Sovaldi's pricing is overdone. The drug is off to a strong start with robust sales expected in the first quarter of 2014, its first full quarter in the market. Gilead will report first quarter results later this month. Sovaldi, with its high cure rates, a short treatment period and reduction/elimination of the need for interferon injections, has the potential to change the treatment paradigm in the HCV space. Strong first quarter sales could go a long way in justifying its high price tag.\n\nMoreover, Gilead is looking to get its next HCV treatment, a fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and Sovaldi, approved in the U.S. The FDA will decide on the approval status of this cocktail treatment by Oct 10.

The biotech selloff, which started late last month, resurfaced late last week, with the NYSE ARCA Biotech Index (^BTK) dropping 6% on Apr 10. The Nasdaq suffered its largest decline in two and half years. Other major indices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), too registered steep declines on that day, driven by the biotech selloff.\n\n\n\nThe negative momentum from the Thursday sell-off continued on Friday with major indices falling on the last day of the week. Big names in the biotech sector like Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Biogen Idec (BIIB) dragged the biotech index down.\n\n\n\nAmidst the second round of biotech selloff, Gilead Sciences (GILD) gained on Friday mainly due to a report in the Reuters that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (:THHSC), which oversees Medicaid, has agreed to reconsider its initial strict recommendation to Medicaid pertaining to the company’s potential blockbuster hepatitis C virus (:HCV) treatment, Sovaldi.\n\n\n\nThe THHSC had initially recommended that the use of Sovaldi should be restricted to treat only the sickest HCV patients (with advanced stages of liver damage). The recommendation was due to the high price tag associated with Sovaldi in the U.S. ($84,000 for a 12-week treatment period). The THHSC agreed to reconsider its recommendation after consultations with outside advisors on the issue. Following the move by the THHSC, plans to initiate offering coverage from July have been put on hold.\n\n\n\nThe THHSC move caused Gilead to gain almost 4% in early trading on Apr 11. However, most of the gains were eaten away during the course of the day and each share of Gilead gained 0.84% at the end of the trading session to close at $66.03.\n\n\n\nSovaldi’s High Price Triggered Initial selloff\n\n\n\nSovaldi was approved in the U.S. in early December last year, as a combination therapy for treating patients suffering from HCV. While the drug’s benefits are unquestioned it is the pricing which has attracted criticism. Since HCV is more prevalent in the low-income strata of the society, Gilead’s pricing policy has attracted severe criticism from all quarters. The first major attack on the price of Sovaldi came from U.S. lawmakers with the Congress’ Committee on Energy and Commerce shooting off a letter last month to the company raising concerns about the pricing of the drug. It was this letter which triggered off the initial round of biotech selloff.\n\n\n\nPricing Concerns Overdone?\n\n\n\nWe believe that the furor surrounding Sovaldi’s pricing is overdone. The drug is off to a strong start with robust sales expected in the first quarter of 2014, its first full quarter in the market. Gilead will report first quarter results later this month. Sovaldi, with its high cure rates, a short treatment period and reduction/elimination of the need for interferon injections, has the potential to change the treatment paradigm in the HCV space. Strong first quarter sales could go a long way in justifying its high price tag.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Gilead is looking to get its next HCV treatment, a fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and Sovaldi, approved in the U.S. The FDA will decide on the approval status of this cocktail treatment by Oct 10. The cocktail treatment is under review in the EU.

It was published in “Pediatrics,” the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Read entire study here (pdf).\n\nConsistent with most previous human and animal studies on the question, researchers concluded in this latest study that so-called SSRI antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) – including virtually all major antidepressant brands, like Prozac, Paxil, Luvox, Zoloft and Celexa – appear to constitute a significant risk factor for autism spectrum disorders, or ASDs, particularly in male children.\n\nThe reported link between antidepressant use and autism is an urgent concern because both trends have skyrocketed in recent years, starting at about the same time:\n\nTRENDING: Strzok outed Hillary\'s abuse of secret information!\n\nAccording to the latest statistics from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 68 American children now has some form of autism.\n\nAt the same time, 11 percent of all Americans 12-and-over are taking SSRI antidepressants, including an astonishing 23 percent – almost one in four – of women in their 40s and 50s, and between 7 and 13 percent of all pregnant women in the U.S.\n\nNoting that ""Prenatal SSRI use was recently associated with autism,” the researchers, echoing earlier studies, write, ""Serotonin is critical in early brain development, creating concerns regarding prenatal exposure to factors influencing serotonin levels, like [SSRIs].""\n\nThe investigators looked for associations between prenatal antidepressant use and the likelihood of autism spectrum disorders, as well as other developmental delays, in children from a group of 966 mother-child pairs, who had been enrolled in the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment, or CHARGE, study.\n\nThe results, while confirming previous research, also arrived at an eye-opening new conclusion: The SSRI-autism risk appears to be much greater with boys.\n\nSpecifically, the research team determined that male children with autism disorders were almost three times as likely to have experienced prenatal exposure to antidepressants, when compared with boys with normal development. The finding regarding autistic boys was even more pronounced if their exposure to SSRIs occurred during the first trimester of pregnancy, when the developing child\'s brain is considered most vulnerable.\n\nTo clearly explain the real-world implications of this new research, WND spoke to Adam C. Urato, M.D., a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass.\n\n“What is interesting about this study is that they analyzed the effects in boys and girls separately and found that it was the boys who had increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and developmental delays,” Urato told WND. “This finding is exactly what several of the animal studies have predicted – that male offspring have more neurobehavioral injury when exposed to SSRIs during development.”\n\nUrato also makes the point that the reported risk was not small, but very significant: “For autism spectrum disorder in boys, first trimester SSRI exposure was associated with more than a 300 percent increased risk (OR 3.22). For developmental delay (DD) third-trimester SSRI exposure was associated with almost a 500 percent increased risk (OR 4.98).”\n\nSummarizing the research to date, Urato said: “This paper adds to the mounting evidence from animal and human studies that the SSRI antidepressants when used in pregnancy are associated with neurobehavioral changes like autism and developmental delay in the exposed children. These antidepressant drugs are chemical compounds and we need to keep that in mind. From thalidomide to DES to cigarettes, history has taught us that exposing pregnant women to potentially toxic chemicals can lead to disastrous results.”\n\nSo, what should pregnant women experiencing depression do?\n\n“Depressed pregnant women should not be ignored,” Urato said. “They need good treatment and care, but the key issue is how to treat them.”\n\nFor instance, there is a great deal of scientific evidence, notes Urato, that “non-drug approaches to depression, such as psychotherapy and exercise, are as good or better for the treatment of depression in many women. This fact, along with all of the pregnancy complications associated with SSRIs (for example, miscarriage, birth defects, preterm birth, and long-term problems like autism) should lead us to prioritize and emphasize the non-drug approaches to depression as a first-line approach.”\n\nRead WND’s previous, in-depth coverage of all previous studies: “Research confirms antidepressant-autism link”', 'A major new study released Monday finds that pregnant woman taking antidepressants are significantly at risk for giving birth to children with autism – especially if the baby is a boy.\nIt was published in “Pediatrics,” the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nThe results, while confirming previous research, also arrived at an eye-opening new conclusion: The SSRI-autism risk appears to be much greater with boys.\nSpecifically, the research team determined that male children with autism disorders were almost three times as likely to have experienced prenatal exposure to antidepressants, when compared with boys with normal development.\n“What is interesting about this study is that they analyzed the effects in boys and girls separately and found that it was the boys who had increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and developmental delays,” Urato told WND.']"

The children ranged in age from 2 to 5. A majority of the children in each category were boys — 82.5 percent of those with ASD, 65.6 percent with DD and 85.6 percent TD.\n\nWhile the study included girls, the substantially stronger effect in boys suggests a possible gender difference in the effect of prenatal SSRI exposure, the authors said.\n\n“We found prenatal SSRI exposure was nearly three times as likely in boys with ASD relative to those with typical development, with the greatest risk occurring when exposure took place during the first trimester,” said Li-Ching Lee, psychiatric epidemiologist in the Bloomberg School’s Department of Epidemiology. “SSRIs also were elevated among boys with developmental delay, with the strongest exposure effect in the third trimester.”\n\nAccording to statistics recently released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1 in 68 U.S. children are diagnosed with ASD. The condition is almost five times more commonplace among boys than girls. The researchers caution that while there has been a co-occurring increase in the use SSRIs, it likely is not a significant contributor to the increase in the prevalence of autism.\n\n“Because of low rates of SSRI use during pregnancy and possible co-existing factors influencing susceptibility to ASD from SSRI exposure, any contribution of these medications to the increase in the prevalence of ASDs likely is minimal,” Lee said.\n\nMaternal depression carries its own risks to the fetus, so that the benefits of using SSRIs during pregnancy should be weighed carefully against any potential harm, the authors noted. They also noted that large sample studies are needed to investigate the effects in girls with ASD.\n\nThe study’s limitations include the difficulty of isolating SSRIs’ effects from those of their indications for use; lack of information on SSRI dosage precluding dose-response analyses, and the relatively small sample of children with developmental delay resulting in imprecise estimates of association.\n\nThe study’s authors include Rebecca A.

The risk of ASD was highest among those mothers who used SSRIs in the first trimester.\n\nEvidence Rating Level: 3 (Average)\n\nStudy Rundown: SSRIs can cross the placenta to increase serotonin levels in the fetus and affect early brain development. Increased serum serotonin has been found in children with autism, a disorder that continues to rise in prevalence and currently affects 1/68 children.1 This study examined mothers’ prenatal SSRI use and the developmental status of their children (autism spectrum disorder [ASD], developmental delay [DD], or typical development [TD]). Prenatal exposure to SSRIs was nearly three-fold higher in boys with ASD compared to those with TD; this association was highest with SSRI use in the first trimester. Boys with DD also had increased exposure to SSRIs compared to those with TD, especially with use in the third trimester. This study was limited by recall bias and the inability to separate the effect of SSRIs from indication for use. Though prenatal SSRI use may increase risks of ASD or DD, untreated psychiatric conditions also hold significant risks for the fetus.\n\nClick to read the study published today in Pediatrics\n\n\n\nRelevant Reading: Parental depression, maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy, and risk of autism spectrum disorders: population based case-control study.\n\nIn-Depth [case-control study]: A total of 966 mother-child pairs (492 ASD, 154 DD, and 320 TD) from the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) Study were examined.

Validated tools confirmed diagnoses of ASD (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised [ADI-R], Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [ADOS]) and DD (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Mullen Scales of Early Learning). Controls were screened for both DD and ASD. Forty-eight (5%) mothers self-reported SSRI use during pregnancy. When stratified by gender, boys with ASD had significantly higher exposure to prenatal SSRIs compared to boys with TD (adjusted odds radio [aOR]: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.07-7.93).

They also provide a scientific basis for suggesting that diet may play an important role in situations where people spend time together, whether at home, in schools or in prisons.\n\n""People can relate to this that when they get hungry, they get cranky. We found that being \'hangry\' – hungry and angry – can affect our behaviour in a bad way, even in our most intimate relationships,"" said Professor Brad Bushman of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe three-year study involved 107 married couples, who were assessed for their general relationship satisfaction in order to see how happy they were with one another overall.\n\nOver a period of 21 days, each couple monitored their blood glucose levels in the morning and evening and were given a voodoo doll and 51 pins, which they were supposed to stick in the doll when they were on their own, depending on how angry they felt towards their spouse.\n\nThe study, published in the journal \'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\', showed a clear link between low levels of blood glucose and the number of pins a spouse stuck into the voodoo doll, Professor Bushman said.\n\n""Even those who reported they had good relationships with their spouses were more likely to express anger if their blood glucose levels were lower,"" he said.\n\nIn a second experiment after the 21-day period, the couples took part in a laboratory test where they played a computer game against their partner, allowing the winner to blast their spouse with a loud noise through headphones.\n\nBLOOD\n\nIn fact, the scientists had arranged it so that each individual played against a computer rather than their spouse without their knowing it, so that they were sure to lose about half the games they played.\n\nAgain, when blood sugar levels fell, individuals were more likely to give longer and louder blasts of noise than when sugar levels were higher.\n\nComparing the first and second part of the study, the scientists also found that those people who stuck more pins in the dolls were more likely to show real aggression as louder and longer noises.\n\nProfessor Bushman suggested that the effect could be explained by the energy needed to maintain the self-control to overcome aggression.

Married couples represent as a perfect real-world extension.""\n\nTo test their theories, researchers rolled out some unique strategies - using voodoo dolls and a computer game.\n\nEach night, couples measured their aggression toward one another by placing needles, up to 51, in small voodoo dolls, meant to represent their spouse. Later, at the end of 21-day study, couples then competed against one another in a computer game, with the victors winning the opportunity to ""blast"" their partners with obnoxious noises, such as fingernails on a chalkboard or a dentist\'s drill.\n\nBoth of these phases of the study proved a single point: When a person\'s blood sugar is lower than normal, they were more likely to act aggressively. It was at these times that the voodoo dolls got stuck the most and their partners were subjected to the loudest blasts of noise.\n\nAccording to Bushman, this result is exactly what past research has predicted. When your blood sugar is lower than its set baseline, your ability to curb negative emotions is impaired. So universal is the phenomenon that it has even entered the vernacular as its own term: ""hangry."" This type of hunger-induced anger has recently been popularized in candy bar commercials and popular sitcoms as well.\n\nDr. Nathan DeWall, professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky and one of the study\'s researchers, said the study demonstrates how self-control requires energy - energy that is in short supply when we are famished.\n\n""Self-control, impulse control uses energy, both mental and physical,"" DeWall said. ""When we deplete that energy, we have a higher tendency of doing things we regret, such as hurting our loved ones.""\n\nRelationship experts not involved with the study said it demonstrates how crucially hunger can affect our emotions.\n\n""Hunger is one of many external forces that play a part in frustration and temperament,"" said Dr. Scott Weltzer, vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center and the director of its Supporting Healthy Relationships program. He added that this phenomenon is often even more evident in close relationships, such as those between married couples.\n\n""Marital tension is analogous to a taught rubber band, and hunger can be the force that causes it to snap,"" he said. ""We are all less inhibited around our loved ones and more likely to lash out at home than we are in the workplace.""\n\nDoctor\'s Take\n\nClearly if your marriage is defined by aggression, a chocolate chip cookie is not going to solve all of your problems. But what this study reinforces is that there may be something to the idea that an empty stomach can lead to occasional marital strife - and that maintaining healthy blood sugar levels may indeed help us curb our aggression toward the ones we love.\n\nSo what\'s the best way to replenish your control and decrease the odds of a quarrel?\n\nRefined carbohydrates in sugary treats may not be the answer; such foods lead to quick sugar spikes and may actually worsen your chance at peace. Rather, options such as fruits and whole grains are a healthier way to keep blood sugar out of the ""hangry"" zone.\n\nBushman\'s recommendation: ""If you have a sensitive topic to discuss, it\'s best done over dinner.""', '""The lower your blood sugar, the lower your ability to control your aggression.\nMarried couples represent as a perfect real-world extension.""\nWhen your blood sugar is lower than its set baseline, your ability to curb negative emotions is impaired.\nHe added that this phenomenon is often even more evident in close relationships, such as those between married couples.\nRather, options such as fruits and whole grains are a healthier way to keep blood sugar out of the ""hangry"" zone.']"

So in their latest study, Bushman and colleagues studied interactions between married couples in their own home, over a much longer time frame.\n\nFor 21 days, 107 couples had their blood glucose tested daily and just before each glucose test they got the opportunity to express aggression towards their spouse.\n\nThey were given a voodoo doll that represented their spouse and told they could stick up to 51 pins in the doll, depending on how angry they felt with their other half.\n\n""People with lower glucose stabbed more pins in the doll than people with higher glucose,"" says Bushman.\n\nPeople whose glucose levels were in the lowest 25 per cent put over twice as many pins in the doll as people whose glucose levels were in the top 25 per cent.\n\nLoud noises\n\nAfter the 21 days, the couples then took part in a lab experiment in which they competed with their spouse in a computer game - they had to see who could press a button fastest when a target square turned red.\n\nThe winner of each of the 25 trials was once again given an opportunity to express their aggression towards their partner.\n\nThis time, they were allowed to blast the losing spouse with up to 5 seconds of an extremely unpleasant noise up to 105 decibels loud. The noise was the combined sound of a smoke alarm, dentist\'s drill and fingernails scratching down a blackboard.\n\nThe researchers found people\'s average glucose level - calculated from the 21-day study - had an influence on what happened.\n\n""People with low glucose gave their spouse louder and longer noise blasts,"" says Bushman.\n\nHe says the study controlled for relationship quality.\n\n""Hungry people are cranky and aggressive even if they have a good relationship with their spouse,"" says Bushman.\n\nSuspicious transactions\n\nThe study had its challenges including getting participants to agree to prick themselves for glucose testing twice a day.\n\nBushman says he also got a phone call from his credit card company after he bought some key experimental equipment.\n\n""I got a telephone call and they said \'We\'ve never seen anyone spend $5000 on voodoo dolls before so we were a little suspicious and though we might check it out,"" says Bushman, who won an Ig Nobel prize last year for a study that showed people think they are more attractive when drinking alcohol.\n\nBut the study, funded by the National Science Foundation, has a serious side.\n\n""I think the implications are pretty broad,"" says Bushman.\n\n""What we eat is related to our angry feelings and aggressive behaviours towards our most intimate partners.""\n\nBushman\'s recommendation: ""If I was going to have a serious discussion with my spouse, I\'d make sure I wasn\'t hungry first.""', 'News in ScienceVoodoo dolls shed light on domestic spatsGlucose low Having low blood glucose means you are more likely to stick pins in a voodoo doll that represents your spouse, a new study suggests.\nVoodoo doll experimentBushman and colleagues previously showed that glucose was linked to control of anger in a short-term lab experiment involving interactions between strangers.\nThey were given a voodoo doll that represented their spouse and told they could stick up to 51 pins in the doll, depending on how angry they felt with their other half.\n""People with lower glucose stabbed more pins in the doll than people with higher glucose,"" says Bushman.\n""People with low glucose gave their spouse louder and longer noise blasts,"" says Bushman.']"

Well, a lot, as it turns out—but you may also want to ask, ""What’s glucose got to do with it?"" A new study of married couples finds that lower levels of blood glucose may make married people both angrier at their spouses and more aggressive toward them.\n\nThe study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, looked at 107 married couples married 12 or more years.\n\nUsing \'Voodoo Dolls\' to Represent Spouses\n\nAt the onset of the study, the couples completed a survey that measured relationship satisfaction.\n\nThe research, which was conducted in people’s homes, required that each spouse measure glucose levels with a blood glucose monitor. Readings were taken before breakfast and every evening before bed, for 21 days.\n\nRelated News: The Key to a Happy Marriage May Lie in Your Genes »\n\nEach participant in the study was given a voodoo doll, which they were told represented their spouse, along with 51 pins. At the end of each day, participants inserted between 0 and 51 pins in the doll, depending on how angry they were with their mate.\n\nThe researchers found that participants with low blood glucose stuck more pins into the dolls. Study results suggest that low glucose levels may decrease a person\'s ability to control emotions such as aggression. “We found that being \'hangry\' [a combination of \'hungry\' and \'angry\'] can affect our behavior in a bad way, even in our most intimate relationships. Even those who reported they had good relationships with their spouses were more likely to express anger if their blood glucose levels were lower. We found a clear link between aggressive impulses as seen with the dolls and actual aggressive behavior,” said lead author Brad J. Bushman, Ph.D., professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University.\n\nFollowing the 21-day study, participants played a game in which they were told they would play against their spouse. The winner of each of the 25 trials could control the volume and duration of a loud, harsh sound to be delivered to the loser. (The opponent was a computer; spouses did hear noise in half the trials.)\n\nParticipants with lower average levels of evening glucose delivered louder and more prolonged noises to their spouse, even after controlling for relationship satisfaction and differences between men and women, according to the study.\n\nLearn How Extra Pounds Can Destroy Your Love Life »\n\nFood for the Brain\n\nBushman told Healthline, “Our brain is less than 2 percent of our body weight, but it consumes about 20 percent of our calories. It demands a lot of energy, which it gets from the foods we eat.”\n\nHe added, “Glucose is the food that the brain requires in order to exercise self-control. By far, the emotion that is the most difficult for people to control is anger. The area behind the forehead, the prefrontal cortex, is in charge of executing functions, such as controlling emotions. It demands a lot of energy to control your emotions.”\n\nAccording to Bushman, this energy can be depleted over time, leading to an erosion of self-control. Aggressive impulses, sometimes directed at a spouse, may emerge as failures of self-control.\n\nJulia Samton, M.D., board certified in psychiatry and neurology, and director of Manhattan Neuropsychiatric, in New York, told Healthline, “When our blood sugar is low our body treats it as a crisis. Our adrenal glands get stimulated, and they send out a number of hormones and communicate to our entire body and brain that we are in crisis. We get more irritable, more hostile, and anxious. Hormones are very powerful chemicals.”\n\nGet the Facts: 7 Foods That Can Enhance Your Sex Life »\n\nNo Surprise: Fatigue and Drinking Alcohol Don\'t Help\n\n\n\nSamton said that fatigue and drinking alcohol may also be to blame. “When we are tired, we have lower frustration tolerance and it can be more difficult to take things in stride. Sometimes if we’ve had too much to drink, we might be less inhibited and say things that we may be feeling that we might not necessarily articulate.”\n\nCommenting on Bushman’s findings, Allison Rumsey, RD, CDN, CNSC, CSCS, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the New York State Dietetic Association, told Healthline that when blood sugar is low, it can cause an imbalance of several hormones in our body that regulate both mood and appetite. “Anger and frustration are common responses to low blood sugar. Blood sugar has to drop pretty low for this to happen, and generally takes several hours of not eating.”\n\nEmphasizing that some people are more prone to having low blood sugar than others and that these people are likely to have more severe symptoms, Rumsey said that anger, as a result of hunger, is also partly based on personality.\n\nDon\'t Be \'Hangry\'\n\nAbout coining the word ""hangry,"" Bushman said, “Hungry people tend to be angry. Blood glucose levels can be brought up most quickly by eating carbohydrates or sugary foods.” Emphasizing that he doesn’t advocate eating a lot of candy bars even though they raise glucose fast, Bushman said, “A better way to raise glucose is by eating protein, such as protein bars and protein drinks, and eating vegetables. These foods will take longer to raise glucose, but glucose will remain elevated longer.”\n\nRumsey advised that in order to keep blood sugar stable and ward off feeling ""hangry,"" a combination of protein and carbs should be consumed every three to four hours. “This could be something as simple as carrots, hummus, peanut butter, banana, cheese, or whole-grain crackers,” Rumsey advised.\n\n“It’s simple advice, but it works,"" Bushman said. ""Before you have a difficult conversation with your spouse, make sure you’re not hungry.”', ""The research, which was conducted in people’s homes, required that each spouse measure glucose levels with a blood glucose monitor.\nThe researchers found that participants with low blood glucose stuck more pins into the dolls.\nStudy results suggest that low glucose levels may decrease a person's ability to control emotions such as aggression.\nEven those who reported they had good relationships with their spouses were more likely to express anger if their blood glucose levels were lower.\n“Anger and frustration are common responses to low blood sugar.""]"

Beatrice and Benedick battled over friends, Elizabeth and Mr Darcy over etiquette, and Punch and Judy over a baby (and sausages). But a study led by Brad Bushman of Ohio State University, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that had these pugnacious partners eaten more, their aggressive tendencies might have been lower.\n\nDr Bushman looked at 107 heterosexual couples who had been married for 12 years on average, and searched for correlations between the levels of glucose in his volunteers’ bloodstreams and their affection (or lack of it) for their spouses. To do this, he and his team first asked that participants rate their spousal relations, to provide a baseline, and then monitored their blood sugar morning and evening for three weeks, while getting them to perform two revealing tasks.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nThe first, which each participant had to do every evening, was to stick pins in a doll he or she had been told represented his or her spouse. Up to 51 pins were available. The second, performed once, at the end of the experiment, was a computer game which participants were told they were playing against their spouses. (In fact, they were playing against the machine.) They were also told that if they won a round of this game, their prize was to be able to torment their partner with an unpleasant noise such as fingernails scratching a blackboard or the scream of an ambulance siren at a volume and duration of their choosing—and their choices were recorded.\n\nBoth tasks showed that blood-sugar levels do indeed help regulate marital annoyance. Most couples were not particularly punitive towards each other when it came to voodoo pin-sticking: the average number of pins stuck per night was 1.35, with the full 51 going in on only three occasions. But for any given individual the number of pins he or she (and women used more pins than men) stuck in the doll of an evening was correlated with his or her blood-sugar level that day. Similarly, those with low average blood-sugar levels over the three weeks of the experiment chose longer and louder punishment sounds for their spouses than those with high levels.\n\nBlood-sugar levels and tolerance for one’s better half’s irritating foibles do, then, seem to be correlated. That does not prove causation—particularly in the case of the noise test, where higher or lower glucose levels over an extended period might be a reflection of something else significant and pertinent about the person in question.

At the end of each day, participants were allowed to use anywhere from 0 to 51 pins to express the amount of anger they were feeling toward their life partners.\n\nAll along, participants\' fluctuating blood sugar levels were measured.

One psychologist thinks it might have to do with blood sugar. But the weird part is how he arrived at that idea.\n\nPsychologist Brad Bushman, with Ohio State University at Columbus, studies the role of blood sugar levels in behavior. A few years ago, he hypothesized that low glucose levels in the blood might be causing spouses to behave more ""aggressively"" toward each other. The question is, how do you measure the relationship between a person\'s blood glucose levels and anger levels directed at a spouse?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Science, Gisela Telis writes:\n\n[Bushman] and colleagues at the University of Kentucky and the University of North Carolina recruited 107 married couples and equipped them with blood glucose meters, voodoo dolls, and 51 pins to record their glucose and anger levels over time. For 21 days, the couples used the meters to measure their glucose levels each morning before breakfast and each evening before bed. They also assessed how angry they were at their spouse at the end of each day, by recording how many of the 51 pins they stuck into their voodoo dolls just before bed when their partner wasn\'t looking. After 21 days, the couples were invited into the lab. There, they played a computer game that allowed them to blast their spouse with an unpleasant noise—a mixture of fingernails scratching a chalkboard, ambulance sirens, and dentist drills—as loudly and for as long as he or she wanted, as a proxy for their willingness to act aggressively and make their partner suffer.\n\nWhat they found, according to Telis, is that ""spouses with lower evening glucose levels showed more anger and aggression toward their partners."" People who scored in the lowest 25th percentile of glucose levels stuck roughly twice as many pins in their voodoo dolls as those in the upper 25th percentile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis seems like a really bizarre proxy for anger. First of all, as one expert noted in the Science article, it\'s hard to say what these glucose levels mean without knowing what caused them. For example, alcohol can lower glucose levels but also raise aggression levels too. But the study didn\'t ask the subjects what they had been eating and drinking. Second of all, is sticking pins in a doll or secretly desiring to blast somebody with noise really a good proxy for ""anger""? It sounds more like a proxy for wanting somebody to suffer, which isn\'t quite the same thing.\n\nAlso, it would have been interesting to find out whether these urges to make the spouse suffer were related to things the spouse had done, or were simply part of an overall rise in aggression caused by blood sugar levels. Presumably glucose levels would affect one\'s outlook on everyone, not just a spouse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\'d like to try part of this experiment at home, here\'s the noise that subjects blasted at their partners.

We found that being 'hangry’ – hungry and angry – can affect our behaviour in a bad way, even in our most intimate relationships,” said Professor Brad Bushman of Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nThe three-year study involved 107 married couples who were assessed for their general relationship satisfaction in order to see how happy there were with one another overall.\n\nOver a period of 21 days, each couple monitored their blood glucose levels in the morning and evening and were given a voodoo doll and 51 pins, which they were supposed to stick in the doll when they were on their own depending on how angry they felt towards their spouse.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed a clear link between low levels of blood glucose and the number of pins that a spouse is likely to stick into the voodoo doll representing their partners, Professor Bushman said.\n\n“When they had lower blood glucose, they felt angrier and took it out on the dolls representing their spouse.

It could prevent major fights between husbands and wives, at least if a new study that used voodoo dolls is right.\n\nThat’s because low blood sugar can make spouses touchy, researchers propose.\n\nIn fact, it can make them “hangry,” a combination of hungry and angry, said Ohio State University psychology researcher Brad Bushman.\n\n“We need glucose for self-control,” said Bushman, lead author of the study, which was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Anger is the emotion that most people have difficulty controlling.”\n\nREAD MORE: Self-control is within our reach, even when we’re tired, scientists say\n\nThe researchers studied 107 married couples for three weeks.

That indicated levels of aggression.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe researchers found that the lower the blood sugar levels, the more pins were pushed into the doll.\n\nIn fact, people with the lowest scores pushed in twice as many pins as those with the highest blood sugar levels, the researchers said.\n\nThe study also found that the spouses were generally not angry at each other. About 70 per cent of the time, people didn’t put any pins in the doll, said study co-author Richard Pond Jr. at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The average for the whole study was a bit more than one pin a night per person.\n\nREAD MORE: 10 health and nutrition stories of the year\n\nThree people put all 51 pins in at one time – and one person did that twice – Pond said.\n\nHe said there’s a good physical reason to link eating to behaviour: The brain, which is only 2 per cent of the body weight, consumes 20 per cent of our calories.\n\nBushman said eating a candy bar might be a good idea if spouses are about to discuss something touchy, but that fruits and vegetables as a better long-term strategy for keeping blood sugar levels up.\n\nOutside experts gave the study, funded by the National Science Foundation, mixed reviews.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nREAD MORE: Cartoon characters key to influencing kids to eat healthier, studies show\n\nChris Beedie, who teaches psychology at the Aberystwyth University in Britain, said he thought the study’s method was flawed and that his own work disagrees with Bushman’s conclusions.

Your normally cheerful spouse has suddenly, and inexplicably, turned cranky and an otherwise pleasant day is fast becoming a scene from “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf.”\n\nWhen you see those storm clouds gathering in your significant other’s eyes, you might do well to give them some carbohydrates -- and fast.\n\nAt least that’s the advice of a team of researchers who examined the connection between low blood sugar levels and aggression in married couples.\n\nThe paper, which was published Monday in PNAS, found that when blood glucose levels dropped, spouses were far more likely to stick pins into voodoo dolls representing their mates. They were also more likely to blast loud noises into earphones strapped to their mate’s head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors argue that loss of self-control is a contributing factor to aggression between intimate partners, and that self-control is linked to nutrition.\n\n“Self-control requires energy, and that energy is provided in part by glucose,” wrote lead study author Brad Bushman, a professor of communication and psychology at Ohio State University.\n\n“Glucose is made from nutritious intake that becomes converted into neurotransmitters that provide energy for brain processes. Low glucose levels can undermine self-control because people have insufficient energy to overcome challenges and unwanted impulses,” wrote Bushman and his colleagues.\n\nThe authors described the phenomenon of lashing out aggressively due to hunger with the slang term “hanger.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo test their hypothesis, authors studied 107 married couples.\n\nFor three weeks, the spouses’ glucose levels were checked in the morning, before breakfast, and in the evening, before bed. They were also asked to perform a unique task at the end of the day, and to record the results.\n\n“To obtain daily measures of aggressive inclinations toward their partner, each participant received a voodoo doll along with 51 pins and was told: ‘This doll represents your spouse. At the end of each day ... insert between 0 and 51 pins in the doll, depending how angry you are with your spouse,” the authors wrote.\n\nThen, at the end of 21 days, they played a “game” in the lab that was designed to measure aggressive behavior.\n\n“Participants were told that they would compete with their spouse to see who could press a button faster when a target square turned red on the computer, and that the winner on each trial could blast the loser with loud noise through headphones,” authors wrote.\n\nThe noises, they were told, included recordings of fingernails scratching a chalkboard, a dentist’s drill and an ambulance siren. A volume dial allowed the punishment-inflicting spouses to choose between silence and a raucous 105 decibels. They could also adjust the duration of the punishment -- from half a second to five seconds, they were told\n\nIn reality, the game, and the punishment, were a sham.\n\nInstead of competing against each other, the spouses were playing the computer in a rigged outcome. Also, they weren’t blasting their partners’ ears. Because they were seated in separate rooms, they could not tell it was all a ruse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, lower glucose levels translated to more pins stuck in the doll and longer, more intense noise settings, authors wrote.\n\n“Results suggest that interventions designed to provide individuals with metabolic energy might foster more harmonious couple interactions,” the authors concluded.\n\nFood, they wrote, might also be of use in aggressive situations that did not involve spouses.\n\n“Food could be a potential tool for curbing aggression by bolstering resources for effective self-control. This intervention might be especially important in stressful settings in which aggression might erupt, such as in prisons, psychiatric hospitals and schools.”', 'The paper, which was published Monday in PNAS, found that when blood glucose levels dropped, spouses were far more likely to stick pins into voodoo dolls representing their mates.\nLow glucose levels can undermine self-control because people have insufficient energy to overcome challenges and unwanted impulses,” wrote Bushman and his colleagues.\nFor three weeks, the spouses’ glucose levels were checked in the morning, before breakfast, and in the evening, before bed.\nAt the end of each day ... insert between 0 and 51 pins in the doll, depending how angry you are with your spouse,” the authors wrote.\nAdvertisementNonetheless, lower glucose levels translated to more pins stuck in the doll and longer, more intense noise settings, authors wrote.']"

Durbin, Illinois Democrat, said Monday. “The report we’re releasing today makes it clear e-cigarettes have made a concerted effort to market to children.”\n\nE-cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes, but work by heating up liquid nicotine into an aerosol rather than burning tobacco. The FDA regulates the sale and marketing of tobacco products such as cigarettes and chewing tobacco but has not yet released a rule governing electronic cigarettes.\n\nEonsmoke, one of the companies included in the report, said it is taking the report seriously and will look at other ways to make sure minors do not buy its e-cigarettes, but that it already does its best to keep its product out of children’s hands.\n\n“Eonsmoke, as a brand, self-regulates by incorporating numerous warning labels on its marketing material and products,” Eonsmoke CEO Michael Tolmach said in a statement. “We offer flavors other than tobacco because adult smokers prefer variety such as they do in other adult products such as alcohol or coffee, not because we’re aiming marketing towards minors.”\n\nMr. Durbin called e-cigarettes a “gateway” to tobacco addiction and said it’s “common sense” that minors who smoke e-cigarettes will be more likely to make the jump to traditional cigarettes.\n\nSupporters of e-cigarettes, however, say there is no evidence to support the senator’s claim, and that many people use e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking, not a stepping stone to tobacco.\n\n“Senator Durbin’s opinion that it is ‘common sense’ that the use of vaporizers leads to an increase in smoking cigarettes is misleading and harmful. While we respect Senator Durbin’s opinion, he is unable to cite any studies with direct evidence to support his position,” said Phil Daman, president of the Smoke Free Alternatives Trade Association, in a statement.\n\nMr. Durbin said the FDA should claim electronic cigarettes as part of its jurisdiction, allowing the agency to restrict mass-media advertising and prevent the sale and marketing to minors. If the FDA doesn’t act, however, he said there isn’t much that can be done legislatively.\n\n“I’m a realist and I know the likelihood of revisiting this whole issue of FDA authority is not very strong either in the House or Senate,” he said. “I think the FDA has been given the legislative authority that they need to control this product and I hope they’ll act on it as quickly as possible, but trying to rehash this battle, I don’t think it’s in the cards.”\n\nThe FDA said it has written a proposal to govern e-cigarette sales and marketing, and it’s being reviewed by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget.\n\nAltria, which makes the MarkTen e-cigarette, said the company agrees with Mr. Durbin on many of the changes he’s hoping to make, including regulation by the FDA, not selling to minors or in self-service dispensers, and adding warning labels with facts about the harm e-cigarettes can cause.\n\n“We think that’s an important thing that the agency brings all tobacco products under its regulatory authority,” said David Sylvia, a spokesman from Altria. “I think if you look through the report and recommendations, we’re in agreement with congressional members on those points.”\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

Dick Durbin, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, California Rep. Henry Waxman and others highlights several issues including the lack of age restrictions and no uniform warning labels for the battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine solution and create vapor that’s inhaled.\n\nWhile the Food and Drug Administration plans to set marketing and product regulations for electronic cigarettes in the near future, for now, almost anything goes. A 2009 law gave the FDA the power to regulate a number of aspects of tobacco marketing and manufacturing, though it cannot ban nicotine or cigarettes outright. The agency first said it planned to assert authority over e-cigarettes in 2011 but hasn’t yet. The proposed FDA regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in October.\n\n“I can’t understand why the FDA is taking this long,” Durbin said in an interview with The Associated Press. “It is clear that the longer they wait, the more young people will be addicted.”\n\nThe report follows an investigation launched by the congressional delegation in September into the practices of nine e-cigarette makers. The staffs surveyed the companies for information on their marketing practices, steps taken to restrict sales to minors, types of warning labels and touting claims of health benefits or reduced exposure to potentially harmful or addictive substances.\n\nAmong the findings, the report says six of the companies surveyed spent more than $59 million on advertising and promotion of their e-cigarettes in 2013. Several of the companies reported that their marketing spending more than doubled between 2012 and 2013, and two of the companies’ marketing expenses increased more than 300 percent during that time. Sales of e-cigarettes, which are sold under more than 200 brand names, are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013.\n\nDurbin said that if the agency “accepts responsibility for this product as they have for tobacco,” it can start establishing standards for sales and marketing.\n\n“If they fail to do that, I’m afraid it’s going to continue reach into the ranks of our children,” he said.\n\nHarkin, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, echoed those concerns in a statement, urging regulators to stop marketing practices that already are illegal for traditional tobacco products.', 'A 2009 law gave the FDA the power to regulate a number of aspects of tobacco marketing and manufacturing, though it cannot ban nicotine or cigarettes outright.\n“It is clear that the longer they wait, the more young people will be addicted.”The report follows an investigation launched by the congressional delegation in September into the practices of nine e-cigarette makers.\nAmong the findings, the report says six of the companies surveyed spent more than $59 million on advertising and promotion of their e-cigarettes in 2013.\nSeveral of the companies reported that their marketing spending more than doubled between 2012 and 2013, and two of the companies’ marketing expenses increased more than 300 percent during that time.\nSales of e-cigarettes, which are sold under more than 200 brand names, are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013.']"

Henry Waxman, D-California, one of the leaders behind the investigation.\n\n“E-cigarette makers are free to sponsor youth-oriented events and produce flavors that appeal to kids.

Twenty-eight states restrict the age of purchase for e-cigarettes and a few companies have self-imposed limits, but otherwise the marketplace is wide open.\n\nWith this report, the 12 Democrats involved are trying to build pressure on the Food & Drug Administration to “deem” that e-cigarettes be regulated like conventional smokes and therefore face the same strict limits on advertising and sales.\n\nTo make the case for tougher regulation, the Congressional report listed several e-cigarette marketing approaches:\n\nCompanies offer dozens of sweet flavored e-cigarettes, including tastes like “Iced Berry” and “Peachy Keen,” which the lawmakers say appeal to children.\n\nCelebrities who appeal to young people, including singer Chris Brown and actor Robert Pattison, have been paid to be seen with the devices.\n\nE-cigarette makers have either sponsored or given away their product at hundreds of kid-friendly events, including baseball games and one day at a Six Flags amusement park. Though, scanning the list, the majority of events cited in the report seemed to be at bars, large concerts and music festivals, which may be geared toward adults.\n\nThe evidence was enough for the lawmakers.\n\n“(This report) makes it clear the e-cigarette companies… have made a determined effort… to lure children into this nicotine addiction,” said Sen.

Durbin, Illinois Democrat, according to the Washington Times. ""The report we\'re releasing today makes it clear e-cigarettes have made a concerted effort to market to children.""\n\nIn this survey released by U.S. Democratic congressmen and women, the researchers focused on nine e-cigarette companies and 348 events that took place within the past two years. Events included very popular music festivals Coachella and Bonnaroo as well as Grand Prix races. They researchers found that six out of the nine companies had provided free samples.\n\nThe companies included Green Smoke, which was later acquired by Altria Group Inc., and Lorillard Inc. The flavors that were offered tended to be candy flavors such as cherry crush and vanilla dreams. Oftentimes companies will use enticing flavors to gain customers.\n\n""These are the same tactics that were used by major cigarette manufacturers before they were banned,"" said Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California, reported by Bloomberg Businessweek.

Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, as well as Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and other legislators — highlights several issues, including the lack of age restrictions and no uniform warning labels for the battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine solution and create vapor that\'s inhaled.\n\nThe new report builds on growing national efforts to learn more about the potentially adverse effects of e-cigarettes. In September 2013, attorneys general of 41 U.S. states sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) urging the body to “take all available measures” to issue clear guidelines for the product, as its use has far outpaced regulatory efforts and the scientific community’s ability to conduct long-term studies.\n\nWhile the FDA plans to set marketing and product regulations for e-cigarettes in the near future, for now, almost anything goes. A 2009 law gave the FDA the power to regulate a number of aspects of tobacco marketing and manufacturing, though it cannot ban nicotine or cigarettes outright. The agency first said it planned to assert authority over e-cigarettes in 2011 but hasn\'t yet. The proposed FDA regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in October.\n\n""I can\'t understand why the FDA is taking this long,"" Sen. Durbin said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""It is clear that the longer they wait, the more young people will be addicted.""\n\nThe report follows an investigation launched by the congressional delegation in September into the practices of nine e-cigarette makers. The staffs surveyed the companies for information on their marketing practices, steps taken to restrict sales to minors, types of warning labels and claims of health benefits or reduced exposure to potentially harmful or addictive substances.\n\nAmong the findings, the report says six of the companies surveyed spent more than $59 million on advertising and promotion of their e-cigarettes in 2013. Several of the companies reported that between 2012 and 2013 their promotional spending more than doubled. Two of the companies\' marketing expenses increased more than 300 percent during that time. Sales of e-cigarettes, which are sold under more than 200 brand names, are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013.\n\nDurbin said that if the agency ""accepts responsibility for this product as they have for tobacco,"" it could start establishing standards for sales and marketing.\n\n""If they fail to do that, I\'m afraid it\'s going to continue reach into the ranks of our children,"" he said.\n\nHarkin, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, echoed those concerns in a statement, urging regulators to stop marketing practices that are already illegal for traditional tobacco products.\n\nE-cigarettes have become extremely popular and been touted as a safer alternative to, and a way to quit, regular cigarette smoking. A study published in September by The Lancet, a British medical journal, found that e-cigarettes were as effective as nicotine patches in helping smokers quit.\n\nBut some experts worry about potential side effects and whether the devices could actually encourage the use of cigarettes.\n\nA study published last fall by the Centers for Disease Control found that teen use of e-cigarettes had more than doubled between 2011 and 2012, and that there was possibly a causal relationship between their use and regular smoking among children.\n\nMeanwhile, outside of federal efforts to regulate e-cigarettes, a number of U.S. municipalities have moved to curb their use in public places.

The staffs of Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, and California Representative Henry Waxman wrote and released the report.\n\nHealth officials and politicians have focused on the fact that a majority of these electronic cigarettes contain nicotine, which is a concern for two reasons: the product actually does not help tobacco users kick their habit and the nicotine is unhealthy for younger people who purchase the product.

Wimmer, the President and CEO of the American Lung Association, nicotine is a highly addictive substance whether it is contained in a conventional cigarette or an electronic cigarette.

(OTCBB:AHII) that could end up beating the big guys at their own game.\n\n\n\nThe new smoking battleground is electronic cigarettes, or e-cigs, for short. Last year could be considered a breakout year for e-cigs, with sales of them reaching a little over $1 billion. Citigroup expects sales of e-cigs to exceed $3 billion this year, however, suggesting the industry has yet to reach its critical mass.\n\n\n\nNo, it's barely a drop in the bucket compared to the $100 billion or so that traditional cigarettes made by Lorillard and Reynolds American see in sales every year, and through the heart of 2012, big tobacco largely dismissed e-cigs, expecting them to be little more than a cute niche, and not expecting electronic cigarette companies like NJOY or American Heritage International to grow into a real threat. What a difference a few months can make, however.\n\n\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, Lorillard Inc. acquired Blu Ecigs (the ones Jenny McCarthy is promoting) in April of 2012. Reynolds American is now wading waist-deep into e-cig waters, launching a nationwide rollout of its Vuse line of electronic cigarettes latte last ear... complete with television ads (the first time in decades cigarettes have been on TV ads, though Blu followed shortly after that). Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) finally got into the game last August with its MarkTen brand... the last of the major U.S. big tobacco names to get into the electronic cigarette game. And, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC (OTCMKTS:ITYBY) is putting the finishing touches on its acquisition of Dragonlite International's e-cig division.\n\n\n\nPoint being, if there wasn't something game-changing about electronic cigarettes, every single traditional tobacco name wouldn't be getting into the game. The fact that big tobacco - not exactly a group of companies known for innovating or breaking ground or even taking risks - are pushing into the e-cig market speaks volumes about where they're going.\n\n\n\nThere's just one problem with companies like Altria Group and Reynolds American getting into the electronic cigarette business - for all their marketing know-how and distribution channel muscle, they're not very good at it. That's how a little company like NJOY still controls 40% of the United States electronic cigarette market. Even NJOY, however, may want to look over its shoulder, as nobody is truly entrenched yet. The competition coming on fast is the aforementioned American Heritage International, which brings something unique to the table.... two unique somethings, to be precise.\n\n\n\nFirst, while most e-cigs are made in China, AHII makes its own electronic cigarettes in the United States, where it can control - and see - what goes into them. While there are no known manufacturing issues with Chinese-made electronic cigarettes yet, sourcing them from overseas leaves an enormous amount of opportunity for problems, the biggest of which is toxic ingredients.\n\n\n\nSecond, though an e-cig is an electronic device, that doesn't necessarily mean consumers want to walk around with what looks like a glowing ball-point pen sticking out of their mouth. American Heritage International e-cigs actually look and feel like traditional cigarettes, giving the company some serious marketing firepower. And, it seems to be an effective idea - AHII sold out of its first production run of electronic cigarettes within just a few weeks.\n\n\n\nBottom line? The e-cig industry hasn't quite made its first gel yet, but we're getting close to that point, and American Heritage International is rapidly but quietly working its way towards the front of the line. Investors who can take a step back and see the bigger picture may want to consider AHII before the gel completely firms up, if not as a long-term play in the electronic cigarette arena, then perhaps as an acquisition candidate as late-to-the-party big tobacco seeks ways to catch up quickly with a stand-out product.\n\nFor more on American Heritage, its investor presentation PDF offers the most insight.

Dick Durbin, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, California Rep. Henry Waxman and others highlights several issues including the lack of age restrictions and no uniform warning labels for the battery-powered devices that heat a liquid nicotine solution and create vapor that\'s inhaled.\n\nWhile the Food and Drug Administration plans to set marketing and product regulations for electronic cigarettes in the near future, for now, almost anything goes. A 2009 law gave the FDA the power to regulate a number of aspects of tobacco marketing and manufacturing, though it cannot ban nicotine or cigarettes outright. The agency first said it planned to assert authority over e-cigarettes in 2011 but hasn\'t yet. The proposed FDA regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in October.\n\n""I can\'t understand why the FDA is taking this long,"" Durbin said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""It is clear that the longer they wait, the more young people will be addicted.""\n\nThe report follows an investigation launched by the congressional delegation in September into the practices of nine e-cigarette makers. The staffs surveyed the companies for information on their marketing practices, steps taken to restrict sales to minors, types of warning labels and touting claims of health benefits or reduced exposure to potentially harmful or addictive substances.\n\nAmong the findings, the report says six of the companies surveyed spent more than $59 million on advertising and promotion of their e-cigarettes in 2013. Several of the companies reported that their marketing spending more than doubled between 2012 and 2013, and two of the companies\' marketing expenses increased more than 300 percent during that time. Sales of e-cigarettes, which are sold under more than 200 brand names, are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013.\n\nDurbin said that if the agency ""accepts responsibility for this product as they have for tobacco,"" it can start establishing standards for sales and marketing.\n\n""If they fail to do that, I\'m afraid it\'s going to continue reach into the ranks of our children,"" he said.\n\nHarkin, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, echoed those concerns in a statement, urging regulators to stop marketing practices that already are illegal for traditional tobacco products.\n\n___\n\nMichael Felberbaum can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/MLFelberbaum.', ""RICHMOND, Va. - Concerns about electronic cigarettes, including flavors and marketing that could appeal to young people, underscore the need to regulate the fast-growing industry, according to a Congressional report released Monday.\nThe report follows an investigation launched by the congressional delegation in September into the practices of nine e-cigarette makers.\nAmong the findings, the report says six of the companies surveyed spent more than $59 million on advertising and promotion of their e-cigarettes in 2013.\nSeveral of the companies reported that their marketing spending more than doubled between 2012 and 2013, and two of the companies' marketing expenses increased more than 300 percent during that time.\nSales of e-cigarettes, which are sold under more than 200 brand names, are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013.""]"

One group (mainly made up of smokers) sees them as potentially saving millions of lives. Another (mainly made up of non-smokers) sees them as ‘renormalising’ smoking.\n\n\n\nIf leaked documents seen by the FT are anything to go by, the World Health Organisation is in the latter camp: apparently the documents outline plans to classify e-cigarettes under the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) – essentially putting them in the same category as cigarettes. Which means ‘vapers’ could be about to join smokers out on the pavement.\n\n\n\nPart of the reason smokers love e-cigarettes is that because the stuff they give off is odourless vapour, rather than smoke, they can use them anywhere (unless the owner of the premises they’re on decrees otherwise). But the WHO’s point is that they still contain nicotine – so they’re still just as addictive as cigarettes. And because vapers buy refills, which last much longer than a packet of fags, it’s often the case that they don’t notice quite now much nicotine they’re taking in.\n\n\n\nDr Haik Nikogosian, who oversees the FCTC, said during a meeting in November that e-cigarettes ‘could result in a new wave of the tobacco epidemic,’ and that ‘more importance should be given to the threat’ posed by them.\n\n\n\nThe trouble is that e-cigarettes are increasingly big business. Sales rose 340% in the year to February, to £193m: globally, the market is worth about $3bn a year (compared, admittedly, with the tobacco industry’s rather larger $300bn value).\n\n\n\nPresumably in the spirit of ‘if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em’, even the tobacco industry has got involved: British American Tobacco launched its version, Vype, back in July. And they’ve spawned a whole cottage industry: The Vape Lab in east London, for instance, the UK’s first ‘e-cigarette and coffee shop’.\n\n\n\nSo, like it or not, vaping is a big thing. And with the tobacco lobby behind them, it’s unlikely the e-cigarette business will take the WHO’s reclassification lying down."", 'One group (mainly made up of smokers) sees them as potentially saving millions of lives.\nWhich means ‘vapers’ could be about to join smokers out on the pavement.\nBut the WHO’s point is that they still contain nicotine – so they’re still just as addictive as cigarettes.\nAnd because vapers buy refills, which last much longer than a packet of fags, it’s often the case that they don’t notice quite now much nicotine they’re taking in.\nAnd with the tobacco lobby behind them, it’s unlikely the e-cigarette business will take the WHO’s reclassification lying down.']"

But for allergy sufferers this means months of impending misery: stuffed and inflamed sinuses, scratchy throats, itchy and watery eyes and a lot of sneezing.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, experts say people with seasonal allergies are in for an especially rough ride this spring and summer. The long winter\'s excessive snowfall and precipitation followed by warmer temperatures means more moisture in the air. All of this raises mold and pollen counts to epic proportions.\n\n""There is a pollen burst going on right now,"" Dr. Clifford Bassett, the medical director at Allergy and Asthma Care of New York, told CBS News. ""They\'re primed and they\'re ready to go and they\'re already releasing their pollens earlier.""\n\nPollen may be especially bad this spring. CBS News\n\nHe said urban dwellers especially must brace themselves for a season of sniffles. ""Air pollution hangs on to pollen. It super-charges the pollen,"" Bassett explained to ""CBS This Morning"" last month.\n\nHigh pollen count in cities is driven by air pollution, warmer temperatures and also changes in trends of plant growth. According to Bassett, there currently are more male plants than female plants in urban areas; male plants are responsible for the pollen that gets into the air.\n\nLast month, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America released their 12th annual ""Spring Allergy Capitals"" for the 45 million sneezy Americans. The report ranks the 100 cities in the U.S. with the worst allergies. This year, Louisville, Ky., climbed to the first spot from last year\'s fifth. The full rankings of 100 cities can be accessed on the AAFA\'s website.\n\nHow to cope with spring allergies\n\nSo what can you do? Here are some tips from Bassett and other experts for how to make allergy season less unbearable so you can spend at least part of your spring in the great outdoors:\n\n-Visit an allergy specialist. Get tested to find out specifically which allergies you have. Even though pollen and mold both cause sneezing and watery itchy eyes some medications may be more effective than others.\n\n-Track pollen and mold counts. Once you know your allergen, you can create an allergy calendar to identify when levels of pollen are highest. There are a number of phone apps, such as Pollen.com\'s Allergy Alert to help allergy sufferers track pollen and mold levels along with the weather.\n\n\n\n-Pre-treat your symptoms. It\'s best to start taking medication before your allergies kick in, which will help to lessen your symptoms. Bassett recommends you begin medications two weeks before you actually start feeling stuffy.\n\n\n\n-Watch what you eat. Avoid certain fruits and vegetables that may aggravate allergies -- a phenomenon known as oral allergy syndrome, which frequently occurs in people with a ragweed allergy. Common culprits include bananas, cantaloupe, cucumbers, honeydew, watermelon and raw zucchini.\n\n-Keep your hair clean. On days with high humidity, your hair is the perfect place for pollen to hide. At the end of the day give your hair a good scrub to prevent a nighttime sneeze-fest. In addition, wash your comb and brush frequently, and skip the hair gel and other sticky styling products which pollen tends to cling to.\n\n-Protect your eyes. During the daytime, shield your eyes from airborne debris with sunglasses.\n\n-Consider alternative treatment. Some sufferers swear by acupuncture but it may best to try more mainstream options before giving complementary treatment a shot. And it\'s always best to check with your allergy specialist or primary care doctor.\n\n', 'But for allergy sufferers this means months of impending misery: stuffed and inflamed sinuses, scratchy throats, itchy and watery eyes and a lot of sneezing.\nIt super-charges the pollen,"" Bassett explained to ""CBS This Morning"" last month.\nLast month, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America released their 12th annual ""Spring Allergy Capitals"" for the 45 million sneezy Americans.\nThere are a number of phone apps, such as Pollen.com\'s Allergy Alert to help allergy sufferers track pollen and mold levels along with the weather.\nAvoid certain fruits and vegetables that may aggravate allergies -- a phenomenon known as oral allergy syndrome, which frequently occurs in people with a ragweed allergy.']"

This is especially important for those who are sensitive to indoor allergens because, for them, allergy season can last all year round, but worsen when pollen becomes an issue in the spring.\n\nDr. Sublet said that year-round allergy sufferers need to remove allergens from the home in order to enjoy an active, healthy lifestyle.\n\nAllergies are a major cause of illness in the U.S., with some 50 million Americans suffering allergies, including millions of children, according to the ACAAI.

Stay on top of routine household chores that prevent allergies, such as changing air filters every three months and using filters with a MERV rating of 11 or 12. Vacuum regularly to get rid of dust mites, using a vacuum with a HEPA filter or a cyclonic vacuum, and also wash bedding and stuffed animals every week. Here are some good vacuum cleaners under 100 dollars.\n\n2. To help reduce moisture that causes mold, use bathroom fans, and clean up any standing water immediately. Use detergent and water to scrub visible mold from surfaces and completely dry them. It also helps to keep your home humidity below 60 percent and clean gutters regularly.\n\n3. If you have any pets, your home probably has elevated levels of fur, saliva and dander after winter. You can lower levels of these allergens by vacuuming often and washing upholstery, including your pet's bed, and be sure to keep your pet out of your bedroom.\n\n4. Opening your windows to let some fresh spring air in may also bring in pollen, and even air fresheners and scented candles contain chemicals that can trigger asthma attacks, so be careful about what you put inside the air in your home.\n\n5. Stay indoors during the midday and afternoon hours, as that's when pollen counts are highest. Also wear gloves and an N95 particulate pollen mask before going outside to mow the lawn or garden, and be sure to take your allergy medication before hand. When outside, do not touch your eyes and do not forget to wash your hands, hair and clothing when you go back inside your home.\n\nSOURCE: American College of Allergy, News Release: Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), Double Duty Spring Cleaning: Keep Healthy and Tidy, April 8, 2010."", 'April showers bring May flowers, but those spring blooms also bring misery to those who suffer from allergies.\nBut there is one way you can help prevent allergies that may surprise you: spring cleaning.\nIn addition to making your home look and feel better, spring cleaning can also go a long way toward combatting allergy symptoms, according to a news release from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI).\nAllergies are a major cause of illness in the U.S., with some 50 million Americans suffering allergies, including millions of children, according to the ACAAI.\nSOURCE: American College of Allergy, News Release: Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), Double Duty Spring Cleaning: Keep Healthy and Tidy, April 8, 2010.']"

The sooner, the better.\n\nDr. Helsel says your main goal is to block pollen, so she suggests keeping your windows shut, showering at night, and washing your pillowcase and sheets more often than usual.\n\n“Some people even suggest wearing sunglasses outside so the pollen doesn’t directly hit your eyes,” she said, “And if you’ve been outside, wash your clothes really well so the pollen doesn’t stay on your clothes. You get in bed and then the symptoms get worse over night.”\n\nShe also suggests using a neti-pot.\n\n“Those are very effective for a lot of people, especially if they do know they have allergies and they know it’s not an infection. I think it’s important to have that differentiated, that they don’t have a sinus infection going on at the time.”\n\nIf you don’t find any relief within a week or two, Dr. Helsel says it’s time to see a doctor and look at other options.', '(April 14, 2014)– Out with the polar vortex and in with the pollen vortex.\nAs if the bone-chilling winter wasn’t bad enough, it seems winter will be felt well into spring.\n“Generally, allergies don’t hit as suddenly,” said Dr. Helsel.\nDr. Helsel says your main goal is to block pollen, so she suggests keeping your windows shut, showering at night, and washing your pillowcase and sheets more often than usual.\n“Those are very effective for a lot of people, especially if they do know they have allergies and they know it’s not an infection.']"

So, What Are Allergies?\n\nAllergies are an abnormal response of the immune system. People who have allergies have an immune system that reacts to a usually harmless substance in the environment. This substance (pollen, mold, and animal dander, for example) is called an allergen.\n\nAllergies are a very common problem, affecting at least two out of every 10 Americans.\n\nPeople with allergies also can develop red, swollen, and itchy eyes when exposed to their allergic triggers.\n\nIf you've got allergies, you might wonder what to expect in the long term. Are you stuck with allergy symptoms, or will they get better? Or could they actually get even worse?\n\nAre your allergies acting up? Get the facts on common allergy types.\n\n2. What Causes Allergies?\n\nAlmost anything can trigger an allergy.\n\nThe air you breathe, whatever touches your skin, anything you put in your mouth - it`s all got potential for causing an allergy.\n\n3. Who Is at Risk?\n\nYou can blame heredity, but it`s not that simple.\n\nWhy does St. Louis always score so high on the worst place to live with allergies? We live in a valley surrounded by 3 rivers, air is stagnant until rain, freezes or heavy winds to move the air. Also indigenous trees to our area that people are allergic to.\n\nThe prediction is that this may be the worst allergy season ever.

Complications\n\nAllergies and Asthma\n\nAsthma attacks (worsening of asthma symptoms) can be triggered by allergies, which can temporarily increase the inflammation of the airways in a susceptible person.\n\nAllergies and Sleep\n\nMany of us know the misery of allergies all too well -- the sneezing, runny nose, and postnasal drip; watery, itchy eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Whether from the symptoms or the medication we use to treat them, our sleep often suffers.\n\nSinusitis\n\nSinusitis is an inflammation, or swelling, of the tissue lining the sinuses.

Now you might be battling polar pollen.\n\nLocal doctors are cautioning people with allergies that they may be experiencing symptoms much earlier than expected this year because of the long, hard and wet winter.\n\nDr. Jordan Scott, an allergist with Northeast Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said people are experiencing allergy symptoms as much as three weeks early, because of what’s being called “polar pollen syndrome.”\n\nThe heavy precipitation helped create healthy roots for pollinating plants. Because of the long soaking time the roots had, the warmer weather is expected to bring with it a heavy pollen season, Scott said.\n\nDr. David Reister, also an allergist with Northeast Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, agreed with his colleague, saying that pollen, especially maple pollen, is out in full force.\n\n“With the cold winter and the melting snow, the tree pollen is out in full force. That actually increases some of the pollen counts,” he said. “There was a lot of snow on the ground, so the trees and roots had a good winter. There’s been plenty of water for them. It’s not like the trees had a tough time this winter with a lack of water.”\n\nHe said if it had been a dry winter, trees would not be pollinating as early.\n\n“They have a good root system. With a dry winter, it would be tougher. A couple of years ago, we had a snowstorm in April. The trees were starting to pollinate so that snowstorm threw things off,” he said. “If you have a lot of rain in the spring, it helps keep the pollen away too.”\n\nThe best thing a person can do is get tested for allergies so they know how to best treat them, he said.\n\n“Diagnosis is important. You should know if it is indoor stuff or outdoor stuff. Once you know what you’re allergic to, you’ll know if you’re an early spring allergy person or a late spring allergy person,” he said.\n\nOnce you know what you are allergic to — such as maple pollen or mold, which comes in early spring, or grass pollen, which hits in June or July — you know when to begin expecting symptoms and the best course of action to deal them, he said.\n\n“April is spring season here. Pollen can flow for miles and miles and miles. If it’s warmer down South, pollen can blow for hundreds of miles. In April, you kind of start seeing the pollen counts go up, but as April continues, those levels go up and up.”\n\nScott said there are precautions people can take to decrease symptoms, including keeping windows closed at night, showering before bed, and not exercising outdoors either early in the morning or late evening.\n\nThere are nonprescription options available to patients, and a doctor can point patients in the right direction to which treatment is best for their symptoms.\n\n“Some of these products can be counter-productive in helping relieve long-term allergy related issues,” he said.\n\nBrandon Linatsas, a chiropractor with Nashua Family Chiropractic, said oftentimes seeing a chiropractor can actually help relieve allergy symptoms.\n\n“Allergies are an unnatural reaction to normal things in the environment,” he said. “People who get help here are people who have back pain and they find out afterward it helps with their allergies.\n\nHe said when a person’s body comes into contact with whatever their allergic trigger is, whether it be pollen, ragweed, pet dander, or dust mites, it makes chemicals called histamines.\n\nHistamines cause the tissue in a person’s nose to swell, his nose and eyes to run, and his eyes to itch, he said.\n\nLinatsas said he also adjusts sinus bones where inflammation occurs and fluid builds up, usually in the face and parts of a person’s neck, especially while having a sinus infection.\n\n“All that fluid that accumulates has to go somewhere. By helping to adjust those facial and neck muscles, it helps patients,” he said. “If there’s any blockage, it blocks up into your face. Adjusting the bones help with draining everything.”\n\nTaking over-the-counter antihistamines can help reduce or block whatever is causing the allergic reaction.\n\nAntihistamines relieve symptoms of different kinds of allergies, including seasonal allergies (hay fever), indoor allergies and food allergies, he said. However, he said, they don’t relieve every symptom, such as nasal congestion.\n\nReister said taking oral steroids can help prevent a lot of symptoms, but a person should be monitored by a doctor.\n\n“With all of the medications that are out there, you want to see an allergy specialist who can monitor what you’re on so you aren’t getting any side effects,” he said.\n\n“Testing allows us to determine what and when so we know how to treat you,” he said. “Testing confirms a diagnosis so then you can really tailor what you need to do, whether it’s a medicine or sprays or pills or shots.”\n\nImproperly treating allergies can cause mental absenteeism, a phenomenon in which someone is physically at work or school but is mentally not there.\n\n“You’re mentally absent because you either aren’t sleeping at night or you’ve taken something over-the-counter to help. People who have bad allergies and don’t get treatment, they get to work and they are nonfunctional,” he said. “They’re physically there but they aren’t functional.”\n\nFollow Katina Caraganis on Tout and Twitter @kcaraganis.', 'Dr. David Reister, also an allergist with Northeast Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, agreed with his colleague, saying that pollen, especially maple pollen, is out in full force.\nIt’s not like the trees had a tough time this winter with a lack of water.”He said if it had been a dry winter, trees would not be pollinating as early.\nOnce you know what you’re allergic to, you’ll know if you’re an early spring allergy person or a late spring allergy person,” he said.\nBrandon Linatsas, a chiropractor with Nashua Family Chiropractic, said oftentimes seeing a chiropractor can actually help relieve allergy symptoms.\nAntihistamines relieve symptoms of different kinds of allergies, including seasonal allergies (hay fever), indoor allergies and food allergies, he said.']"

""The South has been experiencing it already.""\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Allergy Bureau, pollen counts Friday at its monitoring station at Waterbury Hospital showed moderate levels of tree pollen, mostly coming from cedars, maple, box elder and pine, and low levels of mold.

""We\'ve already at least doubled our usual number of new patients coming in the last three to four weeks.""\n\n\n\nSprecace said higher-than-normal mold levels in the last part of winter, set off by freezing and thawing cycles, were already aggravating those with sensitivity, and the onslaught of pollen isn\'t far behind. He recommends allergy sufferers start their medications now, even if they\'re not feeling the effects yet. ""It\'s better to start early versus waiting until you\'re all plugged up,"" he said.\n\n\n\nSprecace recommends over-the-counter medications with loratadine, such as Claritin, or fexofenadine, such as Allegra, for those with mild to moderate symptoms, and prescription medications and nasal sprays for those with more severe cases. Leaving allergies untreated, he warned, sets the stage for sinus infections and other upper respiratory ailments.\n\n\n\nBer said he started telling his patients to take their seasonal allergy medications two weeks ago, adding that some of the medications aren\'t fully effective until after two weeks. ""And it\'s easier to control milder symptoms than waiting until they\'re more pronounced,"" he said.\n\n\n\nWaterbury allergist and immunologist Dr. Christopher Randolph oversees the pollen monitoring station at Waterbury Hospital.

Native trees are well-adapted to the duration of below-freezing temperatures such as those experienced this winter, and the snowpack protected the roots from damage from ice and animals, he said. The gradual melting left the soil well-saturated, meaning tree roots have a deep reservoir of moisture to draw from when trees leaf out.\n\n\n\n""It\'s good for the tree roots to have all that snow,"" Ward said.

Mathematicians from the University of Michigan are attempting to change all this, however,\n\nby releasing an app they claim will help you banish jet lag in record time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJet lag is caused when our internal circadian rhythm is disrupted by crossing time zones too rapidly. Light is the primary signal that affects this 24-hour biological cycle and travelling long distances means our bodies are exposed to light and dark when they aren\'t expecting it. The effects of this are reduced levels of cognitive awareness, changes in mood and general grogginess and sleepiness. Research has also shown that prolonged misalignment of the circadian clock can lead to more serious medical conditions, which is why it is important that we attempt to recover from jet lag as quickly as possible.\n\nThe mathematicians claim that their app, Entrain, stimulates your circadian clock by making optimal lighting recommendations that will help you dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes your body to adjust to a new time zone. The recommendations will pop up as alerts on your phone and tell you when to seek light and dark in order to help your body adapt to the new time zone faster than it would do naturally.\n\nRead next The custom-made town where driverless cars learn to drive The custom-made town where driverless cars learn to drive\n\nEntrain\n\nEntrain attempts to mirror what your body is going through, asking you questions to try and work out what time your body thinks it is. The app will then use light levels you report to track your circadian clock. If the app recommends you seek out darkness when you have no choice but to be in the light, or vice versa, you can manually update the lighting history and your recommendation schedule will update itself automatically.\n\nYour lighting schedule is computed based on equations describing the human circadian clock and how it can be moved from one phase to another in the shortest period of time. Previous studies have shown that various uses of lighting can either shorten or lengthen the jet lag recovery period, and this is well-established theory. The app\'s creators, however, have published a paper in the journal\n\nPLOS Computational Biology detailing the methodology they have developed to determine the mathematically optimal schedules of light exposure for rapidly re-aligning the circadian rhythm. ""Overcoming jet lag is fundamentally a math problem and we\'ve calculated the optimal way of doing it,"" said study author Danny Forger, of the University of Michigan. ""We\'re certainly not the first people to offer advice about this, but our predictions show the mathematically best and quickest ways to adjust across time zones.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on existing mathematical models, the team determined over 1,000 different schedules that could be used to quickly overcoming jet lag. The schedules make allowances for a whole range of lighting levels, including those found indoors and they can also be used by shift workers or those with circadian disorders. No naps or bright flashing lights are necessary -- rather, reestablishing your circadian rhythm is primarily a matter of adjusting what your body perceives to be dawn and dusk.\n\nThe mathematicians have discovered that this allows people to recover from jet lag more quickly than it was ever previously thought possible. They suggest that it reduces the average number of days it takes for you to fully adjust after a 12-hour time zone shift from seven to 13 days, down to only four.\n\nThe app is free and while it is currently available only on iPhone, an Android version will be released soon based on feedback from the iOS release. Users can submit their data to the app\'s creators at the University of Michigan along with feedback about their jet lag symptoms in order to help the mathematicians further refine their understanding of how jet lag affects people.', 'Mathematicians from the University of Michigan are attempting to change all this, however,by releasing an app they claim will help you banish jet lag in record time.\n""Overcoming jet lag is fundamentally a math problem and we\'ve calculated the optimal way of doing it,"" said study author Danny Forger, of the University of Michigan.\nAdvertisementBased on existing mathematical models, the team determined over 1,000 different schedules that could be used to quickly overcoming jet lag.\nThe mathematicians have discovered that this allows people to recover from jet lag more quickly than it was ever previously thought possible.\nUsers can submit their data to the app\'s creators at the University of Michigan along with feedback about their jet lag symptoms in order to help the mathematicians further refine their understanding of how jet lag affects people.']"
115784,http://psychcentral.com/news/2014/04/14/mathematical-app-speeds-jet-lag-recovery/68490.html,health,"['A new mobile app takes a mathematical approach to help jet-lagged travelers align circadian rhythms and expedite recovery from time zone challenges.\n\nUniversity of Michigan (UM) mathematicians say the app uses previously unknown shortcuts to restore a person’s internal clock as efficiency as possible.\n\n“Overcoming jet lag is fundamentally a math problem, and we’ve calculated the optimal way of doing it,” said Danny Forger, Ph.D., math professor at UM.\n\n“We’re certainly not the first people to offer advice about this, but our predictions show the best and quickest ways to adjust across time zones.”\n\nTraditional guidelines recommend allocating one day of recovery for each time zone crossed.\n\nThe new iPhone app, called Entrain, is believed to be the first to take a numbers-based approach to “entrainment,” the scientific term for synchronizing circadian rhythms with the outside hour.\n\nEntrain is built around the premise that light, particularly from the sun and in wavelengths that appear to our eyes as the color blue, is the strongest signal to regulate circadian rhythms.\n\nThese fluctuations in behaviors and bodily functions, tied to the planet’s 24-hour day, do more than guide us to eat and sleep. They govern processes in each one of our cells.\n\nShort disruptions such as jet lag and its symptoms of fatigue and insomnia can affect mood and performance.\n\nScientists have also linked regular disturbances and disorders of the system to depression, certain cancers, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\nPilots, flight attendants, and shift workers, which make up more than 10 percent of the American workforce, are particularly susceptible.\n\nThe shortcuts the app offers are custom schedules of light and darkness depending on the itinerary.\n\nThe schedules boil down to one block of time each day when you should seek the brightest light possible and another when you should put yourself in the dark, or at least in dim light. You don’t even have to be asleep.\n\n“If you must go outside, you can wear pink-tinted glasses to block blue wavelength light,” the researchers said.\n\nAnd if the app prescribes “bright outdoor light” in the middle of the night, a therapeutic lightbox can do the job — yes, its shortcuts sometimes require odd hours.\n\nThe study, published in Public Library of Science Computational Biology, relies on two leading mathematical models, or sets of equations, that have been shown to accurately describe human circadian rhythms.\n\nThe researchers used these equations and a technique called optimal control theory to calculate ideal adjustment schedules for more than 1,000 possible trips.\n\nThe app gives users access to these schedules.\n\nHow the App Works\n\nStart by entering your typical hours of light and darkness in your current time zone, then choose the time zone you’re traveling to and when, as well as the brightest light you expect to spend the most time in during your trip (indoor or outdoor.) The app then offers a specialized plan and predicts how long it will you take to adjust.\n\nFor example, say you’re traveling from Detroit to London, five hours ahead. Your flight leaves at 10 p.m. Eastern Time and arrives at 11:05 a.m. London time the next day. It’s a work trip and you’ll have to spend most of your time in indoor lighting.\n\nUnder those circumstances, the app says it can adjust you in about three days. That’s less than the rule-of-thumb one day per hour outside the starting time zone.\n\nThe entrainment clock for any trip starts at the beginning of the first light cycle in the new time zone.\n\nSo for the London trip, on the day after your arrival, you’d want to get light from 7:40 a.m until around 9 p.m., and not after. Rise earlier on the second day, at 6:20 a.m. Lights out at 7:40 p.m.\n\nYou may feel like going for an evening walk, but being in the light at a time when the app prescribes darkness would lengthen the adjustment period, the researchers say.\n\nTo get over jet lag most efficiently, researchers recommend:\n\nExperience one block of light and one block of darkness each day;\n\nDuring the light phase, be in the brightest light possible;\n\nDuring the dark phase, be in the dimmest light possible. Even a short burst of bright light at the wrong time can extend the time it takes to adjust;\n\nDark phases don’t have to be sleep phases;\n\nIf you must be outside during dark phases, block blue light with rose-tinted glasses or a visor. Follow the customized, mathematically optimal schedule offered by the free app, Entrain.\n\nOn the third day, get up before sunrise, around 5 a.m. Stay in light until 7:20 p.m. Your body will be synched the following morning. If you veer from the schedule, you can tell the app and it will recalculate going forward.\n\nTo show how this new method is different, the researchers illustrate circadian rhythms as a clock with a point at the hour when your body temperature is lowest. This usually occurs about two hours before you wake up.\n\nIf the point is usually at 5 a.m. and you travel overseas, it could abruptly swing over to, say, 3 p.m. in your destination. You’re likely to experience jet lag until your system adjusts and your body is once again at its lowest temperature just a few hours before your alarm goes off.\n\n“The way other approaches get these points to line up again is by inching along on the outside of the circle, sometimes pushing you towards and sometimes pulling you away from the target.\n\n“But our schedules can just cut through the middle,” said Olivia Walch, a mathematics doctoral student who built the app. “This is almost like a body hack to get yourself entrained faster.”\n\nSource: University of Michigan\n\n\n\nWoman using phone app photo by shutterstock.\n\nMathematical App Speeds Jet-Lag Recovery', 'A new mobile app takes a mathematical approach to help jet-lagged travelers align circadian rhythms and expedite recovery from time zone challenges.\nThe shortcuts the app offers are custom schedules of light and darkness depending on the itinerary.\n“But our schedules can just cut through the middle,” said Olivia Walch, a mathematics doctoral student who built the app.\n“This is almost like a body hack to get yourself entrained faster.”Source: University of MichiganWoman using phone app photo by shutterstock.\nMathematical App Speeds Jet-Lag Recovery']"

This usually occurs after a long air journey, due to disruption of the internal body clock, which relies on specific timings of exposure to daylight and darkness. The degree of severity of jet lag is directly proportional to the number of time zones a person crosses while they are travelling. Jet lag causes sleep patterns to go haywire.\n\nShort naps and lots of water are said to be helpful in overcoming jet lag. However, the researchers believe that the issue is merely a mathematical problem, and can be solved using the Entrain app.\n\nSo how exactly does Entrain work? Well, it creates a custom schedule of ‘light and darkness’ exposure. This schedule will let a person know when they should be exposed to bright light, and when they need to be in the dark. Following this schedule could help regulate the body clock much faster, and thus adapt to time zones quickly.\n\nThe calculation of the light schedules is done by using mathematical models, and combining this knowledge with a method, called optimal control theory.\n\nSo, in order to smoothly use Entrain, one must first put in their usual hours of exposure to light and darkness, in the time zone that they live in. Then, they need to choose the time zone that they will be heading to, and the time taken to travel. A very important factor would be to mention just how bright the light around a person would be, if that was the kind of light they would be exposed to for a long time.\n\nAfter putting these details, the app will then offer them a personalized schedule.\n\nAccording to the founders, Entrain made use of the most optimal way to overcome jet lag.\n\nHowever, there is a problem – not everyone will stick to the tight schedule. Only those who did so strictly would have their internal boy clock adjusted by the following morning. Those who slacked off would take longer to recover.\n\nThe app sometimes asked that users be exposed to periods of light and darkness at odd hours. But even then, the researchers who designed the app have a solution. If a person had to be exposed to light in the night, then they would use a lightbox. If they had to be exposed to darkness, they would have to wear pink tinted glasses which would block the light that would disrupt the internal body clock.\n\nWhere could Entrain and its findings be used? Not only for those with long journeys, but it could even be used to improve the health standards of cabin crew and captains in the aviation industry.', 'Jet lag is a burden that all those who travel must bear.\nEntrain is specifically designed to deal with the combination of issues that make up jet lag – from tiredness to disorientation.\nShort naps and lots of water are said to be helpful in overcoming jet lag.\nHowever, the researchers believe that the issue is merely a mathematical problem, and can be solved using the Entrain app.\nAccording to the founders, Entrain made use of the most optimal way to overcome jet lag.']"

However, early gains were followed by a rapid decline that ultimately saw the stock trading down over 2 percent.\n\nThe downward shift appears odd given the fact that the gains were driven by a positive news item. However, several key technical indicators could serve as an explanation for the reversal. Shares opened up 12.6 percent at $1.79 a share and peaked at $1.86 in the first five minutes of trading. After hitting that peak, though, the sell-off was swift, with the stock eventually reaching its previous close as it headed into the final hour of trading and then dipping into a loss before the bell.\n\nWhile the reasons for the steep decline aren’t entirely clear, it could be that the early gain resulted in the stock hitting some technical barriers that resulted in traders backing off of early gains. A look at Lexicon’s chart shows a downward wedge pattern that formed in early October of 2013, with a lengthy downtrend as declining resistance and support lines converged.\n\nThe early-morning gains pushed the stock past resistance levels and resulted in the price crossing its 50-day SMA from below. Other technical data likely contributed to the decline, including the way the MACD line failed to cross the signal line during a rally on April 9. The failure to stay above resistance wasn’t a promising sign for the stock. The downward wedge is a pattern that typically leads to a bullish breakout, and today’s news would appear to be an ideal catalyst for that. However, the fact that the stock pulled back from gains after clearing resistance could mean the stock lacks the strength to break out of its downtrend.\n\nRegardless, the major sell-off despite positive news is a curious one and would seem to indicate that there\'s more to this picture than meets the eye.\n\nSmall-cap pharma Lexicon is developing therapies based on gene knockout technology. From its website:\n\n“Initiated in 2001, our Genome5000 program was designed to discover the function of nearly 5,000 mammalian genes through comprehensive phenotyping of gene knockout mice.

Millions of Americans have this and can’t make enough insulin or use what they do make to process food.\n\nMany experts were skeptical that the benefits seen after a year would last.\n\nNow, three-year results show an even greater advantage for surgery.\n\nBlood-sugar levels were normal in 38 percent and 25 percent of two groups given surgery, but in only 5 percent of those treated with medications.\n\nThe results are ""quite remarkable"" and could revolutionize care, said one independent expert, Dr. Robert Siegel, a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\n""No one dreamed, at least I didn’t,"" that obesity surgery could have such broad effects long before it caused patients to lose weight, he said. Some patients were able to stop using insulin a few days after surgery.\n\nAt three years, ""more than 90 percent of the surgical patients required no insulin,"" and nearly half had needed it at the start of the study, said its leader, Dr. Philip Schauer of the Cleveland Clinic. In contrast, insulin use rose in the medication group, from 52 percent at the start to 55 percent at three years.\n\nThe results were reported Monday at an American College of Cardiology conference in Washington. They also were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nDoctors are reluctant to call surgery a possible cure because they can’t guarantee diabetes won’t come back.\n\nBut some patients, like Heather Britton, have passed the five-year mark when some experts consider cure or prolonged remission a possibility. Before the study, she was taking drugs for diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol; she takes none now.\n\n""It’s a miracle,"" said Britton, a 55-yeear-old computer programmer from suburban Cleveland.\n\n""It saved my life. I have no doubt that I would have had serious complications from my diabetes"" because the disease killed her mother and grandmothers at a young age, she said.\n\nAbout 26 million Americans have diabetes, and two-thirds of them are overweight or obese. Diabetes is a leading cause of heart disease, strokes, kidney failure, eye trouble and other problems.\n\nIt’s treated with various drugs and insulin, and doctors urge weight loss and exercise, but few people can drop enough pounds to make a difference. Bariatric surgery currently is mostly a last resort for very obese people who have failed less drastic ways to lose weight.\n\nIt costs $15,000 to $25,000 and Medicare covers it for very obese people with diabetes. Gastric bypass is the most common type: Through ""keyhole"" surgery, doctors reduce the stomach to a small pouch and reconnect it to the small intestine. Another type is sleeve gastrectomy, in which the size of the stomach is reduced less drastically.\n\nArticle Continues After These Ads\n\nSchauer’s study tested these two operations versus medication alone in 150 mildly obese people with severe diabetes. Their A1c levels -- a key blood-sugar measure -- were over 9 on average at the start. A healthy A1c is 6 or below and the study aimed for that, even though the American Diabetes Association sets an easier target of 7.\n\nAfter three years, researchers had follow-up on 91 percent of the original 150 patients. The medication group’s A1c averaged 8.4; the surgery groups were at 6.7 and 7, with gastric bypass being a little better.\n\nThe surgery groups also shed more pounds -- 25 percent and 21 percent of their body weight versus 4 percent for the medication group.\n\nSome cholesterol and other heart risk factors also improved in the surgery groups and they required fewer medicines for these than at the start.\n\nDoctors don’t know how surgery produces these benefits, but food makes the gut produce hormones to spur insulin, and trimming away part of it affects many hormones and metabolism.\n\nFour patients needed a second surgery within a year but none did after that. Out-of-control diabetes has complications, too -- many patients lose limbs or wind up on dialysis when their kidneys fail, and some need transplants.\n\nAn obesity surgery equipment company sponsored the study, and some of the researchers are paid consultants; the federal government also gave grant support.\n\nDr. Robert Ratner, chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association, said he was ""very encouraged"" that so many stayed in the study, and said it will remain important to follow participants longer, because many people who have weight-loss surgery regain substantial weight down the road.\n\n""Any way you lose weight is beneficial"" for curbing diabetes, he said, but ""we need to be concerned about the cost and complications"" of treatments. Diets cost less and have fewer side effects, Ratner said.\n\nOne other common type of obesity surgery, stomach banding, was not part of this study. Its use has declined in recent years as other types of surgery have shown long-term benefits for keeping weight off.\n\n------\n\nOnline:\n\nSurgery explainer: http://1.usa.gov/1gHoOX4\n\nWeight loss info: http://1.usa.gov/1gTBk6Q\n\nDiabetes info: http://www.diabetes.org\n\n------\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP', 'Surgery helps long-term for obese diabeticsPosted Tuesday, April 1, 2014 8:20 pmWASHINGTON -- New research is boosting hopes that weight-loss surgery can put some patients’ diabetes into remission for years and perhaps in some cases, for good.\nThe medication group’s A1c averaged 8.4; the surgery groups were at 6.7 and 7, with gastric bypass being a little better.\nThe surgery groups also shed more pounds -- 25 percent and 21 percent of their body weight versus 4 percent for the medication group.\nSome cholesterol and other heart risk factors also improved in the surgery groups and they required fewer medicines for these than at the start.\nIts use has declined in recent years as other types of surgery have shown long-term benefits for keeping weight off.']"

The trial achieved the primary endpoint of reducing mealtime insulin in patients.\n\nLX4211 is an oral, first in class dual inhibitor of sodium glucose transporters 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2) designed to lower blood glucose levels through two insulin-dependent mechanisms of action. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-day study, the drug reduced total daily mealtime bolus insulin dose by 32 percent compared with 6 percent for placebo. The trial also met secondary endpoints including glycemic control.\n\nArthur Sands, Lexicon's president and CEO, said, “The results from this study provide a clear demonstration of proof-of-concept of LX4211 as an oral, investigational new drug for type 1 diabetes complementing insulin therapy. The magnitude of improved glycemic control by several measures, including HbA1c in only four weeks, and lower insulin requirements are highly encouraging and support the progression of LX4211 into late-stage development for type 1 diabetes.”\n\nType 1 diabetes affects more than one million people in the U.S., children and adults alike. T1D is an autoimmune disease characterized by the inability to produce the hormone insulin. This is caused by the immune system targeting and destroying the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Lexicon’s LX 4211 is designed to delay the absorption of glucose in the gastrointestinal tract and enhance glucose excretion in the kidney to allow improved glucose control and reduced insulin doses.\n\nPablo Lapuerta, Lexicon's CMO, said, “An oral agent benefiting patients with type 1 diabetes through both substantial improvements in glucose control and significant reduction in the use of insulin with no increase in hypoglycemia is both new and clinically meaningful.

Alimera has been granted marketing authorizations for the drug in several European countries, and it has been commercially launched in the U.K. and Germany.\n\nThe resubmission of its NDA was in response to a complete response letter that the company received from the FDA in October 2013, which prompted the company to include a proposed label and safety update for the drug. Iluvien, which generated $1.9 million in sales in fiscal 2013, is Alimera\'s only marketed product.\n\nThis could only be the beginning for Alimera, however -- analysts believe that Iluvien could eventually generate peak sales of $217 million by 2019 if it launches across additional European markets and gains market approval in the U.S.\n\nAkebia rallies on positive analyst ratings\n\nLast but not least, Akebia Therapeutics has jumped over 16% in pre-market trading after at least three positive analyst ratings.\n\nMorgan Stanley released a new report restating its ""overweight"" rating on the stock. Morgan Stanley currently has a $90 price target on the stock, indicating a potential upside of 430% from Friday\'s closing price. Analysts at UBS AG also shared that bullish sentiment, giving Akebia a ""buy"" rating with a more conservative $28 price target. Nomura Securities also gave Akebia a ""buy"" rating with a price target of $39.\n\nAkebia has no marketed products, and two treatments in its pipeline -- AKB-6548 and AKB-6899. AKB-6548 is currently in two sets of trials for chronic kidney disease and a third one for anemia. AKB-6899 is currently in two sets of trials for various indications in oncology and ophthalmology.\n\nAKB-6548\'s non-dialysis indication for CKD, which is currently in phase 2 trials, is Akebia\'s most advanced program. Akebia is expects to release Phase 2b data for AKB-6548 in the fourth quarter of 2014, followed by phase 2 data for the dialysis indication in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nBoth drugs are based on hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) technology -- a primary regulator of several major biological pathways which can control the production of red blood cells. Nomura analyst M. Ian Somaiya expects AKB-6548 to generate peak sales of $1.2 billion -- if it captures approximately 20% of the U.S. anemia market for dialysis and non-dialysis patients and gains additional value from licensing deals in Europe.\n\nInvestors should note that Akebia only went public last month. It raised $100 million from its IPO and sold 5.9 million shares at $17 per share. Although shares rallied 24% to $21 on the first day of trading, the stock has recently slumped below its IPO price.

There are many new mothers who experience the “baby blues” after giving birth. These “blues” include mood swings and crying periods that fade quickly. Some moms experience more severe and long lasting forms of depression called postpartum depression. There are cases when the postpartum depression develops into postpartum psychosis after childbirth.\n\nBut this kind of mental condition does not affect only women. A new study shows that postpartum depression also affects the fathers, especially men who become fathers at a young age (in their 20s) and the symptoms remain at least during the child’s first five years of life.\n\nFor this study researchers have used data from a project involving more than 20,000 American teenagers in the 90s. The participants were asked 10 questions on depression symptoms in every few intervals of time. These young men were asked whether they felt tired, disliked or unhappy.\n\nThe study showing that postpartum depression also affects the fathers was published on April 14 and researchers say that the depression symptoms tend to increase during the first years of the baby’s life. The same study shows that being a young father doesn’t necessarily mean to suffer from postpartum depression. Researcher Craig David said that the study mainly indicates the time period when fathers are at risk of developing this condition.\n\nOther important fact revealed by the study was that it is very important for a child to see the parents thrive. When young fathers and mothers suffer from depression, the children also tend to develop behavior problems and have difficulties with language and reading.\n\nThere are many studies that look into the risks of postpartum depression for mothers but research dealing with the young father’s mental health is much newer. Studies suggest that 5 to 10% of new dads develop clinical depression after the baby is born.\n\nWith new mothers, experts say that depression may come from a mix of emotional stress and biological changes that come with pregnancy and giving birth. The bodies of men are not affected by parenthood but their lives suffer a major change and for some these changes can be overwhelming.\n\nPostpartum Depression Also Affects The Fathers – recent research reveals\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this recent discovery?

Those who experienced parental depression the most frequently were also around 25 years old when they became fathers and lived with their children.\n\nThe findings are a reminder that men also experience parental depression, and at surprisingly similar rate compared to new mothers. Paternal depression affects 5 percent to 10 percent of fathers, while about 10 percent to 15 percent of new mothers will experience maternal depression.\n\n“There’s been a significant body of literature describing the effect of mother’s depression on child development, and the health care system has tried to rise to the challenge of identifying mothers with depression,” says Craig Garfield, lead author of the study. “Fathers have not been on the radar screen until recently. Now we know that … right around the time of the birth is an important time to try and capture and screen those dads.”\n\nPrevious research from Garfield indicates fathers who are depressed will use more corporal punishment, read less and interact less with their children, and are more likely to be stressed and neglect their children. Consequently, those children are at risk for having poor language and reading development and more behavior problems and conduct disorders.\n\nFor Hispanics, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) indicates depression occurs at a higher rate compared to most other ethnicities, even when not accounting for parental depression specifically. Though Hispanic women tend to be the most likely to experience depression and issues with mental illness, Hispanics in general are considered a high-risk group for depression, anxiety and substance abuse.\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to depression–parental or otherwise–Hispanics face a number of barriers to care, including: mental health stigma, lack of Spanish-speaking care providers, limited clinical data on Hispanics and mental health, high costs of care and lack of insurance coverage, limited transportation, and limited outreach programs, among others.\n\n“The next question is why are there these differences and how can we avoid making a one-size-fits-all approach to paternal depression and actually tailor something to fit individual needs?” Garfield indicated of the racial disparities in his study.\n\nLisa Harvey, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, told Hattiesburg American it’s not surprising that both mothers and fathers experience greater depression during the transition to parenthood because parenthood is one of the most stressful times of a person’s life.\n\n“Young children require an enormous amount of care, and it can be stressful to juggle parenting, work, extra housework, all while getting less sleep,” she said. “Having a child can also cause financial strain and difficulties in the couple’s relationship. All of these things can put parents at risk for becoming depressed.”\n\nResearchers indicate the study findings remind professionals of the importance of identifying parental depression among fathers; most studies focus on the stress of new mothers.', 'Hispanic men are more likely than non-Hispanic white men to suffer from paternal depression during the first five years of parenthood.\nThe findings are a reminder that men also experience parental depression, and at surprisingly similar rate compared to new mothers.\nPaternal depression affects 5 percent to 10 percent of fathers, while about 10 percent to 15 percent of new mothers will experience maternal depression.\nFor Hispanics, the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) indicates depression occurs at a higher rate compared to most other ethnicities, even when not accounting for parental depression specifically.\nThough Hispanic women tend to be the most likely to experience depression and issues with mental illness, Hispanics in general are considered a high-risk group for depression, anxiety and substance abuse.']"

The study didn\'t prove that early fatherhood causes depressive symptoms – it only showed an association between the two.\n\nPostpartum depression\n\n\n\n""But this does show us a time period where fathers are at increased risk,"" said lead researcher Dr. Craig Garfield, an associate professor of paediatrics at North-western University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n\nThe new research was published online in Paediatrics and in the print issue of the journal.\n\nMany studies have looked into the risk of postpartum depression for mothers, but research into fathers\' mental health during this period is much newer, Garfield said. Studies so far suggest that 5% to 10% of new dads develop clinical depression after the baby arrives.\n\nWhat\'s more, researchers have found that when fathers are depressed, children tend to have more behavioural problems and weaker reading and language skills.\n\nIt\'s not clear what role dads\' depression plays in those problems. But ""when parents thrive, children thrive,"" Garfield said, so both parents\' mental health is important.\n\nFor the new study, Garfield\'s team used data from a long-running project that began following more than 20 000 US teens in the 1990s. Every few years, the participants completed a 10-question screening tool on depression symptoms – asking whether they felt unhappy, tired or disliked, for example.\n\nOf the more than 10 600 young men in the study, one-third had become fathers by the time they were aged 24 to 32. And, Garfield\'s team found, dads\' depression scores showed a clear shift over time.\n\nVery low scores\n\n\n\nAmong fathers living with their children, depression scores rose by an average of 68% over the first five years of their child\'s life. Fathers who weren\'t living with their children showed a different trend: Their depression symptoms rose after high school, and then started to decline after they became fathers.\n\nWhile that 68% rise sounds big, it is an average for the group, Garfield said. And for many men, even that much of a change would not be enough to push them into clinical depression.\n\n""Many men started off with very low [scores], so even with that increase they probably wouldn\'t screen positive for depression,"" Garfield noted. ""But some would.""\n\nWhy do some men get depressed after the baby arrives? ""We really don\'t understand the reasons yet,"" Garfield said.\n\nWith new moms, experts suspect that depression arises from a mix of stress and the biological changes that come with pregnancy and childbirth. Men\'s bodies aren\'t affected by fatherhood, but their lives definitely change, noted Eric Lewandowski, of the Child Study Centre at NYU Langone Medical Centre in New York City.\n\nTransitioning to fatherhood\n\nNew fathers may feel added financial strain or stress on their marriage, for example, said Lewandowski, who was not involved in the study.\n\nRead: Father-son bond helps men handle stress\n\n""The transition can be a tough one,"" he said, ""especially around the age at which these men became fathers – in their mid-20s.""\n\nIt\'s not clear, Lewandowski noted, whether the findings might be different for men who become fathers in their 30s or beyond.\n\nBoth he and Garfield said the results call attention to fathers\' mental health. ""Parenting is a team sport, and understanding how men transition into fatherhood is important, too,"" Garfield said.\n\nThere are no guidelines on when or how to screen new fathers for depression. But more research into the issue could change that, Garfield said.\n\nNot all roses\n\n\n\nFor now, Lewandowski said it\'s important for new parents to be prepared for the reality of having a child. ""It\'s not all roses. It\'s tough,"" he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, there\'s ""the joy of having a child,"" and it\'s hard for a scientific study to measure that and ""weigh"" it against the less positive aspects of parenting. And maybe for most moms and dads, Lewandowski said, the joy and the difficulties can ""co-exist.""\n\n\n\nImage: depressed young man from Shutterstock\n\nRead more:\n\nStrong marriage shields kids from depressed dad\n\nDepressed dads spank kids\n\nFathers suffer baby-blues too\n\n', 'Young dads at higher risk of depression In the case of men who become fathers in their 20s and live with their children, depression symptoms tend to rise during the first five years of the child\'s life.\nYoung fathers may be at increased risk of depression symptoms after their baby arrives, all the way through to the child\'s kindergarten, a new study suggests.\nIt\'s not clear what role dads\' depression plays in those problems.\nAnd, Garfield\'s team found, dads\' depression scores showed a clear shift over time.\nAnd maybe for most moms and dads, Lewandowski said, the joy and the difficulties can ""co-exist.""']"

A new study finds that during the first five years of parenthood, young dads saw a 68 percent increase in depressive symptoms.\n\nThe findings are concerning given that the symptoms arose during those critical first years of a child’s life, and researchers worry about the effects paternal depression can have on a child’s well-being.\n\n“It’s not just new moms who need to be screened for depression; dads are at risk, too,” Craig Garfield, an associate professor in pediatrics and medical social sciences at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine and lead author of the study, said in a statement. “Parental depression has a detrimental effect on kids, especially during those first key years of parent-infant attachment. We need to do a better job of helping young dads transition through that time period.”\n\nThe phenomenon of postpartum depression in women is well documented and affects between 10 and 15 percent of new mothers. But less is known about how young dads are affected by depression as they enter parenthood.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that depression affected fathers around 25 years of age who lived with their children 5 to 10 percent of the time.\n\nResearchers from Northwestern University conducted the study over 20 years starting in 1994. They used data collected from more than 10,000 adolescent males. In 2004 and 2005, 3,425 of them, or about one in three, were fathers between the ages of 24 and 32. Eight out of 10 of the fathers lived with their children.\n\nThe men who were surveyed were asked to report on their experiences with depression, including symptoms such as sadness, difficulty focusing and inability to enjoy life. Researchers note that when young dads suffer from these symptoms, it harms their relationships with their kids. Depressed dads read and interact with their children less, are more likely to neglect their kids and resort to corporal forms of punishment at higher rates.\n\n""There\'s been a significant body of literature describing the effect of mother\'s depression on child development, and the health care system has tried to rise to the challenge of identifying mothers with depression,"" Garfield told USA Today. ""Fathers have not been on the radar screen until recently. Now we know that ... right around the time of the birth is an important time to try and capture and screen those dads.""\n\nPrevious research has found similar rates of depression in young fathers. A 2010 study by the Medical Research Council noted that one in 28 dads experienced depressive symptoms in the first year after their child was born.\n\nThere’s no one reason or explanation for why young dads are at a greater risk for depression. Researchers speculate that factors such as strained relationships with a partner, having a partner who also experiences postpartum depression and financial struggles all play a role.', 'A new study finds that during the first five years of parenthood, young dads saw a 68 percent increase in depressive symptoms.\nBut less is known about how young dads are affected by depression as they enter parenthood.\nResearchers note that when young dads suffer from these symptoms, it harms their relationships with their kids.\nPrevious research has found similar rates of depression in young fathers.\nThere’s no one reason or explanation for why young dads are at a greater risk for depression.']"

""This is a wakeup call for anyone who knows a young man who has recently become a new father. Be aware of how he is doing during his transition into fatherhood.

Now, a new study suggests that men who become fathers at a young age experience depression during the first few years of their fatherhood.\n\nPublished in the journal Pediatrics, researchers found that symptoms of postpartum depression increased on average by 68 percent over the first five years of fatherhood, especially for men who become fathers around 25-years-old and live with their children.\n\nPostpartum depression is characterized as severe depressive symptoms that develop after the birth of a child. However, it is typically diagnosed in mothers. Lead study author Dr. Craig Garfield, a professor in pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said depression affects five percent to 10 percent of fathers. Postpartum depression affects around 10 percent to 15 percent of mothers.\n\nThe study looked at more than 20,000 young men who were participating in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The study began in 1994 and followed the subjects for 20 years. Every couple of years, the participants were asked to take a 10-question screening test for depressive symptoms, with questions asking whether they felt unhappy, tired or disliked.\n\nThe study found that out of roughly 10,600 young men who participated in the project, only one-third had become fathers by the time they reached 24 to 32-years-old. The study also found that a father\'s depression sources shifted over time. Fathers who lived with their children had scores that increased by an average of 68 percent within the first five years of their child\'s life. However the scores would not clinically diagnose the men as depressed.\n\n""Many men started off with very low [scores], so even with that increase they probably wouldn\'t screen positive for depression,"" Garfield said, according to HealthDay.

Garfield said the results need additional research. The study did not prove that early fatherhood causes depressive symptoms; it only showed an association between the two.\n\nPrevious research has shown that depressed dads are more likely to neglect their kids. The researchers theorized that becoming a father at a young age places more stress on a dad\'s life. Some of the symptoms that may be linked with men suffering from depression included increased anger and conflict with others, alcohol or drug abuse, violent behavior, losing weight, and isolation.\n\n""Parental depression has a detrimental effect on kids, especially during those first key years of parent-infant attachment,"" Garfield said.

The virus has slowed, but diagnoses and deaths are still occurring.\n\nThe World Health Organization reported a total of 157 confirmed/suspected cases of the virus in Guinea and 22 in Liberia, with death tolls having amassed to 101 and 14. Sierra Leone and Mali have numbers in the single digits for confirmed/suspected cases and deaths.\n\nIsolation and treatment centers provided by the Ministry of Health of Guinea in collaboration with Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization have helped halt the violent spread of the virus, and even guided eight people to recovery. There is no cure, vaccine, or official treatment for the virus, but doctors can help alleviate the symptoms with IV antibiotics and help with nutritional intake.\n\nThe journey has been particularly dangerous for health care workers, of which 15 reported symptoms of the Ebola virus. On April 7, the WHO reported 95 deaths in Guinea, seven deaths in Liberia, and 14 infected health care workers. This proves that there\'s been a gradual decrease in the virus\' prevalence, but it still remains a concern.\n\nAccording to Barbara Knust of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the first seven to 10 days after infection is the peak of the illness. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, fatigue, and muscle aches. The doctors try to mitigate the symptoms, but the only way to know if the virus is completely gone is to run numerous blood tests after a patient is symptom-free for a few days.\n\nAnd although the virus affects the body physically, mental health issues linger with the infected patients. The trauma of having experienced such an acute illness or losing a family member to the illness can negatively affect someone. This is especially true since those infected are quarantined; they feel poorly about themselves and have to deal with the stigma of the virus.\n\n""Health workers will do a lot of things, especially holding hands with [the patients], to publicly demonstrate that they\'re not afraid of these people,"" said Knust in this NPR article.', 'Medical staff from the World Health Organization as well as Doctors Without Borders flocked to Guinea following an unabated Ebola Virus outbreak that began in February.\nThe World Health Organization reported a total of 157 confirmed/suspected cases of the virus in Guinea and 22 in Liberia, with death tolls having amassed to 101 and 14.\nThe journey has been particularly dangerous for health care workers, of which 15 reported symptoms of the Ebola virus.\nOn April 7, the WHO reported 95 deaths in Guinea, seven deaths in Liberia, and 14 infected health care workers.\n""Health workers will do a lot of things, especially holding hands with [the patients], to publicly demonstrate that they\'re not afraid of these people,"" said Knust in this NPR article.']"

The doctor immediately called in the infectious disease experts who arranged for Abdullah to be admitted to the country’s isolation facility at Donka, one of the biggest hospitals in the Guinean capital Conakry. When a laboratory test confirmed that Abdullah was infected with Ebola, he was devastated.\n\n""I spent 10 days in the isolation ward,” says the 29-year-old father of twins who works as a retailer in the Guinean capital. “I was convinced that I would never again see my wife and kids.”\n\nAbdullah was cared for by specialists from the Guinean Ministry of Health supported by doctors and nurses from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and WHO, who are working together to run the isolation ward at Donka Teaching Hospital.\n\nWHO/M-A.

""I wasn’t sure he would survive. But his case shows that the care people are getting in the isolation ward is crucial and improves their odds of survival.""\n\nThere is neither a vaccine nor a specific treatment for Ebola virus disease. People who are severely ill with the disease require intensive medical support including oral rehydration salts or an intravenous drip for extra fluids, antimicrobial medicines, pain killers and nutritious food. The earlier they go to hospital and get appropriate care the higher their chance of survival.\n\nBy 14 April 2014, more than 100 people had been confirmed or suspected of having contracted Ebola in Guinea and more than half had died. But to-date, 9 patients who were admitted to this hospital have recovered and returned home in good health.\n\nOvercoming stigma\n\nBut recovery is not always the end of the battle for former Ebola patients. Many find it difficult to be accepted by their neighbours who are fearful of the disease.\n\nFanta S., a 24-year-old teacher from Conakry, who returned home after laboratory tests showed she was no longer infected with Ebola, felt the stigma of the disease.\n\nWHO/M-A.

Finally, his condition improved and his fever went down. When he had gone a couple of days without any symptoms including fever, diarrhoea, vomiting or bleeding, they took a new blood sample.\n\nAbdullah waited impatiently for the results and was incredibly pleased and relieved when he heard that the sample was negative.\n\n“I felt as if I was reborn and could not wait to hug my twins again,” he says. “The doctors really took great care of me and I’m telling everyone that people who are infected need to go to the hospital.”\n\nWhile it is safe for Abdullah to interact with others in his community, he will have to take some precautions when it comes to his bodily fluids, as the virus can remain there for at least three months. For example, he will have to use condoms to ensure that he doesn’t pass the virus to his wife.

We are reinforcing our support to partner organizations in Guinea and neighbouring countries to ensure urgently needed healthcare to those hit by the epidemic and to stop it from further expanding,” said Kristalina Georgieva, EU Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response.\n\nEU Commissioner for Development, Andris Piebalgs, commented: “The European\n\nCommission has been mobilizing experts and equipment at short notice to provide quick help on the ground. Good coordination is key in the international response to this outbreak and this is why we are also setting up a network of EU and African health institutes to exchange know-how in tackling this terrible disease.”\n\nFollowing a commitment of €500 000 from last week, the Commission has increased its assistance to help the affected communities in Guinea and neighbouring countries to €1.1 million.\n\nThe new funds will allow Médecins Sans Frontières to scale up the on-going interventions in the field of clinical management (such as the isolation of patients and psychosocial support), the tracing of suspected cases and the training and supply of personal protective equipment for health workers.\n\nThe statement also explained that the new funds would support the World Health Organization (WHO) in ensuring the epidemiological surveillance and providing medical supplies, equipment, transport logistics and health personnel.\n\nThree humanitarian experts from the Commission have been sent to Conakry and Monrovia to monitor the situation on the ground and liaise with local authorities and partners.\n\nMoreover, on 26 March six European specialists of the European Mobile Lab project (EMLab) for dangerous infectious diseases arrived in Gueckedou, Guinea, with a mobile laboratory unit. This consists of easily transportable equipment for high security virus manipulation packed in boxes.\n\nIt will substantially enhance the available capacity for rapid analyses of samples and confirmation of Ebola cases, reducing the number of undiagnosed cases and preventing the further spread of the disease, the statement said.\n\nThe EU is closely following the latest developments with its Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This has just issued a second Rapid Risk Assessment stating that the risk for EU citizens travelling or living in the affected countries remains “low”, and giving a series of recommendations on prevention.\n\nThis is the first Ebola virus outbreak registered in the region. It was publicly announced by the Guinean Government on 22 March, following French Institut Pasteur’s confirmed identification of Ebola virus in samples of cases initially thought to be Lassa fever, which is endemic to the region.\n\nTo date, 157 suspected cases including 101 deaths have been reported in Guinea and 21suspected cases in Liberia, out of which 10 resulted lethal.\n\nFirst discovered in DR Congo and Sudan in 1976, several outbreaks of this viral haemorrhagic fever have been reported in East and Central Africa, but not in West Africa.\n\nHighly contagious, human to human transmission of Ebola occurs by simple contact with blood and body fluids. No vaccine or treatment is yet available for this pathogen, one of the world’s most lethal with a case fatality rate of up to 90% depending on the strain.\n\nThe EMLab project is an initiative funded by the European Commission. It includes partners from Germany, Italy, France, Hungary, Switzerland, Slovenia and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs part of the international response to the current Ebola outbreak in Guinea,\n\nWHO and its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) requested lab experts of the EMLab project to support the Ministry of Health of Guinea in viral haemorrhagic fever diagnostics.\n\nThe team of experts is composed of scientists from the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine (Germany), the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology (Germany), the Istituto Nazionale per le Malattie Infettive L.

Certainly Australians should avoid direct contact with people who appear ill and not eat raw or undercooked meat, or indeed any kind of bush meat.""\n\nDr Timothy Newsome is a biochemistry and microbiology lecturer from Sydney University.\n\nDr Newsome says the only virus found in Australia which could be described as simillar to Ebola is the Hendra virus.\n\n""We do have another quite deadly virus disease which broadly speaking in a similar group as Ebola virus, and that\'s Hendra virus.

Generally speaking these cases are horses who get infected from bats. Suprisingly the bats seem to be okay harbouring Hendra virus. Those horses die and occasionally, the people who treat - particularily vets - who treat these horses can get infected, and it\'s got quite a high mortality rate in humans: about 50 per cent. So although it is a relatively rare occurence of humans getting infected, the high mortality rate does make it a risk.""\n\nHowever Dr Newsome says Hendra, unlike Ebola, can be prevented.\n\n""The CSIRO has recently developed a vaccine which can be used on horses and makes the jobs of our vets that little bit safer.""', '(Transcript from World News Radio)Guinea says it has brought the spread of the deadly Ebola virus under control after more than 100 deaths.\n(Click on audio tab to listen to this item)The World Health Organisation says African fruit bats are the natural hosts of the Ebola virus.\nDr Newsome says the only virus found in Australia which could be described as simillar to Ebola is the Hendra virus.\n""We do have another quite deadly virus disease which broadly speaking in a similar group as Ebola virus, and that\'s Hendra virus.\nLike Ebola virus, Hendra virus exists in an animal population.']"

Seven new deaths have been reported, pushing the fatality number to 108. So far 71 of the infections have been confirmed by lab tests.\n\nAs of Apr 11, the most recent illness onsets are Apr 10, in patients from Conakry, the capital, and Guekedou, an area in the forested area of southeastern Guinea, near where the outbreak is thought to have started. The onset date falls well within the disease's 2- to 21-day incubation period, a sign that that the outbreak is ongoing.\n\nThe WHO said doctors at the Donka Hospital isolation facility in Conakry are probing a cluster of patients who had funeral contact with a relative who died on Apr 1 from a suspected malaria infection. Two of the contacts were admitted on Apr 12 and tested positive for EVD. An internal medicine doctor who had treated the patient and later died is also part of the transmission chain. The WHO said he had symptoms of EVD but no bleeding and that his postmortem samples were positive for the virus.\n\nSo far 16 healthcare workers are among Guinea's EVD cases, and in 11 of those the infections were lab-confirmed. The WHO said efforts to promote safe burial practices are ongoing and that in response to the cluster, hospital officials are beefing up surveillance, triage procedures, and infection control.\n\nAs of Apr 10, 11 patients were still hospitalized, and 37 had been discharged. Medical teams are still monitoring 396 contacts.\n\nLiberia's health ministry is reporting one more EVD case as of Apr 11, raising that country's total to 26, according to the WHO. One more patient has died, edging the number of fatalities there to 13. Among the country's six lab-confirmed case-patients, three are healthcare workers.\n\nThe most recent clinical case was detected Apr 11, and the most recent lab-confirmed patient was hospitalized Apr 4. So three people remain hospitalized, and five who tested negative were discharged. Health officials are still monitoring 35 contacts.\n\nIn Mali, the total number of suspected cases remains at six—three in Bamako, the country's capital, and three in two different cities in the Koulikoro region. Tests on samples from the patients are under way at the Pasteur Institute in Senegal and results are expected shortly, the WHO said. Earlier results on two other suspected patients from Mali were negative.\n\nSee also:\n\nApr 14 WHO statement"", ""The new EVD cases in Guinea lift the country's outbreak total to 168.\nSo far 16 healthcare workers are among Guinea's EVD cases, and in 11 of those the infections were lab-confirmed.\nLiberia's health ministry is reporting one more EVD case as of Apr 11, raising that country's total to 26, according to the WHO.\nThe most recent clinical case was detected Apr 11, and the most recent lab-confirmed patient was hospitalized Apr 4.\nEarlier results on two other suspected patients from Mali were negative.""]"

More than ever, it is crucial that families have both the means and the right information to protect themselves and prevent dangerous misunderstandings.”\n\nIn collaboration with partners such as the Red Cross and the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF is stepping up efforts to design culturally-sensitive communication strategies and raise awareness of Ebola, at the grassroots level, across the seven at-risk or affected countries in West Africa.\n\nIn Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, Mali and Guinea Bissau, mass and digital media and inter-personal communication activities are being carried out to prevent people contracting the Ebola virus amongst communities and health workers in mosques, churches, schools, health centres and markets.\n\nAdditionally, UNICEF is providing critical prevention supplies, such as soap, chlorine, and gloves to the people in affected communities across West Africa.\n\nWest Africa is witnessing its first major outbreak of Ebola, which has no vaccine and no cure. The disease has already claimed 111 lives in Guinea and neighbouring Liberia as of 8 April 2014. In total, a growing number of 178 suspected, probable and confirmed cases has been reported in Guinea and Liberia, as well as six suspected cases in Mali.\n\n“Radio dramas, print materials, TV shows, and even voice messages are automatically sent to mobile phones — we use every appropriate means of communication to reach more people, spread the word in local languages and save lives,” adds Borghese. “We are running against time to avoid further spread in West Africa.”\n\n“Ebola kills people; but more lives are put at risk because of lack of information or misinformation though rumours,” stressed Borghese. “There is no existing vaccine against Ebola. Bringing patients with suspected symptoms to health centres as soon as possible increases their chances of survival and prevents other people from getting infected.”\n\nUNICEF is urgently appealing for US$1.2 million for Guinea and almost US$1.3 million for neighbouring countries including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Guinea Bissau and Mali, to provide disinfectant products, essential medicines, life-saving supplies and communication support crucially needed to stop Ebola from spreading further across West Africa.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) Regional Emergency Fund and the Japanese National Committee for UNICEF will contribute $ 100,000 each towards combating the outbreak.\n\nIn Guinea, UNICEF and partners are communicating life-saving information about the disease door-to-door and distributing posters and leaflets. In Liberia, UNICEF has worked with telecommunications companies to send out 500,000 text messages about Ebola.\n\nAcross Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire, UNICEF is taking part in local radio shows. In Cote d’Ivoire, in addition to hygiene equipment, UNICEF has supported health districts in the region of Man with four tents that have been set up as isolation centres. In Mali, UNICEF is helping to develop communication messages around hygiene practices to be disseminated through community radio networks in the affected regions.\n\nIn the most-affected areas of Guinea including the capital Conakry, UNICEF has distributed 77,400 bottles of liquid chlorine, more than 300,000 bars of soap, 150,000 pairs of gloves, 670 sprayers and 1,650kg of Calcium Hypochlorite (HCH) to medical workers and communities.\n\nIn Liberia, UNICEF has provided seven cholera kits, eight large tents to establish isolation units, 15,360 pieces of soap, 725 kg of chlorine and disinfectant products, 100 basic family water kits, 4,830 boxes of disinfectant, over 9,200 buckets and 2,360 jerry cans.\n\nIn addition, UNICEF is supplying national and local health authorities in Sierra Leone, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal and Mali with prevention medical equipment, including soap, gloves, tents, hygiene kits and two large isolation units, required to help contain and prevent Ebola.\n\nUNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do.

As of Thursday, 66 cases have been confirmed by laboratory analysis.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), cases were first reported from forested areas in south-eastern Guinea. The outbreak has rapidly evolved and several districts and Conakry have reported cases and deaths caused by the Ebola virus disease. A small number of suspected cases and deaths has also been reported from neighboring countries with all of them having crossed from Guinea. Confirmed cases have been reported from Guinea and Liberia.\n\nWHAT IS EBOLA VIRUS\n\nEbola virus was first discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo), taking its name from the Ebola River where the DR Congo outbreak was found in a nearby village.\n\nThe WHO defines the Ebola virus disease, formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, as ""a severe, often fatal illness"" and ""one of the world\'s most virulent diseases.""\n\nThe infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected animals or people. Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are health workers, family members and others in close contact with sick people and deceased patients.\n\nEbola virus disease outbreaks can devastate families and communities, but the infection can be controlled through the use of recommended protective measures in clinics and hospitals, at community gatherings, or at home.\n\nHOW DOES IT SPREAD\n\nIn Africa, fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of Ebola virus. The virus is transmitted from wildlife to people through contact with infected fruit bats, or through intermediate hosts, such as monkeys, apes, or pigs that have themselves become infected through contact with bat saliva or faeces.\n\nPeople may then become infected through contact with infected animals, either in the process of slaughtering or through consumption of blood, milk, or raw or undercooked meat.\n\nThe virus is then passed from person to person through direct contact with the blood, secretions or other bodily fluids of infected persons, or from contact with contaminated needles or other equipment in the environment.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS\n\nSigns and symptoms of the Ebola virus disease often include the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, nausea and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings frequently include low white blood cell and platelet counts and elevated liver enzymes.\n\nThe incubation period, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is two to 21 days. People remain infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus, a period that has been reported to be as long as 61 days after onset of illness.\n\nHOW TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT THE DISEASE\n\nDefinitive diagnosis of the disease is made through laboratory testing. Because samples from patients are a source of infection risk for others, testing is conducted under maximum biological containment conditions.\n\nNo vaccine is available, nor is there any specific treatment. Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. Patients are frequently dehydrated and require oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes, or intravenous fluids.\n\nHOW TO PREVENT IT\n\nRaising awareness of the risk factors for infection and the protective measures that should be taken is the only way to reduce human infection and subsequent deaths, says the WHO.\n\nClose unprotected physical contact with Ebola patients should be avoided.\n\nAppropriate use of gloves and personal protective equipment (including hand hygiene before putting on, and especially after taking off personal protective equipment) should be practiced when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.\n\nAlmost all transmission of the virus to health-care workers has been reported when basic infection control measures have not been observed. Health-care workers caring for any patient should practice standard precautions. When caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus infection, health-care workers should apply, in addition to standard precautions, other infection control measures to avoid any exposure to patients\' blood and body fluids and with possibly contaminated environments.\n\nPreparation for burial of the bodies of persons who have died from Ebola virus disease also carries high risks of transmission of the virus. Those who have died from the disease should be promptly and safely buried.', 'The outbreak has rapidly evolved and several districts and Conakry have reported cases and deaths caused by the Ebola virus disease.\nThe WHO defines the Ebola virus disease, formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, as ""a severe, often fatal illness"" and ""one of the world\'s most virulent diseases.""\nHOW DOES IT SPREADIn Africa, fruit bats are believed to be the natural hosts of Ebola virus.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMSSigns and symptoms of the Ebola virus disease often include the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, nausea and sore throat.\nPreparation for burial of the bodies of persons who have died from Ebola virus disease also carries high risks of transmission of the virus.']"

They are survivors of the latest outbreak of Ebola.\n\nEbola often grabs global headlines as the killer virus that can result in a death rate of up to 90 percent. But in Guinea, the death rate in the current outbreak has been about 60 percent. So there are survivors — to the delight of the overworked doctors, health workers and, of course, the patients who have recovered.\n\n""I feel reborn,"" says a vivacious young woman who chose not to give her name because of the stigma associated with the virus. She had tested positive for Ebola and was admitted to the isolation unit in the treatment center run by Doctors Without Borders, a cluster of tents located on the grounds of the main public hospital in Conakry, the capital city.\n\nHer face wreathed in a smile, she tells how she went in with a raging fever and other telltale Ebola symptoms: ""When I was admitted everyone was saying there\'s no cure, there\'s no vaccine, and I was frightened. That alone could kill you.""\n\nA week later, she was discharged. ""I\'m out — I\'ve totally recovered, and I thank God and the doctors for helping me,"" she says.\n\nShe is one of a handful of patients cleared to go home.\n\nThe first person to recover from Ebola and be discharged from the hospital in Conakry is a 30-year-old doctor, who also wants to remain anonymous. He was diagnosed after he began feeling unwell and went for a blood test and checkup.\n\nOther medical professionals call this slight and reserved man a hero, for helping other Ebola patients in isolation. The recovery of the physician and others has given extra motivation to the medical staff, says Henry Gray, emergency coordinator in Guinea for Doctors Without Borders.\n\n""Seeing some of our patients actually survive and walk out under their own steam, it\'s brilliant,"" says Gray. ""For the patients themselves, they sometimes feel as though they\'re fighting against all odds, and when they do come through it, there\'s joy in what is often a sad and difficult place to work.""\n\nBut with survival can come stigma, he warns.\n\n""The community must understand that the survivor does not pose a threat,"" he says. The education falls to the medical team assembled by Doctors Without Borders, which includes local medics and others from the World Health Organization, the local Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross. They all are in close contact with the Ministry of Health as well as political, religious and traditional leaders. ""But that is a work in progress,"" Gray admits. ""In Guinea, Ebola is an unknown disease; they\'re not used to it.""\n\nThe community may think a person is still contagious, says the anonymous doctor who has recovered from the disease. With that fear may come rejection, marginalization and isolation.\n\nHe was pained to see how close friends shunned his wife and wouldn\'t eat the food she cooked — or buy the ginger juice she sells. But her physician husband says he understands people\'s misgivings.\n\nLike the majority of Guineans, he and his wife are Muslims. ""My wife is very religious,"" says the doctor, and Islam is a religion of forgiveness in his household. ""She has forgiven them,"" he notes of the nervous acquaintances and neighbors. And now, day by day, the friends are coming back to their house to visit.\n\nCopyright NPR 2019.', 'They are survivors of the latest outbreak of Ebola.\nEbola often grabs global headlines as the killer virus that can result in a death rate of up to 90 percent.\nSo there are survivors — to the delight of the overworked doctors, health workers and, of course, the patients who have recovered.\nOther medical professionals call this slight and reserved man a hero, for helping other Ebola patients in isolation.\n""In Guinea, Ebola is an unknown disease; they\'re not used to it.""']"
119869,http://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/apr/11/how-a-patient-can-recover-from-ebola/,health,"['At least eight Ebola patients in Guinea have beaten the odds. They have recovered and been sent home. In past outbreaks, the death rate has been as high as 90 percent. In Guinea so far, about 60 percent of the 157 suspected cases have ended in death.\n\nThe first seven to 10 days after infection is the ""peak of the illness,"" when people are most likely to die, says Barbara Knust, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But if the body begins to produce antibodies to fight off the infection, then there\'s hope.\n\nDoctors on the scene think the treatment regimen may play a role in boosting survival odds.\n\n""It\'s hard to say conclusively that what we are able to give treatmentwise is causing that increased survival rate,"" says Tom Fletcher, an infectious diseases physician who is with the World Health Organization team in Guinea. ""But we think interventions such as intravenous fluids, IV antibiotics and paying attention to symptom control and nutrition are probably all important."" Such care has not always been available to patients during past Ebola episodes.\n\nAdds critical care doctor Rob Fowler, also with WHO: ""Outbreaks happen in places where it\'s very challenging to deliver medical care. Even when there\'s no specific therapy for the virus, with supportive care, people can have much better outcomes.""\n\nThe first encouraging sign is when the symptoms fade — fever, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, fatigue and muscle aches. If a patient is symptom-free for several days, doctors run repeat blood tests to see if any virus remains in the bloodstream. ""We\'re fortunate to have an Institut Pasteur lab here that gives us a result within four hours,"" Fletcher says.\n\nBut there are twists to this scenario, says Marie-Christine Férir, Brussels-based emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. A man\'s blood may be free of Ebola, but the virus can persist in semen for two to three months after recovery. (That\'s because antibodies produced in the bloodstream don\'t reach the testicles.) Since Ebola can be transmitted through sexual contact, male survivors are sent home with condoms and instructed to use them for the next three months if they engage in intercourse.\n\nThe virus can also linger in breast milk, so mothers are told to wean any child who had been breast-feeding.\n\nA clear blood test doesn\'t always mean a survivor is ready to be discharged. ""The virus can really weaken a person, [and] they can lose a lot of weight,"" Knust says. ""Sometimes they need extra support to get healthy enough so they aren\'t at risk of a secondary infection.""\n\nA Guinean physician, who was infected with Ebola but recovered, said he regained his strength by eating PlumpyNut — and got a psychological boost from the encouragement and guidance of his caregivers.\n\nEbola survivors do not have to worry about contracting the disease again, says Pierre Rollin, deputy director of the viral special pathogens branch of CDC, who has traveled to the site of previous Ebola epidemics over the past 20 years. ""When they start to test negative, they\'re going to remain negative for the rest of their lives.""\n\nMental health is another matter. Health care workers often check on patients in their homes to see how they are faring after the trauma of suffering through Ebola — and perhaps losing family members to the disease as well. They must also deal with the stigma associated with having had the virus.\n\nHealth workers teach the community that the Ebola survivor cannot infect them.\n\n""They will do a lot of things, especially holding hands with [the patients], to publicly demonstrate that they\'re not afraid of these people,"" says Knust.\n\nAdds Férir: ""[In the past] we would bring the patient into the middle of the village, and we would give a big kiss to the patient to show that it\'s OK, no problem.""\n\nCopyright 2014 NPR.

So it’s no surprise that a new round of allergy medications are getting approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — though they probably should have looked to an earlier release — the most recent of which is Merck’s Grastek, a sublingual — going under the tongue — pill for treating grass allergies.\n\nGrastek is the second sublingual oral immunotherapy (SLIT) to be approved this month and the first of three that Merck plans to market, MedPage Today reported. Once placed under the tongue, it dissolves and super small doses of timothy grass extract are released into the body with the purpose of weaning a person’s allergies out of severity. Although it’s only made with the extract of timothy grass pollen, it’s cross reactive, and therefore can help treat other grass allergies as well, including sweet vernal, orchard, perennial rye, Kentucky blue, and red top.\n\nLate-stage trials showed that the drug was able to reduce allergy symptoms in patients by almost 20 percent, compared to a placebo, according to Fierce Biotech. It’s been approved for use among those who suffer from grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis in adults up to 65 and children as young as 5. Merck may have been a little late, considering that allergy season has already started, because a person who plans on going on Grastek must begin treatment at least 12 weeks before the season begins — Merck plans to start marketing the tablets with partner ALK-abello at the end of the month.\n\nStill, the tablets could be a good alternative to current injection treatments, which have been trusted for years. “Every grass pollen season, many patients with moderate to severe allergic rhinitis experience nasal and ocular allergy symptoms at their worst while taking symptom-relieving medication,” said Dr. David Bernstein, professor of medicine and environmental health in the Division of Immunology, Allergy and Rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, in a Merck press release. “These patients often have multiple sensitivities. Some of these patients may be candidates for immunotherapy, but decline allergy shots. With the FDA approval of Grastek, allergy specialists now have a new sublingual approach to offer these patients for their grass allergies.”\n\nBut Grastek is the second SLIT to be approved. Earlier this month, French pharmaceutical company Stallergenes got Oralair approved for use among five of the same grasses that Grastek treats, Medscape reported. Late-stage trials showed that it was 16 to 30 percent effective in reducing allergy symptoms. Although they are sure to become competitors, Oralair was only approved for children as young as 10.\n\nBoth medications would be prescribed with a required auto-injectable epinephrine prescription, as it’s possible for patients to experience adverse effects. Reported side effects for both include itchy mouths and throat irritation.', 'Grastek is the second sublingual oral immunotherapy (SLIT) to be approved this month and the first of three that Merck plans to market, MedPage Today reported.\nLate-stage trials showed that the drug was able to reduce allergy symptoms in patients by almost 20 percent, compared to a placebo, according to Fierce Biotech.\nWith the FDA approval of Grastek, allergy specialists now have a new sublingual approach to offer these patients for their grass allergies.”But Grastek is the second SLIT to be approved.\nEarlier this month, French pharmaceutical company Stallergenes got Oralair approved for use among five of the same grasses that Grastek treats, Medscape reported.\nLate-stage trials showed that it was 16 to 30 percent effective in reducing allergy symptoms.']"

Grass pollen allergies tend to start from late spring to early summer, after which the grass grown carries pollen across. Grasses like Orchard grass, Bermuda grass, Redtop grass, Timothy grass are to name a few which affects hundreds in United States and across. A recent drug has been launched by Merck and Co to fight allergies related to grass pollen better. The drug Grastek, has recently received approval from the US Food and Drug administration is given clearance to launch.\n\nMerck’s Grastek, is the second drug immunotherapy treatment to be launched in the recent time within a couple of weeks interval. This drug was developed with Denmark’s ALK Abello. This drug is aimed for people between 5 to 65 years of age. This drug is expected to be launch by April this year.\n\nAnti allergic drugs are designed protect the body from allergens. These drugs are immunotherapeutic and work by boosting the person’s immune system. Our body is thus made less sensitive to allergens. People particularly allergic to the extracts of timothy grass, are the target group for Grastek administration. This drug specifically protects this allergen. It will be launched commercially in the form of tablets that could be orally consumed. FDA also approved on the launch of Stallergenes, earlier this month. It is protective against five types of grass pollen.\n\nGrastek was previously recommended by the approval committee of FDA, last December. The drug will shortly undergo post approval studies to check its safety in children. The committee has also advised to screen it for possible side effects like throat irritation, oral blistering and swelling of lips.

Along with partner ALK-abello, Merck ($MRK) plans to launch the treatment by the end of the month, targeting the roughly 7.5 million Americans with moderate to severe timothy grass allergies.\n\nGrastek will carry a boxed warning advising doctors of its risks of severe allergic reactions in certain patient groups. In late-stage studies, Merck\'s drug beat out placebo in reducing allergenic symptoms by about 20%, and the company touts Grastek as a needed new option for patients with severe allergies.\n\nBut the real challenge will likely come in trying to convince allergists to shift away from the tried-and-true shots. Injection regimens are inconvenient and can\'t be done at home, but they\'re cheap and well-trusted among doctors, and analysts are less than optimistic Merck can make much commercial headway with Grastek; peak sales estimates hover around $200 million a year.\n\nAnd Merck is second in line among makers of oral immunotherapies, as France\'s Stallergenes won FDA approval for Grastek competitor Oralair earlier this month. Both companies tout their drugs as shot-beating alternatives to standard therapy, but each may fall victim to timing: Patients are meant to start taking the ascending-dose drugs months before the expected start of allergy season, meaning their peak opportunity is unlikely to come before next winter.\n\nStill, the prevalence of serious allergies means millions of patients each year are faced with severe reactions despite drug treatment, Grastek investigator David Bernstein said in a statement, and injections aren\'t a panacea.\n\n""Some of these patients may be candidates for immunotherapy, but decline allergy shots,"" said Bernstein, a professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. ""With the FDA approval of Grastek, allergy specialists now have a new sublingual approach to offer these patients for their grass allergies.""\n\nGrastek picked up Canadian approval earlier this year and has been on the market in Europe since 2006.
