The iPhone 4s, a device first released in 2011, remains available for RMB 3,288.The limited launch of the 8-gigabyte iPhone 5c would seem to suggest that Apple has selectively picked markets where it believes the new price point could help find some success.In a statement to Re/code, Apple said the update was intended to support new LTE networks, as the iPhone 4s does not have an LTE high-speed radio.""The mid-tier iPhone segment is growing year-over-year and the 8GB model provides a more affordable option for markets where LTE is becoming more established,"" the company said.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook himself admitted in January that the iPhone 5c hasn\'t found the level of sales the company hoped it would.

If they’re not coming up with new models of smart devices they re-launch old models, updating them to current needs. This might be just a calculated marketing strategy or they really have something new to show us in the agglomerated realm of smart devices. Rumors say that they’ve already re-launched the iPad 4 in stores because they want to take out the outdated cousin which is the iPad 2. Let’s see what this is all about.\n\nThe iPad 4 was launched in 2012 and was taken off the shelves, replacing it with the lighter and slimmer iPad Air in October 2013. This time Apple wants to replace the Ipad 2 with new version of iPad 4 that has a 9 inch Retina display and are for sale again on Apple’s website, available in black and white with a 16GB memory.\n\nThe new iPad 4 has a Lighting connector just like the iPad mini, iPad Air and iPad mini Retina.

It retired the 2011-era iPad 2 and replaced it with the iPad 4 as the company\'s entry-level, full-sized tablet. The company also made a rare price cut, dropping the cost of the iPhone 5c by about $70 in an attempt to make it more appealing.\n\nThe iPad 2, which hit store shelves three years ago, aged fairly well. It was thin and light, offered good battery life, and did nearly everything its successors did. Perhaps its weakest feature was the low-resolution screen. Even with the 1024 x 768 pixel display, however, Apple sold vast numbers of the 16-GB model. At $399, the iPad 2 represented a good value. It was popular with educational customers seeking the app access offered by iOS in an affordable package.\n\nLast October Apple introduced the iPad Air, which replaced the iPad 4 as the company\'s top-of-the-line tablet. The iPad 4 went away, but Apple continued selling the iPad 2 -- still at $399. It appears as though Apple\'s supply of iPad 2s finally ran dry. The company has officially retired the iPad 2. In its place, it brought back the iPad 4, which is a two-generation leap over the iPad 2.\n\n[Google\'s helping developers play nice with Apple. See GDC: Google Play Games To Support iOS.]\n\n""Now for $399 customers can get iPad with a stunning 9.7-inch Retina display, fast A6X chip, and 5-MP iSight camera, offering a dramatic upgrade in power, performance, and value compared to the iPad 2 it replaces,"" said Philip Schiller, Apple\'s senior VP of worldwide marketing in a statement. ""The iPad line sets the gold standard in mobile computing, and all iPads have access to the largest and best ecosystem of more than 500,000 iPad optimized apps from the App Store.""\n\nApple is selling only a 16-GB version of the iPad 4, though it is offering an LTE variant for $130 more ($529). This is an incredible value, considering all the features of the iPad 4. Apple\'s 16-GB, WiFi only tablet lineup now looks like this: The original iPad Mini costs $299, the iPad Mini with Retina Display costs $399, the iPad 4 with Retina Display costs $399, and the iPad Air costs $499. Doubling the storage costs an extra $100 per increment, and adding LTE costs an additional $130.\n\nIf you\'re questioning the shared price point between the iPad Mini with Retina Display and the iPad 4 -- both of which cost $399 -- remember that the iPad Mini has superior innards. It has an updated processor, better cameras, and many other improvements that the iPad 4 does not.\n\nEngage with Oracle president Mark Hurd, NFL CIO Michelle McKenna-Doyle, General Motors CIO Randy Mott, Box founder Aaron Levie, UPMC CIO Dan Drawbaugh, GE Power CIO Jim Fowler, and other leaders of the Digital Business movement at the InformationWeek Conference and Elite 100 Awards Ceremony, to be held in conjunction with Interop in Las Vegas, March 31 to April 1, 2014.

But there's also no doubt that it gives you more value in that slot than the three-year-old iPad 2.\n\nIf you need a quick refresher, the iPad 4 had the same 9.7-in Retina Display and external chassis as its early 2012 predecessor, the iPad 3. Its biggest upgrade over that model was an A6X system-on-a-chip (which made it noticeably faster) as well as a Lightning port for charging and data transfer.\n\nThe iPad 4 has the same display as the iPad Air, but is thicker and heavier (and has a slower processor)\n\nWhy make this switch now? Well, no matter how many people were buying the iPad 2, it just wasn't a good value for customers at $400. But the reason for the timing probably relates to supply chain deals. It was almost exactly two years ago that Apple first put the iPad 2 in that $400 slot. If the company made one- or two-year deals to outsource its parts, then that explains why this shift would happen now, and not, say, back in November when the iPad Air launched.\n\nIn addition to the Wi-Fi only 4th-gen iPad, you can also pick up a 16 GB Wi-Fi + cellular model for $530. For more on the iPad 4, you can revisit our review from late 2012, or hit up our comparison of the last four full-sized iPads.\n\nSource: Apple"", ""If you've shopped for an iPad anytime during the last few years, you've probably run into the iPad 2.\nWell, you can finally kiss the iPad 2 goodbye, as Apple just laid it to rest in favor of the much more powerful iPad 4.\nThat's only $100 cheaper than the lighter, thinner, and faster iPad Air (and the same price as the Retina iPad mini), so that's still a hefty chunk of change for an 18-month-old tablet.\nIf you need a quick refresher, the iPad 4 had the same 9.7-in Retina Display and external chassis as its early 2012 predecessor, the iPad 3.\nThe iPad 4 has the same display as the iPad Air, but is thicker and heavier (and has a slower processor)Why make this switch now?""]"

The new 8GB model of the mid-tier, plastic-backed version of the iPhone has half as much memory of the next-cheapest model, and gets a modest price cut in the process. In the UK, the new model costs £429 (about $712), or just £40 ($66) cheaper than the 16GB model.\n\nThe phone, first released in September, was supposed to act as a toehold for Apple in the mid- and low-range market as the demand for high-end smartphones such as the iPhone 5s starts to level off across the globe. But even with cheaper material costs, Apple chose to price the phone at $99 on-contract and $549 off-contract. That hardly made it the bargain phone that many expected the firm to launch to pick up first-time smartphone buyers in countries where carriers don\'t heavily subsidize the cost of phones, such as China.\n\nEven at the new price, there are still legions of phones running Google\'s Android operating system that may better suit the wallets of new smartphone buyers. But while a really cheap phone may help Apple sales, chief executive Tim Cook has also been clear that Apple cares less about taking a big share of the market than it does about profits -- meaning that it\'s unlikely to take a full-on jump into the budget smartphone market as companies such as Samsung, Huawei and ZTE have done.\n\nThat said, it shouldn\'t be that surprising that Apple is making some tweaks to its product line. Cook said in the company\'s last financial earnings call that the mix of iPhone models wasn\'t exactly what the firm had expected, with lower-than-expected demand for the cheaper, colorful phone.\n\n""If we think it\'s in our best interest to make a change, then we\'ll make one,"" he said at the time.\n\nApple also shuffled its iPad lineup Tuesday, opting to discontinue the iPad 2 and revive its 4th-generation iPad as the entry point for its tablet line.\n\nThe fourth-generation iPad temporarily disappeared from the product line with last year\'s introduction of the iPad Air, but it\'s now back in the store with a 16 GB model. The tablet has a 9.7-inch Retina display and an A6x chip, and costs $399 -- the same price as the smaller but faster iPad mini.

While it’s not available in the U.S.—currently, anyway—some of Apple’s international stores are now quietly offering an 8GB version of the iPhone 5c.\n\nThe model, which is available in several European countries (the UK, France, and Germany) as well as Australia and China, seems to come in at about 8 to 9 percent cheaper than the 16GB model. Of course, in most of those countries Apple sells the Phone unlocked and unsubsidized by local carriers, meaning that the prices are much higher than what those of us here in the U.S. are accustomed to.\n\nBut the price difference between the 8GB and 16GB in most places seems to be much smaller than that between the 16GB and 32GB models, leaving many to wonder about the appeal of the 8GB model. For example, in the UK, the 8GB model is on sale for £429 (about $712), the 16GB for £469 ($778), and the 32GB for £549 ($911). Meanwhile, the 8GB iPhone 4s sells for £349 ($579).\n\nAn 8GB device is rather on the limited size for most users, when it comes to media, photos, or even apps. (Personally, I have enough trouble managing space on a 16GB iPad mini.) Given that the iPhone 4s is likely to be the model that appeals to the truly budget-conscious customer, it’s hard to peg exactly who the 8GB iPhone 5c is for. While Apple may be hoping that the cheaper price for the newer model gets customers in the door and provides the opportunity to sell them up to the 16GB model, the price cut doesn’t seem aggressive enough to attract a bevy of new customers.\n\nIt’s also not unlikely that Apple has targeted certain countries as places where a slightly cheaper iPhone 5c will find some traction. In particular, the inclusion of China—one place Apple has been aggressively trying to boost iPhone sales—suggests that the company is deploying the 8GB model where it may make the most difference to its bottom line.\n\nAs for whether the 8GB model will find its way to the U.S., it’s unclear. By most accounts, the iPhone 5s has been the far more popular of the two models Apple introduced last year, but Apple could try and drive more customers to the iPhone 5c by introducing the 8GB model at a $49 price point halfway between the free (with contract) 8GB iPhone 4s and $99 16GB iPhone 5c.', 'While it’s not available in the U.S.—currently, anyway—some of Apple’s international stores are now quietly offering an 8GB version of the iPhone 5c.\nMeanwhile, the 8GB iPhone 4s sells for £349 ($579).\nGiven that the iPhone 4s is likely to be the model that appeals to the truly budget-conscious customer, it’s hard to peg exactly who the 8GB iPhone 5c is for.\nIt’s also not unlikely that Apple has targeted certain countries as places where a slightly cheaper iPhone 5c will find some traction.\nAs for whether the 8GB model will find its way to the U.S., it’s unclear.']"
17498,http://www.dazeinfo.com/2014/03/18/apple-inc-aapl-iphone-5c-8gb-price/,technology,"['Update 1: Apple has reduced the price of iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S by $100. The 16 GB version of iPhone 5C is available at $549 now. This clearly indicates that 8GB version of iPhone 5C will be much more cheaper, atleast down by another $50 or so.\n\nAs we reported earlier, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is now set to introduce the lower version of the iPhone 5C with 8 GB storage option at $549 $500 on May 18, 2014. According to a few leaked images and screen shots, Apple is all set to intensify the competition in Smartphone market by making another round of price cut in iPhone 5C. However, this time the company has also downgraded the storage capacity from 16GB to 8GB. Currently, Apple’s 16GB iPhone 5C is available on Apple Store for $649 and we have learnt that Apple has planned to cut down $85 to $100 for the 8GB variant of iPhone 5C.\n\nApple is trying to position the new 8GB iPhone 5C as the attraction point in the midrange smartphone market, largely dominated by Samsung with Galaxy 4 and Note 2. It’s also being anticipated that Apple could reintroduce the discontinued variants of iPad – iPad 4 and iPad 3 – with a steep price cut to eat into Nexus 10 and Samsung Galaxy Tab markets.\n\nApple iPhone 5C 8GB: A Game Changer?\n\nThe move is being seen as an effort to break the jinx in emerging markets, especially China and India. The two countries together, hold maximum number of mobile phone users with a big window of opportunity in the Smartphone market in near future. More than 2.2 billion mobile phone subscribers, together in China and India, make the APAC region the largest mobile phone market for any vendor in the world. Samsung is already enjoying the biggest pie of the market, while other local players in China and India – the likes of Micromax, Karbonn, Huawei, Lenovo, ZTE are already marking their presence by capturing a sizable market share in their respective country.\n\nApple maintains 21.6% of total smartphone market in China. In India the market share of iPhone remains in single digits, despite of a 400% growth after the aggressive price cut in iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. This puts Apple on the losing front as the iPhone maker is failing to grab a sizable share of newly developing smartphone market quarter over quarter. Apple’s disappointing growth rate continues in the global market as well, as the company is failing to accelerate its growth due to non-existence in the mid-range Smartphone market.\n\nWhile the U.S. market has saturated, Apple is left with no choice but to accept the law-of-the-land. Both China and India are known as price sensitive markets and Apple’s future growth is largely reliant on the Smartphone market in these two countries. In 2013, India had recorded a whopping 172% YOY growth in Smartphone market, while in China it is on its way to touch 1 billion smartphone users. In both the countries more than 40% of the smartphone market is controlled by mid-price-range ($150 – $449) smartphones, which is an untapped market for Apple.\n\nSmartphone Market: Price Way Has Begun\n\nThe whole world is eyeing APAC as the biggest opportunity in the Smartphone market for the next few years. In China 540 million mobile phone users (1.24 billion mobile phone users, 700 million Smartphone users) are yet to adopt a Smartphone, while in India the opportunity window for Smartphone vendors in India is even bigger as 820 million mobile phone users (900 million mobile phone users, 80 million Smartphone users) are yet to upgrade to a Smartphone.\n\nConsidering such a humongous growth opportunity in the Smartphone market, homegrown players are betting big time on the market. Besides, the new entrants like Obi – a mid range Smartphone brand, to be floated by Apple’s former CEO John Sculley – will fuel the price war in the region in future.\n\nThe homegrown Smartphone vendors – the likes of Micromax, Karbonn, Huawei, Gionee, ZTE, Lenovo, Coolpad, have triggered the price war and have been keeping global players Samsung, Nokia, LG, Sony on their toes for long.\n\nApple Wants To Double The iPhone Market Share In 2014\n\nIn 2013, Apple sold 153.2 million units of the iPhone and 73.6 million units of the iPad worldwide. According to a few market predictions Apple could sell 250 million units of the iPhone in 2014. In China alone, Apple is expected to sell nearly 20 million units of iPhone, while Foxconn is expecting to manufacture 90 million units of iPhone 6 during this year.\n\nIn India, Apple is actively working on the new pricing strategy for obsolete the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S. This could help Apple place its bet into the entry-level Smartphone market in price sensitive regions like India and China. Reports claim that Apple could make another price-cut to bring down the price of iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S to $250 and $350, respectively.\n\nAs 41% of worldwide shoppers prioritise price while switching brands, the new price strategy could be helpful for a brand being aspired the most at global level. Apple has emerged as the most desirable brand in developing countries including China, India and Brazil. 42% buyers in China voted for Apple as their next mobile brand, while in India 29% aspire for Apple. Overall, Apple remains at the top as 32% buyers across all 5 developing countries voted for the iPhone.\n\nIn a nutshell, Apple is changing and changing in a big way. Since Tim Cook has started steering the company, a number of strategy shifts have been introduced. If Apple can successfully tap into all the three market segments for Smartphones – iPhone 4 for entry level, iPhone 5C mid range and iPhone 6 for premium Smartphone users – it will definitely give the other Smartphone vendors a run for their money.', 'Update 1: Apple has reduced the price of iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S by $100.\nThis clearly indicates that 8GB version of iPhone 5C will be much more cheaper, atleast down by another $50 or so.\nCurrently, Apple’s 16GB iPhone 5C is available on Apple Store for $649 and we have learnt that Apple has planned to cut down $85 to $100 for the 8GB variant of iPhone 5C.\nApple iPhone 5C 8GB: A Game Changer?\nSmartphone Market: Price Way Has BegunThe whole world is eyeing APAC as the biggest opportunity in the Smartphone market for the next few years.']"

With a contract, it’s selling for £429 in the U.K., at £40 less than the 16-GB model.\n\nWhile this lower-capacity 5C has yet to show up on Apple’s U.S. site, that could happen later today.\n\nApple is clearly looking for sales at the very low end of the market, where it currently dangles the older iPhone 4S as bait. But by offering an iPhone 5C with only 8 GB of storage, it’s not doing customers who would buy it any favors.\n\nThat’s because, typically, iOS 7 eats up almost 4 GB of space all on its own, before adding any apps or media. The UK tech blog Which? looked at different smartphones earlier this year to see just how much available space each has out of the box. A 16-GB iPhone 5C has 12.6 GB, which means 3.4 is taken up by the operating system and preinstalled apps.\n\nIf you apply that figure to an 8-GB 5C, you’re left with a paltry 4.6 GB. Most people I know with 16-GB iPhones struggle with managing available space, so an 8-GB model would be even more agonizing as you add music, photos, videos and documents. The 8-GB iPhone 5C thus comes with an extra “feature” – the frustration of coping with inadequate storage.\n\nIn addition, Apple also began selling a 16-GB, fourth-generation iPad with Retina Display to replace the older iPad 2 as a budget offering. The Wi-Fi-only model sells for $399; add 4G cellular capability and the price goes to $429. This is the same 9.7-inch iPad that was replaced last year by the iPad Air. The only change from the original is that it uses the smaller, Lightning connector rather than the old 30-pin one.\n\nI was surprised when Apple didn’t ditch the iPad 2 for the third- or fourth-gen model with the introduction of the iPad Air. The company may have kept the older model around for better margins, or because of supply constraints on Retina displays. Whatever the reason, it’s good to see Apple has finally moved on.\n\nUpdate: The 8-GB 5C won’t be sold in the U.S., but rather only in five overseas markets, Re/code reports. Apple offered a an explanation for a cheaper, low-capacity device:\n\n“The mid-tier iPhone segment is growing year over year and the 8GB model provides a more affordable option for markets where LTE is becoming more established,” an Apple representative told Re/code. The iPhone 5c, unlike the iPhone 4s, which is also still sold, supports LTE networks.', 'As had been rumored, Apple today started selling a version of its iPhone 5C with only 8 gigabytes of memory.\nBut by offering an iPhone 5C with only 8 GB of storage, it’s not doing customers who would buy it any favors.\nA 16-GB iPhone 5C has 12.6 GB, which means 3.4 is taken up by the operating system and preinstalled apps.\nThe 8-GB iPhone 5C thus comes with an extra “feature” – the frustration of coping with inadequate storage.\nThe iPhone 5c, unlike the iPhone 4s, which is also still sold, supports LTE networks.']"

The feature set is almost identical to the model with which we’re already familiar, but the storage capacity has dropped down to 8GB, half the amount of the previous entry level phone. At the time of writing, the 8GB iPhone 5C has only appeared in the UK online Apple Store, while the U.S. site still shows only the 16GB and 32GB version.\n\nThe reduction in storage capacity also brings a much needed drop in price. However, it’s still not exactly a bargain, as you’ll need to part with £430 to secure an 8GB phone. This is £50 cheaper than the 16GB model, or £120 less than the 32GB iPhone 5C. Prior to the iPhone 5C’s announcement, it was speculated the C would stand for cheap. While it’s less expensive than the iPhone 5S, it can’t quite match the influx of high quality, low-cost Android hardware such as the Moto X and Moto G.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the 8GB phone will make it to the U.S. yet, but if it does, the unlocked, SIM-free price could be $500. This is based on the $100 leap between the 16GB and 32GB model. With a two-year contract, the new model may cost $50.\n\nBy introducing an 8GB model, Apple has found a way of cutting the cost a little more, but at the expense of a very important resource. There’s no way to bump the storage capacity on an iPhone, on the device at least, and with many high-end games and apps taking up to 1GB of space each, new owners run the risk of filling it up very quickly.\n\nAs per earlier rumors, the 8GB iPhone 5C’s launch is also joined by the re-introduction of the iPad 4, which replaces the aging iPad 2 at the bottom of Apple’s tablet range. Now referred to as the iPad Retina Display, the tablet is available in the U.S. Apple Store, where it’s priced at $400 for the 16GB Wi-Fi model, or $530 if you’d like cellular connectivity too.\n\nEditors' Recommendations"", 'Apple has launched a new iPhone 5C model.\nAt the time of writing, the 8GB iPhone 5C has only appeared in the UK online Apple Store, while the U.S. site still shows only the 16GB and 32GB version.\nHowever, it’s still not exactly a bargain, as you’ll need to part with £430 to secure an 8GB phone.\nThis is £50 cheaper than the 16GB model, or £120 less than the 32GB iPhone 5C.\nBy introducing an 8GB model, Apple has found a way of cutting the cost a little more, but at the expense of a very important resource.']"

The UK, French, German and Chinese Apple stores are all selling the 8GB 5c, but as of yet, there is no 8GB 5c available to U.S. customers.\n\nOn Monday, a leaked memo from the German wireless carrier O2 heralded the arrival of a new 8GB iPhone 5c. The internal email indicated that a new 8GB iPhone 5C would be going on sale Tuesday, March 18, for €509 ($707), which is a price reduction of €60 from the 16GB price tag of €569 ($791).\n\nWhile the German O2 store doesn’t show the unsubsidized cost of a new 8GB 5c, it’s currently retailing for €549 on the German online Apple store (the 16GB retails for €599 while the 32GB is going for €699). The UK store has the 8GB 5c going for £429, which is £40 cheaper than the 16GB at £469. And the French store has the 8GB priced at €559, which is €50 cheaper than the 16GB.\n\nIt looks like an 8GB 5c is also available in China (RBM 4,088, or $660) but not Latin America.\n\nSo. Okay. Apple is publicly recognizing that it has a problem. The iPhone 5c sales are pitiful—abject—doleful. Sales have been so bad that Apple reportedly cut production in half just weeks after launch. While one Chinese facility had been making 300,000 units a day, Apple was said to cut the order to 150,000 just one month after the release of the 5c. During their first weekend, 5s sales were said to outpace 5c sales by more than three-to-one.\n\nSo will an ever-so-slightly-cheaper 8GB iPhone 5c save the day? It may spur a meager uptick in sales in Europe and China, but it’s not much of an effort to get a foothold in emerging markets—like China.\n\nBTIG analyst Walter Piecyk has previously estimated that it would take a cut to below $300 on a device for Apple to address the unsubsidized emerging markets.\n\nData from Chinese analytics company Umeng shows that the iPhone 5 is currently the most popular iPhone in China, accounting for 15% of Umeng’s network, while the iPhone 5S accounts for 12% and the iPhone 5C accounts for a paltry 2%.\n\nTim Cook admitted in the company’s last quarterly earnings call that sales of the iPhone 5C were “different than we thought,” which is a pretty huge confession of failure coming from Apple. Many investors fear that the 5C’s failure is largely due to the fact that it is still too expensive for many consumers in unsubsidized countries. Apple was also expected to release an 8 GB iPhone 4 in India for an estimated $245 (R. 15,000), but the company ended up setting the price at $370 (R. 22,900).', 'But no 8GB for North or Latin AmericaIn keeping with yesterday’s rumor, Apple officially launched a new 8GB iPhone 5c in European markets Tuesday morning.\nThe UK, French, German and Chinese Apple stores are all selling the 8GB 5c, but as of yet, there is no 8GB 5c available to U.S. customers.\nOn Monday, a leaked memo from the German wireless carrier O2 heralded the arrival of a new 8GB iPhone 5c.\nIt looks like an 8GB 5c is also available in China (RBM 4,088, or $660) but not Latin America.\nSo will an ever-so-slightly-cheaper 8GB iPhone 5c save the day?']"

17523,http://time.com/28493/apple-tweaks-ipad-lineup-brings-back-4th-gen-model/,technology,"['Apple is now selling the 4th-generation iPad for $399 with 16 GB of storage and Wi-Fi connectivity, or $529 with 4G LTE, essentially replacing Apple’s iPad 2 in the lineup.\n\nThe 4th-generation iPad debuted in 2012, but disappeared last fall, when Apple launched the iPad Air. At the time, most pundits agreed that the iPad 2 was a bad deal at $399, especially when you could get an iPad Mini for $100 less, or a state-of-the-art iPad Air for $100 more. Still, the iPad 2 remained popular, and had appeal for education and point-of-sale markets where the latest technology is less important.\n\nBut perhaps Apple was just clearing inventory, and is now ready to move on to selling a newer, better iPad in the $399 slot. It’s definitely worth considering as a cheaper alternative to the iPad Air; both tablets have Retina displays, fast processors and similar camera quality. The biggest difference between them is weight and thickness, and the inability to get more than 16 GB of storage with the 4th-generation model.\n\nIf you want a thin and light tablet with more storage options, the smaller iPad Mini with Retina display has many virtues, and the same $399 base price as the 4th-generation iPad.\n\nApple is also adding an 8 GB iPhone 5c to its lineup, at least in some markets. The U.K. Apple Store is now selling the 8 GB model for £429 — £40 cheaper than the 16 GB model — while the iPhone 4S remains the cheapest option at £349. The 8 GB iPhone 5c is also on sale now in Australia, China and France, but so far it’s not available in the United States.\n\nAlready, U.S. retailers often sell the 16 GB iPhone 5c at a discount. A recent sale at Walmart, for instance, brought the price down to $29 with a two-year contract. As long as retailers are offering the 16 GB model on the cheap, and the 8 GB iPhone 4S for free, it doesn’t make much sense for Apple to slot in the 8 GB iPhone 5c.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.', 'The 4th-generation iPad debuted in 2012, but disappeared last fall, when Apple launched the iPad Air.\nApple is also adding an 8 GB iPhone 5c to its lineup, at least in some markets.\nThe 8 GB iPhone 5c is also on sale now in Australia, China and France, but so far it’s not available in the United States.\nAlready, U.S. retailers often sell the 16 GB iPhone 5c at a discount.\nAs long as retailers are offering the 16 GB model on the cheap, and the 8 GB iPhone 4S for free, it doesn’t make much sense for Apple to slot in the 8 GB iPhone 5c.']"

17535,http://www.macworld.com/article/2109221/ipad-2-bids-us-farewell-is-replaced-by-fourth-generation-retina-model.html,technology,"['Sayonara, iPad 2—you had a good run. On Tuesday, Apple announced that it’s replacing the iPad 2 in its iPad line-up with the iPad with Retina display, finally retiring the 9.7-inch model first introduced in 2011.\n\nIts successor, the fourth-generation iPad introduced in late 2012, boasts an A6X processor, a 5MP iSight camera, a FaceTime HD camera, support for LTE cellular networking (on Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, or T-Mobile), 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, Bluetooth 4.0, and—as the name suggests—a Retina display with 2048-by-1536 resolution. Available only in 16GB configurations with and without wireless networking, the Retina iPad retains the same $399/$529 price points as its predecessor, and provides much more bang for one’s buck.\n\nThere are plenty of advantages to this upgrade for both consumers and Apple. Consumers get a faster product for the same price, as well as better support for iOS 7. Certain features unavailable on the iPad 2—AirDrop, Siri, video sharing, and more—will work just fine on the speedy fourth-generation iPad. And it also means there’s now only a single iOS device without a Retina display—the iPad mini. That’s no small thing when it comes to developers looking to target iOS software releases.\n\nThe elimination of the iPad 2 also standardizes a second line of iOS devices on the Lightning connector; the iPhone 4s is now the lone holdout in Apple’s line-up. That gives accessory makers another reason to move away from the legacy 30-pin dock connector.\n\nPerhaps the biggest question is how this shift will affect the bottom line for Apple’s tablet offerings. The iPad 2 was, by many accounts, a popular selling chunk of the product line, and even coming in at $399, the three-year-old tablet was likely bringing in a decent profit margin. The fourth-generation iPad, on the other hand, is less than eighteen months from its launch, and though it’s been superseded by last year’s iPad Air, it’s still probably a more expensive device to manufacture than the iPad 2 was.\n\nThat said, continuing to manufacture three-year-old technology does have its downsides, and the replacement of the iPad 2 helps bring users a newer product with a better experience.', 'On Tuesday, Apple announced that it’s replacing the iPad 2 in its iPad line-up with the iPad with Retina display, finally retiring the 9.7-inch model first introduced in 2011.\nAvailable only in 16GB configurations with and without wireless networking, the Retina iPad retains the same $399/$529 price points as its predecessor, and provides much more bang for one’s buck.\nCertain features unavailable on the iPad 2—AirDrop, Siri, video sharing, and more—will work just fine on the speedy fourth-generation iPad.\nAnd it also means there’s now only a single iOS device without a Retina display—the iPad mini.\nThe fourth-generation iPad, on the other hand, is less than eighteen months from its launch, and though it’s been superseded by last year’s iPad Air, it’s still probably a more expensive device to manufacture than the iPad 2 was.']"

The iPhone 5C was not only priced higher than expected, but also failed to woo the customers in plastic shells.\n\nTo make amends perhaps, this lower-capacity version is being readied for a quick launch this week. According to an alleged internal email of German carrier O2, the iPhone 5C is defined as Apple’s “entry-level smartphone.” The email also seems to underscore the idea that other 5C models may also diminish pricing. Rumors have overtaken all belief of the market to the effect that Apple’s iPhone 5C in its lower capacity have arrived at a store in the UK and will be released on Tuesday.\n\nElegantly designed in 5 colors, the iPhone 5C has divided opinions across the market. Prior to its launch, it was expected to be a low-cost smartphone from Apple. However, the iPhone 5C disappoints being priced at higher cost than what the low-cost devices ideally should. It also adversely coincided with the Galaxy S4 Mini, the Nexus 4 and the One Mini, already available in the market with similar features at a lower price.\n\nThe Apple iPhone 5C comes in two variants: 16GB and 32GB. It’s also not significantly cheaper than its companion and the flagship model iPhone 5S. Colors notwithstanding, the iPhone 5C had obtained lukewarm response and its sales haven’t been anywhere near internal estimates.\n\nFor iPhone users, this lower capacity version of iPhone 5C may not be all too pleasant, firstly for the space. Users may want to use apps, videos, songs and other media from the rich iPhone quotient, but their usage will be curtailed by limited space. In addition, an 8GB iPhone 4S is also available for free with a new 2-year contract.\n\nThe 8GB model of iPhone 5C will be priced at £429.99 (about £40 lesser than 16GB model) and will be launched in UK, Australia, and China, but not in the US. The market seems to believe this as a desperate attempt to sell more iPhone 5C devices.\n\nCould the market be wrong? Not likely. Share your thoughts in the comments below.', 'Apple is going to launch an 8GB variant of iPhone 5C soon, which wasn’t so well received in the market.\nThe Apple iPhone 5C comes in two variants: 16GB and 32GB.\nColors notwithstanding, the iPhone 5C had obtained lukewarm response and its sales haven’t been anywhere near internal estimates.\nFor iPhone users, this lower capacity version of iPhone 5C may not be all too pleasant, firstly for the space.\nThe 8GB model of iPhone 5C will be priced at £429.99 (about £40 lesser than 16GB model) and will be launched in UK, Australia, and China, but not in the US.']"
17541,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/18/apple-8gb-iphone-5c-uk-cheaper,technology,"['Apple has launched a new entry-level version of its iPhone 5C smartphone, with 8GB of internal storage and a lower price of £429.\n\nThe handset went on sale from the company’s online store in the UK and other countries this morning, sitting alongside the existing 16GB and 32GB models, which sell for £469 and £549 respectively.\n\nOperators are already selling the cheaper 8GB model from their own websites, with O2 the first to make it available. Apple said in a statement: “The 8GB iPhone 5C model will be available in the UK, France, Germany, Australia and China on 18 March.”\n\nEver since its release in September 2013, the iPhone 5C has been subject to speculation that its sales were disappointing, although Apple has not published official sales figures breaking down iPhone sales between the currently-available 5S, 5C and 4S models.\n\nMost recently, analytics firm Umeng suggested that the 5c was much less popular than the 5S in China, while last October, a survey of US iPhone buyers in late September by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners claimed that 64% were buying the more expensive 5s, while 27% were buying the 5C. Data from Mixpanel also bears that out: its US-based data shows the 5C at 6.4% of iPhone users, compared to 20.7% for the pricier 5S.\n\nApple’s decision not to sell the low-end 5C in the US at first, but to offer it in China - where in January it tied up a deal with the world’s largest carrier, China Mobile, using its 4G service - suggests it is chasing mid-range buyers in markets where carriers offer lower or zero subsidies on handsets. Kevin Restivo, senior smartphone analyst at the research company IDC, commented: “the launch of the 8GB iPhone 5c will help Apple gain share and dampen aspirations of HTC and others with mid-tier targets.”\n\nThe research company Canalys noted that the low-end smartphone market is expected to show a compound growth rate of 34.5% over the next four years, while the $600+ segment - in which Apple competes - will stagnate.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook admitted to analysts in the company’s last quarterly earnings call in January that he had been surprised by the mix of iPhone sales the previous quarter after the introduction of the 5C with the 5S.\n\n“I think last quarter we did a tremendous job, particularly given the mix was something very different than we thought,” he said. “It was the first time we’d ever run that particular play before, and demand percentage turned out to be different than we thought.”\n\n\n\nCook added that Apple was not scared of making changes if necessary. The 8GB iPhone 5c is the result, although it will be battling numerous similarly-priced – not to mention even cheaper – Android and Windows Phone handsets in the increasingly crowded smartphone market.\n\nApple has not yet stopped selling the 8BG iPhone 4S, which dates from October 2011, and is now the only device in its lineup which still uses the 30-pin adapter introduced in 2003. As of 18 March, Apple stopped selling the iPad 2, replacing it with 2012’s iPad 4 with a “retina” display.\n\n• iPhone 5c: why the naysayers are wrong to say Apple is in trouble', 'Apple has launched a new entry-level version of its iPhone 5C smartphone, with 8GB of internal storage and a lower price of £429.\nOperators are already selling the cheaper 8GB model from their own websites, with O2 the first to make it available.\nApple said in a statement: “The 8GB iPhone 5C model will be available in the UK, France, Germany, Australia and China on 18 March.”Ever since its release in September 2013, the iPhone 5C has been subject to speculation that its sales were disappointing, although Apple has not published official sales figures breaking down iPhone sales between the currently-available 5S, 5C and 4S models.\nThe 8GB iPhone 5c is the result, although it will be battling numerous similarly-priced – not to mention even cheaper – Android and Windows Phone handsets in the increasingly crowded smartphone market.\n• iPhone 5c: why the naysayers are wrong to say Apple is in trouble']"

It's available in the E.U. and U.K right now, and will presumably show up on Apple's U.S. website later this morning.\n\nApple adds 8GB model to iPhone 5C lineup\n\nThe 8GB iPhone 5C will cost UK customers £429, which is £40 less than the 16GB model. Since the 8GB model is £40 less than the 16GB version, or US$66.40, it's likely pricing in the United States will come in $60 less for the new model.\n\nThe 8GB model rolled out without any fanfare, and the only difference shoppers will see is the lower storage capacity. It includes the same specs as the rest of the iPhone 5C lineup, including the full range of plastic back covers.\n\nApple isn't saying why it added a lower capacity iPhone model to the 5C lineup, although it doesn't take much to assume the 16GB and 32GB models weren't living up to the company's expectations. The 8GB model's lower price point could help draw in shoppers that were on the fence.\n\nA £40 or $60 difference isn't much, but it may get buyers over the psychological price hurdle so they'll break out their credit cards. For shoppers that weren't biting, they may have opted for the free iPhone 4S, which still keeps them in Apple's camp.\n\nThis may also be a ploy to help draw in smartphone buyers that want an iPhone, but go with Android instead simply on cost. If so, the lower price point may help keep some of those customers, but it'll be easy for retailers to convince buyers they'll get more for their money at that price point by going with Android.\n\nUpdate: There's a reason why you aren't seeing the 8GB iPhone 5C on Apple's site in the United States, and that's because it isn't coming here.

Now the tech giant is planning to slash the prices of the device by bringing a low-storage capacity iPhone 5C to market. It will have 8GB of internal storage, compared to the usual 16GB. According to a leaked email from telecom operator O2, the price of the 8GB variant will be lower by about60 euros.\n\nThe leaked email was first published by a German blog. Later, sources told technology website Engadget that the iPhone 5C with 8GB storage will hit the markets soon. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) AAPL +1.36%’s decision to launch a plastic version of the iPhone hasn’t worked well.

The iPad 4 features a 9.7 inch, 2048 x 1536 pixel display, an Apple A6X processor, front and rear cameras, and 16GB of storage.\n\nYou can opt for a WiFi-only model for $399 or grab a WiFi + Cellular model for use on AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, or T-Mobile networks for $529.\n\nApple’s iPad mini with 7.9 inch Retina Display also has a starting price of $399, but features a newer Apple A7 processor. So if you’ve got $399 burning a hole in your pocket you can now choose the size and speed that best fits your needs.\n\nOr if those prices are too steep, you can still get a 1st-generation iPad mini with a 1024 x 768 pixel screen for $299… or pay a lot less for any number of Android tablets.\n\nvia 9to5Mac', 'Every time Apple introduces a new 9.7 inch iPad, the company has kept the $499 starting price the same.\nBut for the past few years Apple has also offered a cheaper $399 model by keeping around the iPad 2 as an option for shoppers who didn’t need all the latest features.\nNow Apple is finally showing the iPad 2 the door and replacing it with the 4th-generation iPad.\nThe iPad 4 features a 9.7 inch, 2048 x 1536 pixel display, an Apple A6X processor, front and rear cameras, and 16GB of storage.\nApple’s iPad mini with 7.9 inch Retina Display also has a starting price of $399, but features a newer Apple A7 processor.']"

Apple also knows that its current price structure is not conducive to winning that battle. So today, Apple quietly released a new model of the iPhone 5C with 8 gigabytes of internal storage, according to reports.\n\nApple is also pushing prices down on its tablets, bringing back the fourth-generation iPad with 16GB of internal storage for $399. The fourth-generation iPad will replace the iPad 2 as Apple’s lowest price 9.7-inch tablet.\n\nThe 8GB iPhone 5C is as of right now only available through Apple’s European websites and carriers like O2, according to 9to5Mac. The price is currently listed on Apple’s United Kingdom website as £429 ($712) while O2 lists the 8GB iPhone 5C as £409 ($678) without a contract. Both of those prices are more than a consumer would pay in the United States for a 16GB iPhone 5C, which retails for $550 off-contract with the 16GB iPhone 5S selling for $650.\n\nConsidering those prices, Apple may be responding more to consumer preference for iPhones with less storage than any particular need to lower prices to compete in emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia, Middle East or China. Apple’s strategy in emerging markets has long been to push older models of iPhones, such as the iPhone 4, which is available is widely available in India.\n\nAs for the fourth-generation iPad, Apple discontinued it when it released the iPad Air in the fall of 2013 while continuing to push the iPad 2 as its most affordable option. The iPad 2 was the only iOS product that Apple still sold in the U.S. that had the old 30-pin connector that was replaced with Lightning charger when the iPhone 5 was released. At $399, the fourth-generation iPad now matches the price of the iPad Mini with Retina Display.\n\nPrice: The Point Of Contention\n\nNobody really doubts that Apple makes high-quality smartphones and tablets. The iPhone is well reviewed every year and is always competitive with other top smartphones from rivals like HTC, Motorola, LG and Nokia. What consumers and investors around the world wring their hands about when it comes to Apple is price.\n\nApple loves its margins and does not believe it needs to play in the commodity smartphone business to remain a highly profitable and successful company. The iPhone 5C is “unapologetically plastic” as Apple’s lead designer Sir Jony Ive said when it was released. It is also unapologetically $550 and more. That is $200 more than what Google sells the Nexus 5 for and well above the $179 starting price for quality but budget-level devices like the Moto G from Motorola. The brand new Nokia X starts at €79 ($109) and is shipping across the globe (but not the United States). These are quality new smartphones designed specifically to sell in high-growth markets. Apple does not have a new smartphone that can compete with these entries on price and the new 8GB iPhone 5C does not appear to be the answer.\n\nThe iPhone 5C has not been a hit for Apple. It was marked as too expensive and not feature-rich enough to justify its price vis-a-vis the iPhone 5S, which starts at $650 off-contract. In its last quarterly earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted that the company was surprised on the sales ratio between the iPhone 5C and the iPhone 5S which led to an overstock of the cheaper version and a shortage of the more expensive. Apple can push further down market with less storage in the iPhone 5C, but without drastically coming down in price, it will continue to struggle to meet the volume of its rivals which have all focused in 2014 on budget smartphones in emerging markets.', 'So today, Apple quietly released a new model of the iPhone 5C with 8 gigabytes of internal storage, according to reports.\nThe 8GB iPhone 5C is as of right now only available through Apple’s European websites and carriers like O2, according to 9to5Mac.\nThe price is currently listed on Apple’s United Kingdom website as £429 ($712) while O2 lists the 8GB iPhone 5C as £409 ($678) without a contract.\nBoth of those prices are more than a consumer would pay in the United States for a 16GB iPhone 5C, which retails for $550 off-contract with the 16GB iPhone 5S selling for $650.\nThe iPhone 5C is “unapologetically plastic” as Apple’s lead designer Sir Jony Ive said when it was released.']"

It also reintroduced the fourth-gen iPad with Retina Display, replacing the iPad 2.\n\nRumors swirled Monday that Apple would indeed be unveiling a smaller version of the iPhone 5c, after pictures of a German iPhone 5c with 8GB marking on the box cropped up. The phone, which is only available in the U.K., France, Germany, China and Australia, is aimed at boosting sales in markets where Apple is seeing competition from lower-end Android-based phones, as Google\'s (GOOG - Get Report) operating system continues to dominate in these markets.\n\nThough Apple does not break out product revenue by region, growth in Europe was tepid in the fiscal first quarter, with revenue rising 5% year over year to $13.07 billion. Revenue in Asia Pacific, which includes Australia, fell 9% year over year to $3.63 billion. For the entire quarter, Apple generated $57.5 billion in revenue, earning $14.50 a share.\n\nApple shares were slightly higher in trading on Tuesday, gaining 0.5% to $529.39.\n\nApple is looking to not only boost sales in markets where Android is the dominant platform, but to boost its lagging stock price as well. Over the past two years, Apple shares have lost 3.4%, compared to a 44.4% gain in the Nasdaq over the same time frame. As a result, Apple has come under attack from activist investors, including Carl Icahn, to do more with its enormous cash hoard, which topped $158 billion at the end of its most recent quarter.\n\nAAPL data by YCharts\n\nIt\'s interesting that Apple would not launch the smaller version of the 5c, given CEO Timothy D. Cook\'s comments about sales in North America, during Apple\'s fiscal first quarter earnings call. ""In North America, we did not do as well, and this weighed on our results,"" Cook said on the earnings call. ""Our North American business contracted somewhat year over year. And if you look at the reason for this, one was that as we entered the quarter, and forecasted our iPhone sales, where we achieved what we thought, we actually sold more iPhone 5Ss than we projected.""\n\nOn the call, Cook noted it was the first time Apple had ever launched two phones in the quarter, and the ""demand percentage turned out to be different than we thought.""\n\nThe iPhone 5c is seen as inferior to the iPhone 5s, as it\'s largely the iPhone 5, except with a color plastic casing. There\'s also a a small price difference between the 5s and the 5c. A look on Apple\'s U.K. Web site showed the 8GB 5c now costs 429 pounds, 40 pounds less than the 16GB model, with the 32GB model selling for 549 pounds. In France, the phones cost 559 euros, 609 euros and 711 euros, respectively. In Germany, the prices are different, costing slightly less than those in France.', ""NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- As Apple (AAPL - Get Report) tries to boost sales of its fledgling iPhone 5c, the company has launched an 8GB version of the phone in some markets.\nRumors swirled Monday that Apple would indeed be unveiling a smaller version of the iPhone 5c, after pictures of a German iPhone 5c with 8GB marking on the box cropped up.\nFor the entire quarter, Apple generated $57.5 billion in revenue, earning $14.50 a share.\nThe iPhone 5c is seen as inferior to the iPhone 5s, as it's largely the iPhone 5, except with a color plastic casing.\nWeb site showed the 8GB 5c now costs 429 pounds, 40 pounds less than the 16GB model, with the 32GB model selling for 549 pounds.""]"

17578,http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/03/apple-resurrects-the-ipad-4-at-399-retires-the-ipad-2-at-long-last/,technology,"['This morning Apple made a couple of new additions to its iOS lineup, where ""new"" in this case means ""old stuff that is nevertheless better than what it is replacing."" It has finally removed the iPad 2 from its lineup and replaced it with 2012\'s fourth-generation iPad. For its second tour of duty, the iPad 4 will set you back $399 for a 16GB Wi-Fi version or $529 for a cellular version, $100 less than the equivalent iPad Air models and equal to the 16GB Retina iPad mini. There\'s also a new 8GB model of the iPhone 5C, which, as of this writing, is only available in certain territories.\n\nThe iPad 2 first became the $399 entry-level iPad in January of 2012 when the third-generation iPad was introduced, and it stayed there through the introduction of the fourth-generation iPad that October and the iPad Air in October of 2013. It was Apple\'s last remaining iPad that still used the old 30-pin connector, and its retirement leaves the $299 iPad mini as the last non-Retina device in the entire iOS lineup.\n\nThe iPad 4 is a substantial upgrade over its predecessor, looking essentially the same but adding a Retina display, a Lightning port, just a little more weight and thickness, and an Apple A6X processor with about twice the CPU performance and four times the GPU performance of the A5 in the iPad 2.\n\nFor most consumers, we\'d still recommend stepping up to the iPad Air . A 16GB iPad Air costs only 25 percent more than a 16GB iPad 4, but it can offer as much as 200 percent more performance depending on what you\'re using it for. It also has a streamlined profile and is substantially lighter (one pound, instead of the iPad 4\'s 1.44 pounds). If you wouldn\'t mind the Retina iPad mini\'s smaller screen, you can have your cake and eat it too—that tablet costs the same amount but is both newer and faster than the iPad 4. And if you can be patient, sites like The Wirecutter find $50-and-up discounts on the iPad Air with regularity, and they\'ve begun to show up in small quantities on Apple\'s official refurbished hardware site\n\nThe cheaper iPad 4 makes a little more sense for schools and businesses, which often purchase directly from Apple in bulk and can\'t hunt for deals from retailers or on Apple\'s refurbished site like the rest of us can.

We can\'t honestly recommend that anyone buy an 8GB iOS device in this day and age, but we can\'t fault Apple for trying to fill real or perceived gaps in its lineup.', ""For its second tour of duty, the iPad 4 will set you back $399 for a 16GB Wi-Fi version or $529 for a cellular version, $100 less than the equivalent iPad Air models and equal to the 16GB Retina iPad mini.\nThe iPad 2 first became the $399 entry-level iPad in January of 2012 when the third-generation iPad was introduced, and it stayed there through the introduction of the fourth-generation iPad that October and the iPad Air in October of 2013.\nA 16GB iPad Air costs only 25 percent more than a 16GB iPad 4, but it can offer as much as 200 percent more performance depending on what you're using it for.\nIt also has a streamlined profile and is substantially lighter (one pound, instead of the iPad 4's 1.44 pounds).\nBuy 1,000 iPad 4s instead of one, and suddenly you've saved $100,000 instead of $100, a significant chunk of money you could spend on something else (or use to buy another 250-or-so iPad 4s).""]"

The phone first appeared on the website of UK carrier O2. Since then, the handset has made its official appearance on international Apple Stores in the UK, China and Australia, reports The Verge.\n\nIn the UK, the new 8GB version has been priced at at £429 ($712). This is almost $66 (should we include sales tax) less than the existing 16gb version. The 32GB version on the other hand has been priced at £649 ($1077). In the event of Apple deciding to launch the new version in the US, you can expect it to cost around $499 – unlocked. That said, there has been no word from Apple regarding such a possibility. It is also likely that this version of the handset could make its way to emerging markets like India and Indonesia.\n\nThe 8GB iPhone 5c is identical to its larger memory-capacity-toting cousins in every other way. The device packs in Apple’s A6 processor, the 4-inch retina display and the same 8 megapixel camera as the other variants of the iPhone 5c sports. Then of course, there are the various catchy color options that the phone is famous for.\n\nThe possibility of the existence of an 8gb iPhone 5c has been mulled for quite some time now. In fact, just yesterday, there were convincing reports about its existence when a German blog known as Caschy’s blog revealed internal communication between O2 Germany staff members and retailers that talked about the 8gb, entry level handset. The same was corroborated by a picture posted by Engadget of the device’s packaging which showed that the handset did actually exist. There were estimations about the possibility of Apple replacing the iPhone 4s with this new entry-level iPhone. However, it seems Apple would continue to sell the former as well.\n\nIn the meantime, the arrival of a lower priced iPhone in the middle of its life cycle is being seen by many as evidence of the fact that iPhone 5c sales haven’t met Apple’s expectations. That said, Apple executives themselves have never expressed disappointment with the sales performance of the iPhone 5c, so far. Also to be noted is the fact that it still manages to sell more than what the iPhone 4S did to – when it was relegated to a mid-range iPhone post the launch of the iPhone 5s.\n\nIt was just a few days ago that The Inquisitr talked about a new Tumblr page that cropped out of nowhere with professionally made pro Apple iPhone 5c videos. Many suspect this blog was part of an undercover marketing campaign by Apple to project the iPhone 5c as a success.\n\nWhat do you think?

In the U.K., for example, Apple is advertising the 8 GB model for £429.00 (USD $712), or £40 cheaper than the 16 GB version.\n\nThe only difference in the new phone is the internal storage, which is capped at 8 GB, compared to the older 16 and 32 GB models. With less space to store data, photos and apps, the phone is accordingly priced lower and will likely appeal to customers on a budget.\n\n9to5Mac reported Monday that Apple was planning such a phone and suggests the move by Apple is due to disappointing sales of the current iPhone 5c models. Although Apple hasn’t broken out sales of the lower-priced handset, it has been widely believed since October that the iPhone 5c isn’t selling well compared to the new iPhone 5s.

In the US market, the Wi-Fi-only version of iPad 4 has been priced at $399, whereas the model with 4G will cost $529.Approximately a month ago, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that Apple will phase out iPad 2 in March 2014 and replace it with the fourth-generation iPad.Even before this re-launch, iPad 4 was available in the Indian market via several e-commerce and retail majors. The market price of the Wi-Fi model of iPad 4 is around Rs 28,000, whereas the 4G-capable model retails at Rs 35,000 in India.

This same very thing has happened with Apple, and it's no fun at all to deal with.\n\nJust a short while back, we had reported that Apple might come up with an 8GB version of iPhone 5C due to lower than expected sales. Now, the 8GB version of Apple's iPhone 5C smartphone has gone official in select parts of Europe.\n\nThe company today finally launched the 8GB version of iPhone 5C, at a cheaper price. The Apple iPhone 5C now comes in 8GB, 16GB and 32GB versions.\n\nMultiple media reports in the past few hours have been saying that Apple could release the 8GB version of its iPhone 5C. Though, it wasn't expected but now several network providers in the U.K have started offering the 8GB version of iPhone 5C.\n\nRecommended: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella To Unveil Office Version of iPad on March 27\n\nClick Here For The New Apple iPhone 5C Smartphone Photos Gallery\n\nThe handset has appeared via UK-based carrier O2's website with variety of plans to choose from. In fact, French carrier SFR has also listed the new iPhone 5c version, and many more are expected to offer the device.\n\nThe 8GB iPhone 5C (unlocked) version is also available via Apple's own online (U.K) store for £429 (Rs. 43,558), compared to £469 (Rs. 47,619) for the 16 GB model and £549 (Rs. 55,752) for the 32 GB.

The core difference between the 8GB version and the current variants is the reduced storage capacity. For the reminder, Apple iPhone 5C does not come with an option to expand on-board memory via a microSD card slot. On the surface, the iPhone 5C comes with a 4-inch IPS Retina Display (1136x 640p, 326ppi), A6 chipset, 8MP rear-facing camera with a single LED Flash and a 1.2MP front-facing shooter.\n\nApple hasn't announced whether the 8GB version of iPhone 5C will be made available in India or not.

First, the company made an effort to boost sales of its plastic iPhone 5C by launching a lower-capacity 8GB model, which is 10 percent cheaper than the existing version.\n\nWhen it comes to its iPad lineup, Apple finally made the move that was rumored for quite some time now, namely ditch the older iPad 2 in favor of newer models. The company has now replaced that model by relaunching the 16GB iPad 4. The iPad 2 has definitely had a good run, but its end of life (EOL) was expected considering that consumers are now more interested in newer models with Retina displays.\n\nThe 16GB iPad 4 that comes to replace the non-Retina iPad 2 comes with a $399 price tag in Apple's U.S. Online Store, while a cellular version of the tablet is available for $130 more, i.e. $529. Although Apple is still selling its older iPhone 4S alongside the new 8GB iPhone 5C, apparently things are different on the tablet front. On the other hand, it's understandable.\n\nThe iPhone 5C launched alongside the high-end iPhone 5s, and while the flagship saw great demand and good sales figures, the plastic smartphone didn't exactly fly off the shelves. Apple's move to launch an 8GB iPhone 5C is widely seen as an effort to boost lackluster sales, and the new model doesn't replace the iPhone 4S.\n\nOn the iPad front, however, the iPad 2 is considerably older, and its lack of a Retina display made it less than desirable to iFans. Apple's decision to ditch the iPad 2 and replace it with the 16GB iPad 4 comes as no big surprise.\n\nApple had removed the iPad 4 from its tablet lineup last October, making room for its latest iPad Air. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, however, anticipated back in February that Apple would ultimately decide to relaunch the iPad 4 to replace the iPad 2. The fourth-generation iPad comes with 1GB of RAM and an A6X processor, whereas the older iPad 2 had only 512MB of RAM and an A5 chip. The switch makes sense, but it remains to be seen whether the iPad 4 is still in demand.\n\nBoth the Wi-Fi-only and the Wi-Fi + Cellular models of the 16GB iPad 4 are now available for purchase from Apple's online store at this link, or through the company's retail stores. Interested buyers can choose between white or black color options.\n\n© Copyright 2018 Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.

The introduction of an 8 GB model may not improve sales either, as it\'s priced as high as many current-generation, newer Android devices such as the LG G2.\n\nAlongside the launch of the 8 GB iPhone 5c, Apple finally discontinued the iPad 2, replacing it with the fourth-generation iPad as the cheaper option in the company\'s tablet line-up.

Even though the 2nd-generation iPad is old and makes use of some aging technology, this has served Apple well over the past three years because this has been their budget tablet.\n\nWhile most tablet makers prefer to make newer, cheaper models, Apple thought it was in their best interest to stick with a current model and keep it in their portfolio for years. This certainly helps profit margins because they have not had to spend millions on developing newer models for those with less disposal income.\n\nWe had assumed that when Apple released the new iPad tablet last year, the iPad Air, they would keep selling the outgoing model and discontinue the iPad 2, but that wasn’t the case.\n\nHowever, it would seem that Apple has now seen the light because there is finally an iPad 2 replacement for 2014, which just so happens to be the iPad 4.\n\nReasons for the iPad 4 comeback — The most obvious would be the Lighting port, seeing as though Apple has been pushing this connection across the range of iOS devices, and so seemed stupid to keep selling the iPad 2 with its 30-pin connector.\n\nAnother reason is performance because the iPad 2 is looking rather slow when compared to its Android rivals. Retina is another reason, as the iPad 4 sports the Retina display, which as we know is far superior to the iPad without it.\n\nOne of the most important reasons why Apple decided to release the iPad 2 and bring back the fourth generation model was because of iOS 8 support. We believe that the iPad 2 is highly unlikely to support iOS 8, and so Apple felt the need to bring back the iPad 4, which we know will support the next version of its software.', 'We had assumed that when Apple released the new iPad tablet last year, the iPad Air, they would keep selling the outgoing model and discontinue the iPad 2, but that wasn’t the case.\nHowever, it would seem that Apple has now seen the light because there is finally an iPad 2 replacement for 2014, which just so happens to be the iPad 4.\nRetina is another reason, as the iPad 4 sports the Retina display, which as we know is far superior to the iPad without it.\nOne of the most important reasons why Apple decided to release the iPad 2 and bring back the fourth generation model was because of iOS 8 support.\nWe believe that the iPad 2 is highly unlikely to support iOS 8, and so Apple felt the need to bring back the iPad 4, which we know will support the next version of its software.']"

This gives it nearly identical specs to the iPhone 5, with only the colourful polycarbonate plastic shell really setting it apart.\n\nWhen the 5C launched alongside the high-end 5S last year it seemed that Apple likely that Apple would try to capture more of the low-end smartphone market with a cheaper device.\n\nHowever, it seems that Apple set the price too high, and although exact sales figures of the 5C are uncertain (Apple bundles together sales for the two devices) CEO Tim Cook has said that “the mix was stronger to the 5S”.\n\nIn our original review of the pair of devices we said that while that 5C was ""a more powerful phone phone than last year’s iPhone 5, with a longer-lasting battery and improved front-facing camera"" it was the iPhone 5s that was ""the main event"".\n\nThis doesn’t mean the 5C is doing terribly – it’s thought to have sold better in the middle spot of Apple’s portfolio than the 4S, the handset that became second tier when the iPhone 5 came out – but this new memory option suggests Apple still wants more from the plastic fantastic device.\n\nOnline Editors', ""APPLE has lowered the price of its fourth-generation iPad, hours after confirming a lower-cost version of the iPhone 5c.\nAPPLE has lowered the price of its fourth-generation iPad, hours after confirming a lower-cost version of the iPhone 5c.\nEarlier today the company announced a new version of the iPhone 5C handset, it will cost about €60 less than its €599 counterpart.\nIn addition, an 8GM iPhone5C handset at €539 works out more expensive than today's €349 8GB iPhone 4s.\nThe iPhone 5C originally launched with a choice of 16GB and 32GB options.""]"

After reports of poor sales in targeted emerging markets, Apple have decided to take action. The 8GB 5c has half the storage capacity of the next model up in the range, and will cost £429 in the UK when purchased SIM-free.\n\nGood as it is of Apple to diversify their ‘budget’ offerings, the price of the 8GB 5c is just £40 less than its 16GB big brother. In the grand scheme of things, is that really enough of a difference? In the UK at least, it’s hard to imagine someone purchasing a contract phone opting for a handset with half the storage when they theoretically stand to save roughly £3 per month (the handset is yet to be made available by network contract providers, but a difference of £40 spread over a 24-month contract surely couldn’t yield a greater discount). Will someone based in a lower-income region of Africa or Asia really the 8GB model that much more affordable?\n\nThis move could also spell the long-anticipated end of the iPhone 4s.

The appearance of the handset came following its launch with the U.K. carrier O2, and we were first with the news in a report that explained:\n\nFor O2 customers, the new 8GB handset is offered with several varying plans, which include: iPhone 5c – 8GB\n\n£49.99 upfront cost\n\n£28 per month\n\n500 minutes, unlimited texts, 500 MB data The total cost is £721.99, which is the lowest total cost associated with an iPhone 5c handset sold by the carrier. You can also pay £409.00 for the handset with monthly payments of £13, though this offers the same minutes, texts, and data, and costs subscribers the same total fee in the long run. For a free handset, however, 8GB iPhone 5c customers must may £43 per month, but the minutes and data offered are more impressive in both cases: iPhone 5c – 8 GB\n\nNo upfront cost\n\n£43 per month\n\nUnlimited minutes, unlimited texts, 8GB data To put this in perspective, 16GB iPhone 5c handsets with the carrier start at £38 per month (with no upfront cost) for unlimited data, unlimited messaging, and 2GB of limited data. In each cast, access to O2’s 4G LTE network is included.\n\nNot long after our original report went live, Apple added the iPhone 5c to its Apple Online Store in Britain. There, the unlocked model can be purchased for £429.00, though as of this writing the changes haven’t been reflected in the U.S. Apple Online Store.\n\nThe big question, though, is whether the change will help boost iPhone 5s sales. Apple is also pushing on with its iPhone 5c advertising campaign, too, and this recently reached Tumblr, Yahoo, and The New York Times. Though as we’ll discuss below, international sales of the less expensive handset are still poor.\n\nChina\n\nChina was a market where Apple’s anticipated iPhone 5c had been expected to succeed, but the price of the handset, once revealed, put customers off. This week, we heard that the iPhone 5c presently holds less than a two percent share of China’s iOS device market, indicating how unpopular the handset really is in the country.\n\nWe explained:\n\nThe news comes from Umeng, China’s largest app analytics platform (and reached us from the South China Morning Post), which used its network to estimate the share of China’s iOS device market currently held by the iPhone 5c. Though the iPhone 5s accounts for around 12 percent of active iOS devices being used in the nation, the iPhone 5c indeed holds a minute share of less than two percent. Apple’s iPhone 5, on the other hand, is the most popular of the three handsets, and accounts for some 15 percent of the iOS device market in China.\n\nFollowing its release, a survey indicated that the Chinese “dislike the iPhone 5c more than everyone else in the world,” and this likely has a lot to do with the fact that the “low cost” handset actually retails in China for the country’s average monthly wage.\n\nAs of this writing, we’re not sure if the 8GB iPhone 5c mentioned above could make its way to China. If so, this could help increase sales in the country – but only if the price is right. We’ll keep you updated on this front.\n\nIndia\n\nFinally this week, a report indicated that Apple is going ahead with its plan to build smaller, more local retail outlets in India’s big cities and tier II markets. We’d heard previously that such a move could help boost Apple’s market share in the country by around 30 percent, and now a report from The Economic Times claims that Cupertino is set to make the change.\n\nIn our original article, we explained:\n\nApple distributors Redington and Ingram Micro, along with existing trade partners, will set up the new stores; Apple has reportedly said in recent meetings that it’s looking for its new retail outlets to be around 400 to 600 sq ft in size, according to three of the company’s trade partners.\n\nApple is reportedly targeting India’s Pune, Vizag, Guwahati, Durgapur, and Gangtok regions – areas where there is a large student population, and where residents are said to have “high disposable incomes.”\n\nThe plans, however, could “unfold slowly,” and so it may be some time before more concrete information concerning this initiative surfaces online.\n\nIn the meantime, see: Farewell, iPad 2: Apple’s iPad With Retina Display Is Back, What Cannibalization?

For those looking to get their hands on the LTE model, the 16GB model will set you back a much more expensive $529.\n\nWhat this means for Apple is that from here on out, all of the Cupertino company’s tablets will use the Lightning connector, and all of its tablets save for the first-gen iPad mini will feature a Retina display while offering up 4G LTE connectivity.\n\nThe iPad 4 was launched back in 2012 a few months after Apple had launched theiPad 3.

A leaked email from O2 Germany, a telecom operator, revealed that Apple would reduce the internal storage in the phone to 8GB from 16GB and reduce the price by 60 euros (around Rs 5104).A screenshot of the leaked email was first published by a German blog. It was later cited by Engadget, a technology website. After publishing its report, Engadget also received a tip-off with a picture of the new iPhone 5C box that showed 8GB internal storage in the phone’s specifications.For Apple, iPhone 5C experiment has not worked well. Faced with tough challenge from Android, especially in the developing countries, Apple in 2013 launched two models of iPhone for the first time. The premium version – iPhone 5S – uses a metal body and next-generation hardware. The other device – iPhone 5C – that is targeted at more budget-conscious consumers uses a plastic body and hardware which is similar to that of iPhone 5, a device launched in 2012.Apple expected that iPhone 5S would find favour with Apple loyalists who spend big bucks on Apple devices while iPhone 5C would attract consumers looking to get an iPhone but at a more affordable price. However, compared to Android phones, iPhone 5C has been priced too high. In India, when iPhone 5C launched in November, it had an MRP of Rs 41,900 for the model with 16GB internal storage. Given its relatively high price, iPhone 5C has to compete with phones like LG G2, Galaxy S4 and Xperia Z1, which have better hardware.Since the launch, iPhone 5C has seen its price fall by around Rs 5,000 in the market. But it has not been enough to draw consumers. People looking to buy an iPhone prefer iPhone 5S and those who do not have any brand loyalties often pick a high-end Android phone, which is a better value for money, over iPhone 5C.Recent reports indicate Apple has almost 3 million unsold units of iPhone 5C in its inventory. A report by Umeng, a Chinese app analytics, too said that iPhone 5C was a failure in the market. Umeng said that its tracking revealed only 2% iPhone users in China were using iPhone 5C. In comparison, 12% were on iPhone 5S.This is not the first time Apple is reducing the storage in an iPhone to sell it at a (marginally) reduced price. Earlier, it introduced iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S with 8GB storage in India.For now there is no information on when Apple will launch the iPhone 5C with 8GB storage in India. But it is likely to be soon after the expected announcement tomorrow.However, unless the reduction in price is substantial, the iPhone 5C may not find many takers, especially in the Indian market. It is a very competitive market, with phones like Galaxy S4 now selling for around Rs 30,000. At the same time, LG Nexus 5, the official Android phone, continues to be an excellent value for money with a price of Rs 28,999. Almost all Android Android smartphones with a price of around Rs 30,000 or more have better hardware and bigger screen than iPhone 5C and unless the price for 8GB version of the phone is closer to Rs 25,000, it may not find favour with consumers.', 'After publishing its report, Engadget also received a tip-off with a picture of the new iPhone 5C box that showed 8GB internal storage in the phone’s specifications.For Apple, iPhone 5C experiment has not worked well.\nHowever, compared to Android phones, iPhone 5C has been priced too high.\nA report by Umeng, a Chinese app analytics, too said that iPhone 5C was a failure in the market.\nUmeng said that its tracking revealed only 2% iPhone users in China were using iPhone 5C.\nEarlier, it introduced iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S with 8GB storage in India.For now there is no information on when Apple will launch the iPhone 5C with 8GB storage in India.']"

But it won\'t be without its trade-offs.\n\nA leaked email published on the website of German telecom operator O2 and translated by Engadget, reveals that ""Cupertino is looking to boost its middle child by launching an 8GB version that\'ll retail for 60 euros less than the current 16GB model"". Engadget also received a tip-off with a picture of the new iPhone 5C box that showed the device with 8GB internal storage.\n\nThe announcement is reportedly due to be made later today.\n\nAlthough Apple has not revealed just how well (or badly) the iPhone 5C has been doing, it has been widely speculated that the device has not been performing as well as expected. The surprisingly high price tag for the device along with the fact that it was launched together with the 5S which had frankly far superior specs, meant that most people went for the latter instead. Many tech experts and customers were of the view that a mere $100 savings for a phone with less than stellar tech specs and a far inferior body was simply not good enough.\n\nIn fact, this report on GSM Arena revealed that Apple’s stockpile of the iPhone 5c had reached over 3 million units, confirming that it isn’t exactly a hot seller. The site goes on to speculate whether Apple is manufacturing new 8GB iPhone 5c units, which will most probably increase that stockpile, or whether it is just disabling half of the memory on the already assembled and ready to ship ones.\n\nIt is not yet known whether the reduced storage and lower cost iPhone 5C models will make their way to India, where there are already schemes available to sell the device to consumers at attractive rates. Reliance, for instance, offers the device to customers for an EMI of Rs 2,599 on a two-year contract with free local and STD calls, text messages, and 3G data roaming.\n\nA 60 euro price reduction would amount to a price cut of a little over Rs 5,000 in India. But would it be worth it? According to GSM Arena, ""a €530+ price tag for an 8GB iPhone 5c with year and a half old hardware doesn\'t sound like a great bargain.""\n\nApple also recently reintroduced the iPhone 4 in the Indian market for Rs 23,000 to boost flagging sales, a move that we were not too enthused by. Compared to that, a lower cost iPhone 5C may be a better buy, but remember, it will only come with half the storage capacity for an insignificantly lower price.\n\nAnd that may not be the only news out of the Apple stable; according to 9to5Mac, shipments of Apple’s fourth-generation iPad with Retina display have been arriving at Apple Stores with notices to not open until tomorrow.', 'Ayeshea PereraApple\'s \'low cost\' iPhone 5c may finally see a price reduction that may put it at \'affordable\' even if not quite \'low cost\' per se.\nEngadget also received a tip-off with a picture of the new iPhone 5C box that showed the device with 8GB internal storage.\nIn fact, this report on GSM Arena revealed that Apple’s stockpile of the iPhone 5c had reached over 3 million units, confirming that it isn’t exactly a hot seller.\nAccording to GSM Arena, ""a €530+ price tag for an 8GB iPhone 5c with year and a half old hardware doesn\'t sound like a great bargain.""\nCompared to that, a lower cost iPhone 5C may be a better buy, but remember, it will only come with half the storage capacity for an insignificantly lower price.']"

The Apple iPhone 8GB will reportedly cost 509 euros (Rs. 43,239) compared to the 569 euros (Rs. 48,336) price tag for the 16GB model. Apple currently offers its iPhone 5C in 16GB and 32GB capacities.\n\nOn Monday, MacRumors citing two Germany based blog sites, reported that Apple could be planning for an 8GB version of the iPhone 5C. The new version of iPhone 5C is expected to be made available in multiple colors, MacRumors notes.\n\nFurther, MacRumors own tipsters had indicated that the iPhone 5C might get launched in the U.K. Moreover, a picture of 8GB iPhone 5C\'s retail package has been obtained by Engadget, confirming its existence.\n\nRecommended: Apple iPhone 5C Hands On And First Impressions\n\nSo far, all the reports in respect to the introduction of iPhone 5C 8GB are coming straight out of Europe. But there seems to be a little doubt that Apple would limit the phone in Europe.\n\nApple has not been able to sell the iPhone 5C in large numbers, citing negative response from users and critics alike. If the leaked reports turned out to be true, a cheaper iPhone 5C would be a way to elevate Apple\'s market share in the emerging countries, such as India and China.\n\nThe poor performance of Apple iPhone 5C is not limited to Europe; sales have been flat as well in China. A new data from China-based analytics company Umeng shows that the iPhone 5 is the most popular phone, accounting for about 15 percent of Umeng\'s network. The other phone, the iPhone 5S comes in at 12 percent, while the iPhone 5C can only reached at 2 percent.\n\nIn India, Apple was optimistic about the iPhone 5C, as the phone went on sale at Rs. 41,000 for the 16GB version. Since the launch, iPhone 5C has seen price falling by up to Rs. 6000. Even though the phone is a lot cheaper than its launched price; users seemed to stay away from the iPhone 5C. In fact, iPhone 5C\'s biggest threat is none other than Apple iPhone 4S, which is believed to be selling well in Indian market.\n\nIf the iPhone 5C 8GB version comes at a price point of Rs. 30,000 in India, there are still chances to find few takers.

Available in the full gamut of 5C colors, the 8GB version would be the new entry-level iPhone model, said MacRumors. Apple currently offers the 5C in 16GB and 32GB variations.\n\nOne source throwing out this claim is German blog site Caschys Blog, which caught wind of an alleged note sent by German carrier O2 to retailers. The unverified note claims the cost of the 8GB version will be 509 euros ($707) compared with the 569 euros ($791) price tag for the 16GB model.\n\nAnother source, German blog site iFun, has reported that the 8GB version will launch on Tuesday.

Most customers believe that the 5C is overpriced and prefer to buy the high-end iPhone 5S for just $100 more. Apple has all but admitted that the 5C is a flop, but now a new report hints that the company may offer an 8 GB iPhone 5C at a lower price starting Tuesday.\n\nThe report from stadt-bremerhaven.de references an internal email from German carrier O2, which states that the official launch of the 8 GB iPhone 5C will be Tuesday March 18 at 8 a.m. in Germany. The email adds that the devices will be delivered to O2 stores on Monday March 17. At first, the 8 GB version will only be available in white and blue, says the email, but it is assumed that more colors will be forthcoming. The email also includes a strict warning that no one at O2 is to show the devices or their packaging to anyone else prior to the official launch.\n\nO2 will reportedly sell the new 8 GB version of the iPhone 5C for €509, which is €60 less than the current price of the entry-level 16 GB iPhone 5C O2 currently offers for €569. It is unknown if both the 16 GB and 32 GB versions of the iPhone 5C will get an additional price drop, but the odds are against it. After all, Apple isn't a fan of discounts.\n\nThe new 8 GB version of the iPhone 5C will have all the same specifications as it did at launch, but the built-in storage will be halved. The new iPhone 5C will feature the same A6 processor, 4-inch retina display and 8-megapixel back camera.\n\nIt is unknown if Apple's alleged decision to offer an 8 GB version of the struggling iPhone 5C will hurt iPhone 4S sales, seeing as it is the only other iPhone that comes in an 8 GB option. Of course, to hurt iPhone 4S sales, the 8 GB iPhone 5C would have to appeal to customers in the first place. Even if the 8 GB iPhone 5C becomes a reality on Tuesday, it is still unlikely to appeal to hard-core Apple fans. Most iFanatics want the latest and the greatest iPhone, not the plastic iPhone 5C with just 8 GB of storage onboard.\n\nIf customers want a budget smartphone, the iPhone 5C is not for them. It's still going to be too expensive for what it is. You can get a Nexus 5 smartphone from Google with 16 GB of storage, a processor that is more than the A6's equal and an 8-megapixel camera of basically the same quality as the one on the iPhone 5C for basically half the price at $349.\n\nThe iPhone 5C's problem is not that it has too much storage, it's that the 5C isn't cheap enough.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Moreover, its new agreement with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) went into effect Jan. 17, which means Apple stands to gain even further ground in China.\n\nReal smartphones\n\nTim Cook said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal: ""I look at the mobile phone market as having three kinds of phones: feature phones, smartphones that function as or are used as feature phones, and real smartphones. I care about the market share of the last one.""\n\nMore than one-third of smartphones sold in China fall into the ""smartphones that function as feature phones"" category, with 35% of phones sold for less than $150. Apple is more interested in transitioning these customers into real smartphone purchasers than catering to the low-end market.\n\nIf we generously categorize ""real smartphones"" as those priced above $150, Apple has one-third of the market in China. It took half the market of smartphones priced above $330.\n\nComparatively, Apple accounts for 41.6% of the U.S. market as of January. The U.S. smartphone market is largely composed of devices priced above $150, with the average smartphone selling for about $500. So, Apple isn\'t far off in China.\n\nBetter than Samsung\n\nHere\'s the real interesting thing. Despite Samsung\'s efforts to control market share by flooding the market with smartphones at every price range, it hasn\'t succeeded.\n\nBy owning 80% of the 27% share of high-end phones, Apple maintains 21.6% total market share.\n\nMeanwhile, of the other 78.4% of smartphones that make up the Android camp, Samsung only took 24%. Counting non-Android phones, Samsung\'s 24% of the Android share represents only 18.8% of the total smartphone market. Indeed, the market is much more fragmented in China than it is in the U.S.\n\nPerhaps Apple\'s success stems from its ability to differentiate itself from the Android camp in China. Samsung has tried to separate its products from the pact by implementing different user interfaces. In 2014, the company may introduce its first phone that runs on Tizen OS, an Android alternative the company is heading up with Intel.\n\nThe impact of China Mobile\n\nChina Mobile began selling the iPhone in January, which ought to boost iPhone sales in China. The wireless carrier has 760 million subscribers, with 160 million being 3G subscribers. However, an estimated 40 million of China Mobile\'s subscribers were using gray-market smartphones on China Mobile\'s 3G network last year.\n\nAnalyst estimates for the number of iPhones sold through China Mobile in 2014 range from 12 million to 39 million. In January, the effect of the iPhone debut was clear. China Mobile added 14.2 million new 3G subscribers, which is 7.4% growth from December. That number represents the fastest month-to-month growth in 3G subscribers since last August and the biggest absolute 3G subscriber increase ever.\n\nNot only will adding China Mobile as an official carrier help boost sales of the iPhone in China, it should also help quell the number of jailbroken iPhones. When a user jailbreaks his iPhone, he can use his phone with any carrier and bypass the Apple App Store.\n\nThe number of jailbroken iPhones has declined significantly over the last year, from 30% in January to 13% in December. Security risks are much higher on jailbroken phones. The introduction of the iPhone on China mobile will ensure that number continues to decline. As a result, Apple\'s iTunes revenue will see the benefit.\n\nMaking the best\n\nTim Cook has iterated several times that Apple doesn\'t care about market share, it cares about making the best products. Eventually the market will catch up. If you look at China, the largest smartphone market in the world, Apple\'s philosophy is starting to pay off. It\'s better than Samsung, and the second most popular phone maker in the country by active users. The deal with China mobile, along with the expanding economy, will fuel Apple\'s sales going forward.\n\nPeople in China want the iPhone, it\'s just a matter of affording it.\n\nEditor\'s Note: A previous version of this article misstated Sony\'s share of the Android market in China. It has since been corrected.', 'Moreover, its new agreement with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) went into effect Jan. 17, which means Apple stands to gain even further ground in China.\nI care about the market share of the last one.""\nDespite Samsung\'s efforts to control market share by flooding the market with smartphones at every price range, it hasn\'t succeeded.\nBy owning 80% of the 27% share of high-end phones, Apple maintains 21.6% total market share.\nThe deal with China mobile, along with the expanding economy, will fuel Apple\'s sales going forward.']"

Citing unspecified sources, 9to5Mac reported that iPad 4 units have been delivered to Apple Store locations with instructions not to open them until Tuesday, March 18th.\n\niPad 4 with Lightning Connector\n\nThe move coincides with a report out of Europe that Apple will unveil an 8GB iPhone 5c on Tuesday, possibly to replace the iPhone 4s as the company's entry-level iPhone. If both stories are accurate, Apple would be eliminating the legacy 30-pin Dock connector, uniting its shipping iPhone and iPad product lines under the Lightning connector for the first time.\n\nI like this iPad 4 story for a number of reasons. First and foremost is the 30-Pin Dock/Lightning issue that goes along with Apple discontinuing the iPhone 4s. Having both connectors in shipping products has always been questionable, and it runs contrary to Apple's focus on product simplicity. Getting rid of the legacy port is good for the entire iOS ecosystem and customers alike.\n\nFor another, if Apple can make a profit by selling the iPad 4 at $399, the company would be bringing Retina Display quality to the entry level for those who want a full-sized iPad. That's a big deal, especially for the education market—Retina Display iPads offer a substantially better experience than iPads with lower resolutions.\n\nThe iPad Air is an amazing device, but for the budget conscious, a $399 iPad 4 is a far superior choice than an iPad 2 at the same price. It's not even a contest. Faster processor, better graphics, better display—it could open up sales at the lower end of Apple's tablet business.\n\nThe only question is one of margins. Can Apple sell the iPad 4 at a profit for $399? Probably, though obviously not at the same margins achieved with the iPad 2. If so, however, this would be a great move that should increase sales.\n\nMark Gurman has images of the boxed deliveries at 9to5Mac."", ""Apple is about to replace the US$399 iPad 2 with a $399 iPad 4, a move that would dramatically increase the value of Apple's entry-level iPad price point.\nCiting unspecified sources, 9to5Mac reported that iPad 4 units have been delivered to Apple Store locations with instructions not to open them until Tuesday, March 18th.\nIf both stories are accurate, Apple would be eliminating the legacy 30-pin Dock connector, uniting its shipping iPhone and iPad product lines under the Lightning connector for the first time.\nThe iPad Air is an amazing device, but for the budget conscious, a $399 iPad 4 is a far superior choice than an iPad 2 at the same price.\nCan Apple sell the iPad 4 at a profit for $399?""]"

Sales of the “low cost” iPhone have been underwhelming and it’s no mystery as to why. Reducing the iPhone by $100 doesn’t make a dent in the emerging markets. “But!” says Apple. “What if we reduce the price by…$180!”\n\nThat seems to be the strategy, according to a leaked memo from the German carrier o2. The internal email indicates that a new 8GB iPhone 5C will be going on sale Tuesday, March 18, for €509 ($707), which is a price reduction of €60 from the previous price tag of €569 ($791).\n\nApple currently offers an 8GB iPhone 4S that U.S. customers can get for free with a contract, as well as an 8GB iPhone 4 that Apple sells in emerging markets like China and India. And that leads one to wonder whether an 8GB iPhone 5C will have enough space for all of a user’s apps and content. Will an 8GB iPhone be able to deliver all of the promises of the 5C?\n\nEither way, it likely won’t cost Apple much—if anything—to produce. The question is whether it will be anything more than a drop in the proverbial bucket.\n\nTim Cook admitted in the company’s last quarterly earnings call that sales of the iPhone 5C were “different than we thought,” which is a pretty huge confession of failure coming from Apple. Many investors fear that the 5C’s failure is largely due to the fact that it is still too expensive for many consumers in unsubsidized countries. Apple was also expected to release an 8 GB iPhone 4 in India for an estimated $245 (R. 15,000), but the company ended up setting the price at $370 (R. 22,900).\n\nThe 5C is largely thought to be the least popular iPhone available, and reports from China suggest that it’s not much better over in Apple’s newest market. Data from Chinese analytics company Umeng shows that the iPhone 5 is currently the most popular iPhone in China, accounting for 15% of Umeng’s network, while the iPhone 5S accounts for 12% and the iPhone 5C accounts for a paltry 2%.\n\nBTIG analyst Walter Piecyk has previously estimated that it would take a cut to below $300 on a device for Apple to address the unsubsidized emerging markets.\n\nOf course, there's no guarantee that Apple will actually release an 8GB iPhone 5C tomorrow, or any time this week. And if it does, there's nothing saying Apple will release it to the rest of the world.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) appears to be poised to launch a new, cheaper version of the iPhone 5C, this one with 8 gigabytes of memory rather than the current 16GB and 32GB. Less power would mean less expensive components within the smartphone’s colorful plastic shell, enabling Apple to cut prices as well. The current 16GB and 32GB variants would likely continue in production also, that is until all iPhone 5s are ousted by the introduction of the iPhone 6 sometime this summer or autumn.\n\nToday’s revelation of Apple’s possible plans for a low end iPhone 5C came about as a result of leaks from an Apple partner, O2 Germany. The Teutonic firm accidentally released its promotional pages for the new model early, unveiling the new item in Apple’s lineup before the Cupertino, California enterprise was ready to do so on its own. The announcement begins, in German, “The new iPhone 5C with 8GB” (“Das neue iPhone 5C mit 8GB”), encapsulating the entire release in a single short sentence.\n\nSome time later, further substantiation was offered by an anonymous reader who emailed a photograph of the 5C’s retail packaging to Engadget. Assuming that the image is genuine, as it certainly appears to be, this is confirmation that not only does Apple Inc. (AAPL) plan to produce the phone, but that it has already been manufactured and shipped through distribution channels.\n\nThe official release is likely only days away at most, and the photograph also refers to the 8GB 5C inside the package as “Blue,” confirming that the same bright assortment of colors is used for this device as for existing 5Cs with larger memory.\n\nRetail sales of the iPhone 5C have been quite weak compared to the robust performance of the 5S. The 5C is meant to be a cheaper model, but its price is still too high for those who are on a limited budget, while those with more funds prefer the 5S for its stronger performance, greater range of features, and, probably, better aesthetics. An 8GB iPhone 5C could potentially capture profits from the low end of the smartphone market, but its price would need to be significantly below that of the 16GB to make a difference in sales.\n\nRumor has it that prices would be slashed by approximately $80 to $85 relative to current 5C prices. Regardless of the precise figures, however, the new version of the iPhone 5C shows that Apple Inc. (AAPL) remains determined to penetrate the cheap smartphone market, even though its current strengths lie elsewhere.

However, we believe that while the upgrade rate (i.e., % of installed base upgrading their device in a given quarter) had hovered in the 10-11% range over 2011-12, it has now dropped closer to 9% as users find few compelling reasons to upgrade. In peak quarters, the upgrade rate has reached the ~12-14% range and we expect a similar upgrade rate in 2H14 for iPhone 6, if not better. We believe this could drive ~$3.00 (or ~10-15%) EPS accretion over 2H14 assuming an incremental ~3% of the base upgrades each quarter.\n\nThis is yet another analyst group saying Apple releases two phones this year.\n\nIt would be a major departure for Apple, which has only ever done one iPhone at a time since it released the iPhone in 2007. (Last year it did the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C, but the 5C was just an iPhone 5 with a new plastic backing, so it didn\'t really feel like two phones.)\n\nBecause it would be such a change of pace, we\'re skeptical it\'s really going to happen. We\'ll believe it when we see it.\n\nBut, there is a lot of noise around the idea that Apple would do two phones, so we\'re more inclined to believe it\'s going to happen as people keep talking about it.\n\n\n\nNOW WATCH: If You Are Not Using These Google Maps Hacks, You Are Totally Lost', 'Mock up for iPhone 6 Screenshot There\'s a very bullish note on Apple this morning from ISI.\nIt says, ""the \'mother lode\' of all Apple upgrade cycles"" will happen this year when Apple releases two new iPhones with big screens.\nIt\'s predicting Apple releases a 4.7-inch iPhone and a 5.5-inch iPhone this year.\nIn peak quarters, the upgrade rate has reached the ~12-14% range and we expect a similar upgrade rate in 2H14 for iPhone 6, if not better.\nThis is yet another analyst group saying Apple releases two phones this year.']"

Those who got the 5C did so because they broke their iPhone 5\'s and didn\'t want to pay extra for the 5S - the 5C is a forced backup play, not a go-to product, so to speak.But Apple isn\'t giving up yet: It\'s running a campaign on Tumblr featuring cute 5C-themed GIF animations.', 'Umeng, China\'s largest app analytics platform, produced this chart of iPhone activity on its network following the launch of the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C It\'s a disaster for the iPhone 5C.\nFour months after the launch of the iPhone 5C, activations remain way below those of the 5S.\nThe chart shows what percentage of users are on which device:The 5C is on only 2% of devices on Umeng, the company says.\nThe 5S is on 12% of devices — or six times as many.The good news for Apple is that the iPhone 5S is way more popular than the iPhone 5 was.\nSo Apple\'s ""problem"" here is a high-class one.Nonetheless, when Apple gets something wrong, it\'s so unusual that it makes headlines.']"

The iPhone 5c was much less budget-friendly than most were hoping, coming in just a bit under the cost of the flagship 5s. Apple doesn’t discuss actual sales numbers very often, but reports indicate Apple stores have had trouble moving the iPhone 5c. In response, the company could be getting ready to drop the price with a new 8GB version of the device as soon as tomorrow.\n\nThis rumor comes by way of a document allegedly leaked from O2 Germany, which makes it clear the 8GB model is coming to stores tomorrow (March 18th). Following this leak, photos surfaced of packaging for the new iPhone 5c variant. The documents list the 8GB iPhone 5c as retailing for 60 Euros less than the 16GB model, which works out to about $83. The 16GB iPhone 5c is already $99 on-contract, so it’s hard to see how an 8GB version would be anything other than free.\n\nWe won’t know what Apple is planning until it announces the specifics of the rollout, but an 8GB iPhone 5c would probably slot into the bracket where the 8GB iPhone 4s is currently sitting. This would benefit Apple beyond pushing sales of the iPhone 5c. The 4s is using archaic hardware by smartphone standards, and Apple does like the keep its device ecosystem nice and unified.\n\nIf Apple does have to go to such extremes just to move the cheaper iPhone, it’ll be interesting to see how it pivots when new devices are announced at the end of summer. Maybe the iPhone 5c’s mediocre sales performance will doom it to being a blip on the radar, or perhaps Apple will just offer new versions with less storage from the start.', 'The iPhone 5c was much less budget-friendly than most were hoping, coming in just a bit under the cost of the flagship 5s.\nApple doesn’t discuss actual sales numbers very often, but reports indicate Apple stores have had trouble moving the iPhone 5c.\nThe documents list the 8GB iPhone 5c as retailing for 60 Euros less than the 16GB model, which works out to about $83.\nThe 16GB iPhone 5c is already $99 on-contract, so it’s hard to see how an 8GB version would be anything other than free.\nWe won’t know what Apple is planning until it announces the specifics of the rollout, but an 8GB iPhone 5c would probably slot into the bracket where the 8GB iPhone 4s is currently sitting.']"

The handset, which was intended as a low-cost alternative to the flagship iPhone 5s, never really caught on with consumers. Could an even cheaper version of the device salvage its place in Apple’s smartphone lineup?\n\nA newly leaked memo being sent around by German carrier O2 suggests an 8GB version of the device could launch as early as tomorrow, March 18th, at a price €60 (about $80) lower than the off-contract price of the 16GB model. As Apple typically likes to synchronize launches globally, there is a good chance that, should this rumor pan out, the cheaper, lower storage iPhone 5c could come to other parts of the world as well.\n\nApple’s iPhone 5c strategy has been curious since the smartphone’s announcement in September of last year. The handset was long-rumored as a cheap, entry level device that would target emerging markets. Instead, it was revealed as a retooled version of the iPhone 5 that would sell at a price not remarkably lower that the concurrently announced iPhone 5s.\n\nAround the world, the iPhone 5c never really caught on as a “budget” phone as consumers opted to spend a relatively small amount more to upgrade to the iPhone 5s. Poor sales of the “unapologetically plastic” device have only been masked by the popularity of the 5s, and Apple frequently references total sales of both devices under the same figure. Apple has repeatedly altered its order numbers to reflect a waning interest in the device.\n\nPerhaps a slightly cheaper iPhone 5c could drum up some additional sales, but it’s hard to see the variant turning around the model’s poor fortunes.

Apple currently offers the iPhone 5C in 16GB and 32GB models.\n\nOne source in the MacRumors report is Caschys Blog, a German site that became aware of an alleged note sent by German carrier O2 to retailers. The note, which has not been verified, claims the new 8GB phone would cost 509 euros, or $707, compared to the 569 euros, or $791, for the 16GB model.\n\nAnother source, the German blog iFun, reported that the 8GB version would launch on Tuesday. MacRumors also cited multiple sources who said Apple has already shipped the new phone to carrier stores in the U.K.\n\nFinally, Engadget posted a photo of a product package that lists a blue, 8GB iPhone 5C as the model.\n\nApple was rising 0.71% to $528.39 at 1:15 p.m. on Monday.\n\nMust Read: Warren Buffett\'s 10 Favorite Stocks\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance, expanding profit margins and growth in earnings per share. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nAAPL\'s revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 4.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 5.7%. Growth in the company\'s revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.\n\nAlthough AAPL\'s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.13 is very low, it is currently higher than that of the industry average. Along with the favorable debt-to-equity ratio, the company maintains an adequate quick ratio of 1.23, which illustrates the ability to avoid short-term cash problems.\n\nThe stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year.\n\n41.65% is the gross profit margin for APPLE INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 22.69% is above that of the industry average.\n\nAPPLE INC\'s earnings per share improvement from the most recent quarter was slightly positive. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, APPLE INC reported lower earnings of $39.63 versus $44.16 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($42.73 versus $39.63).\n\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: AAPL Ratings Report\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

A larger screen would make sense and it is also what Apple users have been clamoring for so it would not be a stretch of the imagination to think that particular rumor is true.\n\nAdvertising\n\nEarlier we had reported that an analyst had suggested that the iPhone 6 could pack several new sensors, like a temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity sensors, and now thanks to a tweet by Australian blogger, Sonny Dickson, additional specs of the iPhone 6 have been revealed.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Dickson, he has in the past been pretty instrumental in providing photos of leaked iPhone components. In fact he published a slew of iPhone 5c photos even before the phone had been announced, so safe to say that he has managed to build up a pretty solid reputation when it comes to leaking iPhone-related information.\n\nThat being said, according to Dickson, the upcoming iPhone 6 is said to be thinner than ever and will measure at 0.22-inches thin. It is also expected to pack an “Ultra Retina” display with a pixel density of 389ppi. This is a step up over the iPhone 5s’ display which has a pixel density of around 326ppi, but will pale in comparison to the Samsung Galaxy S5 which has a pixel density of around 432ppi.\n\nWe’re not sure if this means that Apple will be increasing the resolution of the iPhone 6 or increasing its display size and its resolution as these were details that Dickson had left out. He also asserts that the iPhone 6 will pack an A8 chipset clocked at 2.6GHz. Dickson also claims that the specs he revealed are the real deal, and like we said before, he has been pretty spot on when it comes to Apple rumors, so there is a chance he could be right on the money.

(NASDAQ:APL). The company, recognised as world’s most valuable company, is geared up for its much awaited iPhone 6, it’s no secret that the iPhone 6 would witness a massive launch as Apple will finally offer a bigger display to challenge the likes of the Galaxy S5 and other flagship Android phones and phablets. In anticipation of huge demand, Apple has reportedly ordered 90 million iPhone 6 units from mobile component maker Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd. (TPE:2354).\n\nThe New Mystery\n\nAccording to BGR, “Foxconn Electronics is expected to land orders for 90 million units of the iPhone 6 from April in 2014.” This information was shared by a Chinese-language Commercial Times that cited data from Citigroup Global Markets.\n\nThere is also a prediction that the launch of the iPhone 6 will send 2014 iPhone shipments surging 24% compared to last year. That would be almost double the 13% YOY growth that iPhone shipments saw in 2013. If this prediction goes right the iPhone 6 order could get a June/July launch date.\n\niPhone 6: 4.7″ Gorilla Glass\n\nDetails about the new iPhone are being closely guarded by Apple. But there are certain common rumors about it. Previously, Apple kept to smaller displays for its iPhone series, compared to most smartphones in the market, the tech giant did try to change this habit of its, Apple’s new flagship device is expected to come with a bigger screen, a 4.7-inch panel with an even denser set of pixels than “traditional” Retina display and cover glass made of sapphire, a material bested only by diamond in terms of toughness. Such a screen could also potentially woo back Android converts who left Apple solely because of the iPhone’s screen size.\n\nThere’s also some speculations that Apple will again release two versions of the iPhone, to appeal to different markets, the company is considering a 4.7-inch and a 5.7-inch model to further expand the current line, and not act as replacements for the 5s and 5c. A 5.7-inch model may take the firm well into “phablet” territory, however, the future existence of such a giant iPhone looks shady.\n\niPhone 6 do have some amazing features, but according to the rumors it is going to use sapphire glass instead of Gorilla glass, which is more expensive and about 1.6 times heavier. It’s environmentally unfriendly too; it takes about 100 times more energy to generate a sapphire crystal that it does glass. The pricing factor may affect the consumers, but as they say pricing has never been a problem for Apple, as most of its customers are from élite society.\n\nWill This Lead To Over Stocking?\n\nIn Q4 2013, Apple shipped 51 million iPhones, which exceeded the market forecast and the company showed a great deal of profits, this positive results would have motivated Apple to increase its production and supply. Though it is a positive move, it all depends when the handset is released though, if it makes its way into pockets by July it will have half a year to sell those 90 million. Then again if it doesn’t come until September, then it will have to sell 90 million units in three months.\n\nBut here we are talking about just not any company, it is the Apple, the inventor, the trend setter. so now it all depends on what it pulls out of the invention bag.\n\nFor those, who are not able to hold their horses, here is an amazing concept video of upcoming iPhone 6, dubbed as iPhone Air, from Apple:', 'In anticipation of huge demand, Apple has reportedly ordered 90 million iPhone 6 units from mobile component maker Foxconn Technology Co.

17772,http://www.gurufocus.com/news/251290/what-to-watch-out-for-in-apple,technology,"['Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one such company that’s always been on the headline. The Cupertino also obtains a superb share of media attention. The most gratifying of all is the amount of interest that it receives from its product fanatics. It’s actually unimaginable to think of enthusiasts standing in unending queues for days, travelling from one part of the globe to another, waiting day in day out just to get their hands on an Apple creation.\n\nNo other company can boast of such admiration. Apple however has stayed grounded and isn’t resting on its laurels. The company is the face of innovation and makes sure to keep its fans lost in thoughts asking: What’s the next big thing Apple’s coming out with? However, just as there are two sides of a coin, all isn’t well with the maker of iPhone. Let’s first talk in brief about the concerns.\n\n\n\nApple 5S. Source: gsmarena.com\n\nWhat’s not at its best?\n\nThe current quarter could be a bit challenging for Apple. According to a Wedge Partners analyst, the tech company could suffer a softer quarter as there are some weaknesses.\n\nFirst, the demand for smartphones is slowing, particularly for high-end smartphones. The problem with Apple is that its iPhones belong to the high-end segment. At the moment, low-end smartphone market is an area for growth, but iPhone 5C is also quite costly to target this arena. Apple doesn’t have a product offering for this segment. Now this leads to the next problem the company’s facing.\n\nAs the iPhone is a high-end smartphone, it fails to meet the requirement of emerging market. Samsung (SSNLF) is making hay in the absence of an Apple offering for emerging countries. The South Korean phone maker offers handsets for different market segments, and this is precisely why it’s so popular in emerging economies where most keep the costly iPhone at arm’s length.\n\nAnother area that didn’t work up to the expectations of the company was its deal with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL). Apple was quite hopeful that its deal with the Chinese telecom giant would lead to huge sales in the Asian economy. But sales haven’t been that solid. In addition, the demand for 5C, which is directed towards emerging economies, is weak and did not see that warm a reception like other Apple products get.\n\nLet’s now get into the positives.\n\nWhat’s on track?\n\nInnovation and R&D is one thing that Apple never compromises on as the technology giant knows pretty well that this is what sets it apart from the rest. There are huge expectations from the company’s upcoming iPhone 6 which is rumored to have a bigger screen. There have also been speculations about the iTV, and it is said that Apple has an expert team designing it. Other than that the company is also said to be working on the iWatch.\n\nApple has also come up with its integrated car service CarPlay that would allow drivers to have hands free control on their iPhone while driving their car. This would not only keep drivers connected to their smartphone, but also ensure a safer drive.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook promises that the company has some really exciting offerings on the way. All eyes are glued on Apple’s next revolutionary release. Undoubtedly there’s no matching Apple – but sometimes one’s own past glory becomes the biggest impediment. Will Cupertino’s upcoming offerings surpass its own past excellence? May or maybe not. But one thing’s for sure – there won’t be another Apple.', 'Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one such company that’s always been on the headline.\nSamsung (SSNLF) is making hay in the absence of an Apple offering for emerging countries.\nApple was quite hopeful that its deal with the Chinese telecom giant would lead to huge sales in the Asian economy.\nThere are huge expectations from the company’s upcoming iPhone 6 which is rumored to have a bigger screen.\nThere have also been speculations about the iTV, and it is said that Apple has an expert team designing it.']"

According to him, the next-generation iPhone could be 0.22 inches thick, compared to the 0.30 inches thickness of the existing iPhone 5s.\n\nDickson also spoke about the display quality of the iPhone 6. According to him, the new iPhone is likely to feature an Ultra Retina screen, which could boast a density of 389 pixels per inch. By comparison, the iPhone 5s’ display has 1136x640 pixel resolution at 326 ppi.\n\nIf the iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch display as suggested by multiple media reports so far, obtaining the 389ppi density at that screen size would require the resolution to be higher than 720p (1280x720), but lower than 1080p (1920x1080), Phone Arena reported.\n\nWhen it comes to the processor of the iPhone 6, Dickson said the handset cold be powered by a new A8 processor, which should be clocking at 2.6GHz. The iPhone 5s, on the other hand, features an A7 processor, clocking at 1.3 GHz.\n\nThese specs could be the real thing #JustSaying — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) March 14, 2014\n\nLast week, Taiwan’s Commercial Times reported that an improved A8 processor for the iPhone 6 is already in production at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, or TSMC (NYSE:TSM). The report said that the new chip is based on TSMC’s 20-nanometer process technology, as opposed to the existing A7 chip, which was produced on Samsung’s (KRX:005935) 28-nanometer technology.\n\nHowever, reports surfaced earlier this week saying that Samsung could split production of the A8 processor with TSMC, taking a larger share than previously suggested.\n\nIn addition to a larger display, the iPhone 6 is also rumored to sport a sapphire crystal display cover, and according to a report from DigiTimes Research on Friday, GT Advance Technologies (NASDAQ:GTAT), the company has partnered with Apple to open a sapphire plant in Mesa, Ariz., and is expected to supply 9 percent to 16.6 percent of the iPhone sapphire screen covers in 2014.\n\nHere is an excerpt from the report:\n\nAssuming that the new-generation iPhone will have a 5-inch screen, then the forecast sapphire revenues are translated into output of 6.27-11.6 million 5-inch sapphire-made screen covers. As Digitimes Research estimates that Apple will ship 70 million units of the new-generation iPhone in 2014, the output of sapphire screen covers from GTAT will account for 9.0-16.6% of the iPhone shipments.\n\nApple is widely rumored to incorporate a larger, scratch-resistant sapphire display as a key feature in the iPhone 6; the company currently uses the material for small iPhone elements like the camera lens and the home button of the iPhone 5s, MacRumors reported.\n\nAccording to some analysts, an iPhone 6 with a bigger screen could also benefit Apple’s stock. While Brian Blair of Wedge Partners said that the company’s stock could rise between $600 and $650 over the next 12 months, Andy Hargreaves, an analyst at Pacific Crest, recently upgraded Apple's stock to “outperform,” and gave it a $635 price target.\n\nHargreaves even predicted that the iPhone 6 could be priced at $299 under a contract, $100 more than what Apple charges for the iPhone 5s. Based on current rumors and previous iPhone release schedules, the iPhone 6 is expected to be released in September."", 'According to him, the next-generation iPhone could be 0.22 inches thick, compared to the 0.30 inches thickness of the existing iPhone 5s.\nBy comparison, the iPhone 5s’ display has 1136x640 pixel resolution at 326 ppi.\nThe iPhone 5s, on the other hand, features an A7 processor, clocking at 1.3 GHz.\nHargreaves even predicted that the iPhone 6 could be priced at $299 under a contract, $100 more than what Apple charges for the iPhone 5s.\nBased on current rumors and previous iPhone release schedules, the iPhone 6 is expected to be released in September.']"

In a leading editorial arguing against the merger, The Economist says that combining the two companies would create “a Goliath far more fearsome than the latest ride at the Universal Studios theme park” that would have entirely too much control over broadband infrastructure in the United States.\n\n“If the takeover is approved, Comcast would control 20 of the top 25 cable markets, according to MoffettNathanson, a research firm,” The Economist writes. “Antitrust officials will need to consider Comcast’s status as a monopsony (a buyer with disproportionate power), when it comes to negotiations with programmers, whose channels it pays to carry. Comcast could refuse to carry certain channels, or use its clout to insist on even greater price discounts or to favor its own content over that of others.”\n\nThe Economist goes on to write that both Comcast and Time Warner Cable are “reviled” by American consumers for both shoddy customer service and high prices and that they would only be encouraged to continue such practices if they were allowed to merge. The bottom line, says the publication, is that regulators should “reject a merger that would reduce competition, provide no benefit to consumers and sap the incentive to innovate.”', 'No one can exactly accuse the editors of The Economist of being wild-eyed populists or enemies of capitalism, which is why it’s noteworthy that the magazine has taken a pretty strong stance against the proposed merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable.\nIn a leading editorial arguing against the merger, The Economist says that combining the two companies would create “a Goliath far more fearsome than the latest ride at the Universal Studios theme park” that would have entirely too much control over broadband infrastructure in the United States.\n“If the takeover is approved, Comcast would control 20 of the top 25 cable markets, according to MoffettNathanson, a research firm,” The Economist writes.\n“Antitrust officials will need to consider Comcast’s status as a monopsony (a buyer with disproportionate power), when it comes to negotiations with programmers, whose channels it pays to carry.\nThe bottom line, says the publication, is that regulators should “reject a merger that would reduce competition, provide no benefit to consumers and sap the incentive to innovate.”']"

After that, the book strays a bit and loses itself. It\'s more focused on things happening outside Apple like patent suits and working conditions in factories.\n\nWe\'ve read the book and there are a bunch of fun tiny details about Apple, Jobs, Tim Cook, and even Jony Ive that we hadn\'t heard before.\n\nProbably the most interesting is that after Steve Jobs died, lead designer Jony Ive asked Apple to give him a private jet.\n\nIve had assumed more control and more power within the company. Jobs used to fly in a Gulfstream paid for by Apple, and Ive wanted the same thing. He makes a lot of trips around the world.\n\nKane says CEO Tim Cook and the board drew a line. It rejected Ive\'s request.\n\nThat\'s just one of many little nuggets. Here are some more. These aren\'t Earth-shattering revelations, but they\'re fun little tid-bits we thought we\'d pass along:\n\nJobs\' favorite water was Glaceau SmartWater.\n\nApple has goofy names for conference rooms. The developer relations team names their rooms after evangelists like Tammy Faye and Pat Robertson. The iPhone software team has a room named ""Between"" which is between the ""Rock"" and ""Hard Place"" meeting rooms.\n\nFormer Apple CEO Gil Amelio always ate his meals off china. His assistants had to take food out of take out containers and put it on china.\n\nSteve Jobs hated Amelio, and created the Gil-o-meter to gauge how stupid someone is. Two Gils meant you were twice as dumb as Amelio.\n\nSteve Jobs made the final call on naming the iPhone 3GS. But, initially he wanted it to be the iPhone 3G S. He later killed the space.\n\nWhen Jobs announced he needed surgery in 2004, Apple stock dropped 2%. His response: ""That\'s it?""\n\nApple initially planned to charge $399 for the iPad, but it was so confident in the product that it raised the price to $499.\n\nAt a meeting with Apple\'s top 100 employees Jobs asked for suggestions of a better name than ""iPod"" before the product was released. Employees suggested ""iPlay"" and ""iMusic."" Jobs\' response: ""Those are all sh*t. I\'m sticking with what I\'ve got.""\n\nJobs wanted to call NeXT, the company he did after Apple, ""Two."" He was talked out of that.\n\nJobs said the two coolest things he\'d done in life were the first Macintosh and the first iPhone.\n\nWhen Jobs went on leave in 2008, Tim Cook\'s parents were so proud of their son, the went into the local newspaper\'s offices to give an interview about Cook. The newspaper didn\'t even ask them to come in, they just did it. When Apple found out, it tried to get the paper to kill the story. The paper didn\'t kill the story, but it downplayed it.\n\nCook wasn\'t obsessed with computers growing up. Kane quotes him saying, ""The truth is, I\'d never thought much about computers. It just sort of happened. Would things have turned out different if that hadn\'t happened? I don\'t know. But I do know that there are only a very few things in life that define you and that was one of them for me.""\n\ndo One time Cook was in an airport lounge at Heathrow in London. He grabbed some cookies and wanted to know why they were called ""digestives."" He asked, ""Are these something I need be careful of?"" He was told they\'re just cookies. His response, ""With a name like digestives, I didn\'t know what I was going to be eating.""\n\nEddy Cue, who is one of the most important people at Apple now, tells his story of how he got Jobs\' attention. He was in a meeting, and told Jobs his opinion. Jobs told him to shut up. Cue didn\'t shut up. So Jobs threw a pen at his forehead. Cue persisted. By the third time Jobs was listening.\n\nAfter Jobs died, Jony Ive, Apple\'s leading designer was distraught. He supposedly told a confidant, ""What am I going to do? I don\'t have my intellectual partner.""\n\nIf you want more, go get the book >', 'We\'ve read the book and there are a bunch of fun tiny details about Apple, Jobs, Tim Cook, and even Jony Ive that we hadn\'t heard before.\nProbably the most interesting is that after Steve Jobs died, lead designer Jony Ive asked Apple to give him a private jet.\nJobs used to fly in a Gulfstream paid for by Apple, and Ive wanted the same thing.\nHis response, ""With a name like digestives, I didn\'t know what I was going to be eating.""\nHe was in a meeting, and told Jobs his opinion.']"

In fact, he’s extremely intense.

But Apple’s own definition of success is much more. Its promise is to be exceptional – to make insanely great products that change the world.

17790,http://9to5mac.com/2014/03/18/book-review-haunted-empire-apple-after-steve-jobs/,technology,"['Former WSJ Apple writer Yukari Iwatani Kane’s long-awaited book based on more than 200 interviews with current and former executives and insiders goes on sale today ($12.74 Amazon/$14.99 iBookstore/Free Audible Audiobook). We got an advance copy, and I enjoyed the first 85 pages or so of background including Steve Jobs’s transitioning the company during the last bout with his terminal cancer. This area included some interesting new tidbits (did you know Apple almost sold the original iPad for $399?).\n\nThe middle of the book meanders somewhat aimlessly into the big stories after Steve Jobs’s death, but spending way too much time on Foxconn, the Samsung trial, the DOJ ebooks trial and patent minutia. I frankly had a hard time staying involved in some of these chapters because it was like re-reading old news reports with little new information to keep me satiated.\n\nHowever, over this period of the book, you start to get an idea of where the whole thing is going. Kane is clearly offended by Apple’s arrogance, and she’s not buying the same old marketing spin that Apple continues to employ after Jobs. When she talks about post-Steve Jobs events, the on-stage jokes are not funny to her (“painful”) and the ‘forced superlatives’ and jabs at the competition are deceptive and betray a deeper insecurity in her eyes. This carries over into Tim Cook’s media appearances including a so-called “disastrous” AllThingsD.\n\nSure Steve Jobs and company have been telling Redmond to “start their copiers” and making Longhorn gags since forever, but now the jokes and marketing no longer ring true – without someone with the credibility to deliver them, like Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd that’s the general theme of the book. That Apple cannot be Apple after Steve Jobs. There must be a story arc here and after Steve Jobs, the company must go into decline. In fact, Kane actually says this in the epilogue (but perhaps it should have been in the prologue):\n\nThe book concludes exactly how it has been prepared to conclude (sorry, no surprise ending). Apple is in a free fall (increasing sales numbers notwithstanding). Employees are leaving for Google and other Valley startups as soon as their stocks vest, if they can wait that long. Behind the scenes, morale is low and people are scrambling to find that lost sense of purpose. There is no room to believe that Apple could, in fact, have “its most innovative years in front of it”, to use Steve Jobs’s resignation words.\n\nAll of that said, I didn’t hate this book like a lot of other Apple reviewers did. I believe it is good for folks like us who often bathe ourselves in pro-Apple news and opinion to get an alternate reality that perhaps the mainstream sees more often in the 24-hour news/entertainment cycle. There were some interesting bits and, if nothing else, Kane’s view of Apple is somehow both cautionary and entertaining.\n\n($12.74 Amazon/$14.99 iBookstore/Free Audible Audiobook)\n\n40.714513 -74.005122', 'However, over this period of the book, you start to get an idea of where the whole thing is going.\nKane is clearly offended by Apple’s arrogance, and she’s not buying the same old marketing spin that Apple continues to employ after Jobs.\nThat Apple cannot be Apple after Steve Jobs.\nThere must be a story arc here and after Steve Jobs, the company must go into decline.\nThere is no room to believe that Apple could, in fact, have “its most innovative years in front of it”, to use Steve Jobs’s resignation words.']"

It is another to do so while being dubbed one of the worst CEOs ever, according to several polls. It is, of course, a whole different thing entirely to be the man to have allegedly given Steve Jobs his walking papers in 1985.\n\nJohn Sculley announced a few days ago that he is launching a new phone brand called Obi in India. At a price range between $90 and $200, Sculley hopes that Obi\'s phones will lure premium phone buyers away from players like Samsung and Apple, and take the fight to local giants like Micromax and Karbonn.\n\nThis would not normally cause much of a flutter in the news business if the name ""Sculley"" didn\'t bring back such strong feelings. Most accounts portray former Apple CEO John Sculley as universally reviled not just for canning someone who turned out to be perhaps the biggest product and marketing genius the world has seen, but also for several missteps that led to his own firing in 1993 by Apple\'s board.\n\nWhen Sculley did join Apple as CEO in 1983, he was supposed to act as, well, Obi-Wan Kenobi to Jobs\' Luke Skywalker. Jobs, an acknowledged visionary, was apparently just too mercurial and ill disciplined to run things at the company in a mature manner, thought the board.\n\nAccording to Apple lore, Jobs approached Sculley, a brilliant marketer who had proven himself by climbing up the ranks to become president of PepsiCo by launching famous strategies such as the ""Pepsi Challenge"". Jobs apparently told Sculley, ""Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world?""\n\nInitially, according to reports, things went swimmingly. But then the cracks began to appear, followed by a major rupture big enough to be Silicon Valley\'s equivalent of the San Andreas Fault.\n\nWhat followed is a matter of some contestation. Some say that Sculley lacked the one thing necessary to make a tech company in the Valley survive and do well; namely, product management skills. The lack of any technical abilities contributed to Sculley being named one of the worst CEOs ever in history by this publication as well as this one.\n\nApple fanatics will also undoubtedly point to Sculley\'s apparent unwillingness to license the Apple OS, as well as his decision to raise the price of the Macintosh when computer prices were falling at the beginning of the end of the old Apple. Tack on his serial failures in bringing out new products such as the Newton and CD players — both arguably visionary in their own right and ahead of their time — as well as the calamitous foray into the PowerPC ship, and many think he truly deserves to be on the aforementioned CEO list.\n\nBut Jobs doesn\'t get off easy in this tale, either. According to this archived Businessweek article, written in the mid-\'90s, that documented the fall of Apple, a rigid Jobs wouldn\'t face the technical weaknesses of his products. For instance, the first Mac was ""a design statement. Dazzling to look at, it was badly underpowered and lacked the expansion capability to fix that."" After sales quickly stagnated, Sculley apparently suggested another version of the product, but Jobs refused and lobbied the board to turf Sculley out. Instead, he found himself out of a job and a company.\n\nSculley has his own version of events. According to this article by ZDNet\'s sister site CNET, the clash was the result of the Macintosh Office failure in 1985, which was widely criticized as being underpowered. Sculley says that Jobs went into a ""deep depression"".\n\n""Steve came to me and he said, \'I want to drop the price of the Macintosh and I want to move the advertising, shift a large portion of it away from the Apple 2 over to the Mac,"" said Sculley in the CNET piece.\n\n""I said, \'Steve, it\'s not going to make any difference. The reason the Mac is not selling has nothing to do with the price or with the advertising. If you do that, we risk throwing the company into a loss.\' And he just totally disagreed with me,"" Sculley continued.\n\n""And so I said, ""Well, I\'m gonna go to the board. And he said, \'I don\'t believe you\'ll do it. And I said: Watch me.""\n\nDecades later, Sculley says that he regrets the way things unravelled. ""What I didn\'t really understand at the time was that tech products go through dramatic life-cycles, that products which are successful one year can go out of business the next year,"" he said. Sculley said he tried to re-engage with Jobs but Jobs never responded.\n\n""I wish Steve and I hadn\'t had a falling out. I wish I had gone back to Steve and said, ""This is your company, let\'s figure out how you can come back and be CEO."" I wish I had thought of that. But you can\'t change history,"" added Sculley. This sounds heartfelt but Mac (or Jobs) fans will probably never forgive Sculley for crowning himself the chief technology officer of Apple in 1990, in a world that he admittedly never completely understood.\n\nBut that was then and this is now. Today, Apple is a global giant but an insignificant factor in India\'s smartphone wars, with not even 1 percent of share. And Jobs is longer around to innovate within the company and position it for where the action is, which is the developing world.\n\nSculley, on the other hand, will have his work cut out for him if he wants to take business away from local stalwarts or even global brands like Nokia, which is finally innovating for the Indian market with snazzy new devices at low cost with just another smartphone on the block.\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere up there, Jobs is probably shaking his head in wry amusement at the huffing and puffing of these mere mortals, itching to get another crack at changing the world.\n\nMaybe Sculley ""firing"" him was the best thing that ever happened to Apple.', ""It is one thing to compete with Apple in India, a country that is the hottest smartphone market in the world.\nIt is, of course, a whole different thing entirely to be the man to have allegedly given Steve Jobs his walking papers in 1985.\nJohn Sculley announced a few days ago that he is launching a new phone brand called Obi in India.\nWhen Sculley did join Apple as CEO in 1983, he was supposed to act as, well, Obi-Wan Kenobi to Jobs' Luke Skywalker.\nToday, Apple is a global giant but an insignificant factor in India's smartphone wars, with not even 1 percent of share.""]"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) often cloaks its operations in mystery, which provides analysts both amateur and professional with ample room to make sweeping predictions that seldom come true in reality. In the case of Apple’s involvement with television manufacture, however, rumors cut both ways just as strongly. Some analysts firmly declare that the Cupertino enterprise will never produce a full-sized television set, while others are just as convinced that such a device is on the brink of a dramatic and triumphant release.\n\nSteve Jobs was opposed to any effort on Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) part to manufacture a television, according to the recent book “Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs” by Yukari Kane. Mr. Jobs maintained that television sets were a very poor business for an electronics company to get into, due to their low turnover. Televisions, he said, are replaced at intervals four times longer than smartphones, meaning that the typical buyer of a hypothetical iTelevision would not purchase another for eight years on average. This was too long to generate the steady, high profits Mr. Jobs envisioned for his firm.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Jobs backpedaled shortly before his death, and stated to his biographer that he would like to make a television. Since then, “imminent” iTelevision releases have been predicted, often with great enthusiasm, by some of the best analytical minds in the business today. Nevertheless, the device has stubbornly refused to materialize, and each new prediction withers and is forgotten as the months continue to pass with no full-sized Apple television announced.\n\nThe Apple TV remains as part of the California company’s product lineup, of course, though this is a compact digital media player which enables play of iTunes, Netflix, YouTube, and various other services through an Apple interface. Currently in its third generation, the device generates a total of around $1 billion in sales out of Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) annual haul of approximately $171 billion, or slightly less than 0.6 percent of revenue. Since this means 99.4 percent of Apple’s profit comes from non-television related products, the current volume generated by Apple TV is scant incentive to boldly launch into this new potential market.\n\nIdeas such as a touchscreen remote for the 4th generation Apple TV might boost sales a bit, but they would be unlikely to even double earnings from the device, meaning that 1.2 percent of Apple’s overall sales would be an extremely optimistic figure to result from such a move.\n\nFigures from the Consumer Electronics Association show a television market that is hardly tempting to a new entrant, no matter how powerful. Prices are steadily declining, falling to an average $495 over the five years ending in 2013, from $904 at the start of the period. Additionally, Samsung, LG, and other firms are already well established in the television world and have made it their fief. Apple would be the interloper, attempting to gain a foothold in a market where it lacks experience and allied companies alike.\n\nIn light of all these considerations, it seems likely that Apple Inc. (AAPL) will opt for a cautious policy of “wait and see.” The firm can maintain a presence in television-related products by continuing to upgrade and update the Apple TV device. Then, if a perfect confluence of circumstances ever comes together which suggests the market will reward them amply When or if that day will ever arrive remains unclear, however, and as a result it seems likely that Apple will continue to wait, leaving development of a full-sized television to an indeterminate point in the future. Such a project may be in the cards someday, but it probably is not today.', 'This was too long to generate the steady, high profits Mr. Jobs envisioned for his firm.\nNevertheless, the device has stubbornly refused to materialize, and each new prediction withers and is forgotten as the months continue to pass with no full-sized Apple television announced.\nThe Apple TV remains as part of the California company’s product lineup, of course, though this is a compact digital media player which enables play of iTunes, Netflix, YouTube, and various other services through an Apple interface.\nFigures from the Consumer Electronics Association show a television market that is hardly tempting to a new entrant, no matter how powerful.\nIn light of all these considerations, it seems likely that Apple Inc.

Instead of being in a ""selling mode,"" companies should focus on educating consumers on what a device does, why it exists and how it can improve their lives, Johnson says. In fact, she differentiates the two, saying marketing is not the same as selling. This idea of teaching rather than selling speaks to Apple\'s mantra of making the best possible products, which in turn will sell themselves.Also touched upon was Apple\'s approach to launching finished products rather than ""beta hardware"" like Google Glass. Comparing the two techniques, Johnson appreciates the Google method of gathering information from user experience, but said ""Apple wouldn\'t do that. Never, ever, ever.""To that point, Johnson described Jobs\' insistence on secrecy. A final product would only be unveiled when it was ready for consumers, and the job of announcing that product on stage always fell to Jobs.""It was just something he really, really enjoyed —he was passionate about,"" Johnson said, adding that the veiled secrecy method is something only Apple can pull off.We could just put things on the website and the world would blow up automatically. Everybody would be talking about it, reading about, writing about it. It was a really interesting and important technique. It\'s unique to Apple. I don\'t think a lot of companies can operate that way.""Johnson also shared a few anecdotes about Jobs, including two instances where he was seen crying over the trials and tribulations of running a company with which he was so deeply entwined.The first was an ad campaign surrounding the release of The Beatles on iTunes, a band which Jobs loved but had difficulties bringing to the music store due in part to a legal spat regarding the ""Apple"" trademark (The Beatles founded ""Apple Records"" as a division of the band\'s Apple Corps project). According to Johnson, the project was extremely important to Jobs.A team from Apple visited London to pick up more than a thousand never-before-seen photographs of The Beatles to be used as part of the ad campaign. When the pictures were finally brought back and spread out on a boardroom table, Jobs perused the collection in tears knowing he had finally accomplished a longtime goal.\n\nA second story focused on the impact negative publicity had on the late Apple cofounder.""He was so sad and so angry about the ""antennagate"" issue and how that was getting portrayed,"" Johnson said. ""His core leadership team —product and marketing leadership team —were sitting around the table, and he was pounding the table and said, \'This is not the company I want to be. This is not what we are building, we don\'t want to be that company, we don\'t want people to think about us this way.""Where the Beatles milestone brought tears, ""antennagate"" caused sobbing.""Did he deeply care about that company and was it one and the same as him?

On the last day of the event, Jobs told attendees to ""ask me anything"" without fear of insulting him. Somebody asked Jobs if Apple was going to release a TV.\n\nJobs didn\'t hesitate in his response: ""No.""\n\nHe explained that ""TV is a terrible business.

While it\'s possible to turn a profit, margins on big-screen TVs are extremely thin, which is why manufacturers have been turning to 4K and Smart TV features to coax consumers to spend more money on big screens.\n\nControlling the living room, however, was still a goal, Jobs said, which is why Apple kept iterating on its Apple TV set-top box.

Williams asked Cook, ""What can you do for television watching … what do you know that\'s going to change the game that we don\'t know yet. Cook\'s response: It\'s a market we see that\'s been left behind."" He further noted that ""It\'s an area of intense interest – I can\'t say more than that."" Was Cook Lying or is a tale out of a new book titled Haunted Empire a make-believe accounting of what Steve Jobs said about making an HDTV? Do we trust Apple\'s CEO who recently stated that Apple TV is no longer a hobby, or a reported account that\'s about three years old at this moment in time? You be the judge.\n\nToday, Business Insider reported on a segment of a new book titled ""Haunted Empire: Apple after Steve Jobs"" by former Wall Street Journal\'s Yukari Iwatani Kane. The segment recounted an Apple executive retreat. The report states that ""One person asked if Apple was going to release a television next. There were already rumors all over the place that it was Apple\'s next conquest. Yukari says \'Jobs didn\'t hesitate.\'"" He said, ""No.""\n\nReportedly Steve Jobs stated that ""TV is a terrible business. They don\'t turn over and the margins suck."" Though he reportedly said that he did want to control the living room and went on to state that Apple TV would remain a hobby until Apple got all the content it needed.\n\nInterestingly in February of this year, Apple\'s CEO Tim Cook admitted that Apple TV was now too big to a hobby racking up a billion dollars in sales. Apple TV is in fact closer to what Steve Jobs pointed to as being a pivotal point in the evolution of Apple TV: ""Until Apple got all the content it needed.""\n\nYet Yukari says that some people in the room believed Jobs\' comments on TV. Others, the ""veterans in the room"" weren\'t sure that Jobs really meant it. Those people thought it was a message from Jobs to focus on what they were doing instead of trying to think of the next thing too quickly.\n\nYes, the ""veterans in the room"" weren\'t sure that Jobs really meant it."" That\'s really a key point. Steve Jobs had in other interviews over the years laughed at the idea of a tablet or cloud computing. Jobs had openly denied that Apple was ever working on a phone. And so freeze framing a reported incident of Steve talking about a TV three years ago is as close to useless as it gets. And with Apple\'s veteran executives saying they weren\'t really sure Jobs meant it, does it really sink the idea of a future Apple TV as in HDTV? No.\n\nEven the business models Jobs was quoting is now woefully outdated. When a 32"" HDTV cost $2500 it wasn\'t a turn-around electronic device. Today, a 32"" HDTV sells for less than an iPhone 5S. And Apple has always been able to sell a commodity device for more by elevating its styling or software. The iPhone wasn\'t and isn\'t a cheap smartphone. So this is not an argument that stands the laugh test.\n\nThat\'s not to say that Apple is racing to introduce an HDTV to market in the foreseeable future. But it also doesn\'t write it off by any stretch of the imagination either. Apple\'s engineers are still plugging away at new aspects of an HDTV, like this fused glass housing that\'s a recent patent-pending invention of Apple\'s.\n\nThere\'s a lot more technology that Apple is working on for 4K resolution based displays. We still don\'t know what Apple acquired PrimeSense for who is a leader in 3D technology. This technology was used in Microsoft\'s Kinect. It could also be redirected to Apple\'s long standing invention regarding future controls for a TV, wall display or gaming system.\n\nAnd if you want to own the living room, TV\'s with advanced FaceTime capabilities built-in will be a must. Today, we don\'t have eye-to-eye contact with those we talk to on Apple\'s FaceTime. To do that, displays would need to have tiny cameras built right into the fabric of the display itself. Yes, like Apple\'s 2006 invention about integrating hidden sensors into the display.\n\nAnd one more thing: The very Steve Jobs who reportedly said ""no"" to a TV three years ago is the very same Steve Jobs who told this biographer Walter Issacson that he ""cracked it."" A reference made about cracking the code to building an HDTV.\n\nSeth Weintraub of 9to5 Mac pointed to the following specific quote on October 21, 2011:\n\n""He very much wanted to do for television sets what he had done for computers, music players, and phones: make them simple and elegant,"" Isaacson wrote.\n\nIsaacson continued: ""\'I\'d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,\' he told me. \'It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.\' No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes for DVD players and cable channels. \'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it.\'""\n\nIn the end does the accounting of one a one-word statement made at an Annual Apple Executive Retreat three years ago sink the hopes for a future HDTV from Apple? Ha! – No, of course not. Especially in light of Steve Jobs articulating a snippet of his vision for an Apple HDTV (or the like) prior to his passing which would counter any previous statements on the matter.\n\nOn the flipside, I wouldn\'t be expecting Santa to be filling his sleigh with them this year, either. But one of these days, you never know.\n\nAbout Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.', 'Today, Business Insider reported on a segment of a new book titled ""Haunted Empire: Apple after Steve Jobs"" by former Wall Street Journal\'s Yukari Iwatani Kane.\nApple TV is in fact closer to what Steve Jobs pointed to as being a pivotal point in the evolution of Apple TV: ""Until Apple got all the content it needed.""\nSteve Jobs had in other interviews over the years laughed at the idea of a tablet or cloud computing.\nAnd with Apple\'s veteran executives saying they weren\'t really sure Jobs meant it, does it really sink the idea of a future Apple TV as in HDTV?\nIn the end does the accounting of one a one-word statement made at an Annual Apple Executive Retreat three years ago sink the hopes for a future HDTV from Apple?']"

Next to the iWatch, it is perhaps the most hyped Apple device that doesn’t actually exist — Apple applying their design and engineering to a beautiful, internet-connected 4K television set. As far as we know, Apple has no plans to release such a device in the near future. According to newly released quotes from Steve Jobs, they never did.\n\nAt a yearly meeting of Apple’s top executives employees — the last Steve Jobs would preside over before his untimely death — the late CEO made it clear that he had no interest in seeing Apple pursue a television business. When asked by an employee during an open Q&A session, Jobs gave an emphatic “No” in regards to whether or not a television set was in Apple’s plans. He elaborated, saying that the turnover simply isn’t great enough and the profit margin is too low.\n\nIt’s true, Apple isn’t likely to find the same sort of money in television sets as it does in iPhones and iPads. These devices are upgraded on a consistent basis at a friendly margin for Apple. A television’s life cycle typically lasts some 8 years, and sets are sold with little wiggle room for profit.\n\nWith Jobs no longer calling the shots at Apple the company’s thinking could have changed. Sure, their other businesses generate enough revenue that Apple could float a less profitable TV business, but why bother? It would appear Cupertino’s sights are instead set on building out a content ecosystem for their Apple TV hardware, shaping it from the “hobby” product it started as to a real source of growth.\n\nRecent months have seen the addition of many new content streams, and rumors point to the launch of revamped Apple TV hardware this year. The new device could also come with some sort of subscription television service as part of agreements between Apple and major cable and satellite providers.\n\nWill we ever see that iTV?

They don’t turn over and the margins suck,” Jobs said at Apple’s annual “Top 100” high-level employee summit, according to excerpts of Kane’s book published Sunday by Business Insider. That’s been interpreted as a refutation of Jobs’ famous statement about an Apple television to biographer Walter Isaccson, who wrote in his 2011 book on the exec that Jobs said, “I’d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use.”\n\nSEE ALSO: Apple Television Is Coming! Brave Analyst Revives Most Unreliable Rumor in History\n\nThe exchange between Jobs and Apple’s top execs was reported by the Journal in 2011. Jobs, in response to a question about the company’s plans in this area, “responded that it would be a bad business to get into, noting that the margins on television are far lower than the margins Apple makes from its other devices and that consumers don’t buy new televisions very frequently,” according to the paper‘s account.\n\nApple is notoriously secretive about its strategy and product plans. Interest in the not-actually-new statements by Jobs, resurfacing like the ghost of Hamlet’s father, reflects the cult-like passion among company watchers in trying to divine the colossal company’s next big move. But Apple’s strategy has obviously evolved since Jobs’ death, and any private comments he may have made more than two years ago do not signal anything definitive one way or the other about the company’s current thinking.\n\nFor now, one of Silicon Valley’s most popular guessing games — whether Apple will launch its own TV set — will continue. Industry analysts for more than three years have routinely predicted various incarnations of what an Apple HDTV might cost, what it might look like and when it might be available.\n\nIn the meantime, the company has focused on the Apple TV set-top, a $99 device that provides access to iTunes content, as well as Netflix, YouTube, HBO Go and other video services. Last month at the company’s annual shareholders meeting, CEO Tim Cook said Apple TV pulled in more than $1 billion in revenue in 2013, including both hardware sales and content purchased through the devices.\n\n“It’s a little more difficult to call (Apple TV) a hobby these days,” said Cook at the shareholders meeting, referring to the term Jobs had once used to describe the set-top.\n\nApple reportedly is prepping a refreshed version of the Apple TV set-top with a faster processor and redesigned interface that may be announced as early as April, according to a Bloomberg report.

Those comments had previously been reported in the Journal in 2011.\n\nAnd then there’s Walter Isaacson’s take on Jobs’ feelings about TV.\n\nThe former Time editor wrote a best-selling biography of Jobs that featured extensive interviews with the Apple visionary.

""I finally cracked it.""Well, not only was Apple beaten to the punch for a media center with the ""simplest user interface you could imagine,"" it now appears that Jobs\' comments contradict a very firm position he expressed before a group of 100 Apple executives, managers, and employees.According to a new book by former Wall Street Journal Apple beat reporter Yukari Iwatani Kane, Steve Jobs vowed that Apple would never, ever make a company-branded television set, claiming it to be bad business.In Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs -- as reported by Business Insider -- Yukari explains that in 2010, at an annual superprivate meeting with 100 of Apple\'s cream of the crop, Jobs talked to his flock about upcoming projects.""You\'ve got Steve Jobs sitting right here,"" the CEO allegedly said on the last day of the meeting. ""You\'re my guys, you can ask me anything you want. I don\'t care how dumb it is or how insulting it is. I want to make you all feel comfortable about whatever questions you have about the company.""Immediately managing to make Jobs go back on his word, one person in the audience asked if Apple was planning on releasing a television set. Jobs quickly asserted, without hesitation, ""No.""""TV is a terrible business,"" Jobs said. ""They don\'t turn over, and the margins suck,"" referring to the long life span of the television set versus a smartphone or tablet, which consumers replace every couple of years or so.But that isn\'t to say that Jobs didn\'t want to completely avoid the media center industry. Jobs added that the Apple TV set-top box would remain ""a hobby"" as it continued to gather content and a larger audience.Although some folks in the room doubted Jobs\' reluctance to release a TV and assumed it was his usual expedient manner to keep his underlings focused on current projects, it\'s been years since Jobs made both contradictory comments, and we still don\'t have an Apple TV set on the market. Even more confusing, current CEO Tim Cook told NBC\'s Brian Williams in late 2012 that the TV market was ""an area of intense interest,"" adding, ""I can\'t say more than that.""Maybe Cook was as ambivalent about the project as we are still uncertain of its likelihood.But as the media center market continues to grow and customers grow more wary of the monopolistic power that cable companies have acquired -- not to mention the possibility it could get even worse with the merger between NASDAQ:CMCSA ) and NYSE:TWC ) looming on the horizon -- consumers are more ready than ever to drop the expensive and antiquated method to watch television content. And although the Apple TV had a head start, the Chromecast appears to be the one leading cord-cutters away from those monthly subscriptions.Unless Apple soon changes the game with a new TV set or a sizable and attractive overhaul to the Apple TV box, Cupertino could have a hard time catching up in the burgeoning war over people\'s living rooms.', 'Steve Jobs even stoked the fires of the Apple rumor mill with comments he made to author Walter Isaacson in the high-profile 2011 biography about the former CEO.\n""I\'d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,"" Jobs famously intimated.\n""You\'ve got Steve Jobs sitting right here,"" the CEO allegedly said on the last day of the meeting.\n""Immediately managing to make Jobs go back on his word, one person in the audience asked if Apple was planning on releasing a television set.\nEven more confusing, current CEO Tim Cook told NBC\'s Brian Williams in late 2012 that the TV market was ""an area of intense interest,"" adding, ""I can\'t say more than that.']"

This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance, expanding profit margins and growth in earnings per share. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nAAPL\'s revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 4.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 5.7%. Growth in the company\'s revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.\n\nAlthough AAPL\'s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.13 is very low, it is currently higher than that of the industry average. Along with the favorable debt-to-equity ratio, the company maintains an adequate quick ratio of 1.23, which illustrates the ability to avoid short-term cash problems.\n\nThe stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year.\n\n41.65% is the gross profit margin for APPLE INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 22.69% is above that of the industry average.\n\nAPPLE INC\'s earnings per share improvement from the most recent quarter was slightly positive. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, APPLE INC reported lower earnings of $39.63 versus $44.16 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($42.73 versus $39.63).\n\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: AAPL Ratings Report\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

Plans for the product may have been put on the back burner years ago, though.

""TV is a terrible business,"" he said, adding that ""they don’t turn over and the margins suck.""\n\nThat statement was reportedly made in response to a question at a secret retreat for Apple’s top 100 executives and employees. The exchange is detailed in Kane’s new book, Haunted Empire: Apple after Steve Jobs. The author says ""veterans in the room"" weren’t convinced Apple had really given up on plans to offer a TV, and that Jobs just wanted them to focus on their current projects. However, as Business Insider points out, we’re still waiting for a big-screen Apple TV three years later.\n\nJobs apparently didn’t want to give up on the living room entirely. The existing Apple TV, the company’s diminutive set-top box, was meant to remain a ""hobby"" until the company lined up additional content deals. Presumably, a full-blown television would have been more viable with a deeper content library behind it. Of course, traditional broadcasters don’t seem to be particularly keen on cooperating with new players in the living room. Rumors long suggested that content negotiations were holding up Apple’s big-screen TV. Difficulty securing content deals has also been blamed for Intel’s decision to sell its OnCue TV service to Verizon.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Apple has completely given up on plans to produce a big-screen television. In fact, a rumor from last summer claimed the company was considering compensating broadcast networks for commercial skipping associated with such a product. But we don’t know if that concession would be enough to get the major networks onboard, and such a deal still wouldn’t address Jobs’ concerns over margins and turnover.\n\nThere was a time when an Apple-branded television seemed like a foregone conclusion.

His revelation came during a secret meeting with the company\'s top executives and sales people, and seem contradictory to the ongoing rumors that Apple has been designing just that.\n\nWhen asked during the meeting whether or not Apple was working on a television, Mr. Jobs said, ""No."" He added, ""TV is a terrible business. They don\'t turn over and the margins suck.""\n\nHis comments from the secret staff meeting were detailed in Yukaro Iwatani Kane\'s book, ""Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs,"" according to Business Insider. She was also a Wall Street Journal technology reporter before jumping into her book, and covered Apple for the publication.\n\nThe meeting was something that Mr. Jobs occasionally scheduled so his top 100 people could talk opening about current and future projects, as well as company business. The meetings were kept secret, and attendees weren\'t allowed to email, text, tweet, or interact with the outside world.\n\nMr. Jobs\'s response to the television question seems plausible because consumers tend to upgrade their TVs only about once every seven or eight years, inventory takes up a lot of retail store space, and retailers make little money on sales. What makes more sense is the continued evolution of the Apple TV. The US$99 set top box falls in the impulse buy zone, takes up little space in stores, and hits a price point where consumers can be convinced to buy newer versions far more often.\n\nMr. Jobs\'s comments throw cold water on the hopes and predictions of Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. He\'s been predicting the Apple television would be coming and even went so far as to say it would ship in late 2013. The year ended without any sign of an Apple television while the Apple TV continues to get software updates.\n\nHe predicted the Apple television would be available in sizes ranging from 42-inches up to 55-inches, and would cost between $1,500 and $2,000.\n\nWhile Mr. Jobs sounded pretty clear on his stance that Apple wouldn\'t make a television, that doesn\'t completely kill the idea. He could\'ve been been sharing only part of his plan, meaning his ""no"" response should\'ve also come with the clause, ""for right now.""\n\nSince Mr. Jobs\'s death, there isn\'t any chance of him influencing Apple\'s current leadership team, including CEO Tim Cook. If Mr. Cook thinks a move into the television market makes sense for the company, then it\'ll happen.\n\nFor now, wearable technology seems to be Apple\'s focus. The company has been hiring health and fitness experts, Mr. Cook has said Apple is very interested in out wrists, and he also said the company will enter into new markets in 2014.\n\nApple hasn\'t made any announcements yet, but when it does, it\'ll more likely be some form of wearable technology, and not a fancy new television.', 'When asked during the meeting whether or not Apple was working on a television, Mr. Jobs said, ""No.""\nHe\'s been predicting the Apple television would be coming and even went so far as to say it would ship in late 2013.\nThe year ended without any sign of an Apple television while the Apple TV continues to get software updates.\nHe predicted the Apple television would be available in sizes ranging from 42-inches up to 55-inches, and would cost between $1,500 and $2,000.\nWhile Mr. Jobs sounded pretty clear on his stance that Apple wouldn\'t make a television, that doesn\'t completely kill the idea.']"

However, a new book on Apple, Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs, may tell a different story. Or it may not.\n\nIn the new book, written by former Wall Street Journal reporter, Iwatani Kane, Steve Jobs at his last top 100 meeting, (Apple holds meetings for its top 100 employees every year to discuss new products, a very secretive meeting), said that Apple would not be building a television, simply because the economics didn\'t work. ""TV is a terrible business,"" Jobs is quoted as saying. ""They don\'t turn over and the margins suck.""\n\nPretty damning comments, right?\n\nNot so fast, my friends.\n\nJobs was notorious for saying one thing in public, and doing another. Just look at his stance on several of Apple\'s biggest products: video iPod, iPad mini, iPhone, etc. In the past, he had damned all of these products in one way or another, the most recent being the iPad mini.\n\nOn Apple\'s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call in 2010, Jobs took a swipe at 7-inch tablets, saying the size of the devices, most of them running Google\'s (GOOG - Get Report) Android operating system, was not conducive to a great app experience. Here are his comments in full:\n\n""I\'d like to comment on the avalanche of tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months. First, it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants, not exactly an avalanche. Second, almost all of them use seven-inch screens as compared to iPad\'s near 10-inch screen. Let\'s start there. One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70% of the benefits of a 10-inch screen. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. The screen measurements are diagonal, so that a seven-inch screen is only 45% as large as iPad\'s 10-inch screen. You heard me right; just 45% as large\n\nIf you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens on the seven-inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display. This size isn\'t sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion.""\n\nNow, the iPad mini is one of Apple\'s best selling products, helping Apple to sell 26 million iPads in its most recent quarter. ""Customers are loving the new iPad Air and iPad Mini, with Retina Display, introduced in October, and response to the more affordable iPad Mini has been very strong,"" Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer said on Apple\'s fiscal first-quarter earnings call.\n\nJobs was notorious for this kind of stuff, so it\'s difficult to read too much into this, especially considering he told his authorized biographer, Walter Isaacson, something completely different. The following is a passage of text from Jobs\' biography, entitled, Steve Jobs:\n\n""\'I\'d like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,\' he told me. \'It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.\' No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes for DVD players and cable channels. \'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine.

As it turns out, it may be because the device simply does not exist.\n\nIn his new book titled “Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs,” Business Insider notes that former Apple reporter Yukari Iwatani Kane shareed an anecdote that, if accurate, suggests that Apple never had any plans to launch a TV.\n\nThe book says that one year at Apple’s annual meeting of the top 100 executives in the company, late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs invited colleagues to ask any questions they might have. “You’ve got Steve Jobs sitting right here. You’re my guys, you can ask me anything you want,” Jobs reportedly said. “I don’t care how dumb it is or how insulting it is. I want to make you all feel comfortable about whatever questions you have about the company.”\n\nWith rumors of an iTV already swirling, one exec supposedly asked if Apple planned to launch a television. According to Yukari, Jobs didn’t hesitate with his reply.\n\n“No,” the former CEO said. “TV is a terrible business. They don’t turn over and the margins suck.”\n\nNow the only question left is whether or not this news will stop Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster from speculating about it.', 'Rumors of Apple’s “iTV” — an own-brand high-definition television Apple is supposedly developing to further its assault on the living room — have been swirling for years now.\nRumors pop up all the time that Apple is making headway in its quest to launch a new HDTV line.\nIn his new book titled “Haunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs,” Business Insider notes that former Apple reporter Yukari Iwatani Kane shareed an anecdote that, if accurate, suggests that Apple never had any plans to launch a TV.\n“You’ve got Steve Jobs sitting right here.\nAccording to Yukari, Jobs didn’t hesitate with his reply.']"

And certainly, among climate scientists, that\'s not true,"" said Leshner.\n\nWhile many other bodies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have produced consensus reports on climate change scenarios and impacts, Harvard\'s McCarthy said he hopes the report\'s clarity and brevity (it is 15 pages long, not including references) will help it break through.\n\nEdward Maibach, an expert in climate change communication and director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, who also advised the AAAS project on communication science, said the report has a chance of changing minds.\n\n""Reports from leading scientific societies can get considerable media attention, and if they do, they can have an impact on what the public and policy makers think, and do,"" Maibach wrote in an email.\n\nEvidence vs. apathy\n\nIn contrast to the IPCC reports, which are hard for the public and policymakers to digest, this report is concise, potentially giving it an advantage, Maibach noted.\n\n""The most effective educational efforts feature simple clear messages, that are repeated often, by a variety of trusted voices,"" Maibach said.\n\n""The messages in this report are simple and clear. It remains to be seen if they will be repeated often, by AAAS and other trusted science voices in American society.""\n\nAdditional outreach efforts will follow the report, said McCarthy, including efforts to communicate with the business and political communities.\n\nRather than arguing over the science of climate change, public discussion should be about actions needed to address it, he said.\n\n""We can debate the policies; we can debate the measures,"" McCarthy said. ""And that\'s the debate we should be having.""', 'The report, called ""What We Know,"" marks the kickoff of a new AAAS initiative to increase dialogue on the risks of climate change.\nAdvertisement""The people that do question climate science are either for the most part not scientists or scientists who are not informed in this area,"" he added.\nThird, the sooner society takes action on climate change, the lower the risk and the cost.\nAlan Leshner, the CEO of AAAS, said he hopes the report will get across the ""core message"" on climate change.\nRather than arguing over the science of climate change, public discussion should be about actions needed to address it, he said.']"
17849,http://motherboard.vice.com/read/scientists-to-americans-were-not-divided-on-climate-change,technology,"[""The largest general scientific organisation in the US—and the world—usually stays out of policy debate, but there’s one issue they’ve decided they just can’t stay quiet on any more. Yup, it’s that overwhelmingly evident yet somehow still controversial scientific observation: human-caused climate change is a thing.\n\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) today launched a campaign with the aim of effectively shaking Americans awake to the reality that climate change exists, and that the country needs to act swiftly to avoid potential disaster in the not-so-distant future. Ahead of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) next week, they’ve published a report, released a bunch of videos from climate experts, and kicked off outreach efforts under the title “What We Know,” to shout the message as loud as they can.\n\nThe main problem they highlight is not so much the scientific evidence for climate change—that’s been discussed enough and it still hasn’t convinced a lot of the population—but to set the record straight on one enduring misconception: that scientists are divided on climate change.\n\nThe report points to a 2013 Yale paper that found around a third of Americans thought that “there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about global warming.” Twenty percent said they didn’t know enough to say, and only 42 percent knew that “most scientists think global warming is happening.” The truth, the AAAS repeatedly states in its campaign, is that 97 percent of climate experts agree that climate change is happening.\n\n“Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening,” they state unequivocally. “This agreement is documented not just by a single study, but by a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from surveys of scientists, content analyses of peer-reviewed studies, and public statements issued by virtually every membership organisation of experts in this field.”\n\nYet according to one recent survey, an unparalleled 23 percent of the general public still doesn’t get it.\n\nCorrecting the erroneous belief that the fundamental idea of human-caused climate change is under question is the key tenet of the campaign, which encourages people to spread the message by social media. They don’t go into why people might be so misinformed, but just want to set the record straight. The point is to move beyond a debate that barely exists in the first place, and focus on dealing with the reality. Above all, that means putting policies in place to reduce emissions.\n\nThat’s of course why the AAAS is targeting the public. It’s not enough for just experts in the field to know the reality of climate change, because any large-scale action would inevitably involve a lot of funding and a lot of politics. Until addressing climate change becomes a popular premise with voters, there’s a limit to what policymakers will be willing to do.\n\nWhile the AAAS generally stays out of political squabbles, they state that one of their goals is to promote “the responsible use of science in public policy.” Science can be a powerful substance, after all.\n\n“As scientists, it is not our role to tell people what they should do or must believe about the rising threat of climate change,” they said in their report. “But we consider it to be our responsibility as professionals to ensure, to the best of our ability, that people understand what we know: human-caused climate change is happening, we face risks of abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes, and responding now will lower the risk and cost of taking action.”\n\nIt’s heartening to see a US body come out and state no-holds-barred that they recognise this global phenomenon, but whether it’ll make any difference seems doubtful; it’s not like there’s been a real lack of information out there for those actually interested in the prevailing scientific opinion. But at least it's one less excuse for deniers to hide behind."", 'Yup, it’s that overwhelmingly evident yet somehow still controversial scientific observation: human-caused climate change is a thing.\n“Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening,” they state unequivocally.\nCorrecting the erroneous belief that the fundamental idea of human-caused climate change is under question is the key tenet of the campaign, which encourages people to spread the message by social media.\nUntil addressing climate change becomes a popular premise with voters, there’s a limit to what policymakers will be willing to do.\n“As scientists, it is not our role to tell people what they should do or must believe about the rising threat of climate change,” they said in their report.']"

As many as 33 percent said “there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether or not global warming is happening.”\n\nConsensus among the scientific community, however, could not be more different: Of about 4,000 papers published between 1991 and 2011, 97 percent took the position that global warming was caused by humans, according to a report by the Guardian.\n\n“Even among members of the broader public who already know about the evidence for climate change and what is causing it, some do not know the degree to which many climate scientists are concerned about the risks of possibly rapid and abrupt climate change,” McCarthy said. “That’s something we are dedicated to discussing with multiple audiences, from business leaders and financial experts to decision makers in all walks of life.”\n\nThe challenge AAAS faces is significant. A recent Gallup poll found that Americans ranked climate change second-to-last in a list of 15 national problems, one spot ahead of race relations. While 59 percent said they worried a “great deal” about the economy, just 24 percent said they felt the same about climate change.\n\nAAAS hopes its new initiative might change that view. On Tuesday, it unveiled a report titled simply, “What We Know,” which summarized current climate findings and gave a rundown of potential consequences. A key goal, the organization says, is to begin preparing for climate change now – and to do so in concrete, economic and risk-management terms.\n\n[ALSO: How Many Jobs Are at Stake in Keystone XL Project?]', 'As recently as last year, only 42 percent of Americans believed “most scientists think global warming is happening,” according to a report.\n“Even among members of the broader public who already know about the evidence for climate change and what is causing it, some do not know the degree to which many climate scientists are concerned about the risks of possibly rapid and abrupt climate change,” McCarthy said.\nA recent Gallup poll found that Americans ranked climate change second-to-last in a list of 15 national problems, one spot ahead of race relations.\nWhile 59 percent said they worried a “great deal” about the economy, just 24 percent said they felt the same about climate change.\nA key goal, the organization says, is to begin preparing for climate change now – and to do so in concrete, economic and risk-management terms.']"

The site receives more video in an average month than most users could watch in a lifetime by some estimates, and a host of different kinds of video can be found there, from the most informative to the most entertaining to the most bizarre. Most every taste can be satisfied on YouTube, but there's one taste that YouTube may be planning to cultivate a little more: the tastes of children 10 and under. New reports suggest that that may not be the case much longer, as YouTube is starting to reach out to child-friendly content providers for a whole new YouTube for the under-10 market.\n\nWhile there's already quite a bit of content on YouTube for the under-10 market—seriously, search “PBS Kids” and check out the “about 236,000” listings therein—the idea behind this version of YouTube is that it wouldn't be intermingled with everything else that's on YouTube, including a lot of things parents would rather children not see like large portions of the comments section, as well as many of the videos involved. The kid-focused YouTube, meanwhile, would be regarded as a trusted source of content for the under-10 market, and could be accessed via a special app or device that would focus on kid-safe video.\n\nNaturally, the main YouTube includes some protection on this front, like a “safety” mode that's geared toward filtering some content, some basic rules on what content can be brought into play, and a subsection called YouTube EDU, a school-focused version that offers strictly educational content. But even in these cases, there are still the issue of ads that come into play, and neither one really offers the same advantages that a specifically-tailored operation would bring to the table, like issues of trust and easy connectivity with devices. There are even reports that suggest the child-friendly YouTube is already on the hunt for content providers, gauging interest in terms of offering up videos for the under-10 market.\n\nNaturally, this is still in the early stages, so it may never actually come to pass. But with a little appropriate engineering, this could be a very big move for YouTube. Most people who put up YouTube videos are either out to share the video with other people or out to make money. Naturally, there are exceptions, but making money or just having fun are the two biggest reasons to hit YouTube. That's tough to do given how much content is going into YouTube on a regular basis, but still very possible. A specifically kid-themed YouTube might make this prospect easier or more difficult; developing child-friendly content can be tougher, but there may be fewer players in this industry. Plus, those looking for child-friendly properties to develop might start the search on a kid-friendly YouTube rather than on YouTube proper. Though the issue of advertising might come up again; parents may not appreciate children used as a captive audience, but content producers won't appreciate working for tips, either.\n\nThere are plenty of issues that will need resolving with the launch of a child-friendly YouTube before it ever sees the light of day. It could certainly work, but not until the necessary tooling has been undertaken and all sides can receive a package that best reflects the motivations going into it.\n\nEdited by Cassandra Tucker"", 'New reports suggest that that may not be the case much longer, as YouTube is starting to reach out to child-friendly content providers for a whole new YouTube for the under-10 market.\nThere are even reports that suggest the child-friendly YouTube is already on the hunt for content providers, gauging interest in terms of offering up videos for the under-10 market.\nMost people who put up YouTube videos are either out to share the video with other people or out to make money.\nPlus, those looking for child-friendly properties to develop might start the search on a kid-friendly YouTube rather than on YouTube proper.\nThere are plenty of issues that will need resolving with the launch of a child-friendly YouTube before it ever sees the light of day.']"

No money changed hands, a person close to the matter said. The person was not authorized to discuss the settlement’s terms.\n\nViacom had originally filed a $1 billion lawsuit against YouTube and others in 2007, and eventually accused the Google unit of illegally broadcasting 79,000 copyrighted videos on its website between 2005 and 2008.\n\nBased in New York, Viacom is controlled by media mogul Sumner Redstone, and owns cable networks such as Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon as well as the Paramount movie studio.\n\nGoogle is based in Mountain View, California. It paid about $1.65 billion for YouTube in 2006.\n\nAPPEAL AVERTED\n\nTuesday’s settlement was announced 11 months after U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan rejected Viacom’s damages claims over YouTube’s alleged posting of clips from “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” “South Park,” “SpongeBob SquarePants” and other programs that viewers had uploaded.\n\nStanton concluded that YouTube didn’t have to constantly scour its website for infringing videos, so long as it removed such videos after receiving demands from copyright owners.\n\nViacom had been appealing that decision to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, and oral argument had been scheduled for March 24.\n\n“Content providers and service providers are finding it more constructive to work together rather than litigate,” said June Besek, a Columbia Law School lecturer and intellectual property specialist. “Content providers need a Google to filter material, and Google needs content to attract people to its websites.”\n\nIn April 2012, Google announced a licensing agreement with Paramount to bring nearly 500 movie titles such as “The Godfather” trilogy and “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” to YouTube and Google Play in the United States and Canada.\n\nGARTH BROOKS, STING, FACEBOOK, YAHOO\n\nThe case tested the reach of the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 law that made it illegal to produce technology to circumvent anti-piracy measures, but limited liability of online service providers for copyright infringement by users.\n\nIn his April 2013 ruling, Stanton had concluded that Google and YouTube were protected from Viacom’s copyright claims by “safe harbor” provisions in the law.\n\nThe judge rejected what he called Viacom’s “ingenious” yet “extravagant” argument that YouTube should monitor the content of videos being uploaded at a rate of more than 24 hours of viewing time per minute.\n\nHe also said YouTube did not interact so closely with people uploading content that it could be said to have engaged in infringing activity.\n\nStanton had in 2010 also ruled for YouTube. The 2nd Circuit revived Viacom’s case in April 2012, saying a reasonable jury could find that YouTube was aware of specific infringements.\n\nSupporters of Viacom during the battle have included the Associated Press, Gannett Co, the Motion Picture Association of America, the National Football League, the Screen Actors Guild, Garth Brooks, the Eagles and Sting.\n\nGoogle and YouTube won backing from eBay Inc, Facebook Inc, Tumblr Inc, Yahoo Inc, Consumers Union, Human Rights Watch and others.\n\nThe case is Viacom International Inc et al v.

In June 2010, a federal district court judge granted summary judgement to YouTube. In April 2012, the US Court of Appeals in Manhattan overturned the ruling and remanded the case to the district court. In April 2013, Google again persuaded the district court judge to discard the lawsuit.\n\nThe case dates back to 2007, when Viacom filed suit against Google, YouTube’s parent company, alleging that YouTube was violating US copyright law.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Viacom alleged that YouTube was operating outside the parameters of the “safe-harbor provisions” of the DMCA. These important provisions were intended to provide a buffer for companies that host user materials. The statute protects such companies against secondary liability claims brought by copyright holders as long as the Web host follows “notice and takedown procedures” in good faith.\n\nViacom had claimed that YouTube was aware that thousands of videos on its site directly infringed on Viacom’s copyrighted content, including from such Viacom-owned networks as Comedy Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon. Viacom claimed that YouTube had willfully turned a blind eye to infringing videos posted to the site and had sought more than $1 billion in damages.\n\nYouTube countered that it had promptly complied with the more than 100,000 takedown notices Viacom had sent to it, which targeted videos Viacom claimed to own, and argued that it followed the DMCA safe harbor procedures.\n\nMany in both the technology and media communities viewed the case as an important test of the legal limits of the safe harbor protections against secondary liability for sites hosting user-uploaded materials.

As “Internet freedom” people, we’ll go on record here and say that this is totally lame.\n\nAccording to Sophos’ Naked Security blog, Google granted the UK government the ability to pull content from YouTube last week, though that content has to be terrorism-related to qualify. But the UK doesn’t want to stop there, and is seeking powers to remove anything they deem “unsavoury,” regardless of its legality.\n\nThe UK’s security and immigration minister, James Brokenshire, said that the government wants to filter content “that may not be illegal but certainly is unsavoury and may not be the sort of material that people would want to see or receive.”\n\nSince “censorship” rightly sounds scary and awful, Brokenshire said that the UK’s attempts to target “unsavoury” content is merely a byproduct of their fight against terrorism. In layman’s, it’s the UK’s version of the NSA’s “we need to tap your phones because domestic security.”\n\nStill, the UK has yet to receive these ambiguous ban-powers, and currently, Google still makes the final determination on what is removed from YouTube. What the UK government has is “trusted flagger” status, meaning that if a flag comes from the UK government, the content is expedited for Google’s review.\n\nYouTube’s ToS draws the line at anything that “incites violence,” and the UK is worried that its citizens might become radicalized by exposure to content related to the ongoing Syrian conflict.\n\nThus, they want an upgrade from “trusted flagger” to “super flagger,” which would allow them to request content takedowns en masse instead of one by one.\n\nIn related news, the UK government has been pressuring ISPs to filter content related to child abuse and pornographic material since the passage of the 2012 Online Safety Bill. Part of that bill states that ISPs should provide porn-free Internet by default.\n\nThough it’s still only hypothetical, Wired notes that the UK could actually be in breach of Article 10(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights (which regard freedom of expression) if they managed to secure the ban-powers they want.', 'Social LawThe UK government is proactively seeking the ability to censor “unsavoury” content on YouTube, and by all accounts, authorities working with Google are getting pretty close to securing these arbitrary ban-powers.\nAccording to Sophos’ Naked Security blog, Google granted the UK government the ability to pull content from YouTube last week, though that content has to be terrorism-related to qualify.\nWhat the UK government has is “trusted flagger” status, meaning that if a flag comes from the UK government, the content is expedited for Google’s review.\nThus, they want an upgrade from “trusted flagger” to “super flagger,” which would allow them to request content takedowns en masse instead of one by one.\nIn related news, the UK government has been pressuring ISPs to filter content related to child abuse and pornographic material since the passage of the 2012 Online Safety Bill.']"

Seven years later, the lawsuit has been settled and YouTube parent Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can stop worrying about the potential impact of a negative ruling.\n\nIn a joint press release, Google and Viacom smoked a public peace pipe: ""This settlement reflects the growing collaborative dialogue between our two companies on important opportunities, and we look forward to working more closely together.""\n\nTerms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Re/Code and its anonymous sources claim that no money changed hands.\n\nThe case has been a legal landmark in many ways. Viacom originally asked for a cool $1 billion in damages, based on the billions of views YouTube had amassed from Viacom-owned content. It\'s been a flashpoint for matters of copyright policy, privacy, and freedom of speech issues. Putting this bad boy to rest without passing it in front of the Supreme Court may be doing the legal system a disservice -- but, hey, at least Google is off the hook.\n\nA long time coming\n\nWhen Viacom launched its legal assault, YouTube was just two years old and Google had bought it for $1.7 billion only four months earlier. This battle was a formative part of YouTube\'s early days, forcing the company to create far-reaching copyright protection schemes.\n\nGoogle has never disclosed financial results from YouTube, lumping the popular video service in with other online revenue sources like ad clicks and Android app sales. With the Viacom matter buried and soon to be forgotten, Google might have more freedom to share YouTube\'s financial results. Reporting these numbers under the cloud of pending big-ticket litigation could have torpedoed some of YouTube\'s legal arguments, which may have helped to keep YouTube\'s financial figures in the dark.\n\nOf course, the tech industry in general and Google in particular are bending over backward to keep their proprietary data under wraps. I\'m not exactly holding my breath until Google starts reporting YouTube results separately, but I\'m still hoping for increased clarity.\n\nThe site was seen as a money sink for years, with the added weight of Viacom\'s litigation on top. YouTube was bought with nearly no revenue on the table, and $1.7 billion was about half of Google\'s cash reserves at the time. Then CEO Eric Schmidt was unsure, but chief legal officer David Drummond promised that the company would be happy buying YouTube.\n\nBut now, Google\'s management calls YouTube a ""strategic growth opportunity"" on par with Android and Chrome. They also call it ""part of our core advertising business,"" with third-party traffic insights to match. Media measurement giant Nielsen now measures YouTube traffic, much the same way it measures TV audiences. That\'s a requirement for getting major advertisers to trust YouTube\'s traffic data and to shovel advertising budgets onto the platform. This thing is getting serious.\n\nSo, at long last, YouTube is clearly earning its keep. Waving off Viacom\'s legal threats only underscores how successful that much-maligned $1.7 billion acquisition has been for Google. David Drummond\'s advice looks better than ever.', ""With the Viacom matter buried and soon to be forgotten, Google might have more freedom to share YouTube's financial results.\nI'm not exactly holding my breath until Google starts reporting YouTube results separately, but I'm still hoping for increased clarity.\nYouTube was bought with nearly no revenue on the table, and $1.7 billion was about half of Google's cash reserves at the time.\nMedia measurement giant Nielsen now measures YouTube traffic, much the same way it measures TV audiences.\nThat's a requirement for getting major advertisers to trust YouTube's traffic data and to shovel advertising budgets onto the platform.""]"

This settlement reflects the growing collaborative dialogue between our two companies on important opportunities, and we look forward to working more closely together.”\n\nAt one point Viacom, the cable powerhouse that owns networks such as MTV and Comedy Central, had been seeking $1 billion in damages from Google. But no money traded hands in the settlement, according to people familiar with the transaction.\n\nGoogle had won a significant victory against Viacom in 2010, when U.S. District Court Judge Louis Stanton ruled largely in the company’s favor. Viacom appealed that decision, but a federal appeals court kicked the case back down to Stanton again, who repeated his ruling in 2013. Viacom appealed that ruling, and the two companies were scheduled to appear in court again next Monday.\n\nSeven years ago, the copyright lawsuit looked like it would have major implications for the way the Web worked. But by now the suit had become an asterisk, because in many ways the core issues have been settled by both the courts and the market.\n\nIn very broad strokes, the practical consensus is that digital services like YouTube — and Twitter, and Facebook, and everyone else that distributes lots of content uploaded by its users — are not responsible for copyright violations if they don’t explicitly encourage them, and if they let copyright holders take down stuff they don’t want up there.\n\nLike many other media companies, Viacom had originally objected to the fact that lots of its content appeared on YouTube without its permission. But Google, which acquired YouTube in 2006, has more or less made peace with most big content companies, in part via a “ContentID” system that allows copyright owners to track their stuff on the world’s largest video site. The system also gives content owners the ability to demand “takedowns” of their stuff — or the option to run ads against it.\n\nViacom itself has been working with YouTube’s ContentID system for some time. Two years ago, Viacom’s Paramount film studio struck a deal to rent movies via YouTube.\n\nAnd, if you’re keeping track of these things, note that Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman’s son, Philippe Dauman Jr., has worked for Google since 2007 — the same year Viacom sued Google. Dauman Jr.’s LinkedIn profile says he’s now working on the “Google Wallet” program.\n\nUpdate: Twitter is pretty great.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/pdauman/status/445922093260345344', 'Viacom, which has been suing Google over alleged copyright violations at its YouTube unit since 2007, has settled out of court, the two companies announced today.\nGoogle and Viacom didn’t provide details, but did offer this statement: “Google and Viacom today jointly announced the resolution of the Viacom vs. YouTube copyright litigation.\nGoogle had won a significant victory against Viacom in 2010, when U.S. District Court Judge Louis Stanton ruled largely in the company’s favor.\nLike many other media companies, Viacom had originally objected to the fact that lots of its content appeared on YouTube without its permission.\nAnd, if you’re keeping track of these things, note that Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman’s son, Philippe Dauman Jr., has worked for Google since 2007 — the same year Viacom sued Google.']"

""This settlement reflects the growing collaborative dialogue between our two companies on important opportunities, and we look forward to working more closely together.""\n\nThe case dates back to 2007, when Viacom sued YouTube for $1 billion. Viacom argued that YouTube facilitated the posting of copyrighted material. YouTube said it was not responsible if YouTube complied with Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices, which it said it did. In 2010, a judge agreed and said YouTube has been compliant. Viacom swiftly appealed and the Circuit Court in 2012 ruled in the company\'s favor. That re-opened the case for another two years, until today\'s deal.\n\nAt the heart of the matter was whether YouTube was responsible for the copyrighted material its users posted on the site. In general, sites that host user-generated content are protected by the DMCA if they take swift action to remove offending content when it\'s reported. YouTube argued that it does remove this content, but Viacom\'s initial lawsuit said YouTube was hosting at least 160,000 unauthorized Viacom clips.\n\nThere was a lot of back and forth, of course. In 2010, Google said that Viacom had ""secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there"" for years.

So far, Viacom had been losing pretty badly at nearly every step of the process -- and YouTube is considered so completely legit at this point that the more Viacom fought, not only did it look worse and worse, but at least some of the legal geniuses there must have realized that the court was going to wipe the floor so clean with them that rulings they really didn\'t like were going to be written and used as precedents for other innovative services.The terms of the settlement are not public, but in this case, it likely doesn\'t much matter. I\'d be surprised if much (or any) money changed hands (: Yup, it appears no money changed hands ). Both companies spent many, many, many millions of dollars in the lawsuit to date, and it clearly made sense to stop it from going any further (especially from Viacom\'s standpoint, because it was pretty clear that it was going to lose really badly). While this means there won\'t be a useful Supreme Court ruling that reinforces the DMCA\'s safe harbors, the initial victories by Google in the lower courts should have enough precedential value to be useful in many other cases.In the end, Viacom wasted more than seven years fighting YouTube in this particular case, and not a single court seemed to think particularly highly of its theories. Its closest ""victory"" in the process still involved the appeals court more or less rejecting every one of Viacom\'s theories. If I\'m a Viacom shareholder (and, thankfully, I\'m not), at this point I\'m asking why the company spent so many years and so much money trying to sue one of the most popular and useful distribution platforms out there.In the end, the case is perhaps one of the most perfect examples of how old media reacts badly to new innovations and immediately reaches for the only real tool in its toolbox against disruptive innovation: flailing about angrily in the court system, hoping to kill the innovation.

It claimed the sharing platform for user-generated videos hosted thousands of unauthorized clips.\n\nGoogle and Viacom putting the conflict to rest reflects how much the attitude toward online video has changed for traditional content companies, from one of protective wariness to one of essential opportunity. It also reflects how YouTube, over the course of many years, has improved its control over its platform, enabling it to work more beneficially with those traditional content creators.\n\nIn a brief joint statement Tuesday, Google and Viacom said they resolved the suit, without disclosing any terms of the settlement.\n\n""This settlement reflects the growing collaborative dialogue between our two companies on important opportunities, and we look forward to working more closely together,"" the companies said in the statement.\n\nThe suit emerged from a period of time when the Internet was as much threat as opportunity to traditional media companies like Viacom, which had seen the virulence of online piracy with music over the preceding decade and noted the damage it could inflict on an industry unaccustomed to rapid change.\n\nThough Google negotiated licensing deals with many entertainment companies like Warner Music Group, CBS, and the BBC, Viacom claimed that after months of negotiations, YouTube was unwilling to reach a fair agreement for Viacom content and failing to put in place promised filtering tools. (Disclosure: CNET is owned by CBS, though not at the time of this lawsuit.)\n\nThe claim kicked off years of back-and-forth legal battles.\n\nViacom withdrew much of its video content off YouTube, choosing instead to focus on video on its own Web sites. Viacom channels like MTV and Comedy Central have since returned to the hosting site, but their absence fostered an environment that helped upstarts like music-video joint venture Vevo to become one of the most-watched corners of YouTube.\n\nSince the time the Viacom and Google\'s conflict arose, traditional media companies have come to use and value YouTube as a marketing platform, and YouTube\'s control over unauthorized content has sharpened, as has its ability to monetize clips with advertisements that more consistently put a slice of that revenue in the hands of the copyright holder.\n\nBut YouTube\'s open platform and gigantic scale -- 6 billion hours of video are watched each month -- continues to spark major conflict and raise other questions about copyright and free speech.\n\nIn a ruling with significant copyright implications, a US appeals court last month said Google must remove anti-Islamic film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which incited sparked protests by outraged Muslims around the world. The court agreed with an actress\' claim of holding some independent copyright on the film because of her appearance in it and said taking it down doesn\'t constitute a prior restraint on speech.', ""YouTubeGoogle and Viacom have settled their seven-year copyright lawsuit, a nearly forgotten fight in which the central conflict has largely become an anachronism.\nViacom, the parent company of such television networks as MTV, Comedy Central, and Nickelodeon, sued Google shortly after the search giant's acquisition of YouTube.\nGoogle and Viacom putting the conflict to rest reflects how much the attitude toward online video has changed for traditional content companies, from one of protective wariness to one of essential opportunity.\nIn a brief joint statement Tuesday, Google and Viacom said they resolved the suit, without disclosing any terms of the settlement.\nViacom withdrew much of its video content off YouTube, choosing instead to focus on video on its own Web sites.""]"

Its latest announcement could see a shift in how law firms embrace video as a key marketing tool, says Matt Rycroft.\n\nGoogle adapts to make the most of emerging trends and technology. antb\n\nGoogle has always liked video, almost always allowing users to filter for video results only alongside news and images. Google also made their relationship with video legitimate by purchasing YouTube in 2006. Until recently only thumbnails of YouTube videos related to your searches have been included in the search results, but now video is being highlighted so much more.\n\nGoogle’s own research shows 61 per cent of users look elsewhere if they don’t see what they’re looking for right away. So now, changes mean the top video in certain search results will play without opening a new web window. This change could give law firms a powerful tool in capturing the attention of potential clients right away, but only if their videos are up to scratch, here’s how:\n\nKeep it tight: Now you’re right in front of a potential client make the most of it. Keep your video as short as possible. 90 seconds is an optimal length but don’t worry about it being too short, you’ll be surprised how much you can say.\n\nAdd a call to arms: You should have this in your videos already, now it’s even more important. Encourage viewers to contact you at the end of the video. If you don’t they may watch the next video in the list, a competitors, because you’ve not steered them towards you.\n\nInclude clickable links: You may have noticed clickable links in videos on YouTube already. These aren’t necessary in a video hosted on your website but if a video is played in Google, make sure it’s easy for viewers to visit your website. Including a link to your homepage so you’re only one click away.\n\nPresently this function is only working with some music videos from YouTube. While it might be extended to other video genres it’s likely to only ever capture content from YouTube in this way so you’ll need to make sure you have a YouTube channel. A full service digital agency will help you do this and also make sure your videos are as good as they can be.

Even as the suit dragged on, the companies since then have reached biz agreements; for example, Viacom participates in the YouTube Content ID program to scan for copyrighted material uploaded to the service. Paramount also in 2012 licensed films to YouTube available for rent.\n\nViacom alleged that the video service had engaged in “massive intentional copyright infringement of Viacom’s entertainment properties.” According to Viacom, nearly 160,000 clips of Viacom programming — including clips from shows like “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart” and “South Park” — were available on YouTube without permission, and that those clips had been viewed more than 1.5 billion times.\n\nGoogle and YouTube fought the suit, and won several victories in federal court. In rulings in 2010 and 2013, U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton of the Southern District of New York said the website was not liable for copyright infringement because it was protected by the “safe harbor” provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That “safe harbor” measure grants immunity to Internet sites if they quickly remove infringing content after they’re notified by a copyright owner.\n\nIn court documents, Viacom argued that YouTube essentially built its business on infringing videos, and the media company produced e-mails in which some of the site’s founders discuss the prevalence of copyrighted videos uploaded by users and their propensity to generate more traffic.\n\nHowever, YouTube contended in court briefings that it could not take down specific clips without a notice because it did not know whether they had been authorized.

Currently about 200 participants have the ability to identify up to 20 videos for review at once, according to a source familiar with the program, confirming a Wall Street Journal report. Of those, fewer than a dozen are government agencies or private organizations; most are individuals who have a reliable track record of ID’ing inappropriate content, the source said.\n\nAsked for comment, a Google rep emphasized that the company itself determines which videos violate its terms of service. The “super flaggers” do not have the ability to remove videos directly. The program is intended to monitor content to make sure it conforms with YouTube’s Community Guidelines, which prohibit pornography, drug abuse and harassment.\n\n“Community flagging is a tool available to anyone on YouTube, allowing us to maintain a safe and vibrant platform with the help of our users,” Google said in a statement. “To make the process more efficient, we invite a small set of users who flag content that violates our Community Guidelines regularly and accurately to access more advanced flagging tools.”\n\nGoogle added, “Any suggestion that a government or any other group can use these flagging tools to remove YouTube content themselves is wrong.”\n\nThe company provides information on what it calls the YouTube Trusted Flagger Program in a document on its website.\n\nYouTube’s antipiracy efforts, meanwhile, are run under a completely separate program called Content ID, which automatically identifies material suspected of infringing copyrights.\n\nAccording to YouTube, the Content ID system scans the equivalent of 400 years of video every day. That is matched against a database with 25 million reference files of copyrighted content supplied by content owners. About 5,000 content partners use the service, including TV broadcasters, movie studios and record labels, the company has said.\n\nStarting late last year, YouTube expanded Content ID to cover videos uploaded by affiliates of multichannel networks such as Maker Studios and Machinima.', 'YouTube’s antipiracy efforts, meanwhile, are run under a completely separate program called Content ID, which automatically identifies material suspected of infringing copyrights.\nAccording to YouTube, the Content ID system scans the equivalent of 400 years of video every day.\nThat is matched against a database with 25 million reference files of copyrighted content supplied by content owners.\nAbout 5,000 content partners use the service, including TV broadcasters, movie studios and record labels, the company has said.\nStarting late last year, YouTube expanded Content ID to cover videos uploaded by affiliates of multichannel networks such as Maker Studios and Machinima.']"

17942,http://www.business2community.com/video-marketing/10-ways-video-can-increase-conversion-rates-0813408,technology,"['Looking for an easy way to increase conversion rates? Then you need to jump on the video marketing bandwagon. Video is hot, hot, hot and some have even described the Google-owned YouTube as the world’s second biggest search engine. Video makes it easy for searchers to get information and answers without working too hard, and it’s also popular with mobile device users.\n\nAccording to CISCO, mobile video represented more than half of all mobile data traffic in 2013. Whichever way you look at it, video is getting attention, while TV viewing is on the decline. That’s why it’s a no-brainer to use video in your marketing to boost conversion rates. Here are 10 ways that video works to improve your success.\n\n6 Ways Using Video Boost Conversions\n\nFirst of all, let’s look at some of the ways using video works for you.\n\n1. Building Trust\n\nUsing trust signals like social proof and safe shopping logos helps people to buy, but there’s nothing that builds trust like the human connection – and that’s what video offers. Instead of looking cautiously at your brand logo, people can see the faces behind the company and are more likely to trust you. And you know what else? People don’t even have to see the video to trust you more. According to a study by Reel SEO, just having the video on your site builds trust, even if web users don’t actually watch it. Go figure!\n\n2. Grabbing Attention\n\nA Forbes article shows that psychologically, people tune into video because:\n\nWe’re wired to pay attention to faces.\n\nWe’re wired to listen to human voices.\n\nBody language in videos conveys emotion that affects viewers.\n\nWe pay attention to movement.\n\nSince video incorporates all those elements, viewers pay more attention – it’s hard wired into our brains!\n\nRecommended For You\n\nRegister Now\n\n3. Keeping Visitors on Site\n\nHow many times have you visited a site looking for information and then gone elsewhere because you couldn’t find what you wanted? It happens all the time, but the attention-getting properties of video means that people stay longer on your site. As an article on Entrepreneur points out, the same people who won’t read a long article may stay to listen to a short video, thus reducing your bounce rate. And if you get them to stay on your page rather than the usual 10 or 20 seconds, you increase your chance of encouraging them to take the next step in your conversion process.\n\n4. Answering Questions\n\nMany people visit your site and wonder if your product or service is right for them. The best way to answer this question is to show real people using your product or service. As far back as 2009, Zappos successfully videoed employees demonstrating their products, resulting in an upturn in sales of between 6 and 30%. If you can condense your product message into 90 seconds or less, then it’s clear and easy to understand for most viewers. And if you don’t want to use people, screencasts also make effective videos.\n\n5. Telling Your Story\n\nProduct videos aside, people want to understand your company before doing business with you. That’s where the explainer video comes in, to get to the heart of your vision and mission and tell your story in a few seconds. Explainer videos are extremely successful in boosting conversions. Studies published on Unbounce show that companies using explainer videos consistently increase their conversion rate by between 10 and 20%.\n\n6. Being Shareable\n\nPeople love to share the things they love – and that includes online video. In 2013, more than 700 YouTube videos were shared on Twitter every minute, says the UK’s Three Motion. Provide a useful product video or a humorous explainer video and you’ll increase the chances that people will share those videos on social media. Include this as part of your content strategy and you will see even more uplift.\n\nFour Ways to Improve Conversions on Your Videos\n\nThe qualities above give a good overview of how videos work for you. Next, let’s look at four ways you can enhance your videos to improve conversions even more.\n\n7. Use a Winning Formula\n\nAs we’ve said before, there’s no room for bad video in 2014. Whether you’re creating a product video, an explainer video, an instructional video or a presentation, you have to have a plan. Crazy Egg suggests that a winning formula is to illustrate a problem, show a solution, explain how it works and include a call to action (more on that in a moment). Keep the video short and focused on a particular audience and topic, and you also have to nail the script, the audio and the visuals.\n\n8. Include a Call to Action\n\nI mentioned this above, but it’s so important it deserves its own heading. If you don’t ask, you don’t get, so ask! If you want the people watching your video to visit a landing page, share the video, contact you for more information, just ask. And here’s another tip: although many people will watch your video right to the end, some won’t. That’s why it’s a good idea to put a call to action early in the video as well, to grab the attention of those who won’t watch the whole thing.\n\n9. Embed Links and Hotspots\n\nClickable hotspots and links can also help boost conversions. An example on the Kissmetrics blog shows how one company used clickable hotspots on videos to take viewers straight to product pages and create a better shopping experience for them.\n\n10. Think about Hosting\n\nWhere you host your video affects conversions too. If you embed the video on your own site and you have a super-fast hosting service or content delivery network, then you get some SEO benefits. On the other hand, you might get more traffic if you host your video on YouTube or another popular video site. Check out the pros and cons of each on Moz and decide. There’s also a useful study from Visual Website Optimizer that shows that it makes a difference whether you embed the video on your page or simply use a link to it. In the end, the study showed that embedding the video in your page led to 28% better conversions.', '6 Ways Using Video Boost ConversionsFirst of all, let’s look at some of the ways using video works for you.\nStudies published on Unbounce show that companies using explainer videos consistently increase their conversion rate by between 10 and 20%.\nProvide a useful product video or a humorous explainer video and you’ll increase the chances that people will share those videos on social media.\nWhether you’re creating a product video, an explainer video, an instructional video or a presentation, you have to have a plan.\nOn the other hand, you might get more traffic if you host your video on YouTube or another popular video site.']"

New GM did carry with it responsibility for the products themselves, such as handling warranty claims and recalls.\n\nGM records show the ignition switch problem first was noticed in 2001 during development of the 2001 Saturn Ion; again in 2003, after it was supposed to have been fixed; then in 2004, by a GM development engineer doing pre-production work on the then-new 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt.\n\n""Clearly, this took too long,"" Barra told a dozen reporters at GM headquarters here.""We will fix our process.""\n\nBut she wouldn\'t promise to establish a victims\' fund or otherwise have GM accept liability for pre-bankruptcy accidents.\n\n""Right now, our focus is on the customers 100%"" to ""make sure we repair every single one of these vehicles,"" she said, though she promised that ""after the (GM internal) investigation, we will do what\'s right.""\n\nSTORY:Barra creates permanent global safety chief\n\nVIDEO: :Barra on recall -- ""terrible things happened""\n\nNEW RECALLS:GM recalls 1.5M vehicles in 3 new actions\n\nGM hired Tony Valukas, chairman of the law firm, Jenner & Block and former U.S. Attorney who probed the Lehman Bros. collapse, to lead that internal investigation.\n\nBarra noted that he ""has 10 years of activity to go through"" to untangle how and why decisions were made that eventually led to the switch recall. ""We won\'t sacrifice accuracy for speed,"" she said, ""and I told him there are no sacred cows.""\n\nShe said, ""No one (has been) disciplined or fired at this time.""\n\nThe lag between first signs of trouble with the switches and the recall has prompted ongoing investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Department of Justice and two Congressional committees, which plan hearings late this month or early next.\n\nBarra said ""it\'s likely"" she\'ll testify at those hearings, along with other GM executives.\n\nBarra and Mark Reuss, who replaced Barra as GM\'s executive vice president of global product development, met with reporters to give GM\'s current analysis of the recall details, to explain how GM is working to prevent future delays recognizing problems and to update the time line for replacing faulty ignition switches.\n\nThe switches can unexpectedly move from ""run"" to ""accessory,"" stalling the engine and cutting power to air bags and other systems. The 1.37 million cars recalled in the U.S. are the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky.\n\nDealers will begin receiving replacement switches on April 7, Barra said. They\'re made by Delphi, which also made the faulty switches, but GM is monitoring the production closely, she said. GM has worked with Delphi to increase capacity and should have enough switches for all recalled models by October, Barra said.\n\nBarra and Reuss both said they\'ll re-emphasize to dealers that they should provide free loaner or rental cars to people nervous about driving their recalled cars before they\'re fixed. GM is paying for the interim cars, so dealers shouldn\'t object, Reuss said.\n\nSome owners have complained to GM, and to USA TODAY, as well, that they\'ve had trouble getting the free temporary vehicles.\n\nBarra also said GM has added dozens of phone workers to make sure owners with questions about the recall or loaner cars can get through promptly.', 'But she wouldn\'t promise to establish a victims\' fund or otherwise have GM accept liability for pre-bankruptcy accidents.\nBarra noted that he ""has 10 years of activity to go through"" to untangle how and why decisions were made that eventually led to the switch recall.\nThey\'re made by Delphi, which also made the faulty switches, but GM is monitoring the production closely, she said.\nGM has worked with Delphi to increase capacity and should have enough switches for all recalled models by October, Barra said.\nBarra also said GM has added dozens of phone workers to make sure owners with questions about the recall or loaner cars can get through promptly.']"

Albertine and Lucy Webster argue the sell-off of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) shares related to the yesterday’s recall is overblown, but yet another recall incident does hurt investor sentiment and negatively impact ongoing turnaround efforts.\n\n\n\nYesterday, 3/17, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) announced three new recalls associated with CEO Mary Barra’s request for a broader internal safety review. General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also announced a $300 mm charge that will occur in 1Q14 associated with the three recalls and the previously announced ignition switch recall.\n\nEvaluating the highest profile recall actions in U.S. history, it seems to us sell-offs related to recall incidents tend to be overdone in the immediate term and generally bleed out of shares in relatively short (1-3 month) order. At this point we also see limited risk of a material financial charge (above the $300 mm GM noted) derailing General Motors Company (NYSE:GM)’s positive financial trajectory. That said, we think valuation upside is limited by a lagging turnaround effort relative to peers, and prolonged focus on recalls only furthers GM’s window to catch up.\n\nGeneral Motors Recall Announcement Details:\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is recalling 303k Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana units from the 2009-2014 model years with a gross vehicle weight of under 10,000 lbs.

In the XTS, a brake booster pump default may cause corrosion, overheating, melting of plastic components, and the possibility of an engine compartment fire. Two engine compartment fires in unsold vehicles at GM dealerships have been reported.\n\nGeneral Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is recalling 1.18 mm Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia models from the 2008-2013 model years, Chevrolet Traverse from the 2009-2013 model years, and Saturn Outlook from the 2008-2010 model years.

She also said that the company has dedicated 50 employees in a customer call center to do nothing but handle phone calls about the recall.\n\nThe recall, which affects about 1.6 million vehicles worldwide, covers vehicles in which the ignition can switch to off while the car is running, disabling the power steering and air bags. GM has been harshly criticized after admitting that its engineers were aware of the problem as early as 2004, but the cars were not recalled until February of this year.\n\nGM has said the problem is tied to at least 12 deaths. But that number could rise as further investigations into the problem take place. The vehicles in the recall — the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac G5 and Solstice and the Saturn Ion and Sky — were built in model years 2003 through 2007.\n\nBarra said the repairs for the recalled cars “should start” the second week of April. That is slightly more detail on the timing of repairs than previously disclosed.\n\nShe also said a GM supplier is adding a second production line to increase the availability of parts needed to make the repairs. And she said dealers are being urged to provide customers with loaner vehicles.\n\nBarra became CEO of GM in January, when she became the first woman to lead a major automaker. A more than three-decade veteran of GM, she had served as head of product development at GM since 2011, after the recalled vehicles were built.\n\nIn addition to details about the ignition switch, Barra mentioned new recalls Monday totaling about 1.5 million vehicles.\n\nThe recalls involve problems with the air bags in some crossover SUVs, the brakes of a Cadillac sedan and the instrument panel of a full-size van, and are unrelated to the ignition switch recall. But she said it’s an example of GM demonstrating to customers that it now moving quickly to solve vehicle problems when discovered.\n\n“The bottom line is we will be better because of this tragic situation if we seize the opportunity. And I believe we will do just that,” she said.\n\nGM said it expects the ignition recall and Monday’s new recalls together will cost the company a total of $300 million, or less than $100 per vehicle if all of the recalled vehicles are brought in for repairs.\n\nGM’s latest recall could actually end up being a positive for the company, according to Kaitlin Wowak, a professor at Notre Dame who has studied recalls.\n\n“The airbag recall gives GM an opportunity to show consumers they are willing to take action before consumers are harmed,” she said.', '× General Motors CEO on recall: ‘Terrible things happened’NEW YORK — General Motors CEO Mary Barra gave her most critical statement yet on the automakers’ handling of a flawed ignition switch, calling it a tragic situation in which “terrible things happened.”Barra, in a video taped for GM employees and released to the public Monday, said various congressional probes and even an criminal investigation into the recall shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone.\n“After all, something went wrong with our process in this instance and terrible things happened,” she said.\nA more than three-decade veteran of GM, she had served as head of product development at GM since 2011, after the recalled vehicles were built.\nIn addition to details about the ignition switch, Barra mentioned new recalls Monday totaling about 1.5 million vehicles.\n“The airbag recall gives GM an opportunity to show consumers they are willing to take action before consumers are harmed,” she said.']"

They are in addition to another 1.6 million cars recalled last week.\n\nThe company’s handling of the original ignition-switch recall is now the subject of a lawsuit and a US federal investigation.

If he needs any additional resources, he will get them.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoyer will provide regular and frequent updates on vehicle safety to Barra, senior management and the GM board of directors.\n\n“Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers in the vehicles they drive,” said Boyer. “Today’s GM is committed to this, and I’m ready to take on this assignment.”\n\nThe appointment comes as GM faces numerous probes into years of delays in fixing the ignition issue.\n\nGM issued recalls only last month — more than a decade after first learning of the ignition issue, the automaker has acknowledged. The faulty switch could shut off the car while driving, disabling safety systems such as air bags and antilock brakes. GM says the issue is connected to 12 deaths, but an analysis by an independent safety group said it could account for as many as 303 fatalities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAppointing a safety chief is consistent Mary Barra’s aggressive efforts to resolve the recall crisis, said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst at IHS Automotive.\n\n“Boyer seems to be a good choice for this position considering his past experience in quality and safety,” Brinley said. “Ensuring that he has access to the top leadership of the corporation gives his position credibility.”\n\nBarra, who became GM’s chief executive in January, has ordered a top-to-bottom safety review.\n\nGM released a video of Barra’s comments to GM employees Monday, in which she outlined the challenges facing the automaker and assessed the gravity of the company’s mistakes.\n\n“These are serious developments that shouldn’t surprise anyone,” Barra told employees. “After all, something went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened.”\n\n“As a member of the GM family and as a mom with a family of my own this really hits home for me,” Barra said.\n\nBoth the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and GM have come under heavy fire from lawmakers and safety advocates for not acting sooner. The Department of Justice and committees in the U.S. House and Senate have opened investigations in the matter. GM will probably face at least a $35-million civil fine.\n\nThe tab could be much higher, said Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays, nothing there is “the potential for $2 billion to $3 billion for plaintiff settlements and/or federal fines.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The weeks ahead will see congressional hearings, as well as fresh attacks from creative tort lawyers in multiple jurisdictions,” Johnson said. “The continued negative headlines are likely to weigh heavily on the stock.”\n\nHe said the moves by Barra demonstrate that “GM is trying to dig deep to the root of the problem” to develop “a more engineering-driven focus on products than had characterized GM in the past.”\n\nBut in the short term, that won’t help the owners of many of the recalled vehicles. Drivers of cars with the ignition problem won’t be able to get their cars fixed for months. Production of the replacement part won’t start until next month, and it will take until October to produce all the new switches needed to fix the recalled cars, GM officials said.\n\nThe ignition switch problem affects 1.6 million cars globally. The models include 2003-07 Saturn Ions, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices, 2006-07 Saturn Sky models, and 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 models.

AFP PHOTO/Stan HONDA (credit: Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\n— The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced a recall of more than 300,000 General Motors vans due to the risk of airbag injuries.\n\nThe recall covers vans from the 2009-2014 model years and includes GMC Savana and Chevrolet Express models.\n\nChevrolet owners can call 1-800-630-2438. GMC owners can call 1-866-996-9463. You can also reach the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hotline at 888-327-4236. For more information on the recall, click here or visit safercar.gov.\n\nMeanwhile, GM has named a 40-year engineer as its new safety chief, placing a single person in charge of recalls and other safety issues as it deals with a huge compact car recall that has damaged the company’s reputation.\n\nThe move, announced Tuesday by CEO Mary Barra, comes after revelations that GM knew about a deadly ignition switch problem in 1.6 million compact cars at least 11 years ago, but failed to recall them until last month. The problem has been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the Chevrolet Cobalt and five other models.\n\nBarra on Tuesday named engineer Jeff Boyer to the new global post. She says it gives GM a single safety leader with access to senior managers and the board. Boyer is responsible for development of safety systems, vehicle testing, and safety of cars after they are sold, including recalls.\n\n“If there are any obstacles in his way, Jeff has the authority to clear them,” Barra said in a statement. “If he needs any additional resources, he will get them.”\n\nTwo congressional committees and the Justice Department are investigating GM’s behavior in the ignition switch case. The company has admitted knowing as early as 2003 that the switches can unexpectedly shut down car engines and cause drivers to lose control. Despite multiple company investigations, the cars were not recalled until last month. In one of the investigations that didn’t lead to a recall, GM failed to consider four fatal accidents in one of the models.\n\n“Something went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened,” Barra said Monday in a video posted on GM’s media website.\n\nOn Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007). All of the recalled cars have the same ignition switches.\n\nThe company said the ignition switches can wear from heavy, dangling keys. If the key chains are bumped or people drive on rough surfaces, the switches can suddenly change from the “run” position to “accessory” or “off.” That cuts off power-assisted steering and brakes and could cause drivers to lose control. Also, the air bags may not inflate in a crash and protect the driver and passengers.\n\nThe company is urging people not to put anything on their key rings until the switches are replaced.\n\nThe recall crisis quickly ended Barra’s honeymoon as CEO. She took over the top job on Jan. 15, becoming the first woman to lead a major global automaker.\n\nSince 2011, Boyer had been executive director of engineering operations and systems development. Before that, he headed global interior engineering and safety performance. In that post, he was responsible for certifying GM vehicle safety and crashworthiness, the company said.\n\nBoyer started with GM in 1974 as a college student at Kettering University in Flint. He has an electrical engineering degree from Kettering and a master of business administration degree from Michigan State University.\n\nOn Monday, GM issued new recalls of 1.5 million vehicles, part of an effort to assure buyers that it’s moving faster to fix safety defects in its cars and trucks.\n\nYou may also be interested in these stories:\n\n[display-posts category=”news” wrapper=”ul” posts_per_page=”4″]\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

The new recalls aren\'t related to that issue, but the company did say they\'re part of a broad product safety review prompted by the ignition switch problem, which is linked to 12 deaths.\n\nGM expects to spend approximately $300 million US in the first quarter to repair the vehicles in the new recalls as well as the vehicles in the small car recall. GM announced last month that ignition switches in older models of the Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5s, Saturn Ion, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky need to be repaired.\n\nThe recalls announced Monday include:\n\n•1.18 million SUVs, including 49,719 in Canada, because their side air bags, front centre air bags and seat belt pretensioners might not deploy if drivers ignore an air bag warning light on their dashboard. The recall includes the Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia from the 2008-2013 model years; the Chevrolet Traverse from the 2009-2013 model years; and the Saturn Outlook from the 2008-2010 model years. GM says no injuries are related to the defect.\n\n•303,000 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans, including 25,710 in Canada, from the 2009-2014 model years because the material on the instrument panel might not adequately protect unbelted passengers\' heads in a crash.

To celebrate, NASA released a series of new images of a stellar nursery, captured by the space observatory.\n\nThese magnificent new photographs were taken of infant stars in the Monkey Head Nebula. This cloud of gas and dust lies 6,400 light years from our home world. As new stars first ignite their nuclear fuel, they radiate ultraviolet light, which pushes at the gas and dust around the infant stellar body. This light can ionize the gas in nebula, providing the atoms with an electric charge.\n\nHubble recorded these images in February 2014, viewing the object in infrared light. Although invisible to human eyes, these frequencies of light are used to keep food hot in restaurants. When UV light from young stars heats the charged gas (mostly hydrogen), it begins to warm, radiating infrared light.\n\nHubble has delighted people worldwide with a wide variety of observations but that mission got off to a rough start. Astronomers, both professional and amateur, were delighted when the space observatory successfully launched into space on 24 April, 1990. That optimism was short-lived, as operators soon discovered the main mirror was ground incorrectly, and only produced blurry images. The spacecraft became the object of ridicule and jokes on television and in movies. In The Naked Gun 2 ½, a model of the Hubble was displayed alongside the Edsel, Titanic, and the Hindenburg.\n\nFor three years, NASA officials used the telescope to do some valuable science, although the orbiting observatory was not operating nearly according to design. Luckily for all of us, the Hubble Space Telescope was designed to be serviced by humans in space. On 2 December 1993, the space shuttle Endeavor lifted off from Cape Canaveral, on a mission to save the telescope. This mission successfully installed a corrective optics package on the telescope, bringing the Universe into proper focus.\n\nSince that time, Hubble has shown the world thousands of images, from our local neighborhood of planets to the depths of the Cosmos. Moreover, Hubble has narrowed the possible age of the Universe to between 13 and 14 billion years. The mission also led to the discovery of dark energy, which causes the expansion of the Universe to accelerate over time.\n\nNASA officials are saying these new images of the Monkey Head Nebula are a small taste of the photographs that will be possible with the new James Webb Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2018.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The Monkey Head Nebula, a colorful region filled with young stars and bright plumes of cosmic gas and dust, lies about 6,400 light years away from Earth. The Hubble last visited the region in 2011.\n\nAccording to NASA, the image demonstrates the power of the Hubble\'s infrared vision, revealing a ""shadowy, dense knot of gas and dust sharply contrasted against a backdrop of brilliant glowing gas.""\n\nThe massive newborn stars (toward the right in the images) are blasting away dust within the nebula, and ultraviolet light emitted by the new stars is shaping the dust into giant pillars.\n\n""This carving action occurs because the nebula is mostly composed of hydrogen gas, which becomes ionized by the ultraviolet radiation,"" NASA said in a statement.

This colourful region is filled with young stars embedded within bright wisps of cosmic gas and dust.\n\nNGC 2174 lies about 6400 light-years away in the constellation of Orion (The Hunter). Hubble previously viewed this part of the sky back in 2001, creating a stunning image released in 2011, and the space telescope has now revisited the region to celebrate its 24th year of operation.\n\nNebulae are a favourite target for Hubble. Their colourful plumes of gas and fiery bright stars create ethereally beautiful pictures. Some of the most famous of Hubble's images have been of nebulae -- for example, the telescope's 22nd and 23rd anniversary images of the Tarantula (heic1206 - http://spacetelescope.org/news/heic1206/) and Horsehead (heic1307 - http://spacetelescope.org/news/heic1307/) nebulae, and its festive 2012 image of planetary nebula NGC 5189 (heic1220 - http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1220/).\n\nThe detail shown in this image lies within NGC 2174, a nebula which gets its more common name, the Monkey Head Nebula, from its curiously familiar shape when viewed in wide-field images.\n\nThe nebula is a violent stellar nursery, packed with the ingredients needed for star formation. However, the recipe for cooking up new stars isn't very efficient and most of the ingredients are wasted as the cloud of gas and dust disperses. This process is accelerated by the presence of fiercely hot young stars which trigger high velocity winds that help to blow the gas outwards.\n\nTo celebrate its 24th year in orbit, the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope has released this beautiful new image of part of NGC 2174, also known as the Monkey Head Nebula.\n\n(Photo Credit: NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA))\n\nA vibrant palette of colours can be seen in this new image of NGC 2174. Dark brown and rust-coloured dust clouds billow outwards, framed against a background of bright blue gas. These striking hues are formed by combining several Hubble images taken with different coloured filters, to reveal a broad range of colours not normally visible to the human eye.\n\nThe icing on this cosmic birthday cake takes the form of young white and pink stars sprinkled amongst the glowing clouds, pushing away the dark stellar nurseries in which they formed. The key ingredient in NGC 2174 is hydrogen gas, which is ionised by the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the young stars. As a result, this region is also known as an HII region [1] -- a large cloud of ionised gas.\n\nThis image marks 24 years of Hubble. This milestone will be further celebrated by a conference being held in Rome, Italy, in March of this year. The conference, entitled Science with the Hubble Space Telescope IV - (http://www.stsci.edu/institute/conference/hst4), will highlight and celebrate the scientific breakthroughs that Hubble has made over the last two decades and look into the future at the topics and key questions that will shape the field of astrophysics in the next decade.\n\nThis portion of the Monkey Head Nebula was imaged in the infrared using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3.

On October 11th, you will set foot in “the beginning of an epic new saga.” Gears of War 4 brings new characters and new threats but keeps the familiar gameplay that has kept Gears fans coming back since 2006.\n\nGears of War 4 developer, The Coalition, says we “can expect a familiar, yet distinct evolution of gameplay.” Details on this “evolution” have been slim, but we do know in your face action that made Gears of War so much fun is here to stay.\n\nI can’t talk about Gears of War without mentioning multiplayer, and there is good news on that front. Starting April 18th, those of you who have played Gears of War: Ultimate Edition can jump right into the Gears of War 4 beta. Everyone else can grab a Gnasher and curb stomp your friends on April 25th. The beta will wrap up on May 1st.\n\nPAX East is also later this month, and The Coalition will be there. Interested in understanding what went into developing Gears of War 4’s multiplayer? The Coalition will hold a panel diving deeper into the ins and outs of multiplayer.\n\nOut of the Shadows: Inside Gears of War Multiplayer with The Coalition starts Sunday, April 24th at 10:30 am in the Albatross Theater. If you’d rather learn more about multiplayer in your pajamas, The Coalition will also livestream the panel on the Gears of War Twitch channel.\n\nI know I’ll be tuning in. I want to see how The Coalition balances keeping multiplayer familiar while also evolving and taking chances. Is the focus still going to be shotgun-based, fast paced action? Or, is The Coalition going to try and change it up a bit? I can’t wait to see what they do.\n\nXbox One holiday lineup takes shape\n\nWith Gears of War 4’s official release date announced, we’re starting to see what Xbox One’s holiday lineup is going to look like. Gears of War 4 has October locked up. Which begs the question, what’s coming in November? The most obvious choice is Halo Wars 2.\n\nCrackdown 3 is a possibility. The multiplayer portion of the game is set for a summer release. No word on when the story portion is coming.\n\nThe next Forza Motorsport is another option. It hasn’t been announced yet, but Microsoft plans to reveal it at E3.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I like Forza for the November release window. The franchise is a known quantity and will sell regardless of what it goes up against it. Halo Wars could nab the September window and stand mostly uncontested.

Starting September 2014, 26 new markets will get retail availability of the Xbox One console, including India. For now, pricing details and exact launch dates have not been disclosed.Making the announcement via a post on the official Xbox blog on Tuesday, Microsoft\'s Yusuf Mehdi said, ""It\'s time to ensure even more fans around the world can enjoy Xbox One . So today we\'re proud to share that it will be available in 26 additional markets in September this year. We\'ll have much more to share at a local level towards the end of April, so stay tuned.""Notably Microsoft\'s primary competitor in the home console space, Sony, launched its PlayStation 4 console in India in January (at Rs. 39,990) , less than two months after its US launch. To puts things in perspective, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were launched in November within a week of each other in the US.Shortly after its US launch however, the Sony PlayStation 4 was rolled out to roughly 53 countries in the first phase. In comparison, Microsoft\'s Xbox One was in its first phase only rolled out to 13 countries Full list of 26 new countries in September phase of Xbox One global roll-out: Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia , Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and UAE.While India launch pricing of the Xbox One has not been revealed, it\'s safe to say it will be slightly more expensive in India than the PlayStation 4 as Sony\'s console cost $100 less at its US launch Both the Microsoft Xbox One and Sony PlayStation 4 sport an integrated CPU-GPU design by AMD, featuring an 8-core low power x86-64 AMD ""Jaguar"" CPU. The Xbox One\'s CPU cores are clocked at 1.75GHz, compared to the Sony PlayStation 4\'s 1.6GHz.While this difference in clock speed is relatively insignificant, the implementation of the GPUs seem certain to create some differences in performance. The Xbox One features a GPU similar to the entry-level Bonaire GPU found on the Radeon HD 7790, while the PlayStation 4 features a GPU similar to the mid-range Pitcairn GPU found on the Radeon HD 7870. While the GPU clock speed is higher on the Xbox One, the difference in GPU processing performance should be tangible.Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 feature 8GB of RAM, though while Sony has opted for the much faster 5500MHz GDDR5 RAM on its console, Microsoft has gone in for 2133MHz DDR3 RAM on the Xbox One, giving the Japanese manufacturer another advantage that may not be offset by the Xbox One\'s implementation of ESRAM (all 32MB of it) for caching purposes.Just like the PS4, the Xbox One also sports a 500GB hard disk drive, a Blu-ray disc and DVD drive, USB 3.0, AUX port, Ethernet, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 2.1 (EDR), an HDMI out port, and an optical-out port.', 'Microsoft has finally announced the next-phase of roll-out for its latest-generation home console, the Xbox One.\nStarting September 2014, 26 new markets will get retail availability of the Xbox One console, including India.\n""Notably Microsoft\'s primary competitor in the home console space, Sony, launched its PlayStation 4 console in India in January (at Rs.\nTo puts things in perspective, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were launched in November within a week of each other in the US.Shortly after its US launch however, the Sony PlayStation 4 was rolled out to roughly 53 countries in the first phase.\nThe Xbox One\'s CPU cores are clocked at 1.75GHz, compared to the Sony PlayStation 4\'s 1.6GHz.While this difference in clock speed is relatively insignificant, the implementation of the GPUs seem certain to create some differences in performance.']"

18087,http://hereisthecity.com/en-gb/2014/03/18/xbox-one-sales-boosted-by-titanfall-but-playstation-4-up-too/,technology,"['Xbox One sales in the UK were boosted by 96% last week with the release of sci-fi shooter Titanfall.\n\nThe game, which is exclusive to Microsoft platforms, including Windows PC, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, launched on 14 March, immediately claiming the number one slot on the all-formats software chart.\n\nAccording to figures released by entertainment sales monitor Chart-Track, 70% of all Xbox One units sold in the UK last week were special editions, bundled with Titanfall. The game has been heavily marketed by Microsoft and publisher Electronic Arts, and is widely considered a benchmark title for the Xbox One machine, especially as it is unavailable on close rival PlayStation 4. Microsoft also accompanied the release with a UK price drop for the console, from £429 to £399.\n\nHowever, according to retail sources speaking to Chris Dring, editor of industry news site, MCV, PS4 sales also rose last week – by 72.4%. “PS4 is in a stronger position,” he said. “It had by far the strongest Christmas out of the two and a really strong start to the year, so has opened a big gap over Xbox One.\n\n“Sony’s big issue is making enough consoles. PS4 has been subject to stock shortages in some areas, particularly during February. In fact last week, PS4 sales rose by over 70% last week because there was an increase in consoles shipped into the market.”\n\nThe comparative strength of the PS4 is also showing up in figures gathered by US research company NPD Group. January saw Sony’s machine outselling the Xbox One by as much as two-to-one, but its advantage is now slowing. “PS4 led hardware sales in February 2014, but by a narrow margin with Xbox One selling over 90% of what the PS4 sold in terms of unit sales,” wrote NPD Group analyst in a news release. “However, with Xbox One’s higher price point it led hardware sales on a dollar basis.”\n\nThe battle between the two consoles remains difficult to gauge, however, as their approach to global distribution differs. PlayStation 4 is currently available in over 50 territories, including the US, most of Europe and Japan, while Xbox One is only available in around 13.\n\nLast week, the New York Times postulated that the paucity of PlayStation 4 stocks in the US, may actually have driven consumers to purchase Xbox One machines instead, accounting for the sharp rise in sales in February. The piece quoted Guy Longworth, senior vice president of PlayStation marketing, who referred to “severe inventory constraints” – perhaps a result of the console’s wider global roll-out.\n\nIt is also likely that Xbox One was boosted in February by players purchasing the machine in preparation for Titanfall, which has received almost universal critical acclaim. If that’s the case, it will be interesting to see what happens when Sony’s PS4 exclusive, Infamous: Second Son releases on 21 March. This is another much-hyped, heavily advertised release with a built-in fan base. And it is likely that whatever constraints Sony was experiencing with distributing its machine last month will be cured in time. “This week will be an interesting test,” said Dring. “I am sure [Infamous: Second Son] will be accompanied with an increase in PS4 supply.”\n\n• Xbox One gets price cut to £399 – with free copy of Titanfall\n\n• Titanfall review – futuristic, fantastic, but not revolutionary\n\nThis article was written by Keith Stuart, for theguardian.com on Tuesday 18th March 2014 12.03 Europe/London\n\nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2010', 'Xbox One sales in the UK were boosted by 96% last week with the release of sci-fi shooter Titanfall.\nAccording to figures released by entertainment sales monitor Chart-Track, 70% of all Xbox One units sold in the UK last week were special editions, bundled with Titanfall.\nHowever, according to retail sources speaking to Chris Dring, editor of industry news site, MCV, PS4 sales also rose last week – by 72.4%.\nJanuary saw Sony’s machine outselling the Xbox One by as much as two-to-one, but its advantage is now slowing.\nIt is also likely that Xbox One was boosted in February by players purchasing the machine in preparation for Titanfall, which has received almost universal critical acclaim.']"

We pester Microsoft pretty much daily for the information – and it’s finally here. Sort of. What we have is a release month – which as the headline would clue you in to, will be in September.\n\nThat’s a little bit earlier than we’ve been expecting, with October the last date we heard mulling about in the rumour mill.\n\nThe information comes courtesy of Microsoft’s Yusuf Mehdi and the Xbox wire.\n\nOn the heels of the most successful Xbox launch in history, we continue to be blown away by the support and engagement of our fans. You’re spending an average of over five hours per day on Xbox One.

So today we’re proud to share that it will be available in 26 additional markets in September this year.\n\nYes, we’re one of those additional markets.

That information will be coming next month, apparently.\n\nSo again, we wait. The longer we wait for the console, the more the tide moves in Sony, and the PlayStation 4’s favour here in South Africa. For South African Xbox die-hards, at least they know how long – roughly - they’ll still be waiting.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve received a press release from Microsoft south Africa’s hardware distributor, Comztek.\n\n“The Xbox One replaces not only the old console, but the old media centre as well, providing a single point of entertainment and communications for the family,” states Heinz Stephan, business practice director at Comztek Consumer Solutions. “With its launch, we could clearly see that the Xbox One is staking its claim on not just a portion of the living room, but all of it.” “In my mind the Xbox One is not just designed as a gaming console, but rather as the single most advanced hybrid gaming and entertainment console. Microsoft has achieved this by creating a dual and parallel running, state-of-the-art Gaming and Windows Operating Systems. What’s more is that the wait for South Africans is almost over,” said Stephan.\n\nSo, Xbox fans. Does this news make you feel any better about the system’s chances in the country? are you stashing away your beans, knowing when you’ll have to have saved up enough?\n\nLast Updated:', 'We’ve been waiting patiently for some sort of information on the release date of Microsoft’s newest console here in South Africa.\nOn the heels of the most successful Xbox launch in history, we continue to be blown away by the support and engagement of our fans.\nIn fact, last week we saw the highest number of hours logged on Xbox Live since the launch of Xbox One.\nThe longer we wait for the console, the more the tide moves in Sony, and the PlayStation 4’s favour here in South Africa.\nFor South African Xbox die-hards, at least they know how long – roughly - they’ll still be waiting.']"

In fact according to reports from GfK Chart-Track, it has been found that thanks to the release of Titanfall, Microsoft has seen its sales of Xbox One units in the UK increase by as much as 96%!\n\nAccording to the report, this is thanks to the Titanfall Xbox One bundle which accounted for 70% of Xbox One sales since its launch on Friday in the UK. This helped to bump Xbox One sales up to 96% in general, which is still pretty impressive. We’re not sure how long Microsoft will be able to maintain its growth, but it’s safe to say that Titanfall is doing a good job at attracting gamers onto Microsoft’s Xbox platform.\n\nHowever not everything is rosy, as you might have heard, Titanfall was launched with several glitches due to server errors which led to downtime, and given that the game is pretty much all about the multiplayer experience, gamers naturally wouldn’t have been able to enjoy it very much if they weren’t able to access Titanfall’s servers.\n\nThen again almost all games encounter some hiccups at its launch, so we guess the important thing is that the developers of the game get this issue sorted out ASAP so that gamers can go ahead and start enjoying themselves. So far based on reviews, many seem to be in favor of the game so if you were thinking about getting your hands on the game, why not pick up an Xbox One while you’re at it?\n\nFiled in .

18140,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/17/microsoft-and-sony-are-both-winning-the-console-wa.aspx,technology,"['Diehard fans of Microsoft\'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One and of Sony\'s (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4 each likely found something to hate about the latest sales results for the month of February. Unfortunately for those fans, the report released last week by research firm NPD describes an industry that\'s improving all around, with no knockout punch of one console over the other. In fact, both Microsoft and Sony have a legitimate claim at ""winning"" the console battle last month.\n\nSpiking hardware sales\n\nThe Xbox One nabbed the overall revenue crown. According to NPD, Microsoft grossed slightly more in sales than Sony could manage. Microsoft confirmed that it sold 258,000 units of its new device in February, which was 61% ahead of where the prior generation Xbox was tracking at this point in its lifecycle. So it isn\'t just marketing spin when the tech giant describes this generation\'s launch as the ""most successful"" one in Xbox history.\n\nStill, that slight victory over Sony was made possible by the $100 price disparity between the two systems. Sony, whose device is cheaper, actually sold more units of its PS4 last month. That result helped push its installed base lead slightly higher, giving it an important win to celebrate as well.\n\nThe Japanese tech giant didn\'t provide official sales numbers for February, but it did trumpet the new NPD data to its Twitter followers.\n\nNPD Group: PS4 is #1 again for the month, and cumulative sales, in the United States. Thanks for your support! -- PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 13, 2014\n\nThe overall industry was the real winner, though. NPD\'s estimate of the video game market, which doesn\'t include digital software revenue, grew by a solid 9% last month to $890 million as hardware sales spiked 42% above the prior year period and ""triple digits"" above January\'s result.\n\nExclusive games on tap\n\nAll of this success came in a month that didn\'t see much in terms of splashy next-gen game releases. Activision Blizzard\'s (NASDAQ: ATVI) Call of Duty: Ghosts title, which has been out since last year, continued to dominate the sales chart: Ghosts took the top spot for the fourth month in a row. Newcomers on the top 10 list included The Lego Movie Video Game and Nintendo\'s (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) Bravely Default for the 3DS.\n\nBut March should be an entirely different story as major new releases shake up the hardware sales results. Microsoft\'s next-gen shooter Titanfall, one of this year\'s most anticipated video games, launched last week and is sure to help move more Xbox consoles. Meanwhile, Sony can look forward to its own exclusive game boosting PS4 sales: Infamous: Second Son hits stores on March 21.\n\nEverybody wins\n\nThose launches make it very likely that we\'ll be hearing about more record growth in the industry when NPD releases its video game sales data for March next month. And the trend will probably be just as promising for Microsoft as it is for Sony. While the Xbox One vs. PS4 battle sounds dramatic, this isn\'t a zero-sum game. Both consoles are selling extremely well at the early stages of this generation, and there is no reason why they can\'t both succeed.', 'In fact, both Microsoft and Sony have a legitimate claim at ""winning"" the console battle last month.\nAccording to NPD, Microsoft grossed slightly more in sales than Sony could manage.\nNewcomers on the top 10 list included The Lego Movie Video Game and Nintendo\'s (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) Bravely Default for the 3DS.\nMeanwhile, Sony can look forward to its own exclusive game boosting PS4 sales: Infamous: Second Son hits stores on March 21.\nAnd the trend will probably be just as promising for Microsoft as it is for Sony.']"

Though both consoles launched last November within a week of one another, Sony’s sales continue to climb as Microsoft struggles to catch up.\n\nAccording to DealNews, a recent survey revealed that 35 percent of gamers who owned an Xbox 360 and PS3 chose to purchase Sony’s next-gen PlayStation 4, while only 23 percent opted for Microsoft’s Xbox One. This poll of 1,727 readers showed that while brand loyalty was certainly a factor for gamers who owned only one console from the previous generation, owners who possessed both consoles were more likely to choose the PS4. Of the 1,727 participants polled, 44 percent owned both a PS3 and Xbox 360.\n\n“Frequently with advanced software-driven technology, consumers will feel inclined to remain within the environment that they're familiar and comfortable with,” DealNews said on Feb. 24. The site’s statistics show that only 42 percent of Xbox 360 owners chose to buy the Xbox One, while 51 percent of PS3 owners purchased the PS4.\n\nStill, many Xbox 360 players hadn’t purchased any new console yet, citing the $499 price tag as the main reason.\n\n“While diehard gamers will likely buy whichever console appeals to them at retail price, our survey suggests that Microsoft could draw more of its own budget-conscious fans into the next generation if it dropped the retail price on its latest console,” DealNews stated.” But given the fact that a high number of gamers are familiar with both platforms, Sony may continue to win over those swing gamers with better specs and a lower retail price.”\n\nThe launch of Respawn’s first-person shooter “Titanfall” on March 11 is reportedly helping Microsoft sell more Xbox One consoles, according to an inside source.

For a long time, the best PC controller has probably been Microsoft’s Xbox 360 gamepad. On the console front, that controller has now been supplanted by the Xbox One controller. So, where are the Windows drivers for that gamepad?\n\nWe’ve been promised those drivers for some time. As SlashGear reports, Albert Penello, Microsoft’s product planning chief for Xbox and Kinect, recently shared some fresh details about that project in a recent NeoGAF forum post. Replying to a question about whether the Xbone controller would require a new dongle, Penello wrote:\n\nNo. The controller (in wired mode) will work as-is.\n\nHow wireless will/could work is TBD. There are some options we are looking at. No more updates on the timeframe beyond what’s been publicly stated – the plan is this year. When the update comes out and we have more details, I can explain the holdup.\n\nAs SlashGear points out, a couple of unofficial solutions already exist for folks wishing to use the Xbone controller on their PCs: a fan-made software hack, and ControllerMax, a physical hardware adapter.\n\nThe Xbox One controller is supposed to have more than 40 improvements over the original Xbox 360 controller, including new analog sticks, a redesigned d-pad, and so-called Impulse Triggers, which deliver vibration feedback.', 'For a long time, the best PC controller has probably been Microsoft’s Xbox 360 gamepad.\nOn the console front, that controller has now been supplanted by the Xbox One controller.\nReplying to a question about whether the Xbone controller would require a new dongle, Penello wrote:No.\nAs SlashGear points out, a couple of unofficial solutions already exist for folks wishing to use the Xbone controller on their PCs: a fan-made software hack, and ControllerMax, a physical hardware adapter.\nThe Xbox One controller is supposed to have more than 40 improvements over the original Xbox 360 controller, including new analog sticks, a redesigned d-pad, and so-called Impulse Triggers, which deliver vibration feedback.']"

18153,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jayson-demers/maximum-engrossment-6-way_b_4944726.html,technology,"['With the recent release of Titanfall in North America and the upcoming releases in the rest of the world, Microsoft is hoping sales of the Xbox One will catch up to the sales of the PS4. There\'s certainly been a fair share of buzz surrounding the game. Here\'s how you can maximize your engrossment in the game and play in style.\n\n1. The Right Equipment\n\nSo you\'ve got the game and you\'ve got the system. You\'re all set up and ready to go. Now what?\n\nWell, how about the limited edition Titanfall controller from Microsoft? The controller is designed after the weaponry in the game and you\'ll feel like you\'re holding a piece of the world in your hand. Talk about engrossment!\n\n2. The Headset\n\nOf course, if there were something that could make you feel more engrossed than holding an artifact that looks specifically like it comes from the world in which you\'re virtually roaming, it\'d be a killer headset. A headset can add more to the gaming experience than perhaps any other accessories; this is especially true for the multiplayer experience. Since this entire game is multiplayer, a good headset is even more important. IGN has an article that reviews headsets from the low-end to the high end.\n\n3. The Sound\n\nThere\'s a whole lot of work that goes into the sound design of any game, and with Titanfall, sound design is particularly impressive. A 5.1 or 6.1 surround-sound setup will make the game sound amazing, and this can actually give you a strategic advantage; surround sound allows you to detect players approaching from behind you.\n\nIf you opt to get a headset, though, you might not need to invest in a new surround sound system. Many headsets come with surround sound built-in.\n\n4. The Graphics\n\nThe Xbox One version of the game - to the chagrin of many players - plays at 792p resolution, though there are plans to go to either 1080p or 900p. The gameplay experience shouldn\'t be negatively affected since, as Drew McCoy - the producer of the game - claims, ""Frame-rate is king"" and resolution doesn\'t matter as much. In contrast, the PC version plays at 1080p, though some report noticing little difference.\n\nEither way, both resolutions are technically HD, so to fully take advantage of what the game has to offer, you\'ll definitely want to have an HDMI-capable display.\n\n5. The Room\n\nThe environment in which you play any game can make all the difference. Some even go so far as to create a separate gaming room, also affectionately referred to by some as man caves or even woman caves.\n\nThe ""Multi-player arena"" room, in particular, is a perfect idea for a multiplayer game like Titanfall. And what gaming room would be complete without a comfortable, high-tech chair specifically designed for gamers? There\'s a good review of a few of these chairs on IGN that showcases chairs with features ranging from vibration support to Bluetooth connectivity.\n\n6. The Lighting\n\nThe room is only half the story when you\'re trying to create the right environment. Proper ambient lighting ties it together. Some people prefer to play video games in the dark. While ambient darkness can increase the contrast and visibility of a TV screen, it\'s no fun to be sitting in an awesome, custom game room in the dark. At the same time, though, it\'s best to avoid extremely bright lights because of the effects light has on the aforementioned contrast ratio and black level.\n\nSo, for the ultimate Titanfall immersion experience, you don\'t want bright lighting and you don\'t want pitch darkness. Good thing there are many happy in-betweens. One lighting setup that works particularly well is LED light strips around the room.\n\nIf you really want to feel like you\'re playing in style, why not make the LED strips yourself? There are all sorts of videos on how to do this on YouTube. If you get good enough at it, you can even do cool things like wrapping the lights around the edges of your chair or your TV screen.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nIt\'s not available yet, and it\'s going to require a patch to support the Xbox One, but the Kickstarter-funded Delta Six might make this game even more amazing. It claims to be the most realistic gaming gun ever. Either way, it sure does look cool, and it absolutely drips with style.\n\nConclusion\n\nFans have been anxiously awaiting Titanfall since it was announced at E3 in 2013. For Microsoft, it\'s considered a system seller. For gamers, it\'s an exciting beginning to what promises to be blockbuster multiplayer console gaming experience. Dedicated gamers know that focus and frags come from more than just hand-eye coordination; it\'s about immersing yourself in the whole experience.', 'A headset can add more to the gaming experience than perhaps any other accessories; this is especially true for the multiplayer experience.\nThe SoundThere\'s a whole lot of work that goes into the sound design of any game, and with Titanfall, sound design is particularly impressive.\nThe ""Multi-player arena"" room, in particular, is a perfect idea for a multiplayer game like Titanfall.\nAnd what gaming room would be complete without a comfortable, high-tech chair specifically designed for gamers?\nFor gamers, it\'s an exciting beginning to what promises to be blockbuster multiplayer console gaming experience.']"

Where Microsoft’s new Xbox is concerned, the game selection is liekly better in the early days and the console’s capabilities are definitely wider thanks to Kinect and Microsoft’s many home entertainment features. Of course, Sony’s PS4 has the stronger specs and greater appeal for hardcore gamers. Are the benefits afforded by its extra onboard oomph really that significant? According to one big developer, the answer is “yes.”\n\ninFAMOUS: Second Son is, without question, on of the biggest games of this console generation so far. The title’s launch has been eagerly anticipated and gamers will finally get their hands on the hot open world action-adventure game this Friday.\n\nLeading up to the title’s release, Sucker Punch Co-Founder Chris Zimmerman chatted with Sony during a PlayStation Blogcast. Among the topics covered is Zimmerman’s opinion that developing an exclusive title for the PlayStation 4 was fantastic because of the console’s superior power.\n\n“That’s a place where we had to apply a lot of technology, to make it feel like there were no loading screens, because believe me, there’s a lot of stuff going on to make it feel like that, right?” Zimmerman said during the interview.\n\nHe continued, “It’s one of the advantages of being a Sony exclusive developer, is that when we’re building the game, we can make decisions like that, because we have exactly one platform we’re aiming for, and we can leverage the heck out of it. We know exactly how fast the hard drive is and these things, and we can design our games to run right up to the limit. It’s the same with the graphics chip. We have the meters on screen showing how much of the chip we have that we’re using, and it’s in the nineties all the times.”\n\nFinally, the developer noted that had the game been made available for both the PS4 and the Xbox One, it would not have afforded the same great experience.\n\n“If you’re someone that has to support multiple platforms, especially if one is slightly less powerful than the other one, then you’re kinda in trouble right?” Zimmerman said. “Because you’re kinda having to work hard so that it can look as good as it can on all of them, and we don’t have to worry about that, we can just focus on making it look great on PS4 and just focus on having the game be as good as possible. We don’t have to wrestle with all that stuff, and that’s freeing.”\n\ninFAMOUS: Second Son launches this coming Friday, March 21st.', 'Of course, Sony’s PS4 has the stronger specs and greater appeal for hardcore gamers.\nAccording to one big developer, the answer is “yes.”inFAMOUS: Second Son is, without question, on of the biggest games of this console generation so far.\nLeading up to the title’s release, Sucker Punch Co-Founder Chris Zimmerman chatted with Sony during a PlayStation Blogcast.\n“If you’re someone that has to support multiple platforms, especially if one is slightly less powerful than the other one, then you’re kinda in trouble right?” Zimmerman said.\nWe don’t have to wrestle with all that stuff, and that’s freeing.”inFAMOUS: Second Son launches this coming Friday, March 21st.']"

The PlayStation 4 has been in the sales lead for some time now, with the Xbox One finally catching up, but it's no question that Sony has turned and captured the interest of many gamers prior to the start of the current console generation.\n\nDealNews (by way of BGR) reports that out of a survey of 1,727 readers, 35% of gamers who owned both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 last generation now own a PlayStation 4. 23% of those gamers bought an Xbox One console instead. 27% of voters bought neither and the remaining 14% bought both (because they can and you should be jealous).\n\nThis news doesn't surprise me in the slightest as my personal preference for console makers has done a complete 180 this generation. I began last generation with an Xbox 360 (if you count before that, I also favored my Xbox) and ended with all three major consoles. At the onset of the current console generation, I saw myself favoring Sony considerably more than Microsoft. I attribute this to value, games, and business practices. Sony's E3 2013 conference didn't hurt either; I needed a cigarette after that one.\n\nTitanfall Launch Makes Xbox One Sales Almost Double in the UK\n\nThe reasons for these “swing gamers” are no doubt diverse. The PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One have been in a resolution war since before they've both been available. Microsoft's Xbox One policies prior to launch upset many people and their odd requirement for Xbox Live Gold, which still has a heavy emphasis on dashboard ads, didn't win people over either.\n\nWith the PlayStation 4 sporting technically stronger hardware, an adoption of indie developers, and a subscription service that offers a lot of value, it's hard not to see why the console is still in the lead. But, like many things, this could change in time; this console generation has only just begun."", ""A survey recently conducted by DealNews attributes Sony's success with the PlayStation 4 to “swing gamers”.\n23% of those gamers bought an Xbox One console instead.\nAt the onset of the current console generation, I saw myself favoring Sony considerably more than Microsoft.\nTitanfall Launch Makes Xbox One Sales Almost Double in the UKThe reasons for these “swing gamers” are no doubt diverse.\nBut, like many things, this could change in time; this console generation has only just begun.""]"

This morning, these rumors have been doused by Microsoft’s director of product management Albert Penello. He suggests that not only will there be no new controller for this purpose, there will be driver support later this year.\n\nThe controller out on the market today will work “as-is” provided it’s connected to the PC you’ve got in your home with a USB cord. This connection is made out the back of the controller in the standard microUSB slot. To be specific, Penello suggests that there will not be a PC-only controller, but that a PC/Xbox One controller may be made – at the same time, the original Xbox One controller will work the same way as this new model (that may or may not be made at all).\n\n“There is no plan to do a new, separate controller that only works on Windows. It will be the same as it is on Xbox 360 – the Xbox One controller you have today will work. That’s not to say that we may not ship also PC SKU of the Xbox One controller, much like we do on Xbox 360.” – Microsoft director of product management Albert Penello\n\nPenello wrote these words at NeoGaf where he also confirmed that they’re still looking in on wireless mode for the PC. “The plan is this year”, he says, and “when the update comes out and we have more details, I can explain the holdup.”\n\nMeanwhile more than one solution has arisen over the past few weeks for allowing an Xbox One wireless controller to work on a PC. One is the slightly long solution created by a fan in software mode. The other is a device known as ControllerMAX – a device we reviewed quite recently.\n\nFor those of you working with the Xbox One controller looking to work with the new Xbox One Chat Adapter, also take note that an issue has arisen.

According to market research group NPD, Microsoft is raking in more profit than Sony due to its higher price. The Xbox One, which launched on Nov. 22, 2013, is priced at $499 -- $100 higher than the PS4.\n\nOn March 13, Microsoft released a statement regarding the success of the Xbox One, calling it the most successful launch in Xbox history. “Xbox One continues selling at a record-breaking pace with 258,000 units sold in the U.S. in the month of February, surpassing Xbox 360 sales by over 61 percent at the same point in time,” the statement read. “And, Xbox 360 continues to grow its install base with 114,000 units sold in February in the U.S. in its 100th month on the market in the U.S., more than any other seventh generation console. The growing fan base for Xbox 360 will have their opportunity to play ‘Titanfall,’ when it launches on Xbox 360 on March 25.”\n\nMicrosoft also revealed some impressive sales figure: More than 772,000 Xbox One games sold in February, while 2.46 million Xbox 360 games also exited shelves.

Publisher Electronic Arts’ sci-fi shooter has already outsold FIFA 14 by a 2-to-1 margin since the start of the year in that country. Microsoft, EA, and developer Respawn all have a lot riding on the success of the title, which has human-sized soldiers fighting with and against giant walking tanks (be sure to read our review).\n\n“Titanfall also gives a colossal boost to Xbox One hardware sales with a huge jump of over 96 percent [week over week] thanks largely to the new Titanfall bundle, [which includes] a download token of the game, accounting for over 70 percent of all Xbox One hardware sold this week,” reads a GfK statement. “The new property is a welcome sight [for EA]. [Its] last No. 1 title [in the U.K.] that wasn’t a FIFA stretches back more than a year when Crysis 3 held the crown in the first week of March 2013.”\n\nGfK collects its sales data electronically through a point-of-service system at retailers. So this data will only reflect software sold at physical stores. EA also released Titanfall for PC on its Origin download store as well as Xbox One’s digital-distribution network. We’ve reached out to EA and Microsoft to see if the shooter is selling this well in other territories.\n\nTitanfall isn’t just important for EA. Microsoft needed that boost to its console sales. Xbox One debuted alongside Sony’s PlayStation 4 in November, and the PS4 has continually sold better. At $400, Sony’s system is $100 less expensive than the Xbox One, and that’s helped the PS4 reach more than 6 million units sold around the world. The Microsoft device is sitting at around 4 million.\n\nIn February, the PS4 once again outsold the Xbox One in the U.S., but by a slim margin. Gamers actually spent more money on Xbox One, but that it’s possible that the PS4 was supply constrained due to Sony finally launching it in Japan.\n\nWhile Titanfall is pushing Xbox Ones, Sony will have a major exclusive of its own in March. The open-world action title Infamous: Second Son hits the system on Friday.

Oh wait, that was the 80’s. Fast forward 30 years and it looks like the fantasy future of fully immersive Virtual Reality might actually be here at long last. Thanks to start ups like the Oculus Rift, there has been a modern day resurgence into VR, mostly out of frustration that commercially available technology just doesn’t exist. However, all of this may be about to change.\n\nAmong others, Sony has been developing a VR headset which will supposedly be unveiled at the Gamers Developer Conference this month. Other than rumors and a few mockups circulating the net we don’t know much about it. We would assume of course that it would be compatible with the PS4 and it would be a shame to ignore the massive market potential of PS3 users still out there.\n\nThere are still a few minor issues that need to be worked out to make a VR headset a successful accessory item. Some of the technology currently in development still requires cables to be physically plugged in which means the viewer is usually confined to a chair or standing in one spot. There is also the latency problem. The human eye perceives movement in the real world in about 20-30 milliseconds. Any more than that and we perceive lag which can lead to the motion sickness some users have been complaining about. Then there is content. So far there is very little actual 360 degree content other than demos.

It was reported that by the end of February, The Xbox One had actually sold around 90% of the units that PS4 had sold in US. With the $100 price difference, it has been projected that Microsoft may have made more money than Sony. However, PS4 is the reigning king overseas, which lead to Microsoft dropping the price of the Xbox One in the UK. The question now is, will the new price cut and release of Titanfall push sales of the Xbox One past the PS4?\n\nLast week we learned that Microsoft was as not as far behind in the game race, when the company released their monthly figures for February. XWire, a Xbox blog, is reporting on the new numbers:\n\n“February NPD Group figures released today [Thursday, March 13] showed that Xbox One continues selling at a record-breaking pace with 258,0 0 units sold in the U.S. in the month of February, surpassing Xbox 360 sales by over 61 percent at the same point in time.”\n\nThese figures are all before the release of the Titanfall and the Xbox One Titanfall bundle.\n\nTitanfall is the first outing from former Call of Duty developers, Jason West and Vince Zampella. West and Zampella had a falling out with their former employers, Infinity Ward, back in 2010, and went on to start, Respawn Entertainment.\n\nTitanfall is an online only first person shooter, with a mixes a semi-familiar,COD style with out of this world sci fi elements. Players have unlimited sprint, the ability to double jump and wall run. You can also call on massive mecks, known as Titans, that drop into battle. The result is face paced, action packed shooter that is light on story but full of thrills.\n\nSince the games release last tuesday, the Xbox One has seen 96 percent. That combined with the recent UK price drop and the bundled system and game combo make it very likely for the Xbox One to turn its fortune around.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n</p>\n\n© 2016 The Classical Art, All rights reserved.

One month, the PlayStation 4 is selling twice as many as the Xbone, and the next month, Xbox One is catching up.\n\nIt could be the limitations of PS4 in stock which could be giving the Xbox One its edge, in spite of all of the technical chatter. While Sony may not have been up front about the PlayStation 4’s native resolution, the PlayStation 4 continues to outperform the Xbox One in nearly every comparison. However, the recent reveal of the Titanfall Xbox One graphics drop hasn’t stopped the game from giving Microsoft’s machine a sudden boost in sales.\n\nAs we have stated before, one of the key components in any console war is the games, and PS4 vs Xbox One is no different. We may claim graphics as the reason our consoles are better, but if the machine doesn’t play the games you want, you won’t buy it. Late adapters especially will judge their purchase based on price and game selection.\n\nSony has reportedly experienced a recurring shortage of PS4 in stock. We can only assume that it’s either because gamers are buying it as soon as it hits the shelves, or because the PlayStation 4 was built too quickly at launch and there was a need to slow down and make them right. The launch of Sony’s current generation console was plagued with enough “blue light of death” scenarios to give us a dreary reminder of the similar early Xbox 360 days.\n\nThe “blue light” problem may have been because the first batch were allegedly rushed out by people willingly sabotaging the console over working conditions. Despite this, the PS4 vs Xbox One console war still saw Sony winning at nearly ever turn in 2013.\n\nMicrosoft’s console hasn’t fared so well due to poor marketing. They may have been more honest than Sony, but their insistence toward focusing on the social and TV aspects of the machine told us they didn’t care as much about the games.\n\nAmazon Warehouse now has the PS4 in stock for less than $300! #PS4 Tracker 03/17/2014 04:46 http://t.co/ojx7YRCJVI — XboxOneLocator (@XboxOneLocator) March 17, 2014\n\nWhile the recent surge of sales indicates that the lack of a Titanfall PS4 port is pushing the Xbox One more than ever, only time will tell if the Titanfall Xbox One bundle will be enough to compete later on. With the upcoming Planetside 2 PS4 port in the works, and Titanfall 2 probably not being Xbox One exclusive, the biggest limitation to PlayStation 4 sales could once more be the number of PS4 in stock.\n\nWhich console do you think will win in PS4 vs Xbox One sales this year?', 'As the PS4 vs Xbox One console war continues, there is much debate over which console is selling better.\nIt could be the limitations of PS4 in stock which could be giving the Xbox One its edge, in spite of all of the technical chatter.\nAs we have stated before, one of the key components in any console war is the games, and PS4 vs Xbox One is no different.\nDespite this, the PS4 vs Xbox One console war still saw Sony winning at nearly ever turn in 2013.\nWhich console do you think will win in PS4 vs Xbox One sales this year?']"

But how the two companies present these numbers couldn’t be more different. Here’s how the holiday season stacked up for both companies.\n\nSony’s PlayStation 4\n\n5.7 million+ units. That’s how many PlayStation 4’s Sony sold through during the holiday season. Sony’s holiday season is from November 22 – January 2 (North America, Latin America and Europe). It’s November 23 through January 3 in Japan and Asia.\n\nLet’s talk about ‘sold through’ for just a second. Sold through means how many units were sold directly to consumers. The shipped number for this same period is higher. If you ever see ‘sold in’ that means shipped. Sold through is a better indicator of how well the product is actually doing.\n\nSony’s weaker first-party line (compared to Microsoft) didn’t hurt software sales one bit. More than 35 million copies were sold worldwide and through digital downloads as of January 3. Marketing deals with two of the biggest November titles (Star Wars: Battlefront and Call of Duty: Black Ops III) helped boost sales.\n\nSony execs are understandably pumped by the sales.\n\n“We are absolutely delighted that so many customers have selected PS4 as the best place to play throughout this holiday season and that the PS4 community is growing more than ever,” said Andrew House, President and Global CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver innovative entertainment experiences, and look forward to bringing an unprecedented games portfolio from third-party developers and publishers and SCE Worldwide Studios, including UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End, New Hot Shots Golf (working title) and The Last Guardian, this coming year.”\n\nYeah, software sales for 2016 are going to be absurd. Holiday 2015 might have been sparse on the first-party side of things, but 2016 is stacked. Horizon: Zero Dawn is a curious omission from the press release. Then again, House isn’t going to list every single PlayStation 4 game coming in 2016.\n\nSince launch, the PlayStation 4 has sold 35.9 million units. Holy shit is all I have to say. I’m a Xbox One guy myself (that’s where my friends play), but that is an insane number. Sony will look to build on this momentum even more in 2016 with a large first-party lineup and PlayStation VR.\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox\n\nMicrosoft also enjoyed a record holiday, but good luck finding hard numbers. Here’s how Microsoft describes their holiday success.\n\n“On Dec. 28 there were more gamers using Xbox Live than any other day in Xbox history, and the number of hours spent gaming on Xbox One and Xbox 360 during Christmas week 2015 were up compared to last year. Thanks to you, Xbox One continues to outpace Xbox 360 at the same point in time in the Xbox 360 generation, making it the best-selling console in Xbox console history.”\n\nI don’t blame Microsoft for not releasing hard numbers. They already said they’re not going to release them anymore. And, it’s clear Sony is pulling away in sales. I’ll give Phil Spencer and the Xbox team props for trying to right the ship after a disastrous reveal, but they just can’t completely shake that bad first impression.\n\n[divider][/divider]\n\nEven if you don’t follow gaming, it’s easy to see who’s winning. Sony is opting for hard numbers while Microsoft goes for ‘better than Xbox 360’ phrases. That’s not to say the Xbox One is disappointing. Hell, far from it.

Microsoft’s machine has proven to be a magnet for gamers who want to play Respawn’s anticipated mech warfare title.\n\nThe Titanfall Xbox One exclusive status has garnered plenty of hate from PlayStation 4 owners who might feel cheated out of the biggest game this year, as reflected by the high number of negative user reviews on Metacritic. That fact alone is enough to tell us that it’s an amazing game, even if the graphics aren’t that impressive (rarely achieving a consistent 800p at a decent frame rate).\n\nOur new Lv. 1 Vanquish can play Titanfall on 1080p high graphics while the XBOX One can’t even play 800p. Where’s “next-gen” now? — Digital Storm (@DigitalStormPC) March 13, 2014\n\nWhere the Xbox One vs PS4 console war may see a shift is on PC. An Xbox One controller PC driver is confirmed to be on its way, and with the processing power of higher-end gaming PCs the controller itself could end up selling alongside Titanfall for Windows. With the lack of direct DualShock 4 PC support, this could garner even more hate from Titanfall PS4 hopefuls.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that the PlayStation 4 controller won’t work on Windows games. This means that you’ll need special software that fools your PC into thinking it’s an Xbox 360 controller. The Xbox One controller PC driver will allow Microsoft’s current generation device to be instantly recognized and accepted for what it is.\n\nEnterprising DualShock 4 PC hackers won’t find it that big of an issue, but the fact that you’re fooling Windows into thinking it’s a rival controller could still make some Sony fanboys upset. This could be especially evident when it comes to on-screen tutorials and quick-time events, where the game will call out Xbox 360 buttons and you’ll have to translate them in your head to DualShock 4 buttons.\n\nXbox One Controller PC Drivers still in the works – http://t.co/Kjl4zvtr0y — Senshudo TV (@senshudotv) March 15, 2014\n\nWith Titanfall facing the eventual PS4 port of PlanetSide 2, the Xbox One will need to keep the exclusive killer IPs coming in order to compete with the PS4 in stock. The recent reveal of Sony not being up front about its technical promises may have swayed the opinions of a few, but that probably won’t be enough to give the Xbox One the edge it may need to beat its rival in the Xbox One vs PS4 console wars.\n\nThe key components to any console war have always been the games and the graphics. For now, the lack of a Titanfall PS4 port and direct DualShock 4 PC support gives the Xbox One the edge, but this round of Xbox One vs PS4 is far from over.', 'As the Xbox One vs PS4 debates rage on, the recent release of Titanfall appears to be a game changer.\n— Digital Storm (@DigitalStormPC) March 13, 2014Where the Xbox One vs PS4 console war may see a shift is on PC.\nWith the lack of direct DualShock 4 PC support, this could garner even more hate from Titanfall PS4 hopefuls.\nThe Xbox One controller PC driver will allow Microsoft’s current generation device to be instantly recognized and accepted for what it is.\nFor now, the lack of a Titanfall PS4 port and direct DualShock 4 PC support gives the Xbox One the edge, but this round of Xbox One vs PS4 is far from over.']"

18217,http://www.computerandvideogames.com/454172/fifa-14-update-hits-xbox-one/,technology,"['Here’s a slice of real football 101 that the FIFA series knows all too well. Some parts of a soccer team are more interchangeable than others. For instance, wingers can be switched at will, right-backs can deputise as slightly wonky left-backs, even a lumbering center-half can be pushed up front in times of need. But on the other hand you don\'t go shoving Lionel Messi into defensive midfield or Ronaldo in goal. You can fiddle around with the extremities all you like, but the spine of the team is sacred. FIFA takes this football lesson to heart, and 14 builds on the same solid base as before, with only minimal changes to the lineup. Like that aforementioned wonky, wrong-footed left-back, though, some changes here are not always for the best.\n\n""It is a slower, more methodical game that can frustrate as often as it delights""\n\nSuch resistance to change is understandable. You get the sense the series peaked artistically with FIFA 12, and now EA Canada is left to play the role of tinkerman, fiddling around with individual components in an attempt to stay fresh and relevant.\n\nThe trend for football games this year is capturing the sport’s unpredictability. PES 2014 achieves this through its \'heart\' mechanic, where players having a bad game grow ever-more skittish and liable to make mistakes. In response FIFA has taken a different path, hoping to capture unpredictability through physics rather than psychology. This isn’t necessarily the direction FIFA should be going in. Last year\'s \'First Touch\' feature, which saw the ball cannon off world class footballers\' feet, was as divisive amongst fans as a Xavi pass. This year it works in tandem with a rebuilt animation system, which makes for a slower, more methodical game that can frustrate as often as it delights.\n\n""You\'re often forced to play the ball out wide to avoid the mass of humanity standing between yourself and the goal.""\n\nThis Frankenstein\'s monster of a feature is called \'Precision Movement\', and the idea is that the more intricate animations make for a deeper game where every step counts. This is true to an extent, but the effect it has on the game\'s enjoyability depends on where on the pitch you happen to be. It\'s the midfield battles that suffer the most; leggy animations affect player stride and their ability to change directions smoothly, and give games a stop-start kind of flow.\n\nPrecision Movement was designed in part to allow for greater playmaking from midfield but in practice the opposite is true, creating treacle-like, congested battles of attrition, where you\'re often forced to play the ball out wide to avoid the mass of humanity standing between yourself and the goal. With First Touch as unpredictable as ever, there are moments where you don\'t feel as in control of proceedings as perhaps you should.\n\n""Goals feel more organic and varied here than they have in a FIFA game for years.""\n\nWhen you\'re through on goal however, you\'ll see the system in a new light. The step-based system meshes well with new ball physics and opens the door for some spectacular goals--dipping half-volleys, curled lace shots, and everything in-between. As a result, goals feel more organic and varied here than they have in a FIFA game for years. When the perfect shot comes off and nestles into the top corner, it feels magical rather than contrived.\n\nThe players feel heavier than those in last year’s FIFA and it\'s easier to muscle nippy forwards off the ball – a rebalance that\'s superbly counterpunched by the Protect The Ball feature (mapped to LT), which sees the player shield the ball, buying valuable seconds for the cavalry to arrive during breaks.\n\n""Throw in the stunning TV presentation and the convenience of ready-built leagues, players, and stadia, and there\'s really only one choice for the casual fan.""\n\nThe result is a game that at first feels less cohesive than FIFAs past, but gingerly eases into a slow-paced cerebral affair, where dourness is punctuated by fleeting moments of inspiration and genius. FIFA 14\'s thirst for realism is a noble cause, and one that will find a sizeable audience. But the real reasons to plump for EA\'s offering, as ever, are ones that are shallow and valid in equal measure. EA\'s financial muscle affords FIFA the kind of glitz and glamour that is forever out of the reach of PES. Throw in the stunning TV presentation and the convenience of ready-built leagues, players, and stadia, and there\'s really only one choice for the casual fan.\n\nFIFA 14\'s a great game--of course it is--but the series seems too big and bloated now to make any substantial changes. FIFA 14 requires more patience than most of its predecessors, and even when your patience is rewarded, it often feels like it\'s flattering to deceive. Slow and stodgy in midfield but dynamic and physical at either end of the pitch, it\'s possible that some might think this the best FIFA ever--but you\'d be splitting hairs, not defences.\n\nThis game was reviewed on Xbox 360.', 'Here’s a slice of real football 101 that the FIFA series knows all too well.\nFIFA takes this football lesson to heart, and 14 builds on the same solid base as before, with only minimal changes to the lineup.\n""Goals feel more organic and varied here than they have in a FIFA game for years.""\nAs a result, goals feel more organic and varied here than they have in a FIFA game for years.\nFIFA 14 requires more patience than most of its predecessors, and even when your patience is rewarded, it often feels like it\'s flattering to deceive.']"

""[I]n addition to torn frames, there’s noticeable judder and a less than solid response from the controls.""\n\nThe Eurogamer article includes a host of videos and image-quality comparison screenshots, so I recommend heading there for all the gory details.

With the constant stream of Steam sales, it\'s hard to find a gamer out there who hasn\'t built up a backlog of PC games — whether they were trying to or not. Fortunately, thanks to Microsoft\'s coordination between the development of the Xbox One and the Windows OS, owners of the new Microsoft console will soon have a convenient option when jumping back and forth between their console and PC.\n\nRumors that Microsoft has been developing a Windows PC-specific controller and planning to lock-out Xbox One controllers from Windows compatibility have been making their way around the forums lately. While that rumour could pose an annoyance to the house of Bill Gate\'s, one Microsoft employee in particular wasn\'t too content with the misinformation making the rounds and took to NeoGAF to debunk the false claims.\n\nMicrosoft\'s director of product management, Albert Penello, responded to a post about the rumors and explained that the controller support (which was announced over the summer) is still on the way.\n\n""This is 100% wrong. When the drivers become available, they will work with the existing controllers. There is no plan to do a new, separate controller that only works on Windows. It will be the same as it is on Xbox 360 — the Xbox One controller you have today will work.""\n\nPenello didn\'t spill all of the details about support for the controller, but his statement should definitely put a lot of minds at rest. He was able to share that Xbox One controllers will work with Windows PCs in wired-mode, but no decision has been made yet on whether or not Microsoft will implement wireless compatibility for the controllers.\n\n""No more updates on the timeframe beyond what\'s been publicly stated. The plan is this year. When the update comes out and we have more details, I can explain the holdup.""\n\nThe delay is caused by the need to write new software that will optimize the controller for PC use. There will also need to be work done to ensure that existing PC games that currently support the Xbox 360 controller will also work with the new Xbox One controller. Although many hardcore PC gamers will be reluctant to give up their mouse and keyboards, the option to switch over to the familiar Xbox One controller will definitely be a nice perk for more casual PC players.\n\nIt\'s great news that support for Microsoft\'s controller will be coming, but only time will tell whether the majority of PC gamers prefer to maneuver with the Xbox One controller, the yet to be released Steam controller, or something else entirely.\n\nWhat is your ideal controller for PC gaming?

The world’s largest social network doesn’t exactly have the best track record when it comes to privacy, and people were concerned that WhatsApp would start collecting user information and sharing it with Facebook.\n\nWhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum published a reassuring blog post on Monday, but also backed up his words with an app update that added new privacy settings. Now users can show off their profile photo to everyone, no one, or just friends. The same goes for the “last seen” time stamp on messages you send and your status. The update for Android offered up a few other new features, like a Camera shortcut for faster photo-sharing, an option to pay for friends’ WhatsApp subscriptions, and the ability to see unread messages on your home screen.\n\n“We don’t know your likes”\n\nWhatsApp\'s new Privacy settings.\n\nThe company is faced with a perception conundrum: Facebook’s resources will let the app grow its impressive international reach, but in the wake of NSA surveillance leaks and Facebook’s past privacy gaffes, users won’t flock to WhatsApp if they feel the app is overstepping its bounds.\n\n“Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA, and we built WhatsApp around the goal of knowing as little about you as possible: You don’t have to give us your name and we don’t ask for your email address,” Koum wrote in Monday’s post. “We don’t know your birthday. We don’t know your home address. We don’t know where you work. We don’t know your likes, what you search for on the internet or collect your GPS location. None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that.”\n\nIn other words: Facebook’s efforts to know as much about you as possible won’t cross over to WhatsApp.\n\nKoum has a personal reason for keeping WhatsApp’s privacy policies in place: He grew up in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, when citizens had to watch what they said for fear of political reprisal.\n\n“One of my strongest memories from that time is a phrase I’d frequently hear when my mother was talking on the phone: ‘This is not a phone conversation; I’ll tell you in person,’” Koum wrote.\n\nWhatsApp’s security challenges\n\nWhatsApp security isn’t solely a Facebook issue. There are other privacy concerns: Last week, a security blogger said he found a flaw in the Android version of the app that allows hackers to see your WhatsApp chats, which are stored on a device’s SD card, if a user unknowingly installs a malicious app. WhatsApp’s response: The problem lies with Android, and users have to be careful about downloading apps from untrusted sources. Another recently discovered problem: When WhatsApp users switch phone numbers, they may receive messages intended for the previous phone number’s owner. The app disconnects accounts after 45 days of inactivity, which is designed to prevent such issues, but the company also encourages users to delete accounts when they switch numbers.\n\nOther security flaws have in the past been found in WhatsApp’s Android version, but the company continues to add protections with regular updates and encourages users to install the most recent version of the app at any given time.\n\nThis story, ""WhatsApp wants to ""set the record straight"" on privacy under Facebook"" was originally published by TechHive .', 'WhatsApp users freaked out after Facebook announced plans to buy the popular over-the-top messaging app for north of $16 billion.\nWe don’t know your likes, what you search for on the internet or collect your GPS location.\nWhatsApp’s security challengesWhatsApp security isn’t solely a Facebook issue.\nAnother recently discovered problem: When WhatsApp users switch phone numbers, they may receive messages intended for the previous phone number’s owner.\nThis story, ""WhatsApp wants to ""set the record straight"" on privacy under Facebook"" was originally published by TechHive .']"

The new settings also give users the option to back up their chats in the cloud. Previously this was turned off by default.\n\nAll this makes sense for Facebook. WhatsApp’s popularity has been fuelled in no small part by its unobtrusive presence in its users’ lives. Signing up and chatting with your friends is a simple process on the app, and some users even find the subscription cost ($1 a year after the first year) a comforting reminder that the company is getting money from something other than their personal data.\n\nSpeaking after the acquisition was announced, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg said that the focus for WhatsApp is “on growing and connecting everyone in the world” and that he didn’t think that ads were “the right way of monetized messaging services”. There’s no guarantee that WhatsApp will always be so intrusive but for the foreseeable future – and up until the company hits one billion accounts – it looks like users can breathe easy.\n\nSocial media is an increasingly important battle ground in elections - and home to many questionable claims pumped out by all sides.

After all, users have every right to be raising eyebrows given the social media giant\'s reputation of questionable and ever-changing privacy principles and a business model that works around collecting and sharing user data.\n\nThe multi-billion deal triggered privacy concerns with advocacy groups filing formal complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) earlier this month. The Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy said in a complaint that the ever-changing privacy policies of Facebook would end up in conflict with WhatsApp\'s solid pro-privacy position. Said advocate groups asked FTC to stop the sale of WhatsApp awaiting an investigation.\n\nOn Monday, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum dispelled such rumors in a blog post.\n\n""Speculation to the contrary isn\'t just baseless and unfounded, it\'s irresponsible. It has the effect of scaring people into thinking we\'re suddenly collecting all kinds of new data. That\'s just not true, and it\'s important to us that you know that,"" he said.\n\nTo explain where he\'s coming from, the CEO said he values the ""principle of private communication,"" having grown up in the 1980s in the USSR where communication was not without fear of monitoring by the KGB.\n\n""Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA, and we built WhatsApp around the goal of knowing as little about you as possible: You don\'t have to give us your name and we don\'t ask for your email address. We don\'t know your birthday. We don\'t know your home address. We don\'t know where you work. We don\'t know your likes, what you search for on the internet or collect your GPS location. None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that,"" he also wrote. He added that the partnership with Facebook would allow them ""to continue operating independently and autonomously.""\n\nFacebook also maintained its position that both companies would continue to operate separately, and that WhatsApp would continue to honor its commitments to privacy and security.\n\nWhatsApp, however, came under fire again after discovery of an alleged ""security flaw"" that allowed other malicious applications to read its messages backed up to an SD card of the user. Koum simply shrugged off the alleged vulnerability and said that his company doesn\'t have control over malware and viruses. He instead advised users to only allow downloads of legitimate applications from the Google Play Store.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

If the images are to be believed, the messaging service will soon get an option to make voice calls. The UI looks quite straightforward and minimalistic. The call menu features three familiar buttons to mute, message, or pass the call through the speaker — all of which are in tune with the iOS 7 design guidelines. Additionally, there is also a camera button next to the mic that will allow for instant camera uploads.\n\nThe website also claims that the calls will be free over Wi-Fi and.3G. So you won't have to pay additional charges apart from from the data bills.

The designer has gracefully tied Facebook's mobile software and Apple's iOS 7 design language gracefully.\n\nHowever, there's another side to the current design of WhatsApp. Despite its utilitarian layout, users have flocked to the service by the millions and it even won the company a $19 billion deal. Changing this might seem sort of unnecessary and in some ways even offensive to users who're interested in purely messaging rather than style.\n\nZiemlewski's design is such a drastic departure from WhatsApps current layout. Facebook has reasons to think twice before embracing such changes in one go. What's more far-fetched is the idea that Facebook will purchase designs from an external source rather than coming up with something itself.\n\nStill, this can't stop users from dreaming of a beautiful messaging app that ties in visually with the operating systems.

Soon after the $19 billion deal was announced, consumer privacy groups asked federal regulators to investigate the merger for potential consumer harms and possibly block the deal. Some users are threatening to leave the service.\n\nWhatsApp founders on Monday tried to deflate concerns that user data may be used for advertising. But it will be hard for the messaging service to convince users who thought they had signed up to service that would never use data for targeted advertising, privacy advocates say. Any deal with Facebook comes with the baggage of the social networking giant\'s troubled history on privacy.\n\n""They took Facebook\'s money, and now one of them has a seat on their board,"" said Jeff Chester, head of Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy group that along with the Electronic Privacy Information Center recently filed a complaint against the merger to the FTC.\n\nJan Koum, who co-founded WhatsApp with Brian Acton, will join Facebook\'s board once the deal closes.\n\nFacebook has repeatedly changed privacy policies on users, having the effect of a slow boil that constantly pushes the comforts of users who are at this point too reliant on the network to leave, some consumer groups say.\n\nThe merger of Facebook and WhatsApp brings together two companies with diametrically opposing business models and philosophies on consumer data. Facebook\'s success is tied directly to how much data it collects about its users and sells for advertising.\n\nWhatsApp has taken great pride in collecting as little information about users as possible. In a blog post Monday, Koum reiterated that no phone numbers or other data of its 455 million users will be shared with Facebook. The free (or nearly free) messaging app doesn\'t ask your name or e-mail address. There is no real sign up procedure like most subscription services and the firm will be run independently from Facebook. The other things WhatsApp won\'t collect: home address, GPS location, your likes, search history. And in a followup email, Koum said messaging history isn\'t stored in its servers. ""None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that,"" Koum said.\n\n""I want to make sure you understand how deeply I value the principle of private communication. For me, this is very personal. I was born in Ukraine, and grew up in the USSR during the 1980s. One of my strongest memories from that time is a phrase I’d frequently hear when my mother was talking on the phone: “This is not a phone conversation; I’ll tell you in person.” The fact that we couldn’t speak freely without the fear that our communications would be monitored by KGB is in part why we moved to the United States when I was a teenager.""\n\nIt\'s personal for Facebook and WhatsApp users too. And it\'s natural for users -- who have seen their profile pictures suddenly become public incorporated into sponsored ads-- to predict changes will be in store for WhatsApp, privacy groups say. In 2012, Facebook settled FTC charges that it deceived consumers by allegedly sharing information about users without the consumer\'s knowledge.\n\n""WhatsApp should enter into a 20 year consent decree with the FTC that it will never accept advertising or incorporate Facebook marketing products,"" Chester said.', 'For global messaging sensation WhatsApp, the privacy brouhaha that followed its sale to Facebook came as a rude surprise.\nWhatsApp founders on Monday tried to deflate concerns that user data may be used for advertising.\nThe merger of Facebook and WhatsApp brings together two companies with diametrically opposing business models and philosophies on consumer data.\n""None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that,"" Koum said.\nIt\'s personal for Facebook and WhatsApp users too.']"

Where is the opportunity now?\n\nThe most high-profile tech deal of this year has undoubtedly been Facebook’s $19bn acquisition of WhatsApp.\n\nEven seasoned tech experts were shocked at the price tag, and there has been much speculation about Facebook’s motivation to pay out such a hefty price: Was it a defensive strategy? Is Facebook concerned about losing the “cool” factor amongst the younger audience? Is Facebook aiming to become a social media conglomerate?\n\nOn the face of it, WhatsApp was acquired for its audience, not its business model, a fairly rudimentary proposition based on charging a modest subscription for usage.\n\nAssuming that the WhatsApp team backtrack on their “no ads” policy, it is likely that the WhatsApp deal will be justified on the basis of generating more ad inventory for Facebook, but given the rapid evolution of the digital social world, we can be sure that Facebook and hatsApp is not the end of the story.\n\nWhat comes next? Competing against the formidable combined force of Facebook and WhatsApp, what will a social app have to do to differentiate itself and build the next global success story?\n\nIt is clear that there is one space into which Facebook and WhatsApp or indeed any of their biggest competitors such as Viber have not effectively addressed, and that is bringing strangers together.\n\nAll of these applications allow users only to communicate with those whom they already know – people whom they have “accepted” as friends or with whom they are already connected in many different ways.\n\nYet sometimes, your real-life social circle is not quite enough to share all the things you want to share. What if you are a Londoner learning Japanese but don’t know any native speakers apart from your teacher? What if you are dying to talk about a book or a film you have just finished that none of your friends have seen or read yet, or want to discuss online game strategies with like-minded fans?\n\nWe’ve seen a genuine demand around the world for opportunities to expand social circles – connecting with like-minded people is a fundamental human need. More than 20,000 people join Palringo every day for the chance to build communities across borders and generations based on shared interests, be it a shared love of cheeseburgers, learning languages, or playing Grand Theft Auto.\n\nThere is a strong future for social apps that focus on specific niches or focus on connecting people who might never meet under any other circumstances – but who should, because they are on the same wavelength. However, having a vision is only part of the story. You also need a business model and the WhatsApp deal raised some interesting questions in that regard.\n\nThe WhatsApp example demonstrates that sometimes it makes sense to forget about the business model and simply focus on obtaining the biggest possible audience in the hopes of being acquired by a buyer that can make sense of it all.\n\nThe consensus among the financial community is that this is a viable model so long as the company is based in Silicon Valley. A more reliable approach, however, is to build a sustainable company with a real business model and this can even be achieved on top of a real-time messaging platform.\n\nThis might mean selling items that enrich communications within a community, allowing members of a community to challenge each other within the context of competitions or offering games that can be played within one or several communities.\n\nThe future will belong to the start-ups that can provide customised entertainment, for instance, charging for games users can play through the app. Whatever form monetisation takes, it would have to be more than being bought by someone who wants to leverage the audience for commerce.\n\nThe key is innovation. The business to match and perhaps outperform WhatsApp’s success story will have to be more than a messaging platform; it will have to be the hub for thousands of communities, competitions, games and fundraising opportunities.\n\nWhatsApp was the most widely discussed deal in recent history, but conversations will now focus on the way in which online messaging communities evolve, diversify, and reassess their business models – as well as change the ways in which we interact.\n\nTim Rea is CEO of messaging and mobile communities app Palringo."", ""What will happen to the messaging industry after Facebook's $19bn acquisition of Whatsapp?\nThe most high-profile tech deal of this year has undoubtedly been Facebook’s $19bn acquisition of WhatsApp.\nOn the face of it, WhatsApp was acquired for its audience, not its business model, a fairly rudimentary proposition based on charging a modest subscription for usage.\nYou also need a business model and the WhatsApp deal raised some interesting questions in that regard.\nA more reliable approach, however, is to build a sustainable company with a real business model and this can even be achieved on top of a real-time messaging platform.""]"

After all, Facebook have the best reputation when it comes to user privacy.\n\nEarlier this month, 2 privacy advocate groups — The Electronic Privacy Information Center, and the Center for Digital Democracy — filed a formal complaint with the FTC, asking them to halt the sale of WhatsApp pending an investigation. The complaint argued that Facebook’s ever changing privacy policies would end up conflicting with WhatsApp’s strong pro-privacy stance. Facebook, on the other hand, maintained that the 2 companies would continue operating separately from one another (something mentioned in the original press release), with WhatsApp honoring commitments to privacy and security.\n\nBut it was last week that WhatsApp once again came under fire after an alleged “security flaw” was discovered in the app. The vulnerability made it possible for other malicious applications to read WhatsApp messages backed up to a user’s SD card (this was an option provided in the app). WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum shrugged off the security flaw, urging users to only download legitimate applications from the Google Play Store, while mentioning that his company essentially has no control over viruses and malware. Unfortunately for WhatsApp, privacy concerns continued to snowball around the net.\n\nIt’s this reason WhatsApp is once again addressing these concerns with a post made on their company blog today to “set the record straight,” once and for all. CEO Jan Koum provides users with insight on exactly what made him such a privacy nut, giving his own personal account of his life in USSR, specifically about how he and his mother were forced to restrict phone conversations over fears of KGB eavesdropping. It’s because of this, Koum says, he moved to the US in the first place, and the reason why privacy is “coded into” WhatsApp’s DNA.\n\nWhen it comes to data collection, he goes onto to note how WhatsApp really knows very little about the millions of users who’ve downloaded the app. Unlike a host of other applications found in app markets across iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, WhatsApp doesn’t require names or email addresses, has no idea where you live, what you “like,” and/or what you’re searching for on the internet. It’s a valid point, and one Koum says he has no plans on changing.\n\nIn fact, if joining up with Facebook meant WhatsApp would have to compromise its privacy policy in any way (or make any changes to their values), Koum assures users that he simply wouldn’t have taken the deal in the first place. It’s these fundamentals Koum attributes to WhatsApp’s success, and the reasons why he says so many users have chosen the messaging service over the vast amount of other options available.\n\n[WhatsApp Blog]', 'The complaint argued that Facebook’s ever changing privacy policies would end up conflicting with WhatsApp’s strong pro-privacy stance.\nFacebook, on the other hand, maintained that the 2 companies would continue operating separately from one another (something mentioned in the original press release), with WhatsApp honoring commitments to privacy and security.\nBut it was last week that WhatsApp once again came under fire after an alleged “security flaw” was discovered in the app.\nWhatsApp CEO Jan Koum shrugged off the security flaw, urging users to only download legitimate applications from the Google Play Store, while mentioning that his company essentially has no control over viruses and malware.\nUnfortunately for WhatsApp, privacy concerns continued to snowball around the net.']"

As a company, we’re excited to continue focusing on offering as many people as possible the chance to stay connected with friends and loved ones, no matter who they are or where they live.\n\nUnfortunately, there has also been a lot of inaccurate and careless information circulating about what our future partnership would mean for WhatsApp users’ data and privacy.\n\nI’d like to set the record straight.\n\nAbove all else, I want to make sure you understand how deeply I value the principle of private communication. For me, this is very personal. I was born in Ukraine, and grew up in the USSR during the 1980s. One of my strongest memories from that time is a phrase I’d frequently hear when my mother was talking on the phone: “This is not a phone conversation; I’ll tell you in person.” The fact that we couldn’t speak freely without the fear that our communications would be monitored by KGB is in part why we moved to the United States when I was a teenager.\n\nRespect for your privacy is coded into our DNA, and we built WhatsApp around the goal of knowing as little about you as possible: You don’t have to give us your name and we don’t ask for your email address. We don’t know your birthday. We don’t know your home address. We don’t know where you work. We don’t know your likes, what you search for on the internet or collect your GPS location. None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that.\n\nIf partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change. Everything that has made WhatsApp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place. Speculation to the contrary isn’t just baseless and unfounded, it’s irresponsible. It has the effect of scaring people into thinking we’re suddenly collecting all kinds of new data. That’s just not true, and it’s important to us that you know that.\n\nMake no mistake: our future partnership with Facebook will not compromise the vision that brought us to this point.

WhatsApp reportedly lost a minority of their membership due to this fear, leading WhatsApp founder Jan Koum to take to the company blog. In a post titled “Setting the record straight”, Koum tries to do just that.\n\nKoum begins setting the record straight by saying “there has also been a lot of inaccurate and careless information circulating about what our future partnership would mean for WhatsApp users’ data and privacy.” He goes on to discuss his upbringing in Ukraine during the cold war and communism. In a totalitarianism regime, Koum felt as though privacy — especially as it relates to communication — was important, and routinely compromised. It prompted his family to move to the United States when he was a teenager, he says.\n\nThe CEO also reminds us that WhatsApp has none of our personal information, like birthdate or email address. “Respect for your privacy is coded into our DNA” he says, adding “we built WhatsApp around the goal of knowing as little about you as possible”. Before adding that the partnership will not compromise their focus or integrity, Koum had the following to add:\n\nIf partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change.

Time and again, our personal info has been compromised and violated by the social media giant, often en masse. By aligning themselves with Facebook, we naturally take interest in our security when using WhatsApp. Even those security concerns that did exist prior to Facebook’s purchase of the platform didn’t come to light until after the transaction. Koum should consider why that is rather than promise not to ask what our names are.\n\nWe can respect that WhatsApp will remain autonomous while being under the auspice of Facebook, but they are tucked neatly under Facebook’s wing — and there has to be a reason Zuckerberg spent $19 million (more than the NASA budget for 2014) for a messaging service. Rather than tell us what WhatsApp won’t be doing, we’d love to hear what Facebook will be doing with WhatsApp.\n\n', 'With Facebook’s massive purchase of WhatsApp, many have had growing concerns over privacy.\nWhatsApp reportedly lost a minority of their membership due to this fear, leading WhatsApp founder Jan Koum to take to the company blog.\nIn a post titled “Setting the record straight”, Koum tries to do just that.\nThe CEO also reminds us that WhatsApp has none of our personal information, like birthdate or email address.\nRather than tell us what WhatsApp won’t be doing, we’d love to hear what Facebook will be doing with WhatsApp.']"

They are not the NSA; they have not stolen any information you wanted kept private. Now, the company is using it to make money by selling it. They do not make this a secret. If you do not want them to do that, then deactivate your account. Nobody is forcing you to be on the network.\n\nWhen it comes to the users of companies that Facebook buys, though, then I have sympathy for their privacy concerns. When someone signed up for a service like Instagram, for example, they did not know that Facebook might gain access to their information at some point in the future. And it seems unfair to that user if the company suddenly did have that access.\n\nFacebook\'s latest purchase, Whatsapp, knows that there have been concerns over privacy ever since the deal was announced in February. Now, CEO Jan Koum has finally decided to address them in a blog post put up on Monday, entitled “Setting the record straight.""\n\nIn the post, Koum said he wanted to clear up the "" inaccurate and careless information circulating about"" over what the company\'s ""future partnership would mean for WhatsApp users’ data and privacy.""\n\nAs someone who was born in Ukraine, and grew up in the USSR during the 1980s, he said, he deeply values "" the principle of private communication."" And the deal for Facebook to acquire the company will not change that.\n\nThe company, he noted, does not ask for information such as the user\'s name, e-mail address, birthday, home address, where they work, their likes, what they search for or their GPS location.\n\n""None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that,"" said Koum. ""If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it.""\n\nKoum repeatedly calls the deal between Whatsapp and Facebook a ""partnership,"" and one that he says will allow him company to ""continue operating independently and autonomously,"" without changing its values or beliefs.\n\n""Make no mistake: our future partnership with Facebook will not compromise the vision that brought us to this point,"" said Koum. ""Our focus remains on delivering the promise of WhatsApp far and wide, so that people around the world have the freedom to speak their mind without fear.""\n\nThe total price for Facebook\'s purchase of WhatsApp includes $4 billion in cash, along with approximately $12 billion worth of Facebook shares. In addition, the agreement also provides for another $3 billion in restricted stock units, which are to be granted to WhatsApp\'s founders and employees, and which will vest over four years subsequent to the closing of the deal.\n\nAt the time of the announcement, it was also revealed that Whatsapp would continue to operate independently, as well as retain its brand, much like Instagram did when Facebook acquired it for $1 billion back in 2012.\n\nIt\'s important for Koum and Zuckerberg to continue to be on good terms with WhatsApp\'s user base, especially considering the $19 billion price tag. The entire deal is predicated on Whatsapp continuing its incredible user growth, which was one million new members each day at the time of the purchase.\n\nRemember back in December of 2012 when Instagram royally pissed off its users with an update to its privacy policy that said that it would be sharing user data with Facebook so that pictures uploaded to Instagram could be used in advertisement on the service without user permission?\n\nHopefully Facebook will have learned from that mistake, and history will not repeat itself with Whatsapp.\n\n(Image source: cheezburger.com)', 'Facebook needs to avoid ticking off users, like it did with Instagram privacy update in 2012Whenever I hear someone start going on about their ""privacy"" on Facebook, I can\'t help but start rolling my eyes.\nWhen it comes to the users of companies that Facebook buys, though, then I have sympathy for their privacy concerns.\nFacebook\'s latest purchase, Whatsapp, knows that there have been concerns over privacy ever since the deal was announced in February.\nThe total price for Facebook\'s purchase of WhatsApp includes $4 billion in cash, along with approximately $12 billion worth of Facebook shares.\nHopefully Facebook will have learned from that mistake, and history will not repeat itself with Whatsapp.']"

None of that data has ever been collected and stored by WhatsApp, and we really have no plans to change that.”\n\nHe also emphasizes that the deal with Facebook is a partnership and none of the principles will change. “If partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn’t have done it. Instead, we are forming a partnership that would allow us to continue operating independently and autonomously. Our fundamental values and beliefs will not change. Our principles will not change. Everything that has made WhatsApp the leader in personal messaging will still be in place. Speculation to the contrary isn’t just baseless and unfounded, it’s irresponsible. It has the effect of scaring people into thinking we’re suddenly collecting all kinds of new data. That’s just not true, and it’s important to us that you know that.”\n\nLast week a report had indicated that WhatsApp’s security might not be foolproof and it could be possible for other apps to glean off data stored on a phone from WhatsApp and use it. However, WhatsApp downplayed the report and blamed it on Android malware and said that the latest version of the app had been addressed in the latest update.\n\nWhatsApp has been under the spotlight after Facebook announced its plans to acquire the messaging service for a whopping $19 billion. WhatsApp said it had 465 million monthly active users on February 24.', 'There have been a number of reports about how WhatsApp would change after its acquisition by Facebook is completed and concerns about the privacy of user data WhatsApp would share with Facebook.\nIn a blog post on the official WhatsApp blog, Koum “set the record straight” and clarified to everyone that the company won’t change and that privacy of users data would remain crucial.\nEarlier last month, in an interview with BGR India, Koum had identified the user information WhatsApp stored on its servers.\nWe don’t know your birthday.\nWe don’t know your likes, what you search for on the Internet or collect your GPS location.']"
18310,http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/03/facebook-inc-whatsapp-hack-privacy/,technology,"['Recently security researchers revealed a major security hole in WhatsApp for Android which allowed hackers to read people’s private conversations. While that issue is concerning enough, there is always the chance that Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) will start selling data from users’ private WhatsApp chats to advertisers—and the security hole could offer Facebook a way to do it.\n\nHow Facebook could use WhatsApp’s data\n\nWe mentioned recently some privacy concerns regarding Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)’s planned acquisition of WhatsApp. Now that this security hole has been uncovered, those concerns may be even more warranted, as Facebook already essentially has a portal into WhatsApp so that it can read users’ conversations. Of course the companies say they’re working to close the hole, as they should, but will Facebook keep the hole open for itself while shutting it for third parties?\n\nThe security issue basically occurs when Android users have a malicious app on their device, which gives other apps access to the whole thing—including WhatsApp. Developers of the malicious app could then basically download and read anyone’s supposedly private WhatsApp conversations.\n\nRob Shavell of Abine suggests that while Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) may be motivated to close the security hole for others, it could find a way to use that hole for its own purposes. After all, the social network still must validate what many see as a high price for WhatsApp.\n\n“The interesting thing is, once Facebook does that and helps these guys out with closing that gap, the interesting thing is, are they going to in the next three months as they figure out how to get the most out of the $19 billion that they used to purchase WhatsApp,” Shavell told ValueWalk in an interview.\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) did not return our request for comment on this story.\n\nWill Facebook change WhatsApp’s privacy practices?\n\nHe believes Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) may be motivated enough to find a way to use the security hole in Android apps to be able to access WhatsApp users’ conversations after the deal between the two companies closes. He questions whether the social network will open up that information to its ad sales team and allow people to look at keywords from chat conversations and then match them up to Facebook profiles.\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has said it currently has no plans to change anything about WhatsApp, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it won’t have plans to do so later. An examination of Facebook’s privacy policies makes it clear that the company could and probably is using information from people’s chat sessions on its website and app.\n\n“They reserve the right to use and any of content they have the right access and use any of this content, ‘any’ being the important three-letter word,” Shavell said. “And they have the right to share it with their ‘approved partners,’ whatever that means.\n\nAnd once WhatsApp is part of Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), it could be lumped together under those privacy practices. Shavell notes that the social network has said that it keeps information from being linked to specific user names in order to be able to say that it is providing privacy, but that doesn’t mean someone won’t be added to an advertising list for certain keywords because of what they are talking about in their chat sessions on Facebook.\n\nParanoia or privacy?\n\nSo should users be concerned about privacy or not when it comes to their online activities? Many will say that they have nothing to hide and that it isn’t a big deal. But then there’s the annoyance of being added to a list because you mentioned the words “engagement” or “marriage” in passing because a friend is getting married. It could, in some ways, be considered akin to telemarketing back in the days before the Do Not Call list was initiated. Of course ignoring ads is still less annoying than receiving a telemarketing call. So why are so many concerned about online privacy? It’s about control.\n\n“It’s not paranoid for users to be concerned about this stuff because it’s actually happening. It is absolutely a big deal because we have no control over it,” Shavell said. “That’s the reason.”\n\nFor users who are concerned about privacy, Shavell recommends not linking their actual phone number to their WhatsApp account. Some options might be to get a Skype number and use that. Abine also offers a service which gives users a separate phone number to use so that their private conversations are not linked to their real profiles.', 'Recently security researchers revealed a major security hole in WhatsApp for Android which allowed hackers to read people’s private conversations.\nWhile that issue is concerning enough, there is always the chance that Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) will start selling data from users’ private WhatsApp chats to advertisers—and the security hole could offer Facebook a way to do it.\nHow Facebook could use WhatsApp’s dataWe mentioned recently some privacy concerns regarding Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)’s planned acquisition of WhatsApp.\nNow that this security hole has been uncovered, those concerns may be even more warranted, as Facebook already essentially has a portal into WhatsApp so that it can read users’ conversations.\nDevelopers of the malicious app could then basically download and read anyone’s supposedly private WhatsApp conversations.']"

18315,http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-honda-and-gm-drivers-will-ignore-recalls-2014-03-18,technology,"['Bloomberg A General Motors Co. 2010 Chevrolet Cobalt\n\nGeneral Motors CEO Mary Barra fired 15 employees and reprimanded another five after the U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas issued a stinging report about why it took the automaker 11 years to recall cars fitted with faulty ignition switches that led to several accidents and deaths. The company has agreed to pay a $35 million fine to settle a federal investigation into the U.S. automaker’s delayed global recall of 2.6 million vehicles and Barra said GM will set up a compensation fund for crash victims. But recent data suggests that although recall rates have risen in recent years, many drivers may still be willing to take their chances.\n\nLast month, GM’s GM, -0.34% reached agreement after accidents involving Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions, among other compact cars, were cited in 13 deaths in the U.S. when a faulty ignition-switch shut off power to the vehicles. Earlier this year, Honda HMC, +0.10% also announced that it’s recalling more than 886,000 Odyssey minivans. Given the more serious nature of the General Motors recall, consumers are more likely to take action, says Jack Nerad, executive market analyst and editorial director at Kelley Blue Book.\n\nThe overall recall response rate hovers at around 70%, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but that doesn’t necessarily indicate completion of the recall. “They would like to boost that response percentage,” Nerad says. “If there are 1 million recalls and 30% of people aren’t responding, that’s still a big number.” And the longer the recall is delayed, the more likely such a situation could occur. “Some people take the attitude that if it’s sunny today, it’s never going to rain,” he says. “With wear and tear, older cars are more susceptible to something going wrong related to that flaw.”\n\nThere’s a financial cost to not responding to a recall notice. “If you ignore the recall completely and have a problem, it could be an issue for financial compensation,” says Patrick Regan, a civil trial attorney based in Washington, D.C., who also handles product liability cases against automobile manufacturers. The law might rule that the driver in question “assumed the risk” of the product, he adds. Used car owners who have not received a notification of the defect would have a stronger case, he says. With the breadth and age of the cars involved in the General Motors recall, he says, “these cars could have changed hands five times. If you don’t get the attention of owners right now, you may never get them.”\n\nBut the older the car, the less likely people will return it, according to a 2012 Society of Automotive Engineers report. Only 42% of people responded to recalls for 2000 models, versus 49% for 2001 models, it found. The rate of recalls steadily increased to 74% for 2004 models, 77% for 2007 models and 89% for 2009 models. One theory: drivers may believe that the longer they drive a car, the safer it is. But older cars are also sold on to third parties and, therefore, become difficult for auto makers to track. That said, owners of new and used cars can sign up for recall notifications by email at the NHTSA’s safety issue search site, says Heather Hunter, a spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association.\n\nAnd drivers do need a certain amount of cajoling, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers report. Automotive companies can boost the response rate with pre-calls to consumers followed up by a notice sent by FedEx (rather than ordinary 1st class or priority USPS mail), it found. Experiments with the color of print and size of envelope notifying people of the recall had negligible impact, “but automated pre-calls timed to occur 1 to 2 days prior to delivery of a paper notice were more effective than follow-up calls timed to occur after the mailings had been delivered,” the report concluded. The percentage of people who respond to auto recalls varies greatly between manufacturers and even different campaigns, says Joe Wiesenfelder, executive editor of auto news site Cars.com. “An automaker might claim 95% compliance on some recalls and, say, 50% on others,” he says. “But safety recalls definitely get higher numbers.”\n\nThis story has been updated from a previous version.\n\nOther articles by Quentin Fottrell:\n\n5 ways commuting is ruining your life\n\n3.5 million defective cars were sold online last year\n\n10 cars almost no women drive', 'The overall recall response rate hovers at around 70%, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but that doesn’t necessarily indicate completion of the recall.\n“If there are 1 million recalls and 30% of people aren’t responding, that’s still a big number.” And the longer the recall is delayed, the more likely such a situation could occur.\nUsed car owners who have not received a notification of the defect would have a stronger case, he says.\nThe rate of recalls steadily increased to 74% for 2004 models, 77% for 2007 models and 89% for 2009 models.\n“But safety recalls definitely get higher numbers.”This story has been updated from a previous version.']"

If the fuel pump is exposed to acidic chemicals or a high temperature environment, then the fuel pump strainer has the potential to crack.\n\nThose acidic chemicals are found in things that vehicles could easily encounter like fertilizer, dust control products, and even chemicals used in a car wash. Once the fuel pump strainer cracks, this may cause the smell of gasoline inside the van and might allow fuel to actually leak out.\n\nThe problem has been under study by Honda since October of 2012, but they were only able to confirm the cause on March 6th of this year. Although Honda has received 187 warranty claims as a result of this issue, no fires or injuries have been reported.\n\nDue to the huge number of affected vehicles, Honda doesn’t currently have enough replacement fuel pumps on hand to fix every vehicle affected by the recall and doesn’t expect to have enough until summer.

Such cracks “could lead to a fuel smell being present or to leaking fuel, increasing the risk of a fire.”\n\nHonda said it noticed a high demand of Odyssey fuel pump replacement parts in October 2012. After investigating the problem, Honda said the cause of the cracks was “prolonged exposure to acidic chemicals and a high temperature environment.” Fertilizer and dust control agents may be contributing factors, said Honda.\n\nThe automaker said it had received 187 warranty claims but no reports of any fires or injuries related to this issue.\n\nWhat Honda will do\n\nDue to the large number of affected vehicles in the recall, Honda will not have a sufficient supply of replacement covers in stock until this summer. Honda will notify owners with an initial letter beginning in April 2014 and will follow up with a second letter when the remedy is available.\n\nAny vehicles that are currently leaking from the fuel pump will get an original replacement cover.

The shares last touched $40 in July 2000.\n\nMicrosoft has had iPad and iPhone versions of Office primed for several months now, sources told Reuters, but the company has dallied on their release due to internal divisions, among other things.\n\nAnalysts said the lack of an Office version for the iPad may have robbed Microsoft of billions of dollars in revenue.

Here\'s what we know.\n\n\n\nWindows 8.1 Update 1: 10 Key Changes (Click image for larger view and slideshow.)\n\nA native version of Microsoft Office for iPads is the software equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster: rumored to exist, endlessly discussed, and stubbornly unrevealed. That could all change by the end of the month. According to multiple reports published late Monday, Microsoft will announce Office for iPad on March 27 at an event in San Francisco.\n\nWill the much-anticipated release live up the hype? Here\'s what we know so far about Microsoft Office for iPad.\n\n1. Office for iPad could be Satya Nadella\'s first major announcement as CEO.\n\nMicrosoft issued press invitations late Monday to a March 27 event at which new CEO Satya Nadella will deliver remarks ""related to the intersection of cloud and mobile."" Citing unnamed sources familiar with Microsoft\'s plans, Reuters, ZDNet, and The Verge each subsequently reported Office for iPad will debut at the event. A Microsoft representative told InformationWeek the company had no comment regarding the press conference\'s itinerary or forthcoming Office products.\n\n[Microsoft\'s own Surface 2 tablet is now LTE-ready. Read Microsoft Surface 2 With LTE: Winner For Mobile Pros?]\n\n2. Office for iPad could take cues from Office Mobile.\n\nOffice for iPad could resemble Office Mobile, according to The Verge. Office Mobile is already available for iPhones, Android smartphones, and Windows Phone devices, though only Windows handsets include the apps out-of-box, without an Office 365 subscription.\n\nOffice for iPads could resemble Office Mobile.\n\n3. Office for iPad will earn billions, but Microsoft might have already left billions more on the table.\n\nThe notion that Office for iPad will earn billions is virtually beyond dispute; a union between the world\'s most popular productivity software and most popular tablet carries obvious appeal. That said, iPad users have already grown accustomed to free Office competitors, including Google Docs and Apple\'s iWork suite. Office boasts richer tools than any alternatives, but on a tablet form factor, a deep list of features is arguably less important than the right interface.\n\nGartner analyst Michael Silver told InformationWeek in an interview last month that Microsoft cannot simply transfer Office\'s desktop experience to a tablet. ""To some extent, I need two applications for each [interface] I use: a touch-friendly one, and then a desktop one for more detailed work,"" he said.\n\nForrester analyst David Johnson agreed, pointing out that Office for iPad ""needs to be strong in a few areas. What it does, it needs to do great.""\n\nOffice remains the business standard, especially at larger corporations, and many enterprises will integrate Office for iPad because they\'ve already signed up for Office 365. These forces alone guarantee the product a certain amount of success. But whether Office can be a game changer on the iPad depends on whether Microsoft can appeal to people outside its core corporate audience.\n\n4. Office for iPad might require an Office 365 subscription.\n\nOffice for iPad might be available only with an Office 365 subscription, according to The Verge\'s sources. Last week\'s debut of Office 365 Personal triggered speculation that Office for iPad might be imminent, as the product announcement included ostensibly brand-agnostic references to tablet support. That speculation seems valid now, but it\'s still not clear if Microsoft also intends any standalone offerings.\n\n5. Office for iPad could negatively affect Windows tablets.\n\nConventional wisdom has held that Microsoft is withholding Office for iPad, which some industry watchers claim has been complete for some time, in order to boost prospects for Windows tablets. This perceived strategy hasn\'t yet paid off, however, as Windows slates claimed less than 3.5% of the market in 2013.

Bernstein Research analyst Mark Moerdler said that Apple AAPL, -0.09% has sold around 195 million iPads, and had an installed base of about 150 million of the tablets at the end of 2013. Moerdler estimates that if even 10% of the iPad installed base were to subscribe to Office, Microsoft could add around 15 million new subscribers and generate between $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion more in subscription revenue from Office every year.\n\nMicrosoft has been developing a version of Office for the iPad for at least a year, but has been hesitant to release it for fear that it would cannibalize the company’s own Windows franchise and tablet offerings, which already offer the software suite.\n\nRaimo Lenschow, an analyst with Barclays, said that Office for iPad “is something that many investors have wanted the company to embrace for a long time” because, in addition to giving a boost to Office revenue, it would also signal that Microsoft is moving towards a more serious strategy across multiple technology platforms.\n\n“It seems like it would be a change in tactics for the new CEO,” said Raimo Lenschow, of Barclays. “And Nadella wants to put people more towards adoption of cloud-services because he sees that as the future.”\n\nThe initial reaction among investors suggests that Lenschow is right about the market’s reaction toward Office on the iPad: Microsoft’s shares rose more than 4%, to a 52-week-high of $39.90 a share. Apple’s stock also rose by $2.77 a share to $529.54.\n\nMoerdler added that if Microsoft does announce Office for the iPad ahead of launching a new touch version of Office it will likely be doing so “to counter alternate word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software from Apple, Google, Evernote and others, [and] drive more users to Microsoft office 365 subscriptions.”\n\nOffice 365 is a subscription-based suite of software products such as Microsoft Word, as well as cloud-based storage, for consumers and businesses.\n\nMore tech news from MarketWatch:\n\nAmazon to ship video-streaming device in April\n\nWal-Mart looking for a cut of the used videogame business\n\nH-P seen gaining as IBM exits key market', 'SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Microsoft Corp. may soon be ready to fill a gaping hole in its product line that has been a common gripe of industry analysts for years: Releasing a version of its popular Office software suite for Apple Inc.’s iPad.\n“It is clearly a directional or strategic benefit to Microsoft that the company is moving Office beyond PCs and Windows to faster-growth platforms and cloud services,” said Nomura Research analyst Rick Sherlund, in a research note.\nThe potential for using Office to draw in customers that use the iPad is huge.\nMoerdler estimates that if even 10% of the iPad installed base were to subscribe to Office, Microsoft could add around 15 million new subscribers and generate between $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion more in subscription revenue from Office every year.\nMoerdler added that if Microsoft does announce Office for the iPad ahead of launching a new touch version of Office it will likely be doing so “to counter alternate word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software from Apple, Google, Evernote and others, [and] drive more users to Microsoft office 365 subscriptions.”Office 365 is a subscription-based suite of software products such as Microsoft Word, as well as cloud-based storage, for consumers and businesses.']"

Well, rumour has it that new CEO Satya Nadella wants to unveil the new Microsoft Office for the iPad. Writers and freelance layabouts in cafes rejoice!\n\nIf it happens, it puts an end to Microsoft’s long and involved iPad snub.

Analysts estimate that Microsoft leaves $2.5 billion in revenue on the table by keeping Office off of the iPad, which has sold nearly 200 million units.\n\nMust Read: Warren Buffett\'s 10 Favorite Stocks\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.\n\nTheStreet Ratings team rates MICROSOFT CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of A-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n""We rate MICROSOFT CORP (MSFT) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, attractive valuation levels and solid stock price performance. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nMSFT\'s revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 10.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 14.3%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company\'s bottom line, improving the earnings per share.\n\nAlthough MSFT\'s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.27 is very low, it is currently higher than that of the industry average. Along with this, the company maintains a quick ratio of 2.96, which clearly demonstrates the ability to cover short-term cash needs.\n\nCurrent return on equity exceeded its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of strength within the company. Compared to other companies in the Software industry and the overall market, MICROSOFT CORP\'s return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.\n\nInvestors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company\'s shares by a sharp 35.73% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index. Regarding the stock\'s future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, MSFT should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.\n\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: MSFT Ratings Report\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

18398,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/18/will-anyone-pay-for-a-tablet-version-of-microsoft.aspx,technology,"['Just a few years ago paying for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office was a required part of buying a computer. Almost everyone who owned a PC (or a Mac) needed a word processor (Microsoft Word) and anyone using their computer for work likely needed Excel for spreadsheets, PowerPoint for presentations, and Outlook for email.\n\nYes, there have long been alternatives to Office but they tended to be used either by the cheap (""I write all my reports in Notepad"") and the type of folks who know how to install Linux on an old PC (""I\'ve been using OpenOffice since it was in beta""). The rise of the tablet however has helped an entire generation break the Office habit and Microsoft is finally poised to attempt to win them back.\n\nWhat is Microsoft doing to win back Office market share?\n\nMicrosoft barely has a toehold in the tablet market and while its own Surface and some other Windows 8 tablets come pre-installed with Office, those running Google\'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple\'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS do not. That has allowed millions of tablet users to learn that there are alternatives. The chart below shows just how few tablet users are on Windows-based devices.\n\nTo win these users back, Microsoft is going to start offering its online version of Office in an individual version dubbed Office 365 Personal for $69.99 a year. Office 365 offers all the Office programs and works on any device with an Internet connection.\n\n""Coming this Spring, Office 365 Personal is a new, great option for people interested in using Office 365. It\'s designed for an individual, allows for one PC or Mac and one tablet to be connected to the service,"" the company wrote on its Office blog.\n\nMicrosoft also has a full-fledged version of Office ready for iPad and iPhones, Reuters reported, but has not announced a release date.\n\n""We have some pretty exciting plans,"" John Case, the top Office marketing executive, told Reuters without giving any details. ""Certainly, interest in Office on the iPad is extreme. When they [customers] want to do real work, they are going to want to use Office.""\n\nWhat happened to Microsoft\'s Office monopoly?\n\nDigs from Microsoft executives aside, people have found ways to ""do real work"" without using Office.\n\nBack before tablets Windows ruled the operating system world and Microsoft had almost the entire market wrapped up. Since Windows came with your computer (and only the techiest of techies knew there were alternatives) it was easy for Microsoft\'s partners (the companies that actually made the PCs) to either pre-install Office and include it in the price of of the computer or have a trial addition loaded onto the desktop. Even the people who chose to use an Apple computer pretty much had to pay to install Office on it because it was the standard for doing business.\n\nThat changed with the advent of the tablet -- a market Microsoft seemed to mostly ignore. In 2014 and 2015 Gartner reports that tablet sales will continue to grow while traditional PCs continue to fall.\n\nWorldwide Device Shipments by Segment (Thousands of Units)\n\nDevice Type 2012 2013 2014 2015 PC (Desk-Based and Notebook) 341,273 299,342 277,939 268,491 Tablet (Ultramobile) 119,529 179,531 263,450 324,565 Mobile Phone 1,746,177 1,804,334 1,893,425 1,964,788 Other Ultramobiles 9,344 17,195 39,636 63,835 Total 2,216,322 2,300,402 2,474,451 2,621,678\n\n""Users continue to move away from the traditional PC (notebooks and desk-based) as it becomes more of a shared content creation tool, while the greater flexibility of tablets, hybrids and lighter notebooks address users\' increasingly different demands,"" said Gartner Research Director Ranjit Atwal.\n\nHow much money is Microsoft losing?\n\nOffice still has a lot of users and makes plenty of money for Microsoft. The product is part of the Microsoft Business Division, which includes Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, Yammer, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, and Office 365. That division brought in $24,738 million in 2013, $24,082 million in 2014, and $22,407 million in 2012, according to the company\'s 2013 annual report.\n\nObviously those are hefty numbers. But by not serving the tablet market, Microsoft left a lot of money on the table.\n\nAccording to one analyst, Reuters reported, Microsoft is giving up $2.5 billion a year in revenue by keeping Office off the iPad.\n\n""Office is being disenfranchised on the hottest growth platforms,"" Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund wrote in a note to clients. ""Maybe it is time to focus on Office independent of Windows.""\n\nCan Microsoft Office win users back?\n\nMicrosoft has lost some Office users and they are never coming back. The youngest generation of tablet users may not even know what they are missing -- they didn\'t begrudgingly find Office replacements once they got tablets, they had never used Office in the first place. It\'s hard to imagine that those users would pay for access to programs that do things they have found other free ways to do.\n\nAll is not lost for Microsoft as Office is still the standard program for business. While Google\'s free online apps can mimic Office and OpenOffice is a reasonable free software-based option, neither of those packages is a direct clone. There are countless people using Office at work or school that -- for a reasonable fee -- would be willing to install it on their tablets.\n\nStill while $69.99 a year may not be high for a high-powered businessman, it seems a little rich for tablet users accustomed to paying a dollar or two for an app. To reach those users -- the bulk of the non-Office generation -- Microsoft will have to either lower the price or offer a free ad-supported version Office.', 'To win these users back, Microsoft is going to start offering its online version of Office in an individual version dubbed Office 365 Personal for $69.99 a year.\nOffice 365 offers all the Office programs and works on any device with an Internet connection.\n""Coming this Spring, Office 365 Personal is a new, great option for people interested in using Office 365.\nThe product is part of the Microsoft Business Division, which includes Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Lync, Yammer, Microsoft Dynamics business solutions, and Office 365.\nBut by not serving the tablet market, Microsoft left a lot of money on the table.']"

Topic? “News related to the intersection of cloud and mobile.”\n\nThe timing is interesting. The coming-out party is taking place the week before Microsoft’s Build Conference, also in San Francisco, but a day after planned Google(s goog) and AWS(s amzn) cloud events in that city that are drawing reporters from around the country.\n\nReports of this project have circulated for at least two years. Given that Apple(s aapl) schooled Microsoft on tablets with the wildly popular iPad, though — and Microsoft’s former CEO Steve Ballmer once pretended to stomp an iPhone to death on stage and told reporters he would not allow his children to use Macs or iPhones — support for the rival platform was clearly a risky position to take internally. Up till now, anyway.\n\nThis looks to be the beginning of a bigger cross-platform mobile push for Microsoft. CRN reported Monday that Microsoft is in talks to acquire Xamarin, a San Francisco company with technology that enables developers to write iOS or Android code using Microsoft tools.\n\nIn a research note, Nomura Securities analyst Rick Sherlund, said this is pretty much all good for Microsoft. While most iPad or Android tablet users are happy with the lightweight apps that run on those devices — Evernote et al. — many are also professionals who rely on business apps, particularly spreadsheets — where Microsoft Excel still rules. Office for iPad — and then probably Android — could keep those users on the reservation — and give them a reason to re-up their enterprise licenses.\n\nSherlund wrote:\n\n“To put this in perspective, it is clearly a directional or strategic benefit to Microsoft that the company is moving Office beyond PCs and Windows to faster growth platforms and cloud services.”\n\nTo be fair, Microsoft was already pushing pen-enabled tablets well before the iPad debuted in 2010. Former top exec Jeff Raikes was toting tablets years before he left the company in 2008. But those systems never took hold the way iPad did.\n\nOffice, which runs on Windows and Mac OS, has long dominated the market for desktop productivity applications — spreadsheets, word processing, presentations — but faces heated competition from Google Apps.\n\nNote: This story was updated at 8:50 a.m. PDT to include analyst quotes and again noting Microsoft’s interest in Xamarin.', 'Microsoft(s msft) plans to officially launch the long-awaited version of Office for iPad next week in San Francisco, sources confirmed Tuesday morning.\nOn Monday, Microsoft notified reporters of an event to be hosted by new CEO Satya Nadella in San Francisco March 27.\nCRN reported Monday that Microsoft is in talks to acquire Xamarin, a San Francisco company with technology that enables developers to write iOS or Android code using Microsoft tools.\nWhile most iPad or Android tablet users are happy with the lightweight apps that run on those devices — Evernote et al.\nOffice for iPad — and then probably Android — could keep those users on the reservation — and give them a reason to re-up their enterprise licenses.']"

Satya Nadella has scheduled a press conference in San Francisco on that date, promising an update on Microsoft\'s ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy, and everybody and their brother in the tech press is now claiming Nadella will use the event as an opportunity to unveil Office for iPad.\n\nIf true, the event will be mostly notable for the fact that it precedes any announcements about a Metro Office. Over its long history, Microsoft has released several products for Apple\'s platforms before releasing them for Windows, but this switcheroo would mark a seismic change in the way Microsoft has long used Office to sell Windows.\n\nI, for one, think that\'s great news -- it means Microsoft is waking up to the realities of the post-PC marketplace. But one nagging detail has me worried. Both Warren and Foley (and the hundreds of copy-and-paste folks who have echoed their words) say that ""the iPad variant of Office will be similar to the iPhone version.""\n\nWhen I first read the pronouncement, I had to go back and read it again. Surely they must have that part wrong.\n\nPorting Office for iPhone (more correctly known as Office Mobile for iPhone) over to the iPad should be a relatively quick and easy job; most iPhone apps move to iPad without much hassle. But surely Microsoft wouldn\'t release another version of Office similar to the one that InfoWorld\'s Galen Gruman calls ""pathetically bad,"" would it?\n\nOffice for iPhone right now doesn\'t come close to any of the major office productivity apps on iPhone or iPad, and it makes a mockery of Office in general. Here are the high points, from Gruman:\n\nWord: No ability to apply styles, no search and replace, no track changes, no numbered or bulleted lists, no graphics\n\nExcel: No cell allignment or merge, no graphics\n\nPowerPoint: No edit in place, no layouts or graphics, no new slideshows (only editing)\n\nThere\'s no printing in any of the applications, either. The worst part is that many simple, straightforward, legit Office documents can\'t be edited in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. Office for iPhone simply says it can\'t edit them -- and gives zero explanation for why.\n\nPerhaps Microsoft will announce a new version of Office Mobile, with many of those gaps plugged, and that new version of Office Mobile will include iPad support?\n\nPlease tell me that\'s the case. Many customers wouldn\'t mind paying for Office 365 to get Office for iPad.

The company has sent out invitations to bloggers and journalists for an event scheduled for the same day at San Francisco. This event would also be the first press meet that would be hosted by Microsoft’s new CEO Satya Nadella. The event is said to be centered on Microsoft’s cloud and mobile products, hence the rumor about the possibility of the debut of Microsoft Office for iPad there.\n\nThe Verge adds that the design and the UI of Office for iPad would be similar to that of the current version that is available for the iPhone. Users would require an Office 365 subscription in order to edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. The software would offer full support for document creation and editing as well. Microsoft has in the past said that they would release the app only when it made some economic sense for them. A major roadblock for Microsoft in the case of Office for iPad was Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines which as the Liveside reports, “don’t appear to allow Microsoft to upsell Office or even OneDrive without cutting Apple in on their 30 percent.” What this basically means is that Microsoft would not be able to let users upgrade to a higher version of the software using its own resources. All upgrades and updates and not to mention, payments would need to be processed using Apple’s infrastructure, for an App to be approved.\n\nAs seen on other mobile versions of Microsoft Office,the version for iPad too is likely to get only Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote as its components. OneNote is already available as a standalone application, though.\n\nAccording to Marie Jo Foley of CNET, Microsoft is likely to include a single license for the tablet version with its recently introduced Office 365 “personal” subscription. This can be used along with one PC or a Mac, depending on what machine you have. She adds that the iPad version of Office might just be a precursor to a touch optimized version of the software that would land for Windows 8.1 and Windows RT tablets. These devices currently ship with a full-fledged desktop version of the software that is better used with a mouse and a keyboard.\n\nAnyway, it would be only until March 27 that we would eventually find out if Microsoft does go ahead and releases Microsoft Office for iPad at the event!', 'Microsoft is all set to officially launch its much talked about Microsoft Office for iPad suite on March 27, reports The Verge.\nThe event is said to be centered on Microsoft’s cloud and mobile products, hence the rumor about the possibility of the debut of Microsoft Office for iPad there.\nAs seen on other mobile versions of Microsoft Office,the version for iPad too is likely to get only Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote as its components.\nShe adds that the iPad version of Office might just be a precursor to a touch optimized version of the software that would land for Windows 8.1 and Windows RT tablets.\nAnyway, it would be only until March 27 that we would eventually find out if Microsoft does go ahead and releases Microsoft Office for iPad at the event!']"
