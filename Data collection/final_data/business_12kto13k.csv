""Now it may not last, and these investors may be gone.""The need probably does exist to convert owner-occupied homes to rental homes, ""because that seems to be a trend,"" Shiller said.""But the problem is that it\'s not typically a great business to do that unless you can get a good price on the house, because it\'s expensive to convert and to maintain disbursed family homes.

Economists rushed this morning to say the results do not mean there is a housing bubble and it is popping. Actually, they say, the opposite is true.\n\nMonth-on-month, U.S. home prices inched down 0.1% in January, matching expectations and after dipping 0.1% in the preceding month. Fully 12 of 20 tracked cities posting drops.\n\nYear-over-year, prices increased 13.24%, a drop from the December year-over-year gain of 13.38%, indicating a general slowing of home price appreciation.\n\n""You may not realize it given the eye-popping levels, but today’s Case-Shiller numbers actually do represent a bit of moderation for the venerable index. The real pace of gains is probably really half that being reported, but the big picture remains the same: the housing market is doing quite well,” said Zillow (Z) chief economist Stan Humphries. “We remain far from normal in terms of appreciation rates, negative equity rates and mortgage rates, but we’re getting there, and a slowdown in appreciation is welcome. As the busy spring home shopping season ramps up, potential buyers and sellers each have some things to look forward to. Buyers can generally expect a lot less competition from investors armed with cash offers, and modestly more homes to choose from; while sellers can still enjoy market dynamics tilted more towards them than to buyers.""\n\nIn a separate report with more adjusted numbers, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said that prices rose 0.5% in January. The FHFA home price data is based on mortgages sold or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, not broader sales.\n\n“Home values increased significantly last year, up 20% or more in Southern California and Las Vegas. Las Vegas and San Francisco still have gains over 20% from the past year, and San Diego prices are going up. But in general, price increases continued to slow down in January,"" said David Williams, vice president at RightStart Mortgage, based in Pasadena, Calif. ""It doesn’t necessarily hurt the market that price growth slows down. We’re still seeing some improvement, which shows a healthy market.The problem now is affordability for first-time homebuyers.""\n\nMonday, Black Knight Financial Services offered its own breakdown of cities with the biggest gains and losses in home prices, close to being in line with the Case-Shiller index.\n\n“Although most analysts do not expect the same rapid increases we saw last year, the consensus is for moderating gains,” David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee, said.\n\n""The housing recovery may have taken a breather due to the cold weather,"" Blitzer said. ""From the bottom in 2012, prices are up 23% and the housing market is showing signs of moving forward with more normal price increases.""\n\nIncluding this month’s data, home prices clocked in at about 20% below the 2006 peak.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors reported March 20 that existing home sales slowed in February to the slowest rate since July 2012.\n\n""Expectations and recent data point to continued home price gains for 2014. Although most analysts do not expect the same rapid increases we saw last year, the consensus is for moderating gains,"" the report states.\n\nThe Sunbelt showed the five highest monthly returns. Las Vegas saw an increase of 1.1% — attributable to a big bounce effect. Miami was up 0.7%.\n\nSan Diego saw its best gain since 2004, up 0.6%, while East Coast metros like New York and Washington, D.C. posted their own highest year-over-year gain since the housing peak in 2006.\n\n“Institutional investors and all-cash buyers aren’t finding the same deals that were around last year,"" Williams said. ""Also, home prices after the New Year are historically lower than most months due to the hangover effect of holiday spending. The demand isn’t there. Potential homebuyers will start working on their taxes to determine their financial status before looking for a new home. Then there’s the snow that hit the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, primarily on weekends, which didn’t help. The Midwest had a lot of snow, too. As for West Coast states, we’ll have to wait and see. The weather wasn’t as much of a problem as the fact that unemployment is still high among people who have reached the age of your typical first-time homebuyer.”', 'Home prices declined in January for the third straight month, slowing the pace of year-over-year appreciation, according to the key 20-city S&P/Case-Shiller survey of home prices.\nMonth-on-month, U.S. home prices inched down 0.1% in January, matching expectations and after dipping 0.1% in the preceding month.\nYear-over-year, prices increased 13.24%, a drop from the December year-over-year gain of 13.38%, indicating a general slowing of home price appreciation.\n""Expectations and recent data point to continued home price gains for 2014.\nLas Vegas saw an increase of 1.1% — attributable to a big bounce effect.']"

Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. ‘Twelve cities reported declining prices in January versus December; eight of those were worse than the month before. From the bottom in 2012, prices are up 23 percent, and the housing market is showing signs of moving forward with more normal price increases.’\n\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller HPI's 20-City Composite posted its third consecutive monthly decline of 0.1%.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, the 10-City and 20-City Composites were up 13.5% and 13.2%, respectively, compared to January 2013.\n\nLas Vegas saw the biggest month-over-month increase in home prices in January, at 1.1%, its 22nd consecutive monthly gain. Despite this, the city is still the farthest from its high set in August 2006 with a peak-to-current decline of 45%.\n\nMeanwhile, Dallas and Denver are now less than 1% away from their recent all-time index highs.\n\n‘The Sun Belt showed the five highest monthly returns,’ Blitzer says. ‘Las Vegas was the leader with an increase of 1.1 percent followed by Miami at 0.7%. San Diego showed its best January performance of 0.6 percent since 2004. San Francisco and Tampa trailed closely at 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent. Elsewhere, New York and Washington, D.C., stood out as they continued to improve and posted their highest year-over-year returns since 2006. Dallas and Denver are the only cities to have reached new record peaks, while Detroit remains the only city with home prices below those of 14 years ago.’\n\nBlitzer adds, ‘Although most analysts do not expect the same rapid increases we saw last year, the consensus is for moderating gains. Existing-home sales declined slightly in February and are at their lowest level since July 2012.’\n\nLas Vegas and San Francisco remain the only two cities posting annual gains of more than 20%. San Diego showed the most improvement with a year-over-year return of 19.4% in January, up from 18% in December. Phoenix saw its annual rate decelerate the most; the city's return peaked last January when it led all 20 cities by a wide margin.\n\nOnly seven of the 20 cities measured in the index – Las Vegas, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Tampa and Washington – showed positive monthly returns in January. Chicago and Seattle declined the most and posted their fourth consecutive drop in average home prices. Although Cleveland continued its decline, it showed the most improvement, with home prices dropping 0.3% in January compared to December.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA) House Price Index, which uses a different methodology, shows that home prices inched up 0.5% in January, compared to December, on a seasonally adjusted basis. That index shows that home prices have increased for 23 of the past 24 months, beginning with February 2012. The November 2013 HPI was the exception, with a decrease of 0.1%.\n\nThe FHFA notes that it revised downward its home price data for December – from an increase of 0.8% to an increase of 0.7%.\n\nThe FHFA HPI is calculated using home sales price information from mortgages either sold to or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, house prices were up 7.4%, compared to January 2013, according to the FHFA HPI.\n\nHome prices as of January were about 8% below their April 2007 peak and were roughly the same as the May 2005 index level.\n\nThe FHFA HPI also shows that home price appreciation was spotty in January, with some regions showing declines while others saw only slight increases. For example, the West South Central division saw home prices drop 0.3%, compared to December, while the Middle Atlantic division saw home prices increase 1.3%.\n\nLooking at home price appreciation on a year-over-year basis, all regions experienced increases, but the degree of recovery varies widely. For example, the Middle Atlantic division saw year-over-year home prices increase 3.2% while the Pacific division saw prices increase 14%.\n\nYesterday, Black Knight Financial Services released its monthly HPI report, also showing that home prices were flat in January compared to December.\n\nWhat's more, CoreLogic's HPI report for January, which was released earlier this month, shows that home prices increased 0.9%, compared to December – however, this includes distressed sales.\n\nAll four reports use different methodologies to arrive at their findings."", 'U.S. home prices inched up by only 0.1% in January compared to December and, in fact, actually went down in some markets, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index (HPI).\nLas Vegas saw the biggest month-over-month increase in home prices in January, at 1.1%, its 22nd consecutive monthly gain.\nAlthough Cleveland continued its decline, it showed the most improvement, with home prices dropping 0.3% in January compared to December.\nFor example, the West South Central division saw home prices drop 0.3%, compared to December, while the Middle Atlantic division saw home prices increase 1.3%.\nFor example, the Middle Atlantic division saw year-over-year home prices increase 3.2% while the Pacific division saw prices increase 14%.']"

Consumer advocates have long complained that the fees on these loans are exorbitant. The typical fee is $15 per $100 borrowed, which translates into an annual percentage rate of about 390 percent. Even so, an estimated 12 million Americans now use such loans, the CFPB says.\n\nThe CFPB looked at the one-year activity of borrowers taking out more than 12 million loans from storefront payday lenders in 30 states in recent years.\n\nThe CFPB doesn\'t break out borrowers by age. However, it said that 1 out of 5 borrowers paid on a monthly basis - a sign that they receive Social Security or other government benefits - and remained in debt for the entire year studied.\n\nElizabeth Costle, director of consumer and state affairs for the AARP Public Policy Institute, says payday lenders tend to like older consumers on Social Security because of the steady income stream.\n\n""The problem is most people can\'t pay them off in two weeks or a month,"" Costle says.

Yet, payday lenders defend these loans as a source of emergency cash for consumers who are unable to secure more favorable credit products.\n\nRelated: Americans in love-hate relationship with payday loans\n\nThe problem is that borrowers often can\'t afford to pay off the first loan, forcing them to roll over their debt and even take out a new, sometimes larger loan so they can pay off the original debt. The CFPB found that more than 80% of all payday loans are rolled over or renewed within two weeks.\n\n""This renewing of loans can put consumers on a slippery slope toward a debt trap in which they cannot get ahead of the money they owe,"" CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement.\n\nThe agency has been cracking down on payday lenders since 2012 and considering possible new lending rules for the industry.\n\nNot all payday borrowers get trapped in a cycle of debt, however. When looking solely at initial loans -- meaning those that aren\'t taken out within 14 days of a previous loan -- the CFPB found that nearly half of borrowers were able to repay with no more than one renewal.\n\nRelated: Debt collection horror stories\n\nBut for those who aren\'t able to pay off the loans quickly, it can be difficult to get out from under the debt. The CFPB has heard from thousands of struggling consumers since it began accepting payday loan complaints last fall.\n\nFor example, one Pennsylvania woman who took out a total of $800 in payday loans to help pay for rent after losing her job told the CFPB that she meant for the loan to be only short-term. But after rolling over her first loan and eventually taking out another one to help pay for it, she has already paid more than $1,400 towards the debt and still owes more.\n\nMany payday borrowers live on fixed monthly incomes, such as retirees or disabled Americans receiving Social Security disability benefits. Of those payday borrowers receiving monthly payments, the study found that one out of five borrowed money every single month of the year.\n\n""These kinds of stories are heartbreaking and they are happening all across the country,"" Cordray said in a prepared statement.

More than 80% of payday loans are rolled over or renewed within two weeks regardless of state restrictions.\n\nWith a typical payday fee of 15% rolling over and renewing loans significantly increases the amount a borrower owes.

Only 15% of borrowers were able to repay their debt when it was due without re-borrowing. However, 48% of initial payday loans were able to be repaid with no more than one renewal.\n\n“We are concerned that too many borrowers slide into the debt traps that payday loans can become,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a news release. “As we work to bring needed reforms to the payday market, we want to ensure consumers have access to small-dollar loans that help them get ahead, not push them farther behind.”\n\nThe new report not only provides startling numbers regarding consumers caught in the payday loan debt trap, it also confirms many of the concerns consumer advocates have recently voiced. The report found that states with cooling off periods, a time frame in which a borrower can not take out another payday loan, have renewal rates nearly identical to states without limitations.\n\nThe finding seems to support consumer advocates claims cooling off periods do nothing to stop the payday loan debt trap. For years, consumer advocates have been calling on federal regulators to rein in payday lenders. While many states have created their own restriction, many even prohibiting the lending practice, federal regulators have thus far done little to provide meaningful protection to consumers when it comes to traditional payday lending.\n\nHowever, earlier this year new federal banking regulations went into effect that essentially caused banks like Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank to discontinue their payday loan-like direct deposit advance programs.\n\nAfter the banks announced the discontinuation of deposit advance programs the National Consumer Law Center urged them to follow certain criteria, including capping the annual percentage rate at no more than 36%, when considering new small loan programs for consumers.\n\nOne alternative currently being explored involves the United States Postal Service entering the financial services arena. Sen. Elizabeth Warren even endorsed the idea of allowing the USPS to extend basic banking needs to consumers.\n\nThe CFPB will discuss their findings during a payday loan field hearing in Nashville, TN, this afternoon.\n\nCFPB Finds Four Out Of Five Payday Loans Are Rolled Over Or Renewed [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]', 'A CFPB report “CFPB Data Point: Payday Lending” [PDF], a continuation of the payday loan investigation it began in 2013, details how the predatory practice of payday lending grips consumers who stand little chance of breaking free.\nMore than 80% of payday loans are rolled over or renewed within two weeks regardless of state restrictions.\nMore than 60% of payday loans are made to borrowers who take out seven or more loans in a row.\nHowever, 48% of initial payday loans were able to be repaid with no more than one renewal.\nThe finding seems to support consumer advocates claims cooling off periods do nothing to stop the payday loan debt trap.']"

As for the economy\'s future, 38% say it\'s getting better, while 56% say things are getting worse, for an economic outlook score of -18 -- the same as the previous week\'s score.\n\nThe recent slight dip in the overall index is attributable to losses in the outlook component since early June, while consumer attitudes about current economic conditions have held steady. This punctuates the pattern seen throughout 2014, with consumers\' perceptions of the current state of the economy inching higher -- now up five points from -18 at the start of January -- while their outlook for the economy has gone in the other direction -- falling 10 points from -8.\n\nSteady, but gloomy\n\nConsumers\' overall confidence in the economy has been relatively steady all year, and that has continued over the last three weeks, with confidence consistently at -16. This stability, however, masks the good news that perceptions of current conditions have improved, and are now approaching their highest level in five years. However, pessimism about the economy\'s direction is mounting, and is keeping the overall index from climbing any higher.\n\nEven last week\'s promising jobs report and stock market highs couldn\'t lift consumers\' confidence, suggesting stability may be in the forecast for the foreseeable future.

CFPB Director Richard Cordray noted at the hearing that his group is in the “late stages” of formulating new rules for short-term loans.\n\nThe extensive report released today is based on data from a 12-month period with more than 12 million storefront payday loans. It is a continuation of the work in last year’s CFPB report on Payday Loans and Deposit Advance Products, one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken on the market.\n\nResearchers found that a primary driver of the cost of payday loans is that consumers may roll over the loans or engage in re-borrowing within a short window of time after repaying their first loan. The study looks at not only the initial loans but also loans taken out within 14 days of paying off the old loans; it considers these subsequent loans to be renewals and part of the same “loan sequence.”\n\nBy focusing on payday loan renewals, the study found that a large share of consumers end up in cycles of repeated borrowing and incur significant costs over time. Specifically, the study found:\n\nFour out of five payday loans are rolled over or renewed\n\nThree out of five payday loans are made to borrowers whose fee expenses exceed amount borrowed\n\nOne out of five new payday loans end up costing the borrower more than the amount borrowed\n\nFour out of five payday borrowers either default or renew a payday loan over the course of a year\n\nFour out of five payday borrowers who renew end up borrowing the same amount or more\n\nOne out of five payday borrowers on monthly benefits trapped in debt\n\nAt a field hearing held Tuesday at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Cordray hinted that new rule proposals for the payday lending market could be coming soon.\n\n“As we look ahead to our next steps, I will frankly say that we are now in the late stages of our considerations about how we can formulate new rules to bring needed reforms to this market,” said Cordray in prepared remarks. “We continue to grapple with all aspects of these issues. We have always acknowledged that the American consumer has shown a clear and steady demand for small-dollar credit products, which can be helpful for the consumers who use them on an occasional basis and can manage to repay them without becoming mired in a prolonged and costly struggle. So we intend to make sure that consumers who can afford to take out small-dollar loans can get the credit they need without jeopardizing or undermining their financial futures.”\n\nWhile the report did not specifically mention debt collection tactics used by either payday lenders or third party ARM firms, Cordray made extensive note of debt collection matters in his speech.\n\n“Our examinations also show that a troubling number of these companies engage in collection activities that may be unfair or deceptive in one or more ways,” said Cordray. “The same is true for debt collectors that work for payday lenders and that may fail to honor the protections that are afforded to consumers through the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. As we uncover these problems, we are taking actions that require firms to comply with the law by changing their practices and to make consumers whole for any harm they have suffered as a result of legal violations.”', 'The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Tuesday released a research report on payday lending and presented some of the findings at a field hearing in Nashville.\nCFPB Director Richard Cordray noted at the hearing that his group is in the “late stages” of formulating new rules for short-term loans.\nThe extensive report released today is based on data from a 12-month period with more than 12 million storefront payday loans.\nIt is a continuation of the work in last year’s CFPB report on Payday Loans and Deposit Advance Products, one of the most comprehensive studies ever undertaken on the market.\nResearchers found that a primary driver of the cost of payday loans is that consumers may roll over the loans or engage in re-borrowing within a short window of time after repaying their first loan.']"

They often are made to borrowers with weak credit or low incomes, and the storefront businesses often are located near military bases. The equivalent annual interest rates run to three digits.\n\nHere\'s how the loans work: Say you need money today, but payday is a week or two away. You write a check dated for your payday and give it to the lender. You get your money, minus the interest fee. In two weeks, the lender cashes your check or charges you more interest to extend, or ""roll over,"" the loan for another two weeks.\n\nGary Schatsky, a New York City financial planner and president of ObjectiveAdvice.com, says, ""This stuff gets me crazy — preying on folks who can\'t afford it.\n\n""Payday loans are probably one of the best examples of people being taken advantage of or wasting their money. Unfortunately, the people who take them out are either uneducated about finance or think they have no other options.\n\n""They think it\'s a simple fix, but as with many simple fixes, they are often extremely expensive and ill advised.""\n\nSchatsky suggests that people who are desperate for money should wait on purchases until their next paycheck, get a loan from a friend or even borrow on their credit card. ""The sad reality is, as bad as it is, even borrowing on a credit card is probably better than getting a payday loan. It will probably end up being cheaper than what a payday loan charges.""\n\nMark Fried, president of TFG Wealth Management in Newtown, Pa., says these latest findings are ""very concerning. If a person ends up paying as much for the loan in fees that was borrowed — how can they possibly save for retirement or their children\'s education or raising themselves up to a higher standard of living.""\n\nHe says these findings ""should concern regulators, both federal and state, along with consumer protection advocates.""\n\nThe new report, designed to educate regulators and the public about the payday lending market, was based on data from a 12-month period with more than about 12 million payday loans.

In the ‘90s it was village center developments. Now, real estate developers are eyeing the older, rundown areas of urban centers for residential and commercial redevelopment.\n\nThere are already plenty of examples. Areas of Brooklyn and Detroit are now flourishing with stylish residences and exciting new businesses. When publications like USA Today feature the best up-and-coming neighborhoods in America, they almost always are made up of urban enclaves that have been transformed.\n\nThey all seem to have something else in common. Residents can easily get around on foot. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) says buyers put a premium on “walkable” neighborhoods.\n\nCreating walkability\n\n“Creating walkability with restaurants and stores can help transition an edgy part of town into one that is hip and hopping with pedestrians,” said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. “This type of real estate development transforms the community for the better.”\n\nOlder, renovated homes and lofts are highly sought-after and don’t linger on the market. People seem to like the idea of walking to a nearby restaurant, movie theater or the corner market.\n\nCity governments like it too. NAR says walkable communities generate four times the tax revenue of regional and business malls, adding more value to a region.\n\n“Walkable urban regions in the U.S. have a 41% higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over non-walkable regions,” said Christopher Leinberger, professor at George Washington University School of Business and president of Locus, a national coalition of real estate developers and investors. “That’s the difference between countries like Germany and Romania.”\n\nLiving in an urban walkable community might also be more affordable than living in the suburbs. NAR cites statistics showing urban residents spend about 43% of their incomes on housing and transportation while the typical suburbanite spends about 48%.\n\n“If a family can get rid of one car, they can increase their mortgage capacity by as much as $150,000,” said Leinberger.\n\nZoning issues\n\nAt a recent NAR-sponsored symposium, panelists suggested urban redevelopment could occur at a faster rate if more municipalities reviewed their zoning regulations and worked with developers toward a common goal.\n\nEarlier this month researchers at the University of Chicago and University of California Berkley found tight land use regulations tended to drive up home prices in America’s most expensive cities. Rolling back some of these regulations in just 3 metros – San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., and New York would boost U.S. economic growth, the researchers said.\n\n“We’ve been bumping along at 2% GDP growth, and we should be at 3.5%, and obsolete zoning is what is holding us back,” said Leinberger. “Less than 10% of land would need to be rezoned, and that is where 80 percent of the development is going to go.”', 'In the 1970s the hot real estate trend was planned communities.\nNow, real estate developers are eyeing the older, rundown areas of urban centers for residential and commercial redevelopment.\n“This type of real estate development transforms the community for the better.”Older, renovated homes and lofts are highly sought-after and don’t linger on the market.\n“That’s the difference between countries like Germany and Romania.”Living in an urban walkable community might also be more affordable than living in the suburbs.\nNAR cites statistics showing urban residents spend about 43% of their incomes on housing and transportation while the typical suburbanite spends about 48%.']"

At least, not without taking out another loan.\n\nThe study, Cordray said, confirms “that all too often … the consumer ends up being hurt rather than helped by this extremely high-cost loan product.”\n\nThe bureau looked at 12 million loans issued by lenders in 30 states, including Ohio.\n\nIt found:\n\n* 80 percent of payday customers rolled over loans or took out new loans within 14 days – a figure that held true even in states that instituted cooling-off periods.\n\n* Most debtors re-borrow many times. More than 60 percent of borrowers in a given year get sucked into a cycle of seven or more loans, and fully half will take out at least 10 loans.\n\n* Monthly borrowers – largely people whose income is from Social Security – struggled more than most. Twenty-two percent of monthly borrowers remained in debt for an entire year.\n\nSo much for payday loans being a quick fix for people in a cash crunch.\n\nConsumers advocates have long contended these are dangerous loans, but previous studies by consumer groups and foundations have largely relied on surveys or on data released by the states that collect payday lending statistics.\n\nThe CFPB used data from payday lenders’ own books. Individual consumers were assigned ID numbers so the bureau could track cyclical borrowing, while the individual borrowers remained anonymous.\n\nTrimming out people who defaulted, only 15 percent of borrowers were able to repay their initial loans without borrowing again within two weeks, the bureau found.\n\nThey’re not re-borrowing so fast because they like payday loans.\n\nThey’re re-borrowing because paying fees seems more doable in the short term than making the balloon principal payment, which typically comes due when they get their next paycheck.\n\nHow do we know?\n\nThe CFPB compared the loan principal between repeat borrowers’ first and last loans and found it stayed the same or grew.\n\nEssentially, borrowers take out the same amount again and again, incurring new fees each time.\n\n“The stress of having to re-borrow the same dollars after already paying substantial fees is a heavy yoke that impairs a consumer’s financial freedom,” Cordray said.\n\nThe CFPB’s determination to act should be a relief to Ohioans, who are waiting for the state Supreme Court to decide whether payday lenders can continue to ignore payday curbs, including interest rate caps, that voters instituted way back in 2008.\n\nThe real question is whether any regulations the CFPB would issue would be expansive enough to get out ahead of the pricey installment loans and auto title loans that payday lenders have increasingly turned to as states crack down on two-week loans.\n\nThe bureau, which was created to route out unfair and deceptive financial products offered to consumers, began supervising payday lenders in 2012.\n\nCongress forbade the CFPB from directly capping payday interest rates, but the CFPB could effectively lower APRs by requiring payday lenders to give consumers more time to repay the loans.\n\nIt also could require lenders to verify consumers have the ability to repay the loans before extending credit. That’s something that banks and credit unions typically are required to do before they issue loans to consumers.\n\nBut payday loans were designed from the outset to be products that could not be easily repaid. The business model depends on churning loans.\n\nThe bureau has spent two years methodically collecting and studying payday records. Cordray has said many times that the CFPB is data-driven, and that's commendable.\n\nBut every day the CFPB waits to issue new rules, vulnerable consumers get hurt.\n\nFollow Sheryl on Twitter: @consumerwriter\n\nOn Facebook: PDConsumerAffairs\n\n\n\nEmail Sheryl at sharris @plaind.com"", ""The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the evidence is in: Payday loans hurt, rather than help borrowers.\nWith the release of its newest report on payday lending, the bureau is readying for a long-anticipated crackdown on payday loans.\nThe bureau's study, the most comprehensive look at payday loans yet, confirms that once consumers get in payday debt, they don't get out.\nSo much for payday loans being a quick fix for people in a cash crunch.\nBut payday loans were designed from the outset to be products that could not be easily repaid.""]"

He has been called ""The Man Who Fed The World,"" and ""The Father of The Green Revolution.""Norm Borlaug was the first plant pathologist to be awarded a Nobel Prize (1970) - for contributions to world peace. For all of use who are fellow plant pathologists, his work has been particularly inspiring.It is a good time to look back at how the challenge of feeding the world population was met during Borlaug\'s career, because we have a similar challenge ahead of us.The chart below shows global population from 1950 with a projection to 2100.I\'ve been looking at food production data available from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAOSTAT). If we look at the half century since FAO started tracking it in 1960, global population increased by 3.89 billion. Between 2010 and 2060, global population is projected to rise by another 3.04 billion.Between 1960 and 2010, production of most crops did manage to keep up with population growth and for many crops there was actually more available per person in 2010 than in 1960.Living standards also improved in many parts of the world, which meant that people were able to enjoy that per capita increase. Fertility rates have declined with the education of women combined with improvements in living standards and food security. It is projected that global human population will level off by around 2100 due to these factors.The increase in food production during Borlaug\'s era was mostly achieved through increased yield on each acre or hectare grown, not from farming more land. That was made possible by agronomic improvements, including the breeding advances that came from the work of Borlaug and many others. In the graph above, the two bottom, green bars show the global crop area in the window 1960-65 (1.09 billion hectares) and 2005-10 (1.45 billion hectares). The increase, shown in the red bar, is 362 million hectares.That is an enormous amount of land, but without increased yield, it would have taken nearly 3.1 billion hectares (blue bar) to have provided the amount of food that was available to the world by 2010. That effectively means that the global farming community, and those that aided it with technologies, advice and expertise, ""saved"" more than 1.6 billion hectares of land from being converted from a natural state into farmland. Realistically, there is not that much land which could ever be farmed.Many of Borlaug\'s contributions were to the staple food crop - wheat. Wheat is not a single crop, but a collection of many different types of wheat grown for different kinds of food ranging from hearty breads, to pasta, to crackers, to flat breads to soft noodles. By the end of this 50 year window, the world\'s wheat farmers were producing 2.69 times as much wheat as in 1960.However, 97% of that increase (green part of the bar) was enabled by higher yields. Only 10 million more hectares were being grown. That meant that the world could continue to have enough wheat without the need for adding 346 million more wheat hectares.That is the legacy of Borlaug and the other participants in the Green Revolution.The story with rice is almost as positive. In 2005-10, humanity had access to 2.9 times as much rice as in 1960-65, and 83% of the increase was attributable to yield with 39 million new hectares added. That meant that there were 187 million hectares which did not need to be added to the rice production base.The story behind these higher yields is complex and varies across geographies.The details of how we might continue this sort of progress through 2060 are also complex and will involve new challenges such as climate change. Even so, on this important anniversary it is fitting to look back at the remarkable accomplishments of the past to find inspiration for the challenges of the future. Lets hope that at the 150th anniversary of Norm Borlaug\'s birth people will once again be able to look back and tell this kind of story.A story about humanity continuing to be fed, but without having had to add much if any new farmed land. Even into his 90s, Borlaug continued to be an articulate proponent for letting farmers use the full toolbox of technologies, including biotechnology, to pursue such goals. Now its up to us to continue to make that case.

It will be determined by what we do together to expand his vision of stewardship toward this planet and the people who live on it,” said Rep. Bruce L. Braley, Iowa Democrat.\n\nBorlaug is one of only three Americans to receive the top three awards for humanitarian work: the Nobel Peace Prize, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the others being civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel).\n\nSpeakers at Tuesday’s dedication ceremony, many of whom met Borlaug when he received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007, spoke of him as a modest man who was not afraid to get his hands dirty to solve problems. While research was a priority for him, his biggest goal was to spread knowledge to farmers and get any advances implemented in the real world as soon as possible.\n\n“Today, we live in a very different world from the one that Norman Borlaug was born into. It’s a world with less preventable misery, less hunger, and more hope for the hungry,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican. “What a legacy for this humble farmer from Iowa — this unlikeliest of revolutionaries, this man who changed the planet with a grain of wheat.”\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, said Borlaug’s research saved more than 1 billion lives over the course of his lifetime by feeding starving people across the country and around the world.\n\n“More than others, he heeded the biblical call to feed the hungry,” she said. “He shared his story and his experience, a way of imploring us to never accept the unacceptable status quo, to never allow countries or communities to go hungry when it is in our power to prevent it.”\n\nThe ceremony also included singing of the Iowa Corn Song, which many in the audience chimed in for, and a prayer from Senate Chaplain Barry Black, who said those who saw the statue should learn from Borlaug’s legacy to “strive to leave the world better than we found it.”\n\nStatuary Hall served as the House chamber for the first half of the 19th century, but now holds some of the collection of statues — generally two from every state — that make up the Capitol’s collection.\n\nThe statue of Borlaug replaces one of James Harlan, a former senator from Iowa and secretary of the Interior under President Andrew Jackson, according to the Architect of the Capitol. The Harlan statue will move to Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where he served as president.\n\nIowa’s other statue depicts Samuel Jordan Kirkwood, who served as the governor of the state during the Civil War.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.\n\nMost Americans have never heard the name Norman Borlaug—and that’s ironic, considering that he is hailed around the world as one of the greatest Americans ever.\n\nCompared to storied politicians, creative industrialists, brilliant inventors, or military heroes, Borlaug’s accomplishments have never been the topic of discussion at the dinner table — he merely set the world’s table. But what a table. The simple Iowa farm boy is credited with saving a billion people around the world from starvation and malnutrition.\n\nHis honors and awards include the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and the Padma Vibhushan (India’s second highest civilian honor). Borlaug is the creator of the World Food Prize, an annual award that recognizes the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. In addition, USDA’s Foreign Agriculture Service administers the Norman E. Borlaug International Agricultural Science and Technology Fellowship Program, which provides training and collaborative research opportunities to scientists from developing and middle-income countries.\n\nToday, on National Agriculture Day—what would have been Borlaug’s 100th birthday—he will be recognized with a statue in the United States Capitol. The statue will be unveiled at 11 a.m., with a live webcast available. USDA Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden will host a public event from 2:00 – 5 p.m. at the Jefferson Auditorium in USDA’s South Building.\n\nThe statue, which depicts Borlaug conducting research in a wheat field, is essentially a snapshot of his career. Borlaug spent 20 years working with wheat producers in Mexico, where he eventually developed high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties and a double-season production system that defied conventional wisdom of the time. As a result, Mexico produced six times more wheat than before and went from an importer nation to a wheat exporter in 1963.\n\nBorlaug followed his success in Mexico by taking on food shortage challenges in Asia and the Middle East. His efforts there were so successful he was credited with starting a “Green Revolution” that saw Pakistan increase its wheat yield from 4.6 million tons in 1965 to 8.4 million tons in 1970; India also improved its harvest, up from 12.3 million tons to 20 million tons in the same period. Since 1968, as India’s population more than doubled, the Borlaug-inspired wheat harvest more than tripled. The Green Revolution has since expanded into rice and maize, to cover the world’s three most important cereal grains.\n\nRather than rest on his laurels, Borlaug came out of semi-retirement in the 1980s to take his work to Africa. Maize and sorghum doubled from 1983 to 1985, and production of wheat, cassava, and cowpeas are also on the rise in the countries that employ his tactics.\n\nToday, Borlaug’s family celebrates his 100th birthday, but in reality, we should all celebrate. He paved the way for agricultural science and technology to improve the well-being of people across the globe and improve the human condition.', 'In addition, USDA’s Foreign Agriculture Service administers the Norman E.

41628,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/24/editorial-the-legacy-of-genius/,business,"['ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nThe Capitol’s Statuary Hall pays tribute to some of America’s most accomplished men and women. Each state selects two native sons or daughters who made a lasting contribution to the nation in arts, sciences or statesmanship. On Tuesday, the state of Iowa will unveil a new statute of Norman Borlaug to stand with George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Sacagawea, Samuel Adams, Helen Keller, Ronald Reagan and other giants. It was an inspired choice. No other American saved more lives than he.\n\nBorlaug, an Iowa-born biologist, was the driving force behind the Green Revolution. His agricultural techniques allowed impoverished developing countries to feed themselves for the first time, ultimately saving more than a billion people from starvation. His technique had three primary components. To increase crop yields, Borlaug determined that farmers needed to plant hearty, disease resistant, genetically modified crops, use fertilizers to help crops grow large in poor soil, and to protect crops from destructive insects with modern pesticides. The combination is powerful and effective.\n\nThis proven method is under attack now from left-wing environmentalists who blindly follow the goofy liberal fad of the day, no matter what it costs. Many of today’s well-fed “progressives,” who aren’t progressive at all, would rather see the millions go hungry than allow Borlaug’s life-saving recipe of genetically modified crops, fertilizers and pesticides to feed the world.\n\nThe European Union, for example, imposed stringent regulations on genetically modified crops, despite the European Academies Science Advisory Council repeatedly explaining to European legislators that there is no rational scientific basis for the regulations. The left-leaning lawmakers were interested only in making a political statement of solidarity with the environmentalists.\n\nGreenpeace launched an all-out assault on genetically modified crops, though crops have been genetically modified with no ill effects long before Gregor Mendel began experimenting with his peas in the 19th century. Nevertheless, Greenpeace wants to ban the life-saving crop techniques and demands that governments harass agricultural producers by implementing ridiculous and cumbersome genetically modified food labeling requirements, meant to drive them out of business. Labeling scheme proposals have also spread to a number of states, including California, Florida, Maryland and Massachusetts.\n\nGreen zealots have tried to blame fertilizer for every bad thing that happens — from cancer to global warming — with little support from science. Borlaug reckoned some value in reducing the use of fertilizer, but he recognized that reduction was possible only through genetically engineering crops to produce a higher yield without fertilizers. That puts environmentalists in a quandary. To eliminate one “bad” thing, they must increase another — or let the world starve.\n\nThe well-fed left chooses starvation for others. Scientists from McGill University in Montreal and the University of Minnesota found that using pesticides increased yields in many crops by more than 25 percent, yet the delusional EarthShare and Sierra Club want to eliminate most pesticides. In 2013, Denmark enacted an enormous tax on bug-killing sprays that did little more than feed crops to insects. Activists and politicians have the luxury of attacking genetically modified crops, fertilizers and pesticides because they eat well themselves as beneficiaries of Borlaug’s innovation.\n\nWhen Norman Borlaug died in 2009 at age 95, he was one of just six people to win the trifecta, the Nobel Peace Prize, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. When the sculpture of Dr. Norman Borlaug is unveiled in Statuary Hall on Tuesday, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, perhaps his image should remind Washington politicians, many of whom are eager to follow the fads, that the cost of following the whims of junk science is measured in the billions.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

Borlaug Statue in National Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol. Appropriately, the date would have been Dr. Borlaug\x92s 100th birthday and is also National Agriculture Day.\n\nWith the unveiling, Iowans will experience a historic, once-in-a-lifetime event that has not occurred in more than a century. The last time a statue representing Iowa was unveiled at the U.S. Capitol was 1913 (Sen. James Harlan). A statue of former Gov. Samuel Kirkwood was unveiled in 1910.\n\nAs we \x97 the Borlaug Statue Committee \x97 embarked on this mission more than two years ago to raise funds and commission an artist to create the statue, we reflected on Borlaug\x92s legacy and the impact his work had on people around the world. As The Atlantic Monthly said in 1997, \x93Norman Borlaug has saved more lives than anyone who has ever lived.\x94\n\nHe was a humble man, born on a farm outside the small Northeast Iowa town of Cresco. He grew up during the Great Depression \x97 when the world\x92s population was 1.8 billion people \x97 and became fascinated by diseases that wiped out entire fields of crops. Highly competitive and persistent, Borlaug devoted his life to researching, innovating, teaching and crusading for progress in agriculture to feed the world.\n\nWith a guiding principal that \x93Food is the moral right of all who are born in to this world,\x94 Borlaug worked in many regions around the globe to develop new, high-yielding wheat varieties.\n\nHe became known as the \x93Father of the Green Revolution\x94 and is credited with saving an estimated 1 billion people around the world from hunger and starvation. He is the only American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the Congressional Gold Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science.\n\nToday, the global population is more than 7 billion people; nearly 1 billion go hungry each day. We face the greatest challenge of human history: How to feed an estimated 9 billion people by the year 2050. Borlaug\x92s inspiration is needed now more than ever as we work to inspire the next generation to focus on creating healthy food systems, and to build on his legacy of agricultural innovation to ensure enough nutritious food for all.\n\nIn this spirit, and as many leaders and others gather in Washington, D.C. this month to unveil the Borlaug Statue, we invite and encourage Iowans to join the celebration and learn more about Borlaug and how they can help continue his legacy.\n\nIowans can watch the Borlaug Statue dedication ceremony webcast at www.speaker.gov/live or visit the State Historical Museum of Iowa in Des Moines to see a smaller version of the statue.\n\nIn addition, Iowans can visit the World Food Prize Hall of Laureates free all day in Des Moines to see the webcast, package meals for the hungry, enjoy children\x92s story time, tour the building with Iowa artists, explore interactive education exhibits about Borlaug and more.\n\nIowans also can visit www.iowaborlaugstatue.org to learn more about the Borlaug statue project, and www.worldfoodprize.org/norm for other opportunities to celebrate his legacy.Dyan Smith of Cedar Rapids is a Borlaug Statue Committee member.

However, the bank has still yet to resume dividend payments. The resumption of payouts to shareholders is seen as the final crucial step in its full rehabilitation.\n\nLast month, Lloyds said it hoped to give more details on its dividend at its half-year financial results.

Her får du vite alt du trenger om det å ha en medlåntaker.\n\nDette er en medlånstaker\n\nNår du tar opp et lån sammen med en annen person, har du en medlåntaker. Begge to blir ansvarlige for å gjøre opp gjelden, og begge har samme rett til pengene som lånes.\n\nFra bankene sin side står de da bedre rustet til å få tilbake det utlånte beløpet. Mister for eksempel en av dere inntektene, må den andre gjøre opp alene.\n\nBilligere forbrukslån\n\nDen ekstra sikkerheten banken får når du søker med en medlåntaker, gir naturligvis større sjanse for at lånet innvilges. Men, akkurat den biten er faktisk ikke det viktigste, for kravene er uansett ikke spesielt høye.\n\nDen største fordelen med en medlåntaker er at lånet ofte blir billigere sier Billigeforbrukslån.no. Rentene på et forbrukslån fastsettes individuelt av de fleste banker. Rentefastsettelsen avhenger veldig av søkerens betalingsevne, noe som selvsagt blir bedre når to søker sammen. Dermed kan man ofte forvente bedre tilbud på rentebetingelser.\n\nLike krav til begge søkere\n\nBanker som aksepterer medlånstaker på forbrukslån stiller de samme kravene til begge to. Det vil si at ingen av dere kan ha betalingsanmerkninger, begge må være over bankens aldersgrense, og begge må ha fast inntekt. I tillegg må dere begge ha norsk statsborgerskap, eller såkalt d-nummer (gjelder utenlandske statsborgere som skatter til Norge).\n\nLån helst med partneren din\n\nDet anbefales at en medlånstaker er ektefellen eller samboeren din. Da unngås lettere uenigheter om hvem som skal betale avdragene på lånet. Faktisk er det stadig flere banker som krever at den du låner sammen med er en ektefelle, eller samboer i registrert forhold.\n\nDet er i tillegg enklere for ektefeller, og til en viss grad samboere, å fordele skattefradraget for gjeldsrenter.\n\nKausjonist er noe annet\n\nMerk deg at en medlåntaker ikke er det samme som kausjonist. Å ha kausjonsansvar gir ingen rettighet til pengene, men kausjonisten får likevel ansvar for tilbakebetaling av lånet dersom låntakeren ikke overholder forpliktelsene sine overfor banken.\n\nPer i dag er det få banker som tilbyr lån mot kausjonsansvar, blant de som spesialiserer seg på forbrukslån.', 'Dette er en medlånstakerNår du tar opp et lån sammen med en annen person, har du en medlåntaker.\nBilligere forbrukslånDen ekstra sikkerheten banken får når du søker med en medlåntaker, gir naturligvis større sjanse for at lånet innvilges.\nLike krav til begge søkereBanker som aksepterer medlånstaker på forbrukslån stiller de samme kravene til begge to.\nFaktisk er det stadig flere banker som krever at den du låner sammen med er en ektefelle, eller samboer i registrert forhold.\nPer i dag er det få banker som tilbyr lån mot kausjonsansvar, blant de som spesialiserer seg på forbrukslån.']"

The 82.3 reading was above the 78.6 forecast of Investing.com and 4.0 above the February 78.3 (previously reported at 78.1).\n\nThis measure of confidence has risen from its interim low of 72.0 in November and it now at a new post-Financial Crisis high.\n\nHere is an excerpt from the Conference Board report.\n\n“Consumer confidence improved in March, as expectations for the short-term outlook bounced back from February’s decline,” said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. “While consumers were moderately more upbeat about future job prospects and the overall economy, they were less optimistic about income growth. The Present Situation index, which had been on an upward trend for the past four months, was relatively unchanged in March. Overall, consumers expect the economy to continue improving and believe it may even pick up a little steam in the months ahead.” Consumers’ assessment of current conditions was little changed in March. Those claiming business conditions are “good” increased to 22.9 percent from 21.2 percent; however, those claiming business conditions are “bad” also rose, to 23.2 percent from 22.0 percent. Consumers’ appraisal of the labor market was relatively unchanged. Those claiming jobs are “plentiful” decreased marginally to 13.1 percent from 13.4 percent, while those saying jobs are “hard to get” increased slightly to 33.0 percent from 32.4 percent. Consumers’ expectations, which fell last month, rebounded in March. The percentage of consumers expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months increased to 18.1 percent from 17.3 percent, while those anticipating business conditions to worsen declined to 10.2 percent from 13.6 percent. Consumers’ outlook for the labor market was also moderately more optimistic. Those expecting more jobs in the months ahead edged up to 13.9 percent from 13.7 percent, while those expecting fewer jobs fell to 18.0 percent from 20.9 percent. The proportion of consumers expecting their incomes to grow declined to 14.9 from 15.8 percent, but those anticipating a decline in their incomes also decreased, to 12.1 percent from 13.4 percent. [press release]\n\nPutting the Latest Number in Context\n\nLet’s take a step back and put Lynn Franco’s interpretation in a larger perspective. The table here shows the average consumer confidence levels for each of the five recessions during the history of this monthly data series, which dates from June 1977. The latest number has moved 12.9 points above the recession mindset but remains 12.0 points below the non-recession average.\n\nThe chart below is another attempt to evaluate the historical context for this index as a coincident indicator of the economy. Toward this end I have highlighted recessions and included GDP. The exponential regression through the index data shows the long-term trend and highlights the extreme volatility of this indicator. Statisticians may assign little significance to a regression through this sort of data. But the slope clearly resembles the regression trend for real GDP shown below, and it is a more revealing gauge of relative confidence than the 1985 level of 100 that the Conference Board cites as a point of reference. Today’s reading of 82.3 is now above the current regression point of 78.2.\n\nClick for a larger image\n\nOn a percentile basis, the latest reading is at the 35.3 percentile of all the monthly readings since the start of the monthly data series in June 1977 and at the 31.0 percentile of non-recessionary months.\n\nFor an additional perspective on consumer attitudes, see my post on the most recent Reuters/University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Here is the chart from that post.\n\nClick for a larger image\n\nAnd finally, let’s take a look at the correlation between consumer confidence and small business sentiment, the latter by way of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Optimism Index. As the chart illustrates, the two have tracked one another fairly closely since the onset of the Financial Crisis.\n\nClick for a larger image\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the next NFIB report echoes the bounce in consumer optimism.\n\nThis article is brought to you courtesy of Doug Short from Advisor Perspectives.', 'Doug Short: The Latest Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index was released this morning based on data collected through March 14.\n“Consumer confidence improved in March, as expectations for the short-term outlook bounced back from February’s decline,” said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.\nThose claiming business conditions are “good” increased to 22.9 percent from 21.2 percent; however, those claiming business conditions are “bad” also rose, to 23.2 percent from 22.0 percent.\nThe exponential regression through the index data shows the long-term trend and highlights the extreme volatility of this indicator.\nFor an additional perspective on consumer attitudes, see my post on the most recent Reuters/University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index.']"

41708,http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2014/03/25/dimon-deputy-epitomizes-succession-of-all-sorts/,business,"['By Antony Currie\n\nThe author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.\n\nJamie Dimon’s loss of a top deputy on Tuesday epitomizes succession issues of all sorts. Key lieutenant Mike Cavanagh has given up a shot at following his mentor atop JPMorgan for one helping run private equity firm Carlyle Group. The move shakes up leadership plans for both companies and also underscores a bigger shift in finance.\n\nAt the mega-bank, Dimon’s inner circle has been shrinking. Potential chief executives have left before – Jes Staley and Bill Winters, for example. They were forced out, though. By all accounts, Cavanagh left of his own accord and the board tried to persuade him to stay.\n\nNo matter how deep the ranks may be at JPMorgan, Cavanagh’s departure is a blow. He amassed more experience during his two decades working under Dimon, including at Bank One, than most. He served as chief financial officer during the crisis, ran transaction services and then the investment bank. Cavanagh also spearheaded the internal inquiry that followed the $6 billion London Whale trading loss in 2012.\n\nRunning a bank isn’t what it used to be, though. A 12 percent return on equity used to be the low end of expectations; now it’s considered success. Core income is also either growing slowly or falling. Increased regulation makes it harder to find new ways to mint money. Compensation is under heightened scrutiny. Some of these problems are exacerbated at JPMorgan because of the profile crafted by Dimon.\n\nIt makes private equity all the more appealing. For one thing, opportunities abound to earn even more than the unwritten $25 million ceiling for bank CEOs. Carlyle’s founders – David Rubenstein, Daniel D’Aniello and William Conway – earned about $750 million last year, mostly from investment profits and dividends.\n\nThe trio obviously is thinking about the firm’s next phase, and sees Cavanagh as part of it. He will be co-president and co-chief operating officer of Carlyle with insider Glenn Youngkin. Outsiders don’t always work out when it comes to managing in the buyout industry, however. Apollo Global, for example, just parted ways with Marc Spilker, who was recruited to be the firm’s president a few years ago from Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile Cavanagh’s job change most directly affects JPMorgan and Carlyle, it is representative of a bigger and slower shift underway. Banks are gradually ceding power to shadow banks. It’s another form of succession boards of directors need to plan for better.', 'Jamie Dimon’s loss of a top deputy on Tuesday epitomizes succession issues of all sorts.\nKey lieutenant Mike Cavanagh has given up a shot at following his mentor atop JPMorgan for one helping run private equity firm Carlyle Group.\nA 12 percent return on equity used to be the low end of expectations; now it’s considered success.\nIt makes private equity all the more appealing.\nWhile Cavanagh’s job change most directly affects JPMorgan and Carlyle, it is representative of a bigger and slower shift underway.']"

41743,http://blogs.marketwatch.com/thetell/2014/03/25/walgreen-why-weeding-out-drugstores-isnt-downsizing/,business,"['Walgreen Co. , included in its fiscal second-quarter report, said Tuesday it plans to close 76 of its stores by August. The news grabbed headlines, and was perhaps the biggest surprise in the report. But it doesn\'t mean the company is shrinking.\n\nThese 76 stores represent less than 1% of Walgreen\'s current tally of 8,210 drugstores. Even after they\'ve been shuttered, the company said it still expects to end 2014 with 55 to 75 additional stores. They added 138 last year, so what this really means is that the pace of expansion has slowed by roughly half.\n\nThe reasoning behind weeding out these stores is that they were either too close to other, more profitable locations or they were in neighborhoods where property values are in decline (so-called ""non-optimal real-estate""). This is simply a reminder that a store\'s success is not measured by sales or margins alone, but includes the building and the value of the land it occupies. And it\'s not in the company\'s interest to sit on assets that are dropping in value.\n\nAnd for anyone suspecting Walgreens is abandoning needy neighborhoods, the company claims the economic demographic served by these marked stores is about 70% middle to high income.\n\nAs for which stores, specifically, Walgreens plans to close, management\'s not saying, though they provide some clues. Most will be on the East Coast (39) or in the Midwest (17). They did say, however, that they aim to reassign most of the employees affected.\n\nThey also estimate the closures will save Walgreens up to $50 million a year and add 2 cents to three cents a share to the bottom line, though one-time charges related to the move will cost $240 million to $280 million.\n\nApparently most investors didn\'t see it coming, but liked it.\n\n""The main incremental was WAG\'s announcement of the closure of 76 stores, which should be accretive to FY15 estimates ... We view this portfolio rationalization announcement as a positive,"" according to Ann Hynes, an equities analyst with Mizuho Securities USA Inc.\n\nWalgreen stock was up as much as 4.5% early Tuesday, briefly the second-biggest percentage gainer in the S&P 500 .\n\n– Jim Jelter\n\nFollow him on Twitter @jjelter.\n\nOther must-read stories from MarketWatch:\n\nCoca-Cola executive pay plan stirs David Winters\' wrath\n\nDavid Rolfe: Buffett\'s Berkshire Hathaway will stomp small-caps', ""Walgreen Co. , included in its fiscal second-quarter report, said Tuesday it plans to close 76 of its stores by August.\nThese 76 stores represent less than 1% of Walgreen's current tally of 8,210 drugstores.\nEven after they've been shuttered, the company said it still expects to end 2014 with 55 to 75 additional stores.\nAs for which stores, specifically, Walgreens plans to close, management's not saying, though they provide some clues.\nOther must-read stories from MarketWatch:Coca-Cola executive pay plan stirs David Winters' wrathDavid Rolfe: Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will stomp small-caps""]"

His 12.2pc stake will be worth nearly £500m on paper when King makes its debut on Wednesday, promoting the 58-year-old to the top flight of Britain’s business elite.\n\nMr Morris faces a potentially nervy wait if he plans to realise most of his new fortune. Though they will cash in some shares, King’s directors are barred from selling shares for six months after the Initial Public Offering and yesterday the jury was very much undecided about the stock’s prospects on day one, let alone half a year into the future.\n\nThe arguments are well-rehearsed on both sides. Candy Crush Saga’s success is undeniably phenomenal. The game, free to download from the Apple App Store or Google Play, extracts hundreds of millions of dollars from the small proportion of players who buy the extra lives and extra moves to satisfy their compulsion.\n\nCandy Crush Saga was released for smartphone in 2012. From a pre-tax loss of $698,000 in 2011, King swung to a profit of $11.1m as the game drew players in their droves, first on Facebook then on smartphones. The profit ballooned to $714m (£433) last year, on revenues of $1.9bn.\n\nYet it is the very pace and scale of Candy Crush Saga’s success that has concerned those who believe King will sink.\n\nAt first glance, on King’s 2013 revenues and profits a valuation of north of $7bn might not seem particularly high. It would represent a price to profits multiple of not much more than 10, which compares with more than 100 for Facebook and 17 for the more traditional games maker Hasbro.\n\nBut 78pc of those revenues were generated by Candy Crush Saga, and just as quickly as smartphone games gain popularity, they can lose it. King’s detractors point to Zynga as the exemplar. It floated on the popularity of Farmville and Mafia Wars, then sank as attention and dollars leaked away.\n\nMichael Hewson of CMC Markets said: “If King can’t come up with an equally popular sequel or another similarly popular game then the risk is we could see it go the same way as Zynga.\n\n“The key drivers will therefore be the company’s ability to come up with new compelling game offerings for a demographic that can have a low boredom threshold as mobile device usage continues to rise.”\n\nThe growth of mobile gaming offers hope to investors planning to back King on Wednesday. According to a research by Strategy Analytics, mobile games have grown to account for 28pc of the global gaming market, compared with 11pc in 2009.\n\nMobile titles from King, Zynga and their rivals draw revenues of $17.3bn this year, up 6pc, the analysts forecast.\n\nSome observers have argued that regardless of the attractive market opportunity in front of them, King’s directors should not be floating the business now. The company has no debt and more than $400m in cash it can invest to ensure it repeats the success of Candy Crush Saga, yet will place enough shares to put $325m in the pockets of individuals.\n\nThe only reason to go public now, it is therefore argued, is for Mr Morris and his fellow major individual shareholders to cash in on that single hit, in the knowledge it may not be repeated. To back up such claims of director self-interest, they point to the fact that the private equity firm Apax Partners, the biggest shareholder, will sell less than one-twentieth of its stake.\n\nThe company is at least open that swelling the ranks of the super-rich is a major motivation. Its prospectus says: “Going public creates a liquid market for our current and future employees and equity holders and will give us greater flexibility to act on strategic opportunities if they arise in the future.”\n\nOne man who will not join in today’s bonanza is Toby Rowland, a co-founder of King who ran it until 2008. He sold his shares for $3m in a private sale in 2011. The stake will be worth nearly $1bn when the company is listed today.\n\nMr Rowland, the son of the mining tycoon Tiny Rowland, is now running Mangahigh.com, a maths education start-up advised by the Oxford professor Marcus du Sautoy, could not be reached on Tuesday.\n\nIn previous comments to analysts at PrivCo he was sanguine, however. Mr Rowland said: “Oh well, I’d probably have blown it on wine, women and a vanity space program.”', 'The flotation of King, the London-based developer of Candy Crush Saga, is sure to be closely watched in the City and on Wall Street, and also in Derby, the Midlands base of the man due to benefit most.\nCandy Crush Saga’s success is undeniably phenomenal.\nCandy Crush Saga was released for smartphone in 2012.\nYet it is the very pace and scale of Candy Crush Saga’s success that has concerned those who believe King will sink.\nBut 78pc of those revenues were generated by Candy Crush Saga, and just as quickly as smartphone games gain popularity, they can lose it.']"

That would make this a relatively small discharge; last week, a pipeline owned by Sunoco Logistics Partners spilled 240 barrels into an Ohio nature preserve.\n\nThe leak had stopped on Tuesday and no injuries were reported, London-based BP said in a statement. It declined to comment on the volume of oil spilled.\n\nAs crews worked on the cleanup on this industrial stretch of shoreline, the effect on Lake Michigan was not immediately clear. Two dozen workers were shoveling up sand on the shore that looked lightly tarred by oil. A vacuum truck was sucking up oily water.\n\nOil spills are not uncommon in the United States, where drilling is at an all-time high and energy production is on the rise. Still, Monday’s spill will probably spur more environmental opposition to the Whiting refinery, which has been under local scrutiny for releasing pollutants into Lake Michigan.\n\nThe spill may also be another blow to BP, whose reputation was tarnished by the Macondo well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. That was the worst offshore spill in U.S. history, spewing millions of barrels of oil into the ocean.\n\nOnly this month was BP allowed to bid again on new federal drilling leases after a two-year government ban was lifted.\n\n“It’s troubling to hear that this spill occurred,” said Lyman Welch, Water Quality Program Director at the Alliance for the Great Lakes group. “It’s a reminder that even when precautions are taken, spills occur into the Great Lakes and we need to be vigilant to protect out drinking water supplies.”\n\nBP laid down containment boom on the water and said the oil was confined to a cove between the refinery’s wastewater treatment plant and a steel mill.\n\nWinds pushed the oil toward the shore and cold temperatures were causing it to harden into a waxy consistency, making it easier to collect, BP spokesman Scott Dean said.\n\n“I’ve had no reports of any wildlife impacted,” said Dean.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Coast Guard and state regulators were at the scene.\n\nOLD DISPUTES\n\nThe largest crude distillation unit at the 405,000-barrel-per-day refinery was operating normally again on Tuesday after a malfunction led to the leak, Dean said.\n\nThe 260,000-bpd crude distillation unit, called Pipestill 12, was the centerpiece of a $4 billion refit of the Whiting refinery completed late last year to run large amounts of oil from Canada’s tar sands fields in Alberta.\n\nA crude distillation unit does the initial refining of crude oil coming into a refinery and provides feedstock for all other units at the plant.\n\nThe refinery has been increasing the amount of Canadian crude oil running through Pipestill 12 during the first quarter of this year.\n\nEnvironmental groups opposed the BP upgrade, saying use of the Canadian crude would increase pollution from the refinery into Lake Michigan.\n\nThe Whiting refinery is the primary focus of BP’s U.S. refining strategy to use only plants in the northern United States that have in easy access to Canadian crude oil.

Federal investigators, who have released little information on what might have caused the accident, were expected back on the scene today.\n\n""It is a miracle that nobody died,"" said Joseph Schwieterman, a transportation expert at DePaul University.\n\nHad the crash occurred during the day, when the trains are often full and luggage-carrying travelers fill the escalator, far more people likely would have been injured, some even killed, he said.

""When pedestrians are hit by a train, it is usual fatal.""\n\nHe also noted that jumping the track likely dissipated the train\'s forward movement, thus lessening the accident\'s severity.

""They gotta earn a living. ... She was extremely tired.""\n\nKelly said she took standard drug and alcohol tests after the derailment, and he said she assured him they were not an issue.\n\nAsked whether she might have nodded off, Kelly responded, ""The indication is there. Yes.""\n\nThe train is designed so that if operators become incapacitated their hand slips off the controls, it should come to a stop.

The affected machine looks to have virtually careened off the track and partially up an escalator leading to the airport terminal from underground.\n\nMaking matters worse, early reports indicated that just shy of three dozens people were hurt in various forms. Considering that the event just struck, the extent of the injuries remain unclear, but our thoughts are obviously with those harmed and their families.\n\nThe Blue Line Accident Details\n\nRiding on the L is a routine, daily event for many Chicagoans. From traveling to work downtown to heading up north to catch a flight at O’Hare. But most of us take for granted the risks that are ever-present when traveling. Train accidents are not as uncommon as you might think, something that the passengers on the ill-fated Blue Line train learned harshly.\n\nInvestigations are still underway to determine exactly what went wrong. local authorities are still learning about the details, and the National Transportation Safety Board was informed.\n\nVarious possibilities exist, including improper signaling and/or equipment failures. In addition, there is a good chance that some sort of human error was involved, and a Chicago Transportation Authority Spokesperson admitted that speeding may have been involved. The CTA official explained, “It appears as though the train would have been going faster than a train normally birthing at this station would be. Normally a train pulls in at just a couple miles an hour and pulls into the state. Obviously this train did not stop so speed could be a factor here.”\n\nFurther inquiry revealed that driver exhaustion may have played a role. A union representative confirmed that the driver was “extremely tired” at the time of the accidents. That suggests that she may have falling asleep, at least momentarily\n\nLegal Liability for Chicago Train Derailment?\n\nIt is impossible to predict how this matter will resolve itself in the upcoming weeks and months. However, as most appreciate, the civil law allows those hurt by the negligence of others to recover for their losses. Regardless of the specifics of this particular accidents, it is likely that some form of negligence contributing in whole or part to the derailment. That is obviously true if, for example, the driver fell asleep at the controls. But that is also true if equipment was not maintained properly and malfunctioned.\n\nNeedless to say, all those affected by this incident should seek out experienced legal help as soon as feasible.

Associated Press\n\nIn case of an emergency, a CTA train operator can push a red button to trigger powerful electromagnetic brakes that could have stopped the lead car of a Blue Line train from catapulting onto an escalator Monday at the O\'Hare station.\n\nThe fact that last resort wasn\'t used reinforces concerns the train operator was dozing or points to a major mechanical failure, safety expert John Plante said.\n\nIf the train operator applied the emergency brakes, ""the train would never have hit the bumping post (at the station terminus). It should have been a good car-length away, unless of course the system didn\'t work,"" said Plante, a former CTA attorney and current Metra board member.\n\nBut that\'s not the only braking question the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.\n\nAn automatic braking system did deploy before the crash, NTSB lead investigator Ted Turpin said at a briefing Tuesday, but it wasn\'t enough to stop the eight-car train. Asked why the automatic braking system didn\'t prevent the lead car from jumping the tracks, Turpin said, ""that\'s an analysis we have to perform.""\n\nData indicates the train was traveling at 25 mph as it neared the station, which wasn\'t an unusual speed, authorities said. More than 30 people were taken to local hospitals with minor injuries and the O\'Hare Station is closed until further notice as a result of the 2:50 a.m. Monday crash.\n\nA passenger filed a lawsuit on Tuesday claiming she is unable to go to work at an airport newsstand because of injuries she received in the crash. Niakesha Thomas accused the CTA of negligence in a suit filed in Cook County circuit court.\n\nTurpin said he intended to interview the operator of the train Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA transit union official said the train operator ""might have dozed off"" in the moments before the crash.\n\nAmalgamated Transit Union Local 308 President Robert Kelly said Monday the CTA employee told him she was extremely tired at the time of the crash. The one-year employee started work at 8:40 p.m. Sunday. She had worked a lot of overtime recently but had 16 hours off before her Sunday shift.\n\n""We always take into consideration the fatigue factor,"" Turpin said. Turpin could not say if the train operator had applied the brakes that were under her control.\n\nThe automatic braking system is located alongside the tracks and uses multiple components including stop arms, or levers.\n\nPlante, who specialized in emergency preparedness and risk management with the CTA, said the automatic braking system is designed more for a ""controlled, slow stop.""\n\nHe noted that if the train was going at 25 mph when it neared the station ""you should be able to stop the train safely ... it may be (going) a little quick."" Another factor the NTSB might consider is that there\'s a downward slope for incoming trains at the O\'Hare station, Plante added.\n\nThe NTSB unit includes experts who examine tracks, signals, mechanisms, equipment, protocols and human factors. In addition to 41 station cameras, the NTSB will review data from signal recorders and video cameras on the train cars and head car.\n\nThe derailment propelled the train\'s head car off the tracks, onto the platform and partially onto the escalator. A second car was lifted up by the momentum of the head car, officials said.\n\nAs for when the station will reopen, Turpin said, ""I hope it will be less than a week.""\n\nWhile the investigation continues, shuttles are running between O\'Hare and Rosemont every five to six minutes.', 'Surveillance video shows CTA Blue Line crashA CTA train car rests on an escalator at the O\'Hare Airport station after it derailed early Monday.\nThe fact that last resort wasn\'t used reinforces concerns the train operator was dozing or points to a major mechanical failure, safety expert John Plante said.\nIf the train operator applied the emergency brakes, ""the train would never have hit the bumping post (at the station terminus).\nA transit union official said the train operator ""might have dozed off"" in the moments before the crash.\nAnother factor the NTSB might consider is that there\'s a downward slope for incoming trains at the O\'Hare station, Plante added.']"

41832,http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-excessive-executive-pay-is-a-mistake/,business,"['Commentary:\n\nWhen David Winters, a longtime money manager, read the Coca-Cola Company\'s annual report recently, the amount of stock put aside to reward the company\'s managers stopped him in his tracks. Over the next four years, some $13 billion of stock was set aside for company executives. This would have meant that fully 14.2 percent of company stock was being used to motivate a management team already well paid. According to the New York Times, Winters argued that ""it is unfathomable that they would require such astronomical sums of money to provide motivation.""\n\nIt isn\'t just unfathomable. It\'s wrong. Why?\n\nFirst of all, money isn\'t a great motivator. While it may offer temporary delight, its value soon wears off. We all accommodate to what we get, so its value as a long-term incentive is slight.\n\nMoreover, money inhibits our sense of social connectedness. In a series of intriguing experiments, students were asked to play Monopoly. When they were done and leaving the lab, an assistant crossed the room and spilled a box of pencils. Here was the focus of the experiment: Which students would prove most helpful? The ones who had made the least amount of money in the game. All over the world, there have been any number of permutations of this kind of research -- some in labs, some in the real world -- and they all point relentlessly to the same conclusion: Money cuts people off from one another.\n\nThis isn\'t really so remarkable. When I fly in a private jet, drive in a limousine, stay in luxury hotels where my every need is catered for -- all things I have done at some stage -- at first this is all delightful. Then it\'s normal. Then it\'s an entitlement. I\'ve watched this happen -- to me and to others. The luxury has corroded my sense of self as normal, imperfect, just like everyone else. If I believe the money, then I imagine I am better, different and separate from other people.\n\nMoreover, geographically the money also separates me from everyone else. On private planes I don\'t have to sit next to crying babies. Eschewing public transportation, I don\'t have any sense of public mood or morale. Behind tall gates, my home provides splendid isolation.\n\nAll of this is exactly what you do not want in managers who are supposed to be connected to their market and their workforce. It\'s a recipe for arrogance, not motivation. Or, as Anthony Salz wrote, when investigating the manipulation of LIBOR rates at Barclays Bank, ""Elevated pay levels inevitably distort culture, tending to attract people who measure their personal success principally on compensation . . . Many interviewees [reported] a sense of an entitlement culture."" Companies that pay excessively isolate themselves and their executives from the societies they ostensibly exist to serve.\n\nThe old argument -- that you have to pay to secure real talent -- is exactly wrong. If you have to pay to get or keep your talent, you end up with the wrong person. Consider instead the view of Charles Munger of Berkshire Hathaway: ""People should take way less than they\'re worth when they\'re favored by life,"" he says, further arguing that when you have risen high enough, you have a ""moral duty to be underpaid -- not to get all you can, but to actually be underpaid.""\n\nAnd Munger stood by his belief, resolutely paying the CEO of Costco (a Berkshire Hathaway investment) less (in cash and stock) than his peers were paid running Walmart, Home Depot or Target. Since Berkshire Hathaway is a big investor in Coca-Cola, it will be interesting to see how it responds to the stock allocation that has so riled David Winters.\n\nExorbitant pay isn\'t -- or shouldn\'t be -- news. That it continues to be so can only be explained by one thing, as one senior executive commented to me recently: Everyone hopes somebody else will go first -- and reduce pay. All the boards want to. Most of the CEOs want to. They all know it needs to happen. But no one wants to be first. You could call it the biggest game of chicken the world has ever seen.', ""First of all, money isn't a great motivator.\nCompanies that pay excessively isolate themselves and their executives from the societies they ostensibly exist to serve.\nThe old argument -- that you have to pay to secure real talent -- is exactly wrong.\nIf you have to pay to get or keep your talent, you end up with the wrong person.\nExorbitant pay isn't -- or shouldn't be -- news.""]"

Phosphoric acid is both an artificial flavoring and a chemical preservative.”\n\nCoca-Cola also falsely represented that Coca-Cola was still made with the “original formula” devised by John Pemberton in 1886, according to the suit.\n\n“In fact, the composition of Coca-Cola has repeatedly changed over time,” the complaint stated. “These changes have included, among other things, an increase in the amount of unhealthy ingredients like sugar and corn syrup and the addition of artificial ingredients like phosphoric acid.”\n\nCoca-Cola knowingly and intentionally sold misbranded products to consumers with the intent to deceive, according to the suit.\n\nSowizrol claims he purchased Coke, Diet Coke, Caffeine Free Coke and Sprite in 2-liter bottles, 20-ounce bottles and individual and various packages of 12-ounce cans and that all containers of Coca-Cola failed to state that any ingredients are used as artificial flavoring or as a chemical preservative.\n\nHad the plaintiff known that Coca-Cola was misbranded, he would not have purchased Coca-Cola products, according to the suit.\n\nSowizrol claims as a result of the defendants’ unlawful misrepresentations, he and millions of others in Illinois and throughout the United States purchased Coca-Cola and were injured as a result of the defendants’ actions.\n\nThe defendants have violated the Illinois Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act by misbranding Coca-Cola products, according to the suit.\n\nSowizrol claims Coca-Cola has been unjustly enriched by its unlawful and deceptive actions.\n\nSowizrol is seeking for an order certifying the case as a class action and for him and his counsel to represent the class; for an order awarding damages, restitution or disgorgement to the plaintiff and the class; for an order requiring the defendants to immediately cease and desist from selling Coca-Cola in violation of the law; and for punitive damages with pre- and post-judgment interest.

The original focus of the tour was nuclear security, but given developments in Russia and Ukraine, the President will use the trip as an opportunity to rally support for his response to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He\'ll do that today in a meeting with the G7 leaders arranged just days ago. Other highlights on the Presidential agenda include a meeting with Pope Francis and speaking with the leaders of Saudi Arabia in an attempt to smooth strained relations between the U.S. and the Middle Eastern kingdom.\n\nIn the corresponding video, Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Aaron Task talks with Lauren Lyster about the financial implication of the Ukraine crisis. Task thinks investors should be paying more attention to the crisis. He said there could be, “massive economic implications, especially for Europe.” He cited Germany as being Russia’s biggest trading partner. “If the German economy were to falter, then whatever recovery there is in the E.U. goes away very quickly, and that...would have ramifications for U.S. markets.”\n\nA top executive at JP Morgan (JPM) in China has resigned amid an investigation into hiring practices. Fang Fang, who had been with the bank for more than a decade, will step down as chief executive for China investment banking and vice chairman of investment banking in Asia. A reason wasn\'t given for his departure, but he is a key figure in a U.S. investigation into whether the bank hired the son of China Everbright Group\'s Chairman in order to win business from that company. Fang has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nOne stock the Yahoo Finance team will be watching today is Apple (AAPL).

Apple had reportedly been in talks with Time Warner Cable (TWC) for a set-top box of its own that would also bypass web congestion. In February, Comcast agreed to takeover Time Warner Cable.\n\nWe\'re also watching Coca-Cola (KO) after the CEO and founder of Wintergreen Advisers, David Winters, sent a letter to Coke\'s board and shareholders, and separate letter to Coke shareholder Warren Buffett, criticizing the company\'s compensation plans. Winters said the issuance of 340 million shares in compensation would be taking $13 billion from the company shareholders and giving it to executives. Winters said the plan ""will significantly erode the per-share value of Coke shares."" Warren Buffett is the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola stock with a 9.1% stake in the company. Wintergreen owns about 2.5 million shares of Coca-Cola and is also a large shareholder in Buffett\'s Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nYahoo\'s Aaron Task said Winters is doing a service by highlighting the issue of employee compensation, since there hasn’t been a lot of shareholder activism on this issue. “[Winters is] saying as a shareholder, ‘I’m basing my investments on what the current levels of both earnings and per share and if the share count explodes by 340 million because of this compensation, well that dilutes my ownership of the company.’” Task added, “He’s doing us a favor.”\n\nTask said members of the “One Percent” are having the discussion about executive compensation, and noted that Warren Buffet has talked a lot about reigning it in. “We talk a lot about income inequality and transfers of wealth in this country,” said Task. “These are wealthy people saying, ‘Wait a minute, this corporation is taking wealth out of our pockets - out of the shareholders pockets.’”\n\nWhich brings us to today\'s poll question: ""How do you think Coca-Cola\'s executive compensation plan will impact the stock and shareholders?""

The user-generated personal expressions will be collected through April 10, and then featured in the commercial.\n\nCoca-Cola also updates the AHH.com website, adding more refreshing energy and updated interactive games to the digital world of ahh.

Shareholders are, in effect, being asked to give Coca-Cola management…14.2% of the company,”\u200b Winters says.\n\n“These billions of dollars given to management will come at the sole expense of the many teachers, nurses, federal and state government employees, and union members, who have invested their hard-earned saving in Coca-Cola shares, either directly or through pensions and mutual funds.”\u200b\n\nAt a time when Coke faces slowing growth in sales and profit, Winters insists it is not in the interest of shareholders to compound company headwinds by diluting the value of their holdings.\n\n\'Winters is misinformed\' - Coke fires back\u200b\n\nBut the company hit back today in a statement sent to BeverageDaily.com: ""The recent statement by Mr. Winters about our 2014 Equity Plan is misinformed and does not reflect the facts,""\u200b a spokesperson said.\n\n""The long-term equity compensation program is tied directly to the achievement of specific business goals and the financial health of the Company. Therefore, if the Company does not meet these goals, these awards are not earned. This pay-for-performance philosophy has been a consistent cornerstone of the program through the years and remains unchanged. \u200b\n\n""The board fully stands behind the Company’s compensation program and believes this plan incorporates performance metrics that link the interests of employees to those of Company shareowners,"" it added. \u200b\n\nWinters states in his letter that Coca-Cola is a ""mature business in a low-growth industry…a large portion of the company’s growth in per-share earnings and value must come from shrinking the number of shares outstanding, so each share is entitled to a larger share of company profits"".\u200b\n\n“Rather than shrinking the number of slices in the pie and increasing the size of each of our slices, management wants to take a $13bn bite out of the pie at the expense of all shareholders,”\u200b he adds.\n\n“It not seems that the company’s executives are more interested in increasing the value of their own accounts, with shareholders footing the bill.”\u200b\n\nIn a separate letter to Buffet urging Berkshire Hathaway to vote down the deal, Winters also notes the proposed plan allows the Coca-Cola Compensation Committee to exclude write-downs, impairments and other extraordinary items when assessing executive pay levels.\n\n“They can, in effect, move the goal posts closer once the ball is in the air,”\u200b he added.\n\n\'The facts are as follows\' - Coca-Cola\u200b\n\nBut expanding on its statement above, The Coca-Cola Company said that ""contrary to the statements of Mr Winters, the facts are as follows""\u200b:\n\nThe proposed 2014 Equity Plan will not change the Company’s long-term equity compensation practices. The plan is not limited to senior executives, but extends to a large group of employees and is important for incentive and retention. Approximately 6,400 were eligible in 2013. The amount of long-term equity compensation awards granted each year are within industry norms.\n\nWe repurchase significantly more stock than what is related to grants under our equity plan, so that shareholders receive significant value. Share repurchases in 2013 totaled $4.8bn, and in 2012, $4.5bn. Of these amounts $1.3bn and $1.4bn respectively, were related to equity plan activity. We plan to continue that practice.\n\nAs noted in the proxy, actual dilution is anticipated to be less than the potential calculations as they do not take into account the impact of the share repurchase program and any equity awards under existing plans that are not earned or are cancelled, terminated or forfeited.\n\nThe 2014 Equity Plan incorporates a number of “best practice” and shareowner friendly provisions, such as no re-pricing of stock options, no liberal share counting and “double-trigger” change in control vesting.\n\n(Photo of Muhtar Kent: Stefen Chow/Fortune Global Forum)', 'Shareholders are, in effect, being asked to give Coca-Cola management…14.2% of the company,”\u200b Winters says.\n""The long-term equity compensation program is tied directly to the achievement of specific business goals and the financial health of the Company.\nThe amount of long-term equity compensation awards granted each year are within industry norms.\nWe repurchase significantly more stock than what is related to grants under our equity plan, so that shareholders receive significant value.\nOf these amounts $1.3bn and $1.4bn respectively, were related to equity plan activity.']"

The settlement is being dispensed in the form of credits in one’s Amazon AMZN, -0.70% or Barnes & Noble US:BKS account, and can only be redeemed at those sites. According to Amazon: “Credits cannot be transferred or redeemed for cash.” Those who bought e-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple and Kobo will have money credited to those accounts, while those who bought their books at other — mostly smaller — retailers will receive checks. What’s more, the size of payments are contingent not only on how many e-books were purchased, but how popular they were: Those who bought an e-book between April 1, 2010 and May 21, 2012 get credits of $3.17 for each New York Times best seller, but only $0.73 for non-best sellers, totaling $166 million. (In Minnesota, which reached a separate settlement, consumers receive a credit of $3.93 or $0.94 per e-book.)\n\nThe ruling came two years after the U.S. Department of Justice accused Apple and five book publishers of anti-competitive practices; the latest settlement came after state Attorney Generals filed lawsuits seeking refunds for their residents. (Read the settlement here.) “Illegal actions by these publishers forced consumers in New York and across the nation to pay artificially inflated prices for e-books,” New York’s Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nFive publishers settled with the federal government and terminated agreements made with Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.65% in 2010, in the weeks before the launch of the first iPad. Those publishers include HarperCollins, Lagardère’s Hachette, CBS’s CBS, -2.83% Simon & Schuster, Pearson’s Penguin Group and the Macmillan unit of Georg von Holtzbrinck. (HarperCollins, like MarketWatch, is part of News Corp. NWSA, +0.50% ) Amazon.com has since cut the prices of e-books. (Apple decided to go to trial and that case continues in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.)\n\nALSO SEE: Amazon’s killer app isn’t Prime. It’s time.\n\nAmazon is the biggest winner in this, experts say. “Amazon profited from the original sale of the full-priced e-books for which the publishers got in trouble, and now they’re profiting again when consumers redeem the credits,” says Mark Coker, founder of e-book distributor Smashwords.com. (A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment.) “This is just feeding Amazon’s growth and market share,” adds Peter Hildick-Smith, president of market researcher Codex Group. Amazon Kindle has over 60% of the U.S. e-book market, he says, “so they will obviously get the lion’s share of the credit spending reimbursed by the settlement fund, while also taking a lot of those book buyers out of the rest of the market for a few weeks.”\n\nReaders are divided on how to spend the credits — on more e-books or print versions. It’s new book release day on Tuesday, says Tyler Cowen, professor of economics at George Mason University and blogger at marginalrevolution.com, and he’d like to go to his local independent book store to see what’s on the table . “I’ve bought a few hundred e-books, usually for airplane reading, but still I prefer physical books.” Cowen, however, would have to spend his $47.49 Amazon credit at Amazon.com. Although he would have liked to have had the choice to buy music or DVDS, Webber says he will return to Amazon to splurge. “I have a filthy book buying habit and like any book junkie I need money to support it,” he says.\n\nALSO SEE: 10 things billionaires won’t tell you\n\nMany consumers don’t have enough credit for even one new book, while others may be forced to go online due to the closure of many independent bookstores. Julia Bush, a University of Missouri School of Journalism student, says she will spend her $1.46 rebate on a cup of coffee. Hildick-Smith, who received his own $3.17 Amazon credit on Tuesday, says book access and even fiction-reading has actually declined with the significant loss of physical store book selling space due to Borders Group’s collapse and the reallocation of roughly one-third of bookseller space to non-book merchandise because of competition from Amazon. “Not everyone has the income to buy Kindles for all their kids and Wi-Fi at home,” he adds.\n\nConsumers have largely benefited from the settlement, experts say, at least in the short-term. “Publishers of e-books have lowered the prices of books dramatically,” Cowen says. The average price of best-selling e-books depends on how many self-published titles are on the list. The average price currently hovers at $7.65, up from $5.36 in January, just $0.09 off an all-time low in December 2013, according to DigitalBookWorld.com. Even paper book aficionados are happy. “That suppliers should be punished for cartelizing such a dynamic and rapidly-changing market seems absurd,” Cowen adds. “If people are worried about monopolies they should focus on hospitals and public education.”\n\nOther articles by Quentin Fottrell:\n\nMajority of Americans never read novels\n\nIs Netflix model the future of e-books?\n\nIf Nook goes bust, will your e-books survive?', 'Amazon Kindle Fire HDXBook buyers awoke Tuesday morning to find wads of digital cash (or at least some loose change) in their inboxes, windfalls courtesy of publishers’ settlements in an e-book antitrust case.\nThe settlement is being dispensed in the form of credits in one’s Amazon AMZN, -0.70% or Barnes & Noble US:BKS account, and can only be redeemed at those sites.\nAccording to Amazon: “Credits cannot be transferred or redeemed for cash.” Those who bought e-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple and Kobo will have money credited to those accounts, while those who bought their books at other — mostly smaller — retailers will receive checks.\n(In Minnesota, which reached a separate settlement, consumers receive a credit of $3.93 or $0.94 per e-book.)\n“I’ve bought a few hundred e-books, usually for airplane reading, but still I prefer physical books.” Cowen, however, would have to spend his $47.49 Amazon credit at Amazon.com.']"

Schneiderman today announced that consumers of electronic books (E-books) will be receiving compensation this week pursuant to settlements entered into by the New York Attorney General and the Attorneys General of numerous other states with five of the six largest publishers of electronic books. The settlements arose out of an investigation and subsequent lawsuit brought by New York and 32 other states against publishers Hachette Book Group Inc., HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Simon & Schuster Inc., Holtzbrinck Publishers, LLC, d/b/a Macmillan, and Penguin Group (USA) Inc., as well as Apple, Inc., alleging anticompetitive activity in the E-book industry. After the publishers settled, a trial was held earlier this year with respect to the claims against Apple. A court found that the publishers and Apple had engaged in an illegal conspiracy that restricted price competition and raised the retail prices of E-books.\n\n“Illegal actions by these publishers forced consumers in New York and across the nation to pay artificially inflated prices for E-books,” said Attorney General Schneiderman. “Companies engaging in such anticompetitive conduct will be punished—and starting today, those injured by their actions will start to receive full and fair compensation.”\n\nThe settlements with the five publishers totaled $166 million nationwide. Approximately $11.5 million is expected to be distributed to E-book purchasers residing in New York. The settlements were approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 6, 2013. Two of the settlements were negotiated together with private counsel representing consumers in states whose attorneys general had not joined the litigation.\n\nPursuant to the settlements, New Yorkers who purchased E-books from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Kobo or Apple will automatically receive a credit on their E-book accounts. Purchasers of E-books from Sony will automatically receive refund checks in the mail. Consumers who purchased E-books from other retailers, and who filed a timely claim form with the Settlement Administrator, will receive refund checks in the mail. The amount of the account credits or money to be received by New Yorkers will be based upon the number of eligible E-books purchased during the claims period (April 1, 2010 to May 21, 2012). For more information on the settlements, visit www.ebookagsettlements.com.\n\nThe case against Apple Inc. continues. In June 2013, following a three-week bench trial in the liability phase of the case, U.S. District Judge Denise Cote found Apple guilty of facilitating and executing a conspiracy to eliminate retail price competition in order to raise the retail prices of E-books, in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. A second trial, to decide the amount of damages Apple must pay for this violation, is expected to take place later this year. New York, along with Texas, Connecticut, and other states, is expected to take a leading role at the trial.\n\nThis matter is being handled for New York by Assistant Attorneys General Robert L. Hubbard and Linda J. Gargiulo, Antitrust Bureau Chief Eric Stock, Antitrust Acting Deputy Chief Geralyn J. Trujillo and Executive Deputy Attorney General Karla G.

Cote said that Apple knew that no publisher could risk acting alone to try to eliminate Amazon.com�s $9.99 price for the most popular e-books, so it �created a mechanism and environment that enabled them to act together in a matter of weeks to eliminate all retail-price competition for their e-books.�\n\nThe e-book publishers � Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Simon & Schuster, Macmillan and Penguin Group � settled the claims against them, without admitting wrongdoing, for a total payment of $166 million; $4.7 million of that will be distributed to Ohio consumers.\n\nA federal court approved the settlement on Dec. 6.\n\nStarting this week, Ohio consumers will receive either an account credit or a check based on the number of eligible e-books they bought during the claims period of April 1, 2010, to May 21, 2012.

We are going to get a big lift to second-quarter growth from the weather,” said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 82.3 from 78.3 in February. That is the highest level since January 2008, just as recession started to take hold, and it beat economists’ expectations for a reading of only 78.6.\n\nThe jump in confidence bodes well for the economy’s prospects, even though consumers were less upbeat about the labor market.\n\nU.S. stocks and the dollar rose in response to the confidence report.\n\nAn unusually cold and snowy winter has held back the economy, disrupting activity ranging from hiring to spending and manufacturing. Growth in the first quarter is expected to have slowed considerably from the fourth-quarter’s annualized 2.4 percent pace.\n\nSeparately, the S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 0.8 percent in January on a seasonally adjusted basis. It followed a similar increase in December. Prices rose 13.2 percent from a year ago.\n\nThe house price gains, driven by a shortage of homes for sale, are bolstering household wealth and helping to support consumer spending.\n\n“The broad-based recovery in home prices which started just under two years ago remains well under way,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.\n\n“While home price appreciation is likely to slow later this year, the steady pace of home price gains should help further support the housing market recovery during the year.”\n\nWEATHER, TIGHT SUPPLIES HURT SALES\n\nBut the dearth of properties is also weighing on the housing market’s recovery.\n\nThe Commerce Department said new home sales fell 3.3 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000 units, the lowest level since last September.\n\nSales were off 1.1 percent from year-ago levels, the biggest year-on-year drop since September 2011.\n\nLast month’s drop brought new home sales in line with other data such as home resales and building activity that have offered a downbeat picture of the housing market.\n\nSome of the slowdown has been blamed on the harsh weather, but the tight supply and a run-up in mortgage rates are also taking a toll.\n\nWhile the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped from a peak of 4.49 percent in September to about 4.30 percent in February, it remains a full percentage point higher than it was a year ago.\n\n“Worsening affordability and still-tight inventory are leading more Americans to rethink home buying this year,” said Ellen Haberle, an economist at Redfin in Seattle.\n\nThough the number of new houses on the market was the highest since December 2010, inventory remains tight. At February’s sales pace, it would take 5.2 months to clear inventories, up from 5.0 months in January and the most since September. A supply of 6.0 months is normally considered healthy.\n\nSales in the Northeast tumbled 32.4 percent, the biggest decline since October 2012 and an indication that severe weather continued to hurt activity.\n\nSales fell 1.5 percent in the South, which also experienced harsh weather. They surged 36.7 percent in the Midwest, but fell 15.9 percent in the West.

Levie founded the company in 2005 and since then has become one of the most entertaining personalities on the tech startup scene.\n\nHere are seven things you probably didn't know about Levie:\n\n1. Levie started Box with friends he met in middle school\n\nLevie and Dylan Smith, now Box CFO, met at Islander Middle School in Mercer Island, Wash., and later cofounded the company. Jeff Queisser, VP of technical operations, met the two soon after. Sam Ghods, VP of technology, met them in 10th grade.\n\n2. Levie is an accomplished magician\n\nBefore entering the tech world, Levie practiced the not-so-dark arts of card tricks, among other illusions. Watch this video from Forbes where Levie shows off his chops.\n\n3. Like other famous tech CEOs, his start was inauspicious and included a garage (or two)\n\nFrom the archives: Box's first office 8 years ago, where we slept, worked, fought, pivoted, built. pic.twitter.com/VD1F9VPO2z — Aaron Levie (@levie) March 15, 2014\n\nLevie founded Box out of a University of Southern California dorm room, then moved to a garage owned by a family member and on to a house, where he slept in the garage.\n\n4. He's great on Twitter\n\nLevie is known to have a good sense of humor, which was on display after the company filed its IPO paperwork. The picture is of a law firm in Missouri that has no known connection to Box, with the tweet more of a nod to his higher profile and the company's legal risks going forward.\n\nShout out to my new Twitter followers. pic.twitter.com/GOScAznJxL — Aaron Levie (@levie) March 24, 2014\n\nIf you have a few minutes, his account is well worth perusing for gems like this.\n\nThat awkward moment when your startup doesn't have a drone strategy. — Aaron Levie (@levie) March 4, 2014\n\n5. He's not afraid of the big guys\n\nLevie has made no secret that he's targeting Microsoft, a company he has alternately lauded and derided.\n\nA native of Seattle, right next door to Microsoft's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, Levie recently told Entrepreneur that Microsoft isn't built to compete in the cloud industry.\n\n6. He's known for wearing bright-colored sneakers\n\nAaron Levie seen here being honored by the Churchill Club while sporting his signature orange kicks. Image: Flickr, Steve Jurvetson\n\nLevie eschews typical CEO footwear like wingtips for sneakers usually of the orange or red variety. The choice is understandable as he tends to do a lot of walking around Box's Los Altos headquarters.\n\n7. He took an angel investment from Mark Cuban — then split with him over the future of the business\n\nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban put $350,000 into Box with virtually no information.\n\nLevie first contacted the Dallas Mavericks owner with an unsolicited email. Levie said during a SXSW interview that Cuban later wrote Box a check without having ever met.\n\nThe first major outside investment the company had taken, the investment might be reasonably estimated at returning 1,500 to 5,000-times the original investment.\n\nBut Levie and Cuban began to disagree on the future strategy for the company. Cuban sold his shares to Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a venture capital firm that now owns a little more than 25% of Box."", 'The move also put the spotlight on 29 year-old Box CEO Aaron Levie.\nLevie is an accomplished magicianBefore entering the tech world, Levie practiced the not-so-dark arts of card tricks, among other illusions.\npic.twitter.com/VD1F9VPO2z — Aaron Levie (@levie) March 15, 2014Levie founded Box out of a University of Southern California dorm room, then moved to a garage owned by a family member and on to a house, where he slept in the garage.\npic.twitter.com/GOScAznJxL — Aaron Levie (@levie) March 24, 2014If you have a few minutes, his account is well worth perusing for gems like this.\n— Aaron Levie (@levie) March 4, 20145.']"

Meanwhile, Draper Fisher Jurvetson owns 25.5 percent. The numbers reveal Levie sold off much of his startup to raise the $414 million that funded Box’s rise to become an enterprise brand name.\n\nUpdate: As pointed out by Dan Primack at Fortune, our previously stated 4.1% figure does not take into account Levie’s unexecuted stock options, which total around 2,613,841 shares at various option prices. This would place Levie’s share of the company at just under 5.7% in total. You can see those shares from the S-1 filing here:\n\nAnother way to put it is that Levie didn’t have much choice. Box needed that funding. The startup is not profitable and notes in its plan to raise $250 million with an IPO that “we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future.” As Alex Wilhelm lays out in his summary of the S-1 document, Box saw losses of $168 million from January 2013-2014, largely due to huge advertising expenses. It looks like all that equity Levie traded away was to bring in money so Box could seduce enterprise CIOs into buying it.\n\nYou can see the rest of the cap table above, including COO Dan Levin with 2 percent, and co-founder/CFO Dylan Smith with 1.8 percent. These all add up to 72.9 percent of the company, leaving the rest of the equity for current and future employees, and what will be sold on the public market. Below you can see how Box’s investors got that equity from its many funding rounds listed in CrunchBase. DFJ got in early, contributing the whole $1.5 million Series A round in 2006, and participated in every round after to build its 25.5 percent position. The Wall Street Journal says the latest $100 million round was at a $2 billion valuation, which implies Box will likely be valued higher than that at IPO.\n\nYou might ask why Levie was willing to whittle his equity down to a nub. Well, many say that startup success is binary. You either win big or lose it all (barring soft landings). Whether you own a lot like Box’s top investors, or a little like its CEO, it’s all worth zero if the startup fails because it didn’t have enough capital to grow.\n\nThe 28-year-old CEO, known for his frequent magazine covers and red converse sneakers, has never seemed scared of bold moves.

Sign up for our free newsletter here.\n\nCloud storage and collaboration platform provider Box published its long-awaited IPO filing this afternoon, and the main revelation is how much cash it\'s burning.\n\nBox\'s cash burn has long been part of Silicon Valley gossip -- especially the careful off-the-record whispers of certain competitors -- but it\'s still a little stunning to see losses outstripping revenue for each of the last three years. In its most recent fiscal year, ended Jan. 31, Box lost $159 million on revenue of $124 million. That\'s why the company has had to raise more than $500 million in venture capital money, and why it needs to go public to raise more money now. It hopes to raise at least $250 million from the offering.\n\nAbout two-thirds of Box\'s operating expenses are going to sales and marketing. The company realized early on that online storage for consumers wasn\'t a great long-term business, so the company pivoted to serve business users. It has since hired a sizable enterprise sales force, with employees from places like Oracle and salesforce.com. Those people don\'t come cheap.\n\nBitcoin and mobile payments: Don\'t get your hopes up\n\nSo is this IPO a return to dot-com levels of exuberance? Perhaps, but there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\nThe enterprise pivot is working. Last year, 57% of orders came from enterprises, defined by Box as companies with more than 1,000 employees. That\'s pretty remarkable for a start-up that really only began catering to enterprises (as opposed to smaller businesses) about three years ago.\n\nLast year, 57% of orders came from enterprises, defined by Box as companies with more than 1,000 employees. That\'s pretty remarkable for a start-up that really only began catering to enterprises (as opposed to smaller businesses) about three years ago. There\'s tremendous upside. Right now, only 7% of Box\'s users are paid users. You read that correctly -- 93% of its users are individuals using the free version of the service. All of those customers are potential paying customers, as long as Box can continue to provide value to them, and successfully upsell organizations that have a lot of free users to paid versions that offer more control for IT.\n\nRight now, only 7% of Box\'s users are paid users. You read that correctly -- 93% of its users are individuals using the free version of the service. All of those customers are potential paying customers, as long as Box can continue to provide value to them, and successfully upsell organizations that have a lot of free users to paid versions that offer more control for IT. Customers are spending more each year. Box measures something it calls retention. It basically starts with customers who are spending at least $5,000 per year, then looks at how much they spent in the last 12 months, versus the 12 months prior. In all cases, those numbers are going up -- retention was 136% in the most recent period. As Box puts it, ""The increase in our retention rate from December 31, 2011 to January 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in user expansion, particularly expansion within larger enterprises, which oftentimes implement a limited initial deployment of our services before renewing their subscription on a broader scale."" In other words, customers are trying, liking, and buying more.\n\nBox measures something it calls retention.

In other words, customers are trying, liking, and buying more. Box as tool provider. If you\'re thinking of Box primarily as an online storage provider like Dropbox, you haven\'t been paying much attention to the company\'s moves over the last two years. Through acquisitions and a gradual expansion of its API set, Box is trying to position itself as a platform for collaboration. In particular, it\'s been reaching out to companies in verticals like health care, with the idea that as customers standardize on Box, the niche vendors who build software for those industries will integrate with Box. That could turn Box into a core part of the enterprise toolbox. Don\'t think of salesforce.com or Workday, which started by becoming indispensable to a particular part of each organization. Instead, think of Oracle, which came up with a core service -- data storage and retrieval -- on which every company relies. If you believe that user-friendly collaboration and information sharing are key to the future of work, then Box could become as indispensable as Oracle.\n\nThere are many huge competitors out there, not least Dropbox, which is making a similar enterprise pivot from a much larger consumer base, as well as big incumbents like Microsoft, which has been making money from the collaboration space for ages.\n\nBox bet early on certain tech trends, like the move to the cloud and the rise of multiplatform mobile-centric workforces. Those trends are playing out. Now the question is whether Box can execute on that vision while keeping its formidable competitors at bay.\n\nMore advice from The Motley Fool\n\n\n\n', ""Cloud storage and collaboration platform provider Box published its long-awaited IPO filing this afternoon, and the main revelation is how much cash it's burning.\nIn its most recent fiscal year, ended Jan. 31, Box lost $159 million on revenue of $124 million.\nLast year, 57% of orders came from enterprises, defined by Box as companies with more than 1,000 employees.\nRight now, only 7% of Box's users are paid users.\nRight now, only 7% of Box's users are paid users.""]"

Known for his quirky style — he typically sports neon-colored sneakers or laces — and dry sense of humor, he has a knack for riffing on any number of topics.\n\n“That awkward moment when your startup doesn’t have a drone strategy,” he tweeted earlier this month as Amazon was catching flak for a proposed high-tech delivery strategy.\n\nSmith, who has been serving as the company’s chief financial officer, has opted to stay behind the scenes for the most part But in 2010, at the age of 24, he appeared on Bravo’s “The Millionaire Matchmaker” reality television program.\n\n(In 16th paragraph, corrects to show only Levie dropped out of school, the other co-founder finished)', '(Reuters) - Data storage provider Box Inc aims to raise about $250 million in an initial public offering, becoming the latest contender from a wave of “cloud-based” companies to test the frothy market for technology listings.\nBox said its full-year loss widened to $169 million even as revenue doubled to $124 million.\nUS Venture Partners, which announced its first Box investment in 2008, is the second-largest shareholder with a 13 percent stake.\nAside from Dropbox, Box also faces competition from some of the biggest names in the Internet industry, including Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O).\nGoogle this month sharply slashed prices for its online storage service Drive, which was seen as a competitive move against Box and Dropbox.']"

Aaron Levie, the 29-year-old CEO and co-founder of the online file sharing and cloud content management service Box, is one of them.\n\nDrop out of college to start a tech company? Check. Turn down a mega-million dollar offer to maintain control of said company? Check. Wear jeans to work and constantly extol the benefits of disruptive technology? Check. Watch your company, now valued at roughly $2 billion, prepare to go public? Double check.\n\nRelated: Aaron Levie on Box\'s $1 Billion Valuation and Solving the World\'s \'Unsexy\' Problems\n\nLevie\'s young, he\'s innovative, he wears distinctive red Converse and, according to TechCrunch, he can be credited ""with bringing sexy back to enterprise startups."" In addition, after more than a year of intense speculation, it\'s finally official: Levie will soon add \'CEO and co-founder of a publicly traded company\' to his already impressive resume.\n\nAlthough, as of yet, he can\'t say he heads a profitable enterprise. Yesterday, Box filed its S-1 documentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission, unveiling previously undisclosed information about the company\'s finances: While its revenue has dramatically increased over the last few years (rising 111 percent year-over-year to $124.2 million by the end of Jan. 2014), so has its net losses (which widened from $112.6 million to $168.6 million over the same time period). The company plans to raise $250 million with an IPO, but notes that ""we do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future.""\n\nThe filing also revealed that Levie owns a considerably small percentage of the company he co-founded back in 2005.\n\nRelated: Candy Crush CEO: If You Don\'t Get Why We Are Worth $7.6 Billion, Then Play Our Game\n\nWhen Facebook filed its initial paperwork with the SEC in February 2012, for example, CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg owned 28.2 percent of the company. And when Groupon went public back in 2011, co-founders Andrew Mason and Eric Lefkofsky (Lefkosfsky replaced Mason as CEO back in February 2012) owned a combined 29.3 percent of class A shares and 83.4 percent of class B shares.\n\nLevie, in contrast, only owns 4.1 percent of Box. Meanwhile, Draper Fisher Jurveston, the Menlo-Park based venture capital firm that invested $1.5 million in series A funding back in 2006, owns 25.5 percent of the company, suggesting that Levie, in an effort to keep his unprofitable company afloat, was forced to sell off the majority of his equity.\n\nDespite his relatively measly stake, Levie remains the very public face of Box (and, one could argue, the most prominent and recognizable cheerleader for ""the cloud""). His letter in the SEC filing touches on all of Silicon Valley\'s most popular tropes (scrappy origin story, the importance of innovation, how technology will make the world a more efficient, transparent and ultimately better place, etc.) But Levie\'s most appealing trait remains his visible enthusiasm; Instead of a traditional sign-off, he concludes his letter with a ""Go Cloud!""\n\nRelated: Box CEO Aaron Levie: Microsoft Doesn\'t Have the DNA to Keep Up', 'Aaron Levie, the 29-year-old CEO and co-founder of the online file sharing and cloud content management service Box, is one of them.\nThe filing also revealed that Levie owns a considerably small percentage of the company he co-founded back in 2005.\nLevie, in contrast, only owns 4.1 percent of Box.\nDespite his relatively measly stake, Levie remains the very public face of Box (and, one could argue, the most prominent and recognizable cheerleader for ""the cloud"").\nRelated: Box CEO Aaron Levie: Microsoft Doesn\'t Have the DNA to Keep Up']"

The company, while promising, has yet to see a profitable year out of the last three. According to released financials, Box lost $168.6 million in its 2014 fiscal year on gross revenue of $124.2 million.\n\nBox has worked on a freemium model. Most of the company\'s users get unpaid access to its content. A small percentage of users pay for the content, and that revenue must cover the cost of all operations plus, eventually, profit. According to Box\'s SEC files, it has 25 million registered users who, among other things, represent 99 percent of the Fortune 500. However, of the more than 34,000 paying organizations include only 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nSuch a strategy puts a company like Box in a difficult position. It wants to expand and develop compelling new services, and yet its sales are low compared to its ambitions. Box has had $414 million in investment, which has given it some freedom to grow and develop its business model.\n\nAccording to the company\'s filing, Box has an accumulated deficit of $361.2 million that reflects ""the substantial investments we made to acquire new customers and develop our services."" In addition, the company plans continued expansion and does not expect to be profitable ""for the foreseeable future.""\n\nIt might seem to be like an early Groupon (GRPN) in its need for high marketing expenses, but Box already has a presence in virtually all the Fortune 500. There are tens of thousands of middle-sized companies -- those between roughly $10 million and $1 billion in annual revenue -- that might need collaborative software, but the cost of addressing that market is high simply because it is so diverse.\n\nBox had $109 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of January with another $44 million in working capital. An IPO is necessary to bring in the capital needed for long-term viability, whether or not the company has reached profitability. Although the paperwork mentions a $250 million aggregate offering price, that is more a formality than final number.\n\nInvestors should notice that Box has some significant competition even now -- Dropbox, Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), IBM (IBM), and EMC, to mention a few.', ""Box Inc., a company that provides cloud storage and content management to business users, filed paperwork Monday for an initial public offering.\nAccording to released financials, Box lost $168.6 million in its 2014 fiscal year on gross revenue of $124.2 million.\nAccording to Box's SEC files, it has 25 million registered users who, among other things, represent 99 percent of the Fortune 500.\nHowever, of the more than 34,000 paying organizations include only 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies.\nBox had $109 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of January with another $44 million in working capital.""]"

Walgreen expects generics to start helping its year-over-year performance again by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nWalgreen said a tough winter also affected its performance in the quarter by keeping customers away from its stores, forcing it to temporarily close some locations and adding about $23 million in snow removal costs.\n\nOverall, Walgreen Co. earned $754 million, or 78 cents per share, in the quarter that ended Feb. 28.

Shares climbed as much as 3 percent in early trading after the company reported decent second-quarter earnings. Second-quarter sales increased 5.1 percent on the year to $19.6 billion, effectively in line with the mean analyst estimate. For the first half of the year, sales were up 5.5 percent at $37.9 billion. Comparable store sales increased 4.3 percent in the second quarter, but customer traffic declined 1.4 percent. A 3.4 percent increase in basket size is consistent with the idea that although there may be less foot traffic through Walgreen stores, those customers are purchasing more. Part of the catalyst for bigger baskets is the successful ongoing rollout of the Balance Rewards loyalty program, which had 100 million enrollees and 80 million active members in February.\n\nT = Technicals on the Stock Chart Are Strong\n\nWalgreen stock has surged to the upside in recent quarters.

Solis, File)\n\nWalgreen\'s fiscal second quarter earnings slipped from a year ago as the nation\'s largest drugstore chain reaped a smaller benefit from generic drugs and took a $60 million hit due to rough winter weather.\n\nBut the Deerfield, Ill., company\'s underlying performance impressed investors, and its shares rose, approaching the all-time high that they reached last month.\n\nWalgreen executives said Tuesday that a wave of new generic drug introductions peaked in last year\'s quarter, which helped the company\'s bottom line then but made comparisons difficult for this year\'s quarter.\n\nGeneric drugs, which are cheaper alternatives to branded medicines, squeeze drugstore sales but improve profitability because they come with a wider margin between the cost for the pharmacy to purchase the drugs and the reimbursement it receives.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that the tough comparison between this year\'s quarters and last year will ease later this year. Walgreen expects generics to start helping its year-over-year performance again by the end of the fiscal year.\n\nWalgreen said a tough winter also affected its performance in the quarter by keeping customers away from its stores, forcing it to temporarily close some locations and adding about $23 million in snow removal costs.\n\nOverall, Walgreen Co. earned $754 million, or 78 cents per share, in the quarter that ended Feb. 28. That\'s down from $756 million, or 79 cents per share, a year ago.\n\nAdjusted earnings were 91 cents per share. Analysts expected 93 cents per share, according to FactSet.\n\nIts revenue rose to about 5 per cent to $19.61 billion and matched Wall Street expectations.\n\nWalgreen competitor CVS Caremark Corp. made a big splash nationally last month when it said it planned to phase out tobacco product sales from its stores by October. Walgreen stores still sell tobacco, and an analyst asked CEO Greg Wasson during a Tuesday morning conference call whether the company would stick with it unless such sales a banned by a local government.\n\nWasson didn\'t address the future of tobacco sales. Instead, he emphasized that the drugstore chain has pharmacists who can help people quit as well as smoking cessation products.\n\n""We think we\'re well-positioned to help folks change their behaviour,"" he said.\n\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas said Walgreen stores may gain some business from smokers once CVS quits selling tobacco.\n\n""We\'re in an environment right now where traffic is really tough to come by ... so every little bit helps,"" he said.\n\nWalgreen shares rose $1.95, or 3 per cent, to $66.26 after rising as high as $68.15 earlier in the day. The stock started 2014 strong, hitting an all-time high price of $69.84 at the end of last month.', ""Overall, Walgreen Co. earned $754 million, or 78 cents per share, in the quarter that ended Feb. 28.\nWasson didn't address the future of tobacco sales.\nInstead, he emphasized that the drugstore chain has pharmacists who can help people quit as well as smoking cessation products.\nGabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas said Walgreen stores may gain some business from smokers once CVS quits selling tobacco.\nWalgreen shares rose $1.95, or 3 per cent, to $66.26 after rising as high as $68.15 earlier in the day.""]"

Walgreens's main competitor, CVS Caremark (NYSE: CVS) recently announced plans to phase out the sale of tobacco products at its stores by October.\n\n“What we’re focused on is to help encourage our customers to make healthy choices, not just with cigarettes, but with their daily habits,” The Chicago Tribune reports Wasson telling investors during the call.\n\n“We think we’re well-positioned to help folks change their behavior who want to quit,” he added, apparently referring to the company's quit-smoking programs and products."", ""Walgreens (NYSE: WAG), the nation's largest drug store chain, says it will close 76 of its stores during the second half of fiscal 2014 as a cost-cutting measure, following a weaker-than-expected second quarter earnings report.\nThe company announced its second quarter net earnings at $754 million, or 78 cents per share – compared to $756 million or 79 cents a share in the same time period a year ago.\nIt also reported adjusted second quarter earnings per share of 91 cents, compared to 96 cents a year earlier, reportedly missing investor expectations by one cent.\nIn a Tuesday morning conference call, Wasson also said Walgreens will continue selling tobacco products.\nWalgreens's main competitor, CVS Caremark (NYSE: CVS) recently announced plans to phase out the sale of tobacco products at its stores by October.""]"

The combined synergies of Walgreen Company (NYSE:WAG) and Alliance Boots in the first half of 2014 were around $236 million.

( WAG ) reported adjusted net earnings of 91 cents per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2014, down 5.2% from the year-ago adjusted net earnings. The adjusted earnings also remained below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. On a reported basis, earnings came in at $754 million or 78 cents per share, down 0.2% or down 1.2% year over year, respectively.\n\nWalgreens' sales came in at $19,605 million in the quarter, up 5.1% year over year and marginally ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19,547 million.\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nFront-end comparable store (those open for at least a year) sales and basket size grew 2.0% and 3.4%, respectively, in the quarter. On the other hand, customer traffic in comparable stores was down 1.4%. Overall, comparable store sales improved 4.3%.\n\nPrescription sales (accounting for 62.2% of total sales in the quarter) climbed 7.0% over the prior-year quarter, while prescription sales in comparable stores increased 5.8%. Moreover, Walgreens filled 214 million prescriptions (up 2.8% year over year) during the reported quarter.\n\nPrescriptions filled at comparable stores rose 2.2%. As reported by IMS Health, Walgreens' market share in retail pharmacy improved 20 basis points (bps) to 19.0% at the end of Feb 2014.\n\nThe company's Balance Rewards loyalty program reached a milestone with approximately 100 million enrollees and 80 million active members at the end of the second quarter.\n\nGross profit increased a mere 0.8% year over year to $5.65 billion. However, gross margin contracted 125 bps to 28.8% due to fewer new generic drugs introduction, a less severe flu season and soft margin in front-end sales as the company made meaningful promotional investments to drive store traffic. The LIFO provision was $51 million in this year's second quarter versus $72 million last year.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses scaled up 1.6% to $4.6 billion. Operating margin contracted 44 bps to 5.5%.\n\nThe company opened/acquired 28 stores in the reported quarter compared with 29 in the year-ago quarter. As of Feb 28, 2014, the company operated in 8,681 locations in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including 8,210 drugstores (138 more compared with the year-ago period). The company also operates worksite health and wellness centers, infusion and respiratory service facilities, specialty pharmacies, mail service facilities, e-commerce business and Take Care Health Systems.\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nWalgreens exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.77 billion, significantly lower than $2.4 billion as of Feb 28, 2013. Long-term debt was higher at $4.49 billion in the reported quarter, compared with $5.1 billion as of Feb 28, 2013.\n\nMoreover, the company has generated year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.47 billion in the quarter compared with $1.17 billion in the same period last year.\n\nStriding Ahead on Synergy Track\n\nWalgreens' partnership with Alliance Boots is yielding positive results, with combined first half of fiscal 2014 synergies of $236 million. In the second quarter, the Alliance Boots deal was accretive to adjusted earnings by 8 cents. The company estimates that accretion from Alliance Boots in the third quarter will be an adjusted 13 to 14 cents per share. Moreover, the company expects second-year combined synergy programin the range of$375-$425 million, an increase from the previous second-year estimate of $350-$400 million.\n\nOur Take\n\nWalgreens reported a mixed fiscal second quarter with a bottom line miss and a marginal beat on the top-line front.The generic wave in the pharmaceutical industry is still a threat to revenues. This is also reflected in the company's quarterly sales figure.\n\nNonetheless, Walgreens is poised to generate higher profits from escalating sales of higher-margin generic drugs. The company is also positioned on a healthy dividend growth track. Further, the customer loyalty program is gaining traction as reflected in increasing registrations. This should improve customer traffic for Walgreens going forward. Moving on, the deal with Amerisource Bergen Corp. ( ABC ) - likely to create a leader in the generic and branded drug purchasing space- is another major upside.\n\nWalgreens currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While we choose to remain on the sidelines regarding WAG at present, drug retailers like Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD ) and CVS Caremark Corp. ( CVS ) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) are worth considering.\n\nAMERISOURCEBRGN (ABC): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nCVS CAREMARK CP (CVS): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nRITE AID CORP (RAD): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nWALGREEN CO (WAG): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."", ""Walgreen Co.

A slowdown in generic drug introduction and a mild flu season hampered the largest U.S. drugstore chain\'s performance.\n\nWalgreen reported a year-over-year decline in net income to $754 million, or 78 cents a share, from $756 million, or 79 cents a share. Profit excluding items was 91 cents, two cents less than the consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Walgreen said price cuts it made to compete with rivals during the difficult holiday season also put pressure on its second-quarter profit.\n\nGross profit margin declined 1.3% year over year to 28.8%. Sales rose 5.1% to $19.61 billion, while comparable-store sales in stores open at least a year rose 4.3% thanks mostly to prescription sales gains, which generate almost two-thirds of the company\'s revenue. Comparable-store sales of general merchandise ticked upward just 2% thanks to fewer shoppers entering Walgreen\'s drugstores.\n\nCEO Greg Wasson said the pressure from fewer new generic drugs would lighten in the second half of the fiscal year. The company also said its partnership with Alliance Boots Holdings, which runs the largest European pharmacy chain, could generate synergies between $375 million and $425 million, up $25 million from its previous estimate. Walgreen wants to combine the companies\' drug purchases and sell the European products in its stores.\n\nWalgreen bought 45% of Alliance Boots in 2012 with an option to buy the remainder in 2015.\n\nMust Read: Warren Buffett\'s 10 Favorite Stocks\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.\n\nTheStreet Ratings team rates WALGREEN CO as a ""buy"" with a ratings score of B+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n""We rate WALGREEN CO (WAG) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nThe revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 7.2%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 5.8%. Growth in the company\'s revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.\n\nPowered by its strong earnings growth of 67.44% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 66.94% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock\'s future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, WAG should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.\n\nWALGREEN CO reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past year. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, WALGREEN CO increased its bottom line by earning $2.56 versus $2.42 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.47 versus $2.56).\n\nThe net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Food & Staples Retailing industry. The net income increased by 68.3% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $413.00 million to $695.00 million.\n\nWAG\'s debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.25 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. Even though the company has a strong debt-to-equity ratio, the quick ratio of 0.42 is very weak and demonstrates a lack of ability to pay short-term obligations.\n\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: WAG Ratings Report\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

Sales fell to their slowest pace in five months, a sign that the housing market has yet to recover fully from brutal winter weather.\n\nWASHINGTON � Fewer people bought new U.S. homes in February. Sales fell to their slowest pace in five months, a sign that the housing market has yet to recover fully from brutal winter weather.\n\nSales of new homes declined 3.3 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 440,000, the Commerce Department said yesterday. That was down from a revised rate of 455,000 in January.\n\nBuying dropped off during February in the Northeast, which was battered by snowstorms. It also fell in Western states, where last year�s price increases have made homes less affordable.\n\nNew-home sales have declined 1.1 percent during the past 12 months. Despite the seasonal hit by a cold winter, sales are still on track to exceed the 428,000 total from 2013, when they rose 16.3 percent to their highest level in five years\n\nMost economists expect sales to rebound as the weather improves and the spring buying season begins. Not only does warmer weather bring more traffic to open houses, but families are usually reluctant to move in the middle of the school year.\n\nStill, several other indicators from February suggest that a sectorwide rebound has yet to begin.\n\nAn index tracking mortgage applications fell last month to its lowest level since December 2000. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported its seasonally adjusted index of refinancing and home-buying demand dropped 8.5 percent to 348.5 in the week that ended on Feb. 21.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors said last Thursday that sales declined 0.4 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 million.

Lending to the sluggishness in the housing market, January’s figure also was revised significantly lower than originally estimated, although an upward revision to December’s figure helped counterbalance the decline.\n\nThe Commerce Department said on Tuesday that new home sales, a measure of signed contracts to buy a newly built home (not the number of closings, as for existing home sales), slid by 3.3 percent to an annualized rate of 440,000 from a 445,000 pace in January, marking the slowest pace since September. The February report was a little worse than the 442,000 economists predicted.\n\nMeanwhile, January’s number was revised down from the original estimate of a 468,000 annualized rate based upon a more complete set of data. The original estimate for January represented a five-year high for new home sales. The downward revision still was the best in one year. December’s figure was increased by 14,000 to 441,000.\n\nCompared to February 2013, sales were off by 1.1 percent.\n\nThe frigid cold and snowy conditions that blanketed large swaths of the United States this winter has caused economists to pause and consider some soft economic reports from the last three months. At this point, it’s difficult to discern if there are some underlying problems that go deeper than just Mother Nature, including interest rates hikes that began last May and the rising cost of a new (or existing) home.\n\nThe median sales price of new houses sold in February 2014 was $261,800, according to the Commerce Department report. The average sales price was $317,500.\n\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index was also delivered on Tuesday, which showed that prices rose 13.2 percent in January, compared to a year earlier.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of February was 189,000. This represented a supply of 5.2 months at the current sales rate. The tight inventory has some housing pundits forecasting that pent-up demand with low supply leaves a lot of upside to new home sales going forward. The inventory may still be below the 6-month level that economists regard as a healthy market, but, at the same time, February’s new house stockpile is the most in 25 months.\n\nTypically, the housing markets gains steam in the spring as the warmer weather starts setting in and families look to make changes while kids are on summer vacation.\n\nFrom a regional perspective, annualized sales increased only in the Midwest during February, rising to 67,000 from 49,000 in January. Sales in the South dipped from 259,000 to 255,000; from 113,000 to 95,000 in the West and from 34,000 to 24,000 in the Northeast.\n\nWall Street is taking the report with a grain of salt. As mentioned, the vote is not in yet on the impact of the weather and there seems to be bullish sentiment that the housing market will soon be back on the path to recovery.

In short, too many new investors chasing what\'s been a monumental ride for these stocks. And who can blame them for wanting a piece of this action? The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF , for example, is up 54% over a year.\n\nThe data from EPFR show the extent to which the health-care/biotech segment has been wiping the floor with almost every other sector. As Barron\'s Brendan Conway pointed out recently, biotech ETFs have ""vacuumed up more money in the new year than they did in all of 2013.""\n\nWhile Tuesday marked an attempt at a rebound for biotechs , fears that the sector could be overheating, along with some eye-popping IPOs, have caused some investors to give up the chase. The Nasdaq Biotech ETF has tumbled nearly 10% so far this month, and a good chunk has come in the last two trading sessions.\n\nLong-term investors may be hanging on. Analysts at Baird and RBC are among advising that over the long haul, the sector has much to offer, and that the selloff is creating opportunity. But some of that money -- and of course it remains to be seen how much -- may have been chased away for good, or at least the equivalent to a good long while in the world of investing.\n\nHenrik Drusebjerg, senior strategist at Nordea, explains that many investors have been pushed into equities, and in the process went for the sector they viewed as safest -- health care -- though in buying the sector, via funds and ETFs, were also at times getting exposed to biotech stocks. (Bubbles have been taking place largely in biotechs, but he says if you look at the overall health-care sector, it\'s still one of the places where analysts have a hard time making their estimates match the actual developments, and estimates are being downgraded, says Drusebjerg).\n\n""A lot of investors were facing the fact that if they want a return on their investments, increasingly over the last year at least, they had to take more and more equities on because interest rates are so extremely low and bonds are so extremely expensive. They had to increase their risk to maintain the return they were trying to obtain,"" explains Drusebjerg.\n\nAnd as for the money being pulled out, the natural question is where will it go next.\n\nDrusebjerg expects that in the coming weeks, markets will see the start of a sector rotation from health care into cyclicals, such as financials and industrials -- a move that he\'s already made. Moves into cyclical stocks often reflect a rise in confidence in the economy. He also likes IT, as it\'s one of the few sectors where he\'s seeing earnings revisions. Amid signs that U.S. and European companies are starting to invest, he expects the first wave of money will be spent on upgrading technology.\n\nWhile he\'s not putting cash on the sidelines, he says it wouldn\'t be surprising to see some investors park ex-biotech dollars in cash.\n\nBut the rotation could be delayed for weeks until investors see signs that the U.S. economy is looking up and that the this winter\'s harsh weather hasn\'t masked deeper economic problems.\n\nDrusebjerg is not the only one eying financials. In a note to clients on Monday, BTIG upgraded financials to overweight, citing economic improvement, rising interest rates and just-completed bank stress tests. Most banks included in the test appear set to improve on capital returns, which should boost assumptions for returns across the sector, says BTIG strategist Dan Greenhaus.\n\nGreenhaus also cut his view on consumer discretionary to underweight. He expects the economy will accelerate, with consumer de-leveraging apparently on the wane, both positives for consumers, but believes the discretionary sector\'s best days are behind it.\n\n""The bulk of housing\'s adjustment is behind us and while we don\'t fear higher interest rates as some of our contemporaries do, we don\'t think the stocks will react as positively going forward as they have in the recent past,"" says Greenhaus.\n\n-- Barbara Kollmeyer writes for MarketWatch.

New York - US stocks ended higher on Tuesday, rebounding from a two-day decline as the hard-hit biotechnology sector regained its momentum and a strong read on consumer confidence increased optimism about the economy. Trading was choppy throughout the day with the Nasdaq at one point turning lower, led by a sharp reversal in biotech shares. So-called momentum stocks were still down for the day but off their lows, including Netflix, down 2.1 percent at $370.84. Netflix has declined for 14 of the past 15 sessions, falling almost 19 percent over that stretch Biotech shares also reversed earlier losses, including Regeneron Pharma, ending 0.8 percent higher at $308.87, and Gilead Sciences Inc, up 1.3 percent at $73.03. Alexion Pharma ended 2.2 percent higher at $153.08.\n\nThe rebound in some so-called “momentum” names was an indication that while concerns persist about geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and slowing growth in China, investors are not so bearish on equities as to sell them wholesale.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, fell 7.1 percent to 14.02.\n\n“Investors become momentarily concerned about valuation, but that pullback was healthy, and we could see modest gains from here just because equities remain the most attractive place to be,” said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York, which has $475 billion in assets under management.\n\n“Biotechs continue to look attractive since they offer a higher level of growth, and in fact, they look more attractive than they did because valuations improved in the selloff.”\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 91.19 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 16,367.88.

In short, last year's winners are falling hardest as investors run scared,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\n“However, as we look at the pattern of investor interest expressed through options trading, there are few signs that derivative traders are prepared to throw in the towel.”\n\nThe largest open interest for Facebook options was seen in $70 calls that expire in April and May. The stock ended 1.2 percent higher at $64.89. Call options are generally viewed as bullish bets, expecting the stock to move higher.\n\nInvestors continued to watch global issues cautiously. On Monday, major stock indexes fell on concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, pushing traders to take profits in such high-flying sectors as biotech and Internet shares. Those names rebounded on Tuesday, with some of Monday's biggest decliners topping the list of advancing S&P 500 names.\n\nIn the latest on the housing market, US single-family home prices rose slightly more than expected in January, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, while new home sales fell more than expected in February. - Reuters"", 'Wall Street rebounds.\nTrading was choppy throughout the day with the Nasdaq at one point turning lower, led by a sharp reversal in biotech shares.\nSo-called momentum stocks were still down for the day but off their lows, including Netflix, down 2.1 percent at $370.84.\nSupporting the rebound in momentum stocks on Tuesday, bullish bets were placed on those names in the options market.\n“Momentum stocks took all the punches Monday, with biotech especially and social media stocks taking a thumping.']"

By about 3 p.m., the index was down only 0.2 percent after moving quickly in and out of positive territory.\n\n“Anecdotally, it does seem that when there’s upside momentum, people jump into risky names, and then they bail fairly quickly when they have concerns,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.\n\n“I wouldn’t say that the market at large is at risk of falling just because these did. There’s nothing on the S&P that would make people concerned from a technical perspective. We’re well above the 50-day moving average and haven’t touched the 200-day in years. So far, fund flows indicate that people aren’t leaving equities.”\n\nContributing to volatility, selling pressure has also intensified of late as valuations reach levels not seen in almost a decade. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 recently hit its highest since early 2005, and is trading above the historical median, according to Thomson Reuters IBES data.\n\nSo-called momentum stocks were still down for the day but off their lows, including Netflix, down 2.2 percent at $370.41. Netflix has declined for 14 of the past 15 sessions, falling almost 19 percent over that stretch.\n\nBiotech shares also reversed earlier losses, including Regeneron Pharma, up 0.4 percent at $307.45, and Gilead Sciences Inc, up 1.1 percent at $72.92.\n\nData showed consumer confidence rose more than expected in March, climbing to its highest level since January 2008. The report was the latest in a string of positive reads on the U.S. economy that supported theories that softness early this year was related to bad weather and not weakening fundamentals.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 97.58 points, or 0.60 percent, at 16,374.27. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 7.53 points, or 0.41 percent, at 1,864.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7.31 points, or 0.17 percent, at 4,233.69.\n\nBULLISH BETS ON MOMENTUM STOCKS\n\nThe rebound in some so-called “momentum” names was an indication that while concerns persist about geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and slowing growth in China, investors are not so bearish on equities as to sell them wholesale.\n\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, fell 4 percent. The VIX remains at historically low levels.\n\n“Momentum stocks took all the punches Monday, with biotech especially and social media stocks taking a thumping. In short, last year’s winners are falling hardest as investors run scared,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\n“However, as we look at the pattern of investor interest expressed through options trading, there are few signs that derivative traders are prepared to throw in the towel.”\n\nFacebook Inc was the second-most active equity option on Tuesday, with largest open interest seen in $70 calls that expire in April and May. The stock was up 1 percent at $64.77. Call options are generally viewed as bullish bets, expecting the stock to move higher.\n\nInvestors continued to watch global issues cautiously. On Monday, major stock indexes fell on concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, pushing traders to take profits in such high-flying sectors as biotech and Internet shares. Those names rebounded on Tuesday, with some of Monday’s biggest decliners topping the list of advancing S&P 500 names.\n\nIn the latest on the housing market, U.S. single-family home prices rose slightly more than expected in January, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, while new home sales fell more than expected in February.

While the major large-cap averages are hanging just below record highs, much of the rest of the market is coming under intense selling pressure focused on two of the most popular sectors: Big tech and biotech.\n\nJust look at the way Google (GOOG), which has been on a tear since reporting good earnings back in October, is collapsing below its 50-day moving average and is on track for its first five-day decline since January 2013. Or the way the iShares Biotech (IBB) is on track to close below its 100-day exponential moving average for the first time since late 2012.\n\nThere\'s more. Momentum favorites like Tesla Motors (TSLA), Netflix (NFLX), and Twitter (TWTR) are all rolling over badly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overall impression is that investors are rushing for the exits, spooked by last week\'s surprisingly hawkish read from new Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen in which she indicated that not only is the ongoing ""QE3"" bond purchase program set to end but short-term interest rates could start rising as soon as this time next year. That\'s sooner than the market had priced in. And it\'s shocking to many given the recent slowing in the economic data.\n\nSure, there are some sector-specific drags happening:\n\nFor biotech, selling was encouraged by a letter from House Democrats raising concern over the pricing of Gilead Sciences\' (GILD) Solvadi hepatitis C drug, which costs $84,000 per treatment. Although GILD recovered from steep losses on Thursday to finish with a small gain, the bloom has come off the sector group as lofty valuations come under pressure from possible political pushback.\n\nBut the overall market is feeling heavy. So it\'s not surprising that the most extended, most vulnerable stocks roll over first.\n\nConsider that the number of S&P 500 stocks in uptrends has rolled over for the first time since early January after setting a much lower high. When the market peaked in January, nearly 84 percent of S&P 500 stocks were in uptrend; but now, we only hit a peak of 78 percent. That\'s a sign of buying exhaustion as traders found fewer and fewer attractive issues during the February-March rally.\n\nOr that we\'ve seen a frantic rotation out of cyclical, economically-sensitive sectors like technology into more defensive areas like utilities over the last few weeks. While much of the market is in the red year-to-date, the Utilities Sector SPDR (XLU) is up more than eight percent. In fact, we\'re looking at the most meaningful rotation into defensive stocks since early 2013.\n\nAnthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge and Edge Pro investment advisory newsletters, as well as Mirhaydari Capital Management, a registered investment advisory firm.', ""Or the way the iShares Biotech (IBB) is on track to close below its 100-day exponential moving average for the first time since late 2012.\nConsider that the number of S&P 500 stocks in uptrends has rolled over for the first time since early January after setting a much lower high.\nWhen the market peaked in January, nearly 84 percent of S&P 500 stocks were in uptrend; but now, we only hit a peak of 78 percent.\nWhile much of the market is in the red year-to-date, the Utilities Sector SPDR (XLU) is up more than eight percent.\nIn fact, we're looking at the most meaningful rotation into defensive stocks since early 2013.""]"

While the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 10.18 points or 0.2 percent at 4,216.21, the Dow is up 52.18 points or 0.3 percent at 16,328.87 and the S&P 500 is up 2.89 points or 0.2 percent at 1,860.33.\n\nThe early strength on Wall Street partly reflected a positive reaction to the latest batch of U.S. economic data, including a report from the Conference Board showing a significant improvement in consumer confidence in the month of March.\n\nThe Conference Board said its consumer confidence index jumped to 82.3 in March from a revised 78.3 in February. Economists had been expecting the index to edge up to 78.4.\n\nWith the much bigger than expected increase, the consumer confidence index reached its highest level since January of 2008.\n\n""Consumer confidence improved in March, as expectations for the short-term outlook bounced back from February\'s decline,"" said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board.\n\nA separate report from Standard & Poor\'s showed that home prices in major metropolitan areas rose slightly more than expected in January, while the Commerce Department reported a drop in new home sales in February.\n\nBuying interest waned over the course of the morning, however, as traders continued to express uncertainty about whether the current state of the supports further upside for the markets.\n\nWhile some recent data points to the economy breaking out of the winter doldrums, traders seem to be waiting for more concrete evidence of a recovery.\n\nAmong individual stocks, shares of Sonic (SONC) are moving sharply higher after the restaurant operator reported better than expected second quarter earnings growth and provided upbeat full-year guidance.\n\nItalian eyewear maker Luxottica (LUX) is also seeing strength on news that the company has reached an agreement to design, develop and distribute a new breed of eyewear for Google Glass.\n\nOn the other hand, shares of Carnival (CCL) have moved to the downside after the cruise operator warned that it might post a loss for the current quarter due to higher costs.\n\nSector News\n\nExtending the downward move seen over the past few sessions, biotechnology stocks have come under significant selling pressure. The NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index has fallen by 1.4 percent, moving lower for the fifth straight session.\n\nPharmacyclics (PCYC), BioMarin (BMRN), and Illumina (ILMN) are turning in some of the biotech sector\'s worst performances in mid-day trading.\n\nBrokerage stocks have also shown a notable move to the downside, dragging the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index down by 1.2 percent. FXCM Inc. (FXCM) is posting a steep loss on the day.\n\nMeanwhile, considerable strength remains visible among airline stocks. The NYSE Arca Airline Index has pulled back well off its best levels but is still up by 1.2 percent.\n\nSteel, computer hardware, and oil service stocks also continue to see notable strength, although they have given back ground from earlier in the session.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly lower during trading on Tuesday. Japan\'s Nikkei 225 Index dropped by 0.4 percent, while Hong Kong\'s Hang Seng Index ended the day down by 0.5 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets have shown strong moves to the upside on the day. While the U.K.\'s FTSE 100 Index has advanced by 1.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are up by 1.3 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries have climbed back near the unchanged line after seeing early weakness.

A spokesman for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management said the leak was plugged by 1 a.m. today.\n\nThe effect on Lake Michigan, the source of drinking water for 7 million people in Chicago and the suburbs, likely won’t be determined for several days. Emergency response crews from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard are on the scene.\n\nBP laid booms on the water in an attempt to keep the oil from spreading beyond a cove between the refinery’s wastewater treatment plant and an Arcelor Mittal steel mill. Winds were pushing the oil toward the shore and frigid temperatures caused some of it to harden into a waxy consistency that made it easier to collect, said Scott Dean, a BP spokesman.\n\nThe malfunction apparently occurred at the refinery’s largest distillation unit, the centerpiece of a $4 billion overhaul that allowed BP to process more heavy Canadian oil from the tar sands region of Alberta. The unit, which Dean said has resumed normal operations, performs one of the first steps in the refining of crude oil into gasoline and other fuels.\n\nSENATOR CARL LEVIN STATEMENT\n\nMichigan Sen.

43886,http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/03/25/3418808/oil-leaks-lake-michigan/,business,"['A BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana leaked up to 1,638 gallons of oil into Lake Michigan Monday afternoon, an incident that occurred less than two weeks after the U.S. lifted BP’s ban on seeking new oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBP says the spill, which has since been stopped and contained, was caused by a “disruption in the refining process” at its Whiting refinery in northwest Indiana. Dan Goldblatt, spokesman at the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, told ThinkProgress that his office was notified at about 4:30 CDT Monday of an oil sheen, which EPA officials said on a press call Thursday totaled about 5,000 square yards, on Lake Michigan. Mike Beslow, On-Scene Coordinator for the EPA, said that when he visited the site around 9 p.m. Monday, the sheen was no longer visible.\n\nLake Michigan acts as the drinking water source for 7 million people in the Chigago area alone, but EPA officials said on the call that the drinking water wouldn’t be affected by the spill. The EPA, BP and the Coast Guard are leading the cleanup effort, which involves placing booms on the water, scooping up oil, which has been turned hard and waxy by cold weather, with their hands, and cleaning up a nearby beach that was contaminated. BP told Reuters that they have had “no reports of any wildlife impacted,” and EPA officials confirmed this on the call.\n\nThe presence of a sheen on a body of water is typically viewed as a violation of the Clean Water Act, and EPA Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman said during the call that officials would look into whether action should be taken against BP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can assure you that EPA’s lawyers will be looking at this matter and determining whether or not enforcement action will be appropriate,” she said.\n\nThe Whiting refinery, which was recently upgraded to process oil from the Canadian tar sands, has drawn the ire of environmentalists in the past, due to its pollution of Lake Michigan. Last September, Indiana regulators ruled that BP must cut the amount of mercury pollution it releases annually into Lake Michigan from the refinery from 23.1 parts per trillion of to 8.75 parts per trillion. The new rule marks a “modest but significant” change, according to the NRDC, but is still above the federal mercury limit of 1.3 parts per trillion.\n\nThe Whiting refinery was also at the center of a November lawsuit by Chicago residents, who sued BP, Koch Industries, and other companies over the storage of vast piles of petroleum coke, a byproduct left over from the refining of tar sands oil. The Whiting refinery currently produces about 600,000 tons per year of petcoke, but the recent $3.8 billion expansion has the potential to up its petcoke production to 2.2 million tons per year.\n\nSpokespersons at BP did not immediately respond to ThinkProgress’ request for comment. The spill comes on the heels of a barge collision that spilled up to 170,000 gallons of oil into into Galveston Bay Saturday, and just over a week after a spill of 20,000 gallons of oil was reported in an Ohio nature reserve.\n\nUpdate:\n\nBP now estimates that 15 to 39 barrels — or 630 to 1,638 gallons — of oil spilled into the lake, which is an increase from previous estimates of 378 to 756 gallons. This post has been updated to reflect that information.', 'A BP refinery in Whiting, Indiana leaked up to 1,638 gallons of oil into Lake Michigan Monday afternoon, an incident that occurred less than two weeks after the U.S. lifted BP’s ban on seeking new oil leases in the Gulf of Mexico.\nBP says the spill, which has since been stopped and contained, was caused by a “disruption in the refining process” at its Whiting refinery in northwest Indiana.\nThe Whiting refinery, which was recently upgraded to process oil from the Canadian tar sands, has drawn the ire of environmentalists in the past, due to its pollution of Lake Michigan.\nLast September, Indiana regulators ruled that BP must cut the amount of mercury pollution it releases annually into Lake Michigan from the refinery from 23.1 parts per trillion of to 8.75 parts per trillion.\nThe Whiting refinery currently produces about 600,000 tons per year of petcoke, but the recent $3.8 billion expansion has the potential to up its petcoke production to 2.2 million tons per year.']"

That bail agreement was only in effect until the end of the appeals process, which came to a close on Tuesday.\n\nIn upholding the verdict, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has shut down Gupta’s appeal process, and effectively closed the door on any hope the disgraced hedge fund manager may have had at having the original judgment overturned. The court order called Gupta’s appeal “without merit.”\n\nGupta and his litigation team have argued that the evidence against him – which consists mainly of wire-tapped phone calls between Gupta and Raj Rajaratnam, who is currently behind bars – is nothing more than hearsay, and that this evidence was unfairly introduced during Gupta’s original trial, influencing the jury to incorrectly pass a guilty verdict.\n\nBut the appeals court disagreed, finding the circumstantial evidence to be compelling enough that they would now not allow a full new trial for Gupta. The courts also refused to hear “state of mind” testimony from Gupta’s daughter, Geetanjali, which Gupta’s lawyers believe would have vouched for how angry Gupta was after allegedly being duped by Rajaratnam into giving him privileged trading information.\n\nGupta still has a separate appeal case, which is still live, involving an amended restitution amount of $6.22 million for his criminal malfeasance.

43970,http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20140326/NEWS02/140329357/Time-uncertainty-make-plane-hunt-uniquely-hard,business,"['CANBERRA, Australia — Not one object has been recovered from the missing airliner that Malaysian officials are now convinced plunged into the southern Indian Ocean 17 days ago. Some of the pieces are likely 3,500 meters (11,500 feet) underwater. Others are bobbing in a fickle system of currents that one oceanographer compares to a pinball machine. And by now, they could easily be hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from each other.\n\nThe job of gathering this wreckage, and especially the black boxes that will help determine what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, is an unprecedented challenge. The crews who needed two years to find a black box from the Air France flight lost in the Atlantic in 2009 had much more information to go on.\n\n“Even though that was the biggest and most complicated search for an aircraft in the ocean ever conducted, it was a relatively refined area compared with what we’re talking about here,” said U.S. underwater wreck hunter David Mearns, who advised both British and French investigators in the Air France case.\n\nMalaysia said the latest search area had been narrowed to about 870,000 square kilometers (335,000 square miles, 470,000 square nautical miles), an area about as big as Texas and Oklahoma combined.\n\nIt was analysis of satellite data, rather than any confirmed wreckage, that led Malaysia to conclude Monday that Flight 370 plunged into the Indian Ocean 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of the Australian west coast city of Perth, and that all 239 people aboard died. Satellites and planes have seen objects in the water, large and small, but nothing has been retrieved or positively identified as coming from the Boeing 777-200.\n\nGeoff Dell, discipline leader of accident investigation at Central Queensland University, said Tuesday that if the black boxes are found, it would be the most difficult search for a lost plane ever to succeed.\n\n“We’re not searching for a needle in a haystack,” said Air Marshal Mark Binskin, Australia’s deputy defense chief. “We’re still trying to define where the haystack is.”\n\nDell said there’s an urgent need to find any wreckage from the plane. Even one piece would allow oceanographers to plot where it might have drifted from. That information, combined with the vague course of the plane calculated by British satellite company Inmarsat, could greatly refine the search area for pieces that have sunk.\n\n“You’ve got a rough idea of the flight path from this satellite data. Using your best guesses, you’ve got to backtrack from where you’ve fished the pieces out of the water, based on current and wind,” Dell said. “You’re looking for those two paths to intersect and that would be your starting point, but there’d be many, many variables, estimations and tolerances in both of those paths.”\n\nThe estimated paths of the flight and the current would produce “an X-marks-the-spot where we start looking, but it could be a couple of hundred miles off,” he said.\n\nThe job gets harder every day the current carries wreckage away, said Erik van Sebille, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He said the swirling and unpredictable nature of currents can spread items that begin in the same place hundreds of kilometers (miles) apart within weeks.\n\n“It’s like one giant pinball machine out there,” he said.\n\nWeather is further complicating the task. The search was suspended for 24 hours Tuesday due to rough seas.\n\nBinskin, the Australian deputy defense chief, said search planes had dropped electronic buoys near potential debris fields that have been seen in recent days, in hopes of keeping track of them.\n\nAustralian Defense Minister David Johnston said, “The turning point for us, I think, will be when we pull some piece of debris from the surface of the ocean and positively identify it as being part of the aircraft.”\n\nThe search involves ships and planes from the United States, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea.\n\nMalaysia said the U.S. Navy will deliver a black box pinger locator to Perth on Wednesday. The Australian warship that will tow the locator is due to arrive in the search area on April 5. By then, there may be little time left.\n\nBy law, the boxes must be able to send those signals for at least 30 days following a crash. But experts say they can continue making noise for another 15 days or so beyond that, depending on the strength of the black box battery.\n\nHans Weber, the president and owner of TECOP International, a San Diego-based aviation consulting firm, said that if the black boxes are submerged, the effectiveness of the pinging they emit can be affected by variations in water temperature.\n\nHe said the ocean can form layers of water that are different temperatures, and that sometimes the pinging can effectively be reflected back by a different layer of water. He said the pinging works best in water that has a uniform temperature.\n\nDell said if the black boxes were several kilometers (miles) deep, the ships might need to be almost directly over them before the signal could detect them.\n\nIf found in deep water, Dell expected that unmanned submarines would be needed to retrieve them. That’s how the black box from Air France Flight 447 was retrieved in May 2011, almost two years after the Airbus A330 crashed with the loss of 228 lives.\n\nMearns, the wreck hunter, said this week that Malaysian plane search is far more complex “because with Air France they knew the flight plan of the plane, the track of the plane, the last known position.” The last 280 seconds of the plane’s path were unclear, he said, compared to several hours for Flight 370.\n\nAnd it did not take 17 days to find wreckage from Flight 447. Within five days, more than 100 pieces of debris were found.', 'And by now, they could easily be hundreds of kilometers (miles) away from each other.\n“We’re still trying to define where the haystack is.”Dell said there’s an urgent need to find any wreckage from the plane.\nHe said the swirling and unpredictable nature of currents can spread items that begin in the same place hundreds of kilometers (miles) apart within weeks.\nDell said if the black boxes were several kilometers (miles) deep, the ships might need to be almost directly over them before the signal could detect them.\nAnd it did not take 17 days to find wreckage from Flight 447.']"

The objects ranged in length from one to twenty-five yards long.\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is co-ordinating the search on Malaysia’s behalf, said that three objects had been spotted - two apparent pieces of rope, and a blue object - but none were seen on a second pass.\n\nIt remains uncertain whether the objects came from the plane or from something else, such as a cargo ship.\n\nSearch resumes\n\nEarlier today, 12 planes and five ships from the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand resumed the hunt for any pieces of the jet after gale-force winds died down.\n\nAlthough officials have narrowed the search area it is still estimated at 622,000 square miles, more than six times the total size of the UK.\n\nAustralian prime minister Tony Abbott said: “We’re throwing everything we have at this search.\n\n“This is about the most inaccessible spot imaginable. It’s thousands of kilometres from anywhere, but nevertheless we are the closest nation. We are a capable nation. We will do what we can to solve this riddle.”\n\n‘Defining the haystack’\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the latest search would focus on 30,900 square miles of ocean. The search area is about 1,550 miles southwest of Perth.\n\nSpeaking in Perth, Australia’s deputy defence chief Air Marshal Mark Binskin said it was a massive challenge.\n\nAir Marshal Binskin said: “We’re not searching for a needle in a haystack - we’re still trying to define where the haystack is.”\n\nVarious pieces of floating objects have been spotted south west of the coastal city, but none has been retrieved. If they are found to be from the plane, that may help investigators narrow the search for the wreckage of the plane.\n\n‘Indication plane went down’\n\nOn Monday, Malaysian authorities said that an analysis of satellite data received after China, home to 153 of the passengers, has demanded that Malaysia turn over the satellite data used to determine the plane’s fate.\n\nThe airline’s chairman, Mohammed Nor Mohammed Yusof, said it may take time for further answers to become clear. He said: “The investigation still under way may yet prove to be even longer and more complex than it has been since March 8.”\n\nThe search for the wreckage and the plane’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders could take years, if it is ever successful.\n\nInvestigators took two years to find the black box from an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic Ocean during a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009, despite search teams knowing within days where the crash site was.\n\nDavid Ferreira, an oceanographer at the University of Reading, said little was known about the detailed topography of the seabed where the plane is believed to have crashed.\n\n“We know much more about the surface of the moon than we do about the ocean floor in that part of the Indian Ocean,” he said.\n\nSatellite data imprecise\n\nSatellite information sent from MH370 did not provide an exact location of the plane’s last location. Malaysian defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the data was still being analysed “to attempt to determine the final position of the aircraft” and that an international working group of satellite and aircraft performance experts had been set up.\n\nInvestigators are looking at various possible reasons for the crash, including mechanical or electrical failure, hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or someone else on board.', 'A SATELLITE scanning the Indian Ocean for remnants of missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370 has found a possible debris field containing 122 objects.\nOn Monday, the Malaysian government said that British satellite data indicated the plane had gone down in the Indian Ocean, killing all 239 people aboard.\nMalaysian defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the objects were more than 1,550 miles south-west of Australia, near where other satellites previously detected objects.\nIt remains uncertain whether the objects came from the plane or from something else, such as a cargo ship.\nSatellite data impreciseSatellite information sent from MH370 did not provide an exact location of the plane’s last location.']"

Family members of the 239 on board have meanwhile insisted they need to see physical evidence before accepting Malaysia’s conclusion that the flight crashed into the ocean with the loss of all lives.\n\nAbbott said: ""We are just going to keep on looking because we owe it to people to do everything we can to resolve this riddle.\n\n""It is not absolutely open-ended but it is not something we will lightly abandon … We\'re throwing everything we have at this search.""\n\nTwelve planes and two ships have been sweeping a search zone about 2,500km south-west of Perth, with South Korean aircraft joining the hunt for the first time. The Australian naval vessel HMAS Success has returned to the area and China’s polar supply ship Xue Long has arrived.\n\nMalaysia has said the total area being searched covers almost 470,000 square nautical miles. Aerial sightings of items possibly connected to the flight had raised hopes that the wreckage may be found but so far no objects have been conclusively connected to MH370, which vanished on 8 March.\n\nCompounding the difficulties of searching such a remote area, prone to poor weather conditions, is the state of the seabed. An underwater geology expert warned that a chain of undersea volcanoes runs directly through the area, meaning the ocean floor is extremely rugged with small gullies and ridges constantly reshaped by magma flows.\n\n""It\'s very unfortunate if that debris has landed on the active crest area – it will make life more challenging,"" Robin Beaman of Queensland\'s James Cook University told Agence France-Presse.\n\nExperts say finding the wreckage is crucial to understanding what happened to the flight but warn that locating and recovering it could take years – or even prove impossible.\n\nMalaysian officials have said the plane was diverted from its original course as a deliberate act by someone on board – but insist they are not ruling out any possible explanations, from hijacking and sabotage to an attempt to deal with mechanical problems.\n\n""We do not know why … we do not know how the terrible tragedy happened,"" said the Malaysia Airlines chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya.\n\nInvestigators concluded that the plane crashed with the loss of all lives after experts undertook complex analysis of data showing automated contact between the Boeing 777 and satellites. The last complete contact came at 8.11am Malaysian time, seven and a half hours after MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur, and showed it over a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean. A partial signal was detected eight minutes later, around the time the aircraft would have run out of fuel.\n\nFamily members have reacted angrily to Monday’s announcement of the plane\'s apparent fate and railed at the muddled communications prior to that. They mounted a protest outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing on Tuesday and branded both the Malaysian government and the airline as liars.\n\nOn Wednesday their fury was fuelled by the apparent disappearance of Malaysia Airlines staff and other caregivers sent by the company, who had been supporting them at the hotel where they are staying in Beijing.\n\nA microblog message posted by a group calling itself the Malaysia Airlines MH370 Relatives Committee said: “Each relative was taken care by two special volunteers, but so far all Malaysia Airlines crew mysteriously disappeared. Do they also lose contact?\n\n“There is no daily shuttle bus, no arrangement any more for the relatives’ accommodation, no answer on the 24-hour emergency line.”\n\nA staff member at the media centre for Malaysia Airlines said she did not know about the allegations that employees had withdrawn. The company has yet to respond further.\n\nAbbott, the Australian prime minister, led a motion of condolence in parliament, where members observed a minute\'s silence. ""We mourn all those 239 passengers and crew. We especially mourn the six Australian citizens and one Australian resident who must be presumed dead and we grieve with their families and loved ones,"" he said.\n\n\n\n""I want to assure them that Australia will do all it can to recover what we can from the southern Indian Ocean so that they can have the closure and eventually the peace that comes with understanding more of what happened.""\n\nThe search operation was suspended on Tuesday due to gale force winds, huge waves and driving rain, but resumed on Wednesday in calmer weather.', '""It is not absolutely open-ended but it is not something we will lightly abandon … We\'re throwing everything we have at this search.""\nThe Australian naval vessel HMAS Success has returned to the area and China’s polar supply ship Xue Long has arrived.\n""We do not know why … we do not know how the terrible tragedy happened,"" said the Malaysia Airlines chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya.\nA microblog message posted by a group calling itself the Malaysia Airlines MH370 Relatives Committee said: “Each relative was taken care by two special volunteers, but so far all Malaysia Airlines crew mysteriously disappeared.\nThe search operation was suspended on Tuesday due to gale force winds, huge waves and driving rain, but resumed on Wednesday in calmer weather.']"

A Xinhua correspondent aboard the plane said the meteorologic conditions were complicated. Meanwhile, multinational search for the wreckage of the missing jetliner has resumed off Western Australia\'s coast following the improvement in weather conditions, local media reported on Wednesday. Conditions around the search area are expected to favor the search on Wednesday, said Adam Conroy, senior weather forecaster from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

We should see winds and seas ease and really just isolated showers through the area,"" Conroy told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Twelve planes and several ships are expected to join the search and recovery operation, with six countries involved in the search - Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, China and the Republic of Korea, according to the ABC. China has not suspended its search operation in other possible search areas despite Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak\'s announcement on the ill-fated plane. Chinese icebreaker Xuelong arrived in the area where Chinese airborne searchers spotted some suspicious objects on Monday. Late Monday, Najib said the missing plane ""ended"" in the southern Indian Ocean, based on new calculations by Inmarsat, a British satellite company that provided the satellite data. Chinese naval vessels continued to scour waters southwest of Sumatra on Tuesday. ""We should not be distracted by the uncertain information from outside,"" said Liu Zhonghu, captain of the Jinggangshan amphibious docking vessel. Liu said the Jinggangshan and another vessel, the Yongxingdao, would continue to do their utmost to comb the target sea area in accordance with previously agreed international search arrangements. In Washington, the state department said Tuesday that the United States was approaching Inmarsat for satellite data to conduct its own analysis in order to corroborate the company\'s conclusion. Spokeswoman Marie Harf, who said a day earlier the U.S. had no ""independent corroboration"" about the crash of Flight MH370 as announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak based on an analysis of satellite data by the Inmarsat company, told reporters that Washington was ""in touch"" with the two sides. ""We are in touch with both the Malaysian government about their calculations and the British company about their images to see if we can independently confirm their data analysis through our own data analysis,"" Harf said at a regular news briefing. No trace of the missing plane has been found since the two vessels entered their assigned search areas near Sumatra early Saturday, an area of some 53,000 square nautical miles (181,785 square km) between Nias Island and Christmas Island. Another Chinese naval fleet consisting of supply ship Qiandaohu, missile destroyer Haikou and amphibious transport dock Kunlunshan was expected to arrive in the waters southwest of the Australian port of Perth on Wednesday. Flight MH370, a Boeing 777-200, went missing on its way to Beijing on March 8, shortly after take-off from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. The plane was carrying 12 crew and 227 passengers, including 154 Chinese. The multi-national massive search for the missing jetliner has entered the third week.

With wildly differing theories about the loss of the Malaysia Airlines jet, the MH370 mystery is becoming to the early 21st century what the JFK assassination was to the 20th. We look at the key questions – and offer some cautious answers.\n\nHas Malaysia been keeping information secret?\n\nInformation has certainly been ineptly managed since the Boeing 777 went missing on 8 March, but I have not seen convincing evidence that it has been deliberately withheld by Malaysia Airlines or the Malaysian government. They have both stressed the need to communicate openly with the relatives of the 239 people on board, but also to verify information before it has been released.\n\nDownload the new Indpendent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\nThe key accusation that the Malaysians must answer, once the search is completed, is why it failed to act immediately on the key data supplied by Inmarsat about the jet’s last hours? The London-based firm told investigators of the vital information three days after the disappearance of the Beijing-bound flight. But it took a further four days before the futile search in the South China Sea was abandoned, and prolonged the unimaginable anguish of the relatives.\n\nHow significant is the lack of a distress signal from the pilots, and of evidence of passengers using their mobile phones?\n\nVery significant. Starting on the flight deck: the order of priorities of any pilot is clear: aviate (ie keep the aircraft flying), navigate (achieve the desired course and altitude), communicate. If the crew were dealing with a complex and unforeseen problem, they would quite properly focus on the issue rather than contacting the ground or other aircraft. But it appears that a number of manoeuvres were performed that would seem to allow enough time for one or other pilot to broadcast a warning.\n\nIf passengers became aware of an unusual or sinister development, it is highly likely that at least some of them would switch on their mobile phones – a few of which would be expected to register on networks while briefly flying over the Malayan peninsula. But the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission reports no such contact. It is possible that passengers were unaware of the change in course, or that they were incapacitated, for example by depressurisation of the cabin.\n\nOnce the aircraft was some distance from land, any contact with ground stations would be impossible.\n\nWere the pilots involved?\n\n“Probably a suicidal pilot,” says the aviation expert Chris Yates. “I see no other conclusion to draw, other than a vague possibility that a passenger or passengers took control.” There has been much speculation about the backgrounds and states of mind of the captain and first officer. However, many other theories have been put forward. Could something as trivial as a spilt cup of coffee on the flight deck cause an electrical short circuit, which smouldered and produced enough smoke to overcame the pilots before they could broadcast a Mayday? Or could some other event have disabled the communications systems and incapacitated the flight crew?\n\nHas hijacking/terrorism now been discounted?\n\nThe suicidal terrorism demonstrated to such deadly effect on 9/11 was aimed at mass murder and targeting iconic structures. Had these been the motives with MH370, then the obvious targets would be the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur - until a decade ago the tallest buildings in the world. Traditional hijacking involves the perpetrator demanding to be flown to a different destination, and does not usually result in the destruction of the aircraft. So unless a macabre new strain of evil has been devised, it is difficult to identify a motive. In addition, no credible claims have been made by any terrorist group for the loss of the jet.\n\nWill they ever give up looking for the aircraft?\n\nCompared with the search for traces of Air France flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic between Rio and Paris five years ago, looking for MH370 is an order of magnitude more difficult. The distance from the shore is much greater, the sea conditions much heavier and the clues about possible locations much less certain. It is an extraordinarily expensive business. But so much is riding on finding out what happens, that the search is likely to continue indefinitely. The need for some sort of closure for the relatives is clear. But the aviation community is also desperate to learn more – in case there is some previously unidentified issue with the aircraft, and to establish responsibility before the legal process begins.\n\nIf they find it, will they raise it?\n\nSearch teams will want to recover as much as possible of the debris, to get clues about the aircraft’s final moments – and the sequence of events that led to the loss. They will home in on the flight data recorder, which keeps details of commands from the flight deck, and the cockpit voice recorder. The latter, though, may not yield many clues since it has only a two-hour capacity, and therefore cannot reveal what happened over the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nHas bad news about a crash been given by text message previously?\n\nNot as far as I can tell – but there has never been an event like this. With the unexplained loss of a large passenger jet, we are in uncharted territory – or at least territory that has been uncharted for decades. Thankfully air disasters are so rare that “normal” is difficult to define. But in previous events, relatives have tended to learn the worse from the media, rather than the airline.', 'The disappearance of a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard remains shrouded in uncertainty.\nThe London-based firm told investigators of the vital information three days after the disappearance of the Beijing-bound flight.\nHow significant is the lack of a distress signal from the pilots, and of evidence of passengers using their mobile phones?\nIt is possible that passengers were unaware of the change in course, or that they were incapacitated, for example by depressurisation of the cabin.\nThey will home in on the flight data recorder, which keeps details of commands from the flight deck, and the cockpit voice recorder.']"

The incomplete signal represented a partial handshake, he said.\n\nAt this time, this transmission is not understood and is subject to further ongoing work, Hishammuddin said.\n\nThe next signal from the aircraft was due at 9.15 am but never came. Hishammuddin referred delicately to the likelihood that the cessation of signals came after the plane ran out of fuel, saying the timing is consistent with the maximum endurance of the aircraft.\n\nAlso read: Jaswant Singh and wife's assets: From tractor, cows, Arab horses and more\n\nOn Tuesday morning, relatives and friends of many of the 153 Chinese passengers on Flight 370 gathered outside the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing to demand that Malaysian officials tell them the truth about the fate of the flight. They went there despite assurances from police that the Malaysian ambassador would come to their hotel to talk to them.\n\nThe group shoved past police officers as they left their hotel, arriving on foot at the embassy about 40 minutes later. The street was crowded with journalists, police officers and people trying to get past police roadblocks to reach some of the other embassies on the block, including the American, Israeli and French embassies. A line of paramilitary police officers then blocked the road and prevented journalists from following the marchers.\n\nOne diplomat came out to talk to the protesters, who presented the embassy with a scathing collective statement saying the families wanted answers and would consider Malaysian officials and the airline to be murderers if the families found that missteps had led to the deaths of their loved ones.\n\nIn the midafternoon, a man who said his surname was Wang spoke at the hotel where the families were staying, saying he represented them. He said the Malaysian government had so far failed to provide any evidence for its conclusion that the plane had ended up crashing in the Indian Ocean, killing everyone on board. He said most of the families did not believe the Malaysian governments narrative about the loss of the plane. I just want the truth to come out with evidence, Wang said, adding that he believed hijackers who harbored ill will toward Malaysia had taken the plane.\n\nAfter 3 pm, the Malaysian ambassador to China arrived to talk privately to the relatives and friends gathered in the hotels ballroom. A palpable feeling of anger and frustration hung over the conversation, people in the room said.\n\nThe Chinese government continued to make skeptical remarks over the announcement by the Malaysians. We are highly concerned with Malaysias conclusion, and have demanded full information and the evidence that supports the conclusion, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said at a news conference in the afternoon.\n\n- By KEITH BRADSHER, EDWARD WONG and THOMAS FULLER"", 'On Tuesday morning, relatives and friends of many of the 153 Chinese passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 370 gathered outside the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing.\n(Reuters)The Malaysian authorities released new details on Tuesday of the last satellite communications by Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, even as furious family members and friends of the planes passengers broke through police lines in Beijing and marched to the Malaysian Embassy.\nThey went there despite assurances from police that the Malaysian ambassador would come to their hotel to talk to them.\nHe said most of the families did not believe the Malaysian governments narrative about the loss of the plane.\nAfter 3 pm, the Malaysian ambassador to China arrived to talk privately to the relatives and friends gathered in the hotels ballroom.']"

If they are found to be from the plane, that may help investigators narrow the search for the wreckage of the plane.\n\nMalaysia said on Monday that an analysis of satellite data received after Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8 indicated the plane had gone down in the Indian Ocean, killing all 239 people aboard.\n\nBut that finding did not answer troubling questions about why the plane was so far off-course. China, home to 153 of the passengers, demanded that Malaysia turn over the satellite data used to determine the plane’s fate.\n\nThe airline’s chairman, Mohammed Nor Mohammed Yusof, said it may take time for further answers to become clear.\n\n“The investigation still under way may yet prove to be even longer and more complex than it has been since March 8,” he said.\n\nThe search for the wreckage and the plane’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders could take years because the ocean can extend to up to 23,000 feet deep in some parts. It took two years to find the black box from an Air France jet that went down in the Atlantic Ocean on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009 and searchers knew within days where the crash site was.\n\nThere is a race against the clock to find Flight 370’s black boxes, whose battery-powered “pinger” could stop sending signals within two weeks. The batteries are designed to last at least a month.\n\nDavid Ferreira, an oceanographer at the University of Reading, said little was known about the detailed topography of the seabed where the plane is believed to have crashed.\n\n“We know much more about the surface of the moon than we do about the ocean floor in that part of the Indian Ocean,” he said.\n\nThe satellite information did not provide an exact location – only a rough estimate of where the jet went down, and defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the data was still being analysed “to attempt to determine the final position of the aircraft” and that an international working group of satellite and aircraft performance experts had been set up.\n\nThe lack of physical evidence and what is thought to be a lack of reliable information from Malaysian officials has resulted in a torrent of criticism from relatives of the passengers.\n\nIn Beijing, nearly 100 relatives and their supporters marched to the Malaysian embassy, where they threw plastic water bottles, tried to rush the gate and chanted “Liars!”.\n\nMany wore white T-shirts that read “Let’s pray for MH370”. They held banners and shouted: “Tell the truth! Return our relatives!”\n\nPolice briefly scuffled with a group of relatives who tried to approach journalists. The relatives demanded to see the Malaysian ambassador, and they later met him.\n\nIn a clear statement of support for the families, Chinese president Xi Jinping ordered a special envoy to Kuala Lumpur to deal with the case and deputy foreign minister Xie Hangsheng told Malaysia’s ambassador that China wanted to know exactly what led to the announcement that the plane had been lost.\n\nThe conclusions were based on an analysis of the brief signals the plane sent every hour to a satellite belonging to Inmarsat, a British company, even after other communication systems on the jet shut down for unknown reasons.\n\nInvestigators will be looking at various possibilities, including mechanical or electrical failure, hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or someone else on board.\n\n“We do not know why.

Although officials sharply narrowed the search zone based on the last satellite signals received from the Boeing 777, it was still estimated at 1.6 million square kilometers (622,000 square miles), an area bigger than Texas and Oklahoma combined.\n\n""We\'re not searching for a needle in a haystack — we\'re still trying to define where the haystack is,""Australia\'s deputy defense chief, Air Marshal Mark Binskin, told reporters Tuesday at a military base in the Australian west coast city of Perth as idle planes stood behind him. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which coordinates the search on Malaysia\'s behalf, said Wednesday\'s search will focus on 80,000 square kilometers (30,900 square miles) of ocean. The search area is about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth.\n\nDon\'t Miss 108 SHARES 654 SHARES 797 SHARES\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told Nine network television on Wednesday: ""We\'re throwing everything we have at this search."" ""This is about the most inaccessible spot imaginable. It\'s thousands of kilometers from anywhere, but nevertheless, we are the closest nation. We are a capable nation. We will do what we can to solve this riddle,"" he later told Seven Network television.\n\nMalaysia announced Monday that an analysis of satellite data received after Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8 indicated the plane had gone down in the Indian Ocean, killing all 239 people aboard. The finding did not answer troubling questions about why the plane was so far off-course. China, home to 153 of the passengers, demanded that Malaysia turn over the satellite data used to determine the plane\'s fate.\n\nThe airline\'s chairman, Mohammed Nor Mohammed Yusof, said it may take time for further answers to become clear. ""The investigation still underway may yet prove to be even longer and more complex than it has been since March 8th,"" he said.\n\nThe search for the wreckage and the plane\'s flight data and cockpit voice recorders could take years because the ocean can extend to up to 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) deep in some parts. It took two years to find the black box from an Air France jet that went down in the Atlantic Ocean on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 2009, and searchers knew within days where the crash site was.\n\nThere is a race against the clock to find Flight 370\'s black boxes, whose battery-powered ""pinger"" could stop sending signals within two weeks. The batteries are designed to last at least a month. David Ferreira, an oceanographer at the University of Reading in Britain, said little is known about the detailed topography of the seabed where the plane is believed to have crashed. ""We know much more about the surface of the moon than we do about the ocean floor in that part of the Indian Ocean,"" Ferreira said.\n\nSearching for a needle in a haystack would be simple by comparison, he said. ""This haystack is in the dark, two or three miles underwater, hundreds of miles from land, and in a field no one has even seen before, let alone mapped,"" Ferreira added. The satellite information does not provide an exact location — only a rough estimate of where the jet went down.\n\nDefense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the data is still being analyzed ""to attempt to determine the final position of the aircraft"" and that an international working group of satellite and aircraft performance experts had been set up. Monday\'s announcement that there were no survivors unleashed sorrow and anger among the victims\' families, who have complained bitterly about a lack of reliable information from Malaysian officials.\n\nInvestigators will be looking at various possibilities, including mechanical or electrical failure, hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or someone else on board. ""We do not know why. We do not know how. We do not know how the terrible tragedy happened,"" Malaysia Airlines\' chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, told reporters.\n\nAustralian and Chinese search planes spotted floating objects southwest of Perth on Monday, but none was retrieved. With the 24-hour delay in the search, those objects and other possible debris from the plane could drift to an even wider area.\n\nThere are 26 countries involved in the search, and Hishammudin said the problems are not diplomatic ""but technical and logistical.\u200b"" ""We\'ve got to get lucky,"" said John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board.

There were also 38 passengers from Malaysia, seven were Indonesian, six were from Australian and three Americans were on board, among other nationalities.\n\n\n\nRolfe estimated that an American court could pay out between $8-10 million on a per-passenger basis, but compensation would be a fraction of this outside of the U.S. In China, she estimated relatives would receive less than $1 million per passenger.\n\nAllianz, the main reinsurer for the missing Malaysia Airlines yet, has already started pay out on claims relating to its disappearance, according to Reuters.\n\n\n\nThe German insurance giant would not comment on financial details, but The Telegraph reported that some $110 million had been placed in an escrow account and Allianz had agreed to make hardship payments to the relatives of those on the fight.\n\nWhere claims can be brought\n\nThe Montreal Convention dictates that a claim has to be brought in one of five places: where the carrier is domiciled; its main place of business; where the ticket was bought; the destination of the flight or the primary residence of the plaintiff.\n\n\n\n""So for the majority of passengers on this flight, this is either China or Malaysia and these countries have very limited views of damages as opposed to America,"" Illinois-based aviation crash attorney Floyd Wisner told CNBC.\n\n\n\n(Read more: How 19th century physics was used to trace missing plane )\n\n\n\n""They could evaluate these cases and say a Chinese life is (of) less value than an American life.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was in The Hague for the third Nuclear Security Summit, instructed a special envoy be appointed to handle issues surrounding the plane\'s disappearance with the Malaysian side. Late on Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the missing plane ""ended"" in the southern Indian Ocean, based on new calculations by the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch and Inmarsat, a Britain-based satellite company that provided the satellite data. ""We are highly concerned with Malaysia\'s conclusion, and have demanded full information and the evidence that supports the conclusion,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. Since the whereabouts of the missing jet remained unknown, China would continue to spare no effort in the search and Chinese vessels were continuing to arrive in the target waters, Hong said. On Tuesday, Chinese icebreaker Xuelong reached the area where Chinese search planes spotted suspected objects, while the merchant ship Zhonghaishaohua arrived in waters where French satellites spotted suspicious items, according to the spokesman. Another Chinese naval fleet consisting of supply ship Qiandaohu, missile destroyer Haikou and amphibious transport dock Kunlunshan was expected to arrive in the waters southwest of the Australian west coast city of Perth on Wednesday. Chinese vessels Haixun 01 and Nanhaijiu 101 were heading for the area where an Australian satellite spotted suspicious items, Hong said. In addition, China was maintaining its search operation in other possible search areas, despite Najib\'s announcement the plane had gone down in the southern Indian Ocean. ""As the executor of a task, we should not be distracted by the uncertain information from outside,"" said Liu Zhonghu, captain of the Jinggangshan amphibious docking vessel, which is searching waters near Sumatra. Liu said the Jinggangshan and another vessel, the Yongxingdao, would continue to comb their current search area in accordance with previously agreed international arrangements. No trace of the missing plan has been found since the two vessels entered the 53,000 square nautical mile (181,785 square km) area between Nias Island and Christmas Island early Saturday. The international search team led by Australia has shifted focus to the southern corridor. Malaysia\'s acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, as a result of the new data analysis, the search and rescue operation in the northern corridor had been called off. Hishammuddin said all search efforts were now focused in the southern part of the southern corridor, in an area covering some 469,407 square nautical miles, as against the 2.24 million square nautical miles which was announced on March 18. However, the southern search and rescue mission had been suspended due to the bad weather, the minister said. ""Six Chinese ships are currently in the search area, and are expected to arrive within the vicinity of MH370\'s last known position by Wednesday morning,"" he said. Hishammuddin said two Korean aircraft left Subang airport for Perth Tuesday morning to join the multinational search operation. ""HMAS Success is also currently in the search area,"" he said.

[Special coverage]\n\nQ. Why did Malaysia announce the aircraft had crashed into the southern Indian Ocean based simply on analysis of satellite data, rather than solid evidence such as authenticated debris?\n\nA. Many people contacted by China Daily or discussing the announcement on the Internet have expressed concerns about whether the conclusion is justifiable and is based on enough evidence, given that no physical part of the aircraft has yet been retrieved.\n\nThey said the Malaysian government should provide more evidence to back up the satellite data, even though the authority of the United Kingdom\'s Air Accidents Investigation Branch and Inmarsat is beyond question, before reaching the conclusion.\n\nQ. How hard is it to locate and retrieve the aircraft\'s two flight recorders, commonly known as ""black boxes""?\n\nA. Most experts agree that the most direct and reliable method of unearthing the real causes behind the disappearance of Flight MH370 is by analyzing information and data recorded by the black boxes.\n\nHowever, no one knows exactly how long will it take and how difficult will it be to find the devices.\n\nThe signal sent out by the instruments will be significantly muffled by seawater, according to Wang Ya\'nan, deputy editor-in-chief at Aerospace Knowledge magazine. He said after the 2009 crash of Air France flight 447, it took investigators nearly two years to find the recorders. Search teams failed to locate its signal because the recorder was submerged to a depth of 3,900 meters.\n\nThe ocean depth in the area suspected to be the final location of flight MH370 ranges from 2,500 to 4,000 m, according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States.\n\nQ. How much effective information could be obtained from the black box?\n\nA. Zhou Jisheng, former deputy chief designer of the ARJ21 - the Chinese-made regional jet - said: ""It is very difficult to extrapolate exactly what happened during the almost eight-hour flight from the black boxes, namely the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. The memory of the cockpit voice recorder is usually only two-hours. The flight data recorder can record for at least 25 hours, but it only saves flight data.""\n\nChen Cheng, chief editor of the website Sina\'s aviation channel who was a maintenance technician for Boeing 767s for five years, said: ""If someone could turn off the transponder, they could also turn off the black boxes. It is not difficult for a pilot or anyone that knows the airplane well to turn off the devices.""\n\nQ. What were the real causes of the disappearance?\n\nA. A wealth of speculation has lingered around the incident, because no one has been able to draw a complete picture of what took place in the cockpit and cabin before the Boeing 777-200 disappeared.\n\nMany experts with knowledge of investigations into such incidents have suggested that it\'s highly likely that the plane\'s disappearance was the result of a well-planned plot, but no organization or individual has yet claimed responsibility.\n\nUnverified claims about criminal investigations into a number of individuals continue to circulate among the public, which is eagerly awaiting a credible explanation.\n\nQ. Why did it take the Malaysian authorities so long to release information and data held by them during the past several days, and why did they sometimes only do so after international media outlets had published related information?\n\nA. Xu Ke, a former pilot who is now an aviation security researcher at Zhejiang Police College, said many of the Malaysian authorities\' actions had taken the public by surprise and it was difficult to explain the motives behind those actions.', 'The Malaysian prime minister has declared that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 ""ended in the southern Indian Ocean"", but several questions and enigmassurrounding the tragedy remain unsolved while the world waits for explanations.\nHow hard is it to locate and retrieve the aircraft\'s two flight recorders, commonly known as ""black boxes""?\nMost experts agree that the most direct and reliable method of unearthing the real causes behind the disappearance of Flight MH370 is by analyzing information and data recorded by the black boxes.\nThe ocean depth in the area suspected to be the final location of flight MH370 ranges from 2,500 to 4,000 m, according to Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States.\nThe flight data recorder can record for at least 25 hours, but it only saves flight data.""']"

Furthermore, he indicated that the ECB’s forward guidance could keep “policy interest rates as low as they are currently or even lower for an extended period of time” in the euro-zone economy. Negative sentiment for the euro was also fuelled after an ECB policymaker, Jozef Makuch stated that deflation risks in the euro-zone have risen in the recent times and that the central bank is prepared to take “additional non-standard measures to avoid getting into a deflationary environment.” Separately, an ECB Governing Council member, Jens Weidmann also hinted towards the possibility for the central bank to buy loans and other assets from banks to help support the economy while another ECB official, Erkki Liikanen suggested that the idea of negative interest rate should no longer be a controversial issue in the region.\n\n\n\nThe euro-bloc’s common currency declined further after the IFO index on Germany’s business climate and business expectations fell more-than-expected to a reading of 110.7 and 106.4, respectively, in March. However, Germany’s IFO current assessment index advanced more than estimates to a level of 115.2 in March, from previous month’s reading of 114.4.\n\n\n\nThe US dollar gained ground after data showed that consumer confidence in the world’s largest economy, the US, surpassed analysts’ expectations and rose to a six-year high reading of 82.3 in March. However, new home sales in the US fell more-than-expected and hit a five-month low reading in February.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, discussion surrounding the Fed Chief, Janet Yellen’s comments last week intensified after the Philadelphia Fed President, Charles Plosser stated that Janet Yellen’s comments on interest rate were not a “mistake” as some had speculated and the central bank has not yet changed its position in any way on interest rates. Additionally, the Chief of Atlanta Fed Dennis Lockhart, opined that the US Fed would take more than six months time from the end of its QE programme to hike its interest rate, which could probably happen in the second half of next year. Separately, the Dallas Fed President, Richard Fisher, stated that the central bank would keep its interest rates near zero until it is confident on the recovery of the US economy.\n\n\n\nIn the Asian session, at GMT0400, the pair is trading at 1.3812, with the EUR trading 0.06% lower from yesterday’s close.\n\n\n\nThe pair is expected to find support at 1.3757, and a fall through could take it to the next support level of 1.3703.

44117,http://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/sunrise-market-commentary-currencies/2014/03/26/,business,"['On Monday, trading in the EUR/USD cross rate was primarily driven by ECBcomments. European equities were in good shape as tensions on Ukraine eased, but this risk‐on rally had hardly an impact on currency trading. This was also the case for slightly weaker than expected German IFO business sentiment report.\n\nDuring the day, several ECB members spoke ‘dovish’. Even ECB Weidmann suggested that QE was not completely excluded. EUR/USD tested the mid 1.37 area late in the European trading session. Later, Draghi repeated that “the ECB will do what is needed to maintain price stability.” However, this was not enough to cause further euro losses. More or less in line with the price action on Monday, EUR/USD was captured by some kind of a short‐squeeze.\n\nOvernight, Asian equities are mostly in positive territory extending the decent performance in the US yesterday evening. USD/JPY again hardly profits from the constructive stock market sentiment. EUR/USD is again drifting back lower, reversing part of yesterday’s short‐squeeze. The comments from Fed members Plosser en Bullard can be considered as hawkish, but they had no noticeable impact on EUR/USD trading, as these governors are known for their hawkish stance.\n\nToday, the calendar is only modestly interesting. There are no important eco data in Europe. In the US, the Durable orders and the Markit PMI’s will be published. The durable orders are notoriously volatile. A decent figure is expected, but we see downside risks for the core orders’ component. Even if confirmed, the dollar may fail to profit.\n\nThere are no official ECB speakers scheduled, but there might still come more comments on ECB reaction function to low inflation and a strong euro. For now, the impact on the euro is very limited. Nervousness might rise if the German inflation data (on Friday) would suggest a low EMU figure (next Monday).\n\nHowever, for now the mid 1.3750 area proves to be a tough support short‐term. The jury is still out regarding a more broad‐based dollar rebound.For that, stronger US eco data are needed. Even so, the 1.40 barrier is now better protected.\n\n\n\n\n\nSterling slightly higher on “as expected” UK CPI\n\nOn Tuesday, the UK inflation was reported close to expectations at 0.5% M/M and 1.7% Y/Y. However markets were positioned for the risk of a lower outcome. As a consequence, Sterling regained gradually ground across the board. Later in the session, the decline of EUR/GBP accelerated after ECB’s governors, including Buba’s Weidmann, indicated that the ECB keeps a close eye on the valuation of the euro and that more easing remains possible. EUR/GBP returned to the well‐known 0.8350 area. Cable was little changed in the low 1.65 area.\n\nOvernight, EUR/GBP is little changed near the 0.8350 pivot. Cable is a few ticks lower in the 1.6520 area.\n\nLater today, the UK eco calendar is empty. So, technical considerations will prevail. The US durable orders might affect cable, but we don’t expect a break beyond the technically important levels. On the topside, important levels are too far away. On the downside, the correction low is at 1.6460. However, given the recent rather dull performance of the dollar a break is not evident.\n\nEUR/GBP is hovering in a tight range between 0.8320 and 0.84 and the pair is now again in the middle of that range with no trigger available for a break either way. Later this week, the UK retail sales (tomorrow) and consumer confidence (Friday) are released. Will they unlock the current stalemate? Not evident. On the euro side of the story, the ECB has started a new campaign to make market aware that the debate on more easing is still open. We look for more verbal interventions, but for the reaction of the euro is muted. Markets want more proof that this is more than just talk.', 'On Monday, trading in the EUR/USD cross rate was primarily driven by ECBcomments.\nMore or less in line with the price action on Monday, EUR/USD was captured by some kind of a short‐squeeze.\nThe comments from Fed members Plosser en Bullard can be considered as hawkish, but they had no noticeable impact on EUR/USD trading, as these governors are known for their hawkish stance.\nThere are no official ECB speakers scheduled, but there might still come more comments on ECB reaction function to low inflation and a strong euro.\nSterling slightly higher on “as expected” UK CPIOn Tuesday, the UK inflation was reported close to expectations at 0.5% M/M and 1.7% Y/Y.']"

""Good"" deleveraging is where banks quickly shed bad assets and raise new equity that can be put to work in new lending.\n\nBetter capitalised banks will mean ""financing should resume for firms with profitable investment opportunities,"" he said.\n\nIrish Independent', 'Europe\'s handling of the financial crisis made the recession worse and longer, Mario Draghi has admitted.\nEurope\'s handling of the financial crisis made the recession worse and longer, Mario Draghi has admitted.\nWRONGSince June 2012, the euro area has taken ""the right sequence of steps"", he added.\nThat 2010 statement is now widely believed to have exacerbated the crisis by driving investors to sell bonds of weaker euro area members.\nThe lack of an enforced fiscal framework in Europe before the crisis led to a ""front loading"" of fiscal consolidation – another term for austerity – during the crisis, Mr Draghi said.']"

But it is still controversial. The pace of liquidation is one issue.”\n\nThe Central Bank has committed to selling a minimum of €0.5 billion of the bonds by the end of 2014, which it is expected to offload in small tranches, but Dublin is under pressure to sell a larger percentage given the current strong appetite for Irish government debt.\n\nSources familiar with the thinking of the ECB on this issue said the pace at which the government sells off the bonds is a key concern. “Even the doves on this issue have concerns and want to leave this behind us [...] the faster the sales take place the better.”\n\nThe Central Bank of Ireland agreed last year to sell the bonds “but only where such a sale is not disruptive to financial stability”.\n\nThe weighted average life of the long-term government bonds is 34 to 35 years, compared to seven or eight years for the promissory notes.\n\nThe ECB’s annual report to be published on April 7th is expected to include a reference to the promissory note deal that will indicate residual concerns exist about the arrangement.\n\nTwo weeks ago the country resumed regular market access by raising €1 billion in an auction of 10-year bonds, the first regular bond auction since exiting the bailout in December.\n\nLast week it followed suit with an issuance of €500 million in short-term debt.\n\nSo-called peripheral euro zone countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland have seen something of a revival in markets in recent months as the euro zone crisis has subsided.

Unless the indicator has direct bearings on monetary policy, like employment or inflation, the market’s sensitivity to such data is becoming lower,” said Kadota at Barclays.\n\nAgainst the yen, the dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 102.38 , edging further away from this month’s low of 101.205 reached when safe-haven bids driven by the Ukraine crisis supported the Japanese currency along with the Swiss franc.\n\nThe yen has been hemmed in a relatively tight range between 102.01 and 102.65 against the dollar this week, with traders attributing its inertia to dwindling participation from Japanese investors, many of whom are suspected of having closed their books before the completion of the domestic fiscal year at the end of the month.\n\n“There are few incentives or events left that can knock the yen out of its current range, and focus has already turned to the U.S. nonfarm payrolls next week,” said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo.\n\n“The nonfarm payrolls might be the only predictable factor with enough clout to break the deadlock,” Sera said.\n\nThe Australian dollar traded at $0.9162, near a four-month high of $0.9178 hit on Tuesday.\n\nSpeculation that China will unveil stimulus measures to re-energise its slowing economy has helped the New Zealand dollar and Aussie, often used as a proxy for exposure to growth cycles in China, Australia’s key export market.\n\nThe market was keeping an eye on Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens, due to speak in Hong Kong at 0330 GMT.\n\nRecent Aussie strength could trigger a fresh round of jawboning that the currency is too high, though RBA officials have been noticeably less aggressive in their comments recently.

With the benefit of hindsight, it is hard to imagine anyone arguing today that Europe reacted well to the crisis,\n\nSo where does that leave us? Well, for one thing, the economic recovery in Europe remains fragile. Mr Draghi indicated yesterday that he\'ll help that as far as he can. But in his Paris confession, he appears to be crying out to politicians to meet him half way. In that sense, the speech may be a parable rather than a history lesson.\n\nUntil June 2012, Europe flailed because there was no plan, and what plan there was pulled in different directions at once. ""Look where that got us?"", Mr Draghi seems to be asking.\n\nSince then, loose money, and the promise that the ECB will print cash to ease any new threat has steadied things.\n\nThe new questions – which Mr Draghi raised yesterday in Paris – are around whether economies themselves are fit for purpose. On that, the ECB can\'t help, Mr Draghi said. So it\'s over to national governments who must now decide whether they can come together to produce a recovery, or reprise their blundering policies of the past.\n\nIrish Independent', 'That\'s the gist of a speech given by the European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to students in Paris yesterday.\nMr Draghi indicated yesterday that he\'ll help that as far as he can.\n"", Mr Draghi seems to be asking.\nThe new questions – which Mr Draghi raised yesterday in Paris – are around whether economies themselves are fit for purpose.\nOn that, the ECB can\'t help, Mr Draghi said.']"

But the euro zone economy is still weak and inflation remains stuck well below the central bank’s target.\n\nWith the debate over possible alternative measures picking up pace, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said the ECB could consider purchasing euro zone government bonds or top-rated private sector assets.\n\nThat opened the door to one of the most divisive policy options - quantitative easing (QE) - and one that the German central bank has consistently viewed critically.\n\n“Of course any private or public assets that we might buy would have to meet certain quality standards,” Weidmann, who is a member of the ECB’s Governing Council, said in an interview with MNI published on Tuesday.\n\n“But the overall question is one of effectiveness, costs and side-effects. We are currently discussing the effectiveness of these measures. The intended effects would then have to be weighed against the costs and side-effects.”\n\nECB President Mario Draghi in Paris stressed the ECB’s readiness to act should inflation come in below expectations.\n\nFor now, there was no need to act, Weidmann said, but if the outlook for inflation changed, for example as a result of a stronger euro exchange rate, the ECB could step in, most likely with another interest rate cut and possibly even QE.\n\nAnother cut of the main refinancing rate would likely push the deposit rate into negative territory, which would mean that banks have to pay to park their funds at the ECB overnight.\n\nThe ECB has so far held off from that because of possible side effects, but Finnish governor Erkki Liikanen said a negative deposit rate was no “longer a controversial issue”.\n\nThe euro fell temporarily after policymakers signalled potentially more monetary easing to around $1.3780. The European Commission’ vice-president for industry, Antonio Tajani, had said earlier at $1.40 the euro was too strong.\n\nSlovakia’s central bank governor Jozef Makuch said the currency should weaken by the end of the year.\n\nNEGATIVE RATES\n\nThe ECB has started to pay closer attention to the euro exchange rate and its impact on the outlook for inflation, and Weidmann said a negative deposit rate could be a way to address the impact of a strengthening currency.\n\n“If you wanted to counter the consequences of a strong appreciation of the euro for the inflation outlook, negative rates would, however, appear to be a more appropriate measure than others,” he said. “But we are talking about hypothetical scenarios here and not about imminent decisions.”\n\nThe impact such a step would have to improve bank lending to companies and households was, however, “debatable”, he said.\n\nThe Bundesbank represents the 18-member euro zone’s biggest economy, Germany, and its president’s words carry weight in the debate over what the ECB should do as traditional tools such as changing borrowing costs lose their force.\n\nWeidmann cited limits under the ECB’s mandate on funding governments, which a pending German constitutional court ruling on the legality of the Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) bond purchase programme is expected to underline.\n\n“This does not mean that a QE programme is generally out of the question. But we have to ensure that the prohibition of monetary financing is respected,” Weidmann said.\n\n“We need to discuss this and ideally achieve a common view.”\n\nThe ECB’s Liikanen and Makuch also did not rule out QE.\n\nAsked by the Wall Street Journal whether government bonds purchases by the ECB violated the EU treaty, Liikanen said: “That’s not a legal problem. The treaty allows the purchases from the secondary markets.”\n\nQE would represent a radical departure for the ECB, which has so far refrained from taking such a step also because it is such a highly political issue in the euro zone.\n\nWeidmann’s predecessor Axel Weber resigned in 2011 in protest at the ECB’s first government bond purchase programme at the height of the euro zone debt crisis and Weidmann was the only Governing Council member to vote against the OMT in 2012.\n\nThe Bundesbank is concerned about overstretching the ECB’s mandate of preserving price stability and venturing too far into the realm of financing governments by buying sovereign debt, something that it is banned from doing under EU law.

44166,http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/850714.shtml,business,"['Illustration: Lu Ting/GT\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine\'s crisis is currently dominating the headlines. As a result, there is a risk that investors may miss the bigger picture. The world economy is set to accelerate for the second consecutive year. What is less widely recognized is that Europe is the ""swing factor"" driving this year\'s recovery. After two years of contraction, the euro area is likely to grow around 1.3 percent in 2014. That\'s a positive swing of 1.7 percentage points from last year\'s contraction.\n\n\n\nThe 18-country euro area is almost as big as the US economy, and its $13 trillion of annual output equals 17 percent of the global total. A sharp turnaround in this giant economic and currency bloc is thus likely to have a significant effect on the rest of the world. For emerging markets, Europe\'s revival is particularly welcome because it is being led by domestic demand. As a result, economies across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America that count the euro area as one of their main export markets are likely to be among the biggest beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nThe improvement in Europe\'s outlook was scarcely anticipated only two years ago, when the euro area came close to collapsing. A deft move in 2012 by the European Central Bank under the newly appointed President Mario Draghi, who promised to provide emergency funding to any euro-area government facing problems selling debt, brought the region back from the brink.\n\n\n\nAlthough the legitimacy of the so-called Outright Monetary Transactions - the bond-buying plan unveiled by Draghi to provide cash-strapped governments with emergency funding - is being questioned, the move has had the desired impact: the region has shaken off its extreme pessimism, business confidence is gradually returning, and sovereign bond yields are easing back to normal.\n\n\n\nThe good news for emerging-market exporters is that domestic demand in the euro area is on the rise again, after more than two years of sharp contraction, as investment picks up, consumer spending rises and the decline in government spending ends.\n\n\n\nAmong the larger euro-area economies, Germany\'s growth prospects look best. Real wages in the region\'s largest economy should recover and employment is rising. Investment is growing after a prolonged decline and should accelerate through 2015, the squeeze on government finances is easing, and higher immigration and the eventual introduction of a minimum wage should boost consumer spending. A bounce in German domestic demand should shrink the country\'s current-account surplus, the excess in its exports of goods and services over imports.\n\n\n\nFrance and Italy pulled out of recession in 2013 and the reform agenda is gaining more traction. Meanwhile, the euro-area peripheral economies are reporting falling unemployment; import demand should pick up as these economies emerge from deep recession, capping current-account surpluses. The euro area\'s record current-account surplus is likely to peak later this year as import growth outpaces export growth, and then start diminishing.\n\n\n\nEurope\'s nascent revival comes at an opportune time for emerging markets. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, these economies have relied on domestic consumption, government and private investment, and trade with other emerging markets to fuel growth as recessions in the US and Europe dragged exports lower.\n\n\n\nAs consumption starts to power the euro-area recovery, the impact is likely to be felt in countries as far-flung as India, Singapore, Brazil and Nigeria. These four emerging economies, along with Algeria and Turkey, are among the top 10 non-European emerging-market exporters to the euro area. These economies also have more exposure to the euro area than to the US.\n\n\n\nFor the other exporters on this top 10 list - South Korea, China and Saudi Arabia - exports to the euro area account for one-half to three-quarters the value of their exports to the US; the ratio rises to 80 to 100 percent when their exports to the broader 28-member European Union (EU) are considered.\n\n\n\nOur recent study shows that a return to December 2011 import levels for the euro area would mean a substantial rise in exports from some emerging markets. The latest data show that South Korean and Indonesian exports would rise by 24 percent, exports from Malaysia would rise by 14 percent, and exports from South Africa, India, China and Singapore would rise by 11 to 13 percent.\n\n\n\nGenerally, the euro area is more important than the US as a destination for African and Middle Eastern exports. For Asian exporters, the EU is as important as the US, with each taking in around $500 billion of imports from developing Asia. Indeed, the euro area imports more from China than from the US; it accounts for over one-quarter of African exports, making it three times the size of the US market for African exports. For exports from the Middle East, it is twice the size of the US market.\n\n\n\nEurope is still not out of the woods as doubts linger about the ability of some peripheral economies, such as Greece, to repay creditors, and others to return to pre-crisis growth rates. However, a consumer-led upturn is unfolding across the region. The ongoing unrest in Ukraine is likely to have a limited, if any, impact on the euro-area economies and should not stall the region\'s recovery. Europe\'s upturn gives emerging markets reason for cheer as US monetary conditions tighten and China undergoes a policy-led slowdown.\n\n\n\nThe author is regional head of Research for Europe at Standard Chartered Bank. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn', ""For emerging markets, Europe's revival is particularly welcome because it is being led by domestic demand.\nThe improvement in Europe's outlook was scarcely anticipated only two years ago, when the euro area came close to collapsing.\nEurope's nascent revival comes at an opportune time for emerging markets.\nThese four emerging economies, along with Algeria and Turkey, are among the top 10 non-European emerging-market exporters to the euro area.\nEurope's upturn gives emerging markets reason for cheer as US monetary conditions tighten and China undergoes a policy-led slowdown.""]"

44186,http://gulfnews.com/business/opinion/region-needs-pre-emptive-action-against-bitcoin-1.1308480,business,"['It was not so long ago that we were warned of the risk of dealing in the digital currency of Bitcoin. Many dealers recently lost their “money” after being targeted by internet hackers, since there is no physical presence of this currency, which is issued and traded only online.\n\nThe losses were not limited to individuals alone, but also included banks trading in bitcoins. The Canadian Bank of Flexcoin collapsed after computer hackers stole 896 bitcoins worth $600,000 (Dh2.2 million). Japan’s Mt. Gox, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, announced its bankruptcy after the loss of $63.7 million in bitcoins through hacking.\n\nThere are still some who trade in bitcoins, while the value of the total units of this digital currency is now about $7 billion. These people are encouraged by the skyrocketing rise in the value of this currency, which recently reached $660 per bitcoin. Its value increases several times in a short period of time, attracting quick profit-seekers and those who want to get rich quick despite the inherent risk they could also lose all of their savings.\n\nAlthough trading in the electronic currency has not become a phenomenon in the region, there are attempts to penetrate local markets, where many individuals would not mind taking high risks even if it means they could conceivably lose a portion of their wealth. A search for quick profit is always the fuel for such decisions, or it could be the thrill that accompanies a high-risk gambit that could end up with huge losses, similar to what happened in Canada and Japan.\n\nAt a time when many countries have taken practical measures to stop trading in Bitcoin, or curbing it at least, central banks and telecom companies in the region have yet to determine their stand or take any protective measures to avoid potential downsides that may impact dealers in this fake currency.\n\nRegarding central banks and financial institutions, it is necessary for them to set practical steps, alert dealers and investors about the risks and follow those who deal in this currency, particularly individuals and foreign institutions trying to exploit the availability of funds in countries in the region.\n\nTelecom companies that provide internet services have to block bitcoin trading sites in order to protect dealers and investors, as Canada did after it was hit by fraudulent scams. This is simply because most dealers and investors trading in bitcoins are not fully aware of the details of this type of monetary and financial transactions, driven by major temptations while ignoring the potential danger.\n\nTrading in bitcoins looks like the doings of certain fund and asset management companies who descended on the region in the 1970s and 1980s, and thousands of investors lost their savings after they believed they would give them high profits. They then found out that these were just bogus profits after the owners of such entities, mostly set up under a religious façade, fled to their home countries along with depositors’ money.\n\nTime repeats itself, but in different ways and on a global scale, with the use of modern technology and keeping abreast of the era of globalisation and the internet, and through international networks in which money laundering inter-relates with drug-trafficking and trade in the black market.\n\nIf it was possible to monitor and hold responsible asset management companies in the last century — when many of those involved in the scams were tried and brought to justice but unfortunately without recovering investor funds — today’s fake trading and manipulations are away from accountability.\n\nThis is because of the “ghost” management of these operations, as evidenced from the bankruptcy of companies and banks in Canada and Japan.\n\nSwift action to protect local markets and investors is required, and can be done through the measures mentioned, to fill in the gaps and protect markets and investors from exploitation and hackers.\n\nThis is necessary, especially after fraud has become a phenomenon associating monetary and financial transactions, and despite security precautions taken by banks and financial institutions to protect clients.', 'It was not so long ago that we were warned of the risk of dealing in the digital currency of Bitcoin.\nThe losses were not limited to individuals alone, but also included banks trading in bitcoins.\nGox, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, announced its bankruptcy after the loss of $63.7 million in bitcoins through hacking.\nThese people are encouraged by the skyrocketing rise in the value of this currency, which recently reached $660 per bitcoin.\nTelecom companies that provide internet services have to block bitcoin trading sites in order to protect dealers and investors, as Canada did after it was hit by fraudulent scams.']"

44196,"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-epa-waters-20140326,0,1080552.story",business,"['WASHINGTON — The Obama administration proposed a long-awaited rule on Tuesday to clarify that the Clean Water Act protects wetlands near rivers and waterways fed by seasonal thaws and rains — a decision that could particularly shield water sources in the West.\n\nProposed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, the draft Waters of the U.S. rule is aimed at defining the scope of the Clean Water Act after two Supreme Court decisions in the last 15 years led to confusion about which waterways were under federal protection, said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.\n\nAt issue is the status of waterways that do not flow year-round or are not permanent lakes, but streams that flow intermittently or after heavy rains, and riparian wetlands. Many small, intermittent waterways feed into drinking-water sources, especially in the West. Without protections, theses tributaries and wetlands could be polluted or filled in, as has happened since the Supreme Court decisions, environmentalists said.\n\n“The health of our rivers, lakes, bays and coastal waters depends on the smaller interconnected streams and wetlands that feed them,” McCarthy said. “These places are where we get our drinking water. Our farmers rely on these vital waters to grow the fuel, food and fiber that feed our nation. Our businesses rely on abundant, usable water to manufacture.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the draft rule, most intermittent and rain-dependent streams, as well as wetlands near rivers and streams, would be protected by the Clean Water Act. Building, dumping or discharging in those waterways would require a permit from the EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nFor bodies of water farther away from perennial waterways, the need for permits would be examined on a case-by-case basis. A third category, including man-made ponds and many kinds of ditches, would be exempt from regulation.\n\nThe effort to draft a rule to clearly define the scope of the Clean Water Act has been vigorously opposed by agricultural interests and industry, especially construction companies. They argue that the Obama administration’s definitions would expand the reach of the law and create onerous conditions for business. The National Assn. of Home Builders contends that the new rule would drive up the price of newly constructed houses.\n\nKevin Kelly, the association’s chairman and a developer from Wilmington, Del., said the EPA had “added just about everything into its jurisdiction by expanding the definition of a tributary — even ditches and man-made canals, or any other feature that a regulator determines to have a bed, bank and high-water mark. It’s a waste of taxpayer resources to treat a rainwater ditch with the same scrutiny as we would the Delaware Bay.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor about 30 years after the Clean Water Act passed in 1972, Congress and the EPA used an expansive definition of the protected waterways, said William W. Buzbee, director of the environmental law program at Emory University. But the Supreme Court decisions raised questions about the value of small upstream waterways and riparian wetlands.\n\n“During a time of uncertainty, the federal government’s enforcement of the law was weakened for fear of overstepping,” Buzbee said.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2009, the country lost tens of thousands of acres of wetlands. About 70% of that land was lost on the Gulf Coast to subsidence and rising sea levels, but the remainder inland disappeared because of development, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers say the draft rule is rooted in a September 2013 peer-reviewed assessment of more than a thousand science articles that look at the role of those bodies of water in the country’s larger hydrology.\n\nThe new rule would not be issued until after the completion of the final version of the assessment, the EPA said.\n\nThe assessment, Connectivity of Streams and Wetlands to Downstream Waters, concluded that “streams, regardless of their size or how frequently they flow, are connected to and have important effects on downstream waters.” The report also said riparian wetlands were connected to those smaller streams and filtered out pollution before it reached larger waterways.\n\nNearly 60% of the thousands of miles of streams in the United States flow seasonally or after heavy rains, especially in the drought-prone West, the report said. One in three Americans, or 117 million people, gets drinking water from systems fed by those streams, according to the EPA.\n\nEnvironmentalists and hunting and fishing organizations welcomed the proposed rule. There will be a 90-day comment period after it is published in the Federal Register in the coming weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Today’s action is vital to the health of America’s great waters,” said Margie Alt, executive director of Environment America. “By protecting the streams that feed into mighty rivers like the Mississippi and the wetlands that filter pollution from the Puget Sound and other iconic waters, this rule is a safety net for all the waterways Americans care about.”\n\nneela.banerjee@latimes.com', 'WASHINGTON — The Obama administration proposed a long-awaited rule on Tuesday to clarify that the Clean Water Act protects wetlands near rivers and waterways fed by seasonal thaws and rains — a decision that could particularly shield water sources in the West.\nOur businesses rely on abundant, usable water to manufacture.”AdvertisementUnder the draft rule, most intermittent and rain-dependent streams, as well as wetlands near rivers and streams, would be protected by the Clean Water Act.\nFor bodies of water farther away from perennial waterways, the need for permits would be examined on a case-by-case basis.\nThe effort to draft a rule to clearly define the scope of the Clean Water Act has been vigorously opposed by agricultural interests and industry, especially construction companies.\nOne in three Americans, or 117 million people, gets drinking water from systems fed by those streams, according to the EPA.']"

We remember the unspoiled wetlands and streams where our parents took us hunting and fishing as kids. We value our deep-rooted ties to the lakes and rivers that shape where we grew up and where we live. Our waters define who we are as people and as a nation.\n\nBefore 1972, that identity was threatened. Back then, levels of toxic pollution in our waters were so high that a river in Ohio caught fire. Americans deserved better, and millions of voices called for change. Congress answered the call with the passage of the Clean Water Act.\n\nFor more than four decades, the Clean Water Act has protected our right to safe water to drink and pristine places to hunt, fish, swim, and play. The law didn't just defend the mighty Mississippi or our Great Lakes; it also protected the smaller streams and wetlands that weave together a vast, interconnected system. It recognized the dangers of dumping toxic pollution upstream, because healthy downstream lakes and rivers are beholden to the streams and wetlands that feed them.\n\nIncredibly, one in three Americans -- more than 117 million people -- get their drinking water from these types of streams and headwaters. For example, every single one of more than two million people in Suffolk County, Mass., where I grew up, gets at least some of their water from these sources.\n\nWater doesn't just nourish our people -- it sustains a strong American economy. Our farmers and ranchers need access to clean water to grow the fuel, food, and fiber that feed our nation.\n\nManufacturers rely on abundant water supplies to make everything from cars to computer chips. And the energy sector depends on water to produce affordable power for our homes and businesses. According to the Outdoor Industry Association, outdoor recreation alone pumps more than $640 billion in direct consumer spending into the economy each year, accounting for more than six million domestic jobs.\n\nWithout Clean Water Act protections -- there's often nothing stopping sewage, toxic chemicals, or some other worst-case water scenario from threatening our health and livelihoods. Unfortunately, over the last decade, the Clean Water Act has been bogged down by confusion. Two complex court decisions narrowed legal protections and muddled everyone's understanding of what waters are -- or are not -- covered under the law. Protections have been especially confusing for those smaller, vital interconnected streams and wetlands.\n\n\n\nThat's why our action is so important. Based on sound science and the law, we're proposing a Clean Water Act rule that clarifies which waters are protected -- with an eye toward those critical waters upstream.\n\n\n\nSome may think that this rule will broaden the reach of EPA regulations -- but that's simply not the case. Our proposed rule will not add to or expand the scope of waters historically protected under the Clean Water Act. In the end -- the increased clarity will save us time, keep money in our pockets, cut red tape, give certainty to business, and help fulfill the Clean Water Act's original promise: to make America's waters fishable and swimmable for all.\n\n\n\nBut to get this rule right, we need everyone to be part of the conversation. We're holding discussions around the country and gathering input to help shape the final rule. Visit www.epa.gov/uswaters to learn more about the Clean Water Act and how you can comment on our proposal.\n\n\n\nWe've made a lot of progress over the last four decades. Our rivers are no longer flammable -- but we still have a ways to go. We need to do what we can to clear the way for the Clean Water Act do its job -- protecting our health, providing for our cherished pastimes, and promoting a thriving economy.\n\n\n\nToday's proposed rule helps clear that path forward. It gets us closer to clean, healthy waters upstream and downstream, so our children's children can enjoy the same treasured places we enjoy today.\n\n\n\nMore information: www.epa.gov/uswaters"", ""Congress answered the call with the passage of the Clean Water Act.\nFor more than four decades, the Clean Water Act has protected our right to safe water to drink and pristine places to hunt, fish, swim, and play.\nWithout Clean Water Act protections -- there's often nothing stopping sewage, toxic chemicals, or some other worst-case water scenario from threatening our health and livelihoods.\nUnfortunately, over the last decade, the Clean Water Act has been bogged down by confusion.\nVisit www.epa.gov/uswaters to learn more about the Clean Water Act and how you can comment on our proposal.""]"

At a very young age we were taught about the important role that water plays not only on our community\'s economy, but in our daily lives. In agricultural production, water is everything.\n\nYou don\'t have to grow up in a farm town though to understand that clean water is fundamental to our daily lives. The recent chemical spill in West Virginia, which left over 300,000 of that state\'s residents without usable water for weeks on end made that point catastrophically clear for many. The sad reality is that the experiences of those West Virginians are shared in many communities across this nation on a daily basis. The Clean Water Act -- a key environmental law that Congress passed in the \'70s to protect our nation\'s clean water resources -- is fundamentally broken.\n\nDrinking water sources of over 117 million Americans are in peril, unprotected by the Clean Water Act and at risk to harmful chemicals. You may be wondering, perhaps as you sip a cup of coffee or drink a cup of tea, \'Where did we go wrong?\' The answer rests in a small but important section of the Act that defines ""waters of the United States."" During the Bush administration, as a gift to water polluters nationwide, the EPA rushed through two controversial rules that narrowly defined ""waters of the United States"" under the Clean Water Act and removed its coverage of much of our nation\'s water bodies. Because of this, today more than 59 percent of U.S. streams and 20 million acres of wetlands are vulnerable to toxic pollution.\n\nOur families and communities have been feeling the loss of clean water protections. Today, more than 55 percent of our rivers and streams are rated in ""poor"" condition and considered unfit for drinking water, swimming, or fishing. Our waters have gotten dirtier, making it clear that we desperately need these protections back.\n\nThankfully, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finally taken steps to rectify this situation and restore the original intent (along with its coverage) of the Clean Water Act to many of the waters left vulnerable by the Bush rule. Today EPA proposed a draft rule, known as the ""Waters of the U.S."" rule, which defines waters of the U.S. in an evidence-based and scientifically accurate manner. The rule is based on extensive peer-reviewed scientific studies that affirm what common sense has long told us: If we want clean water for our communities and families, we must protect the vital streams and wetlands that flow into our drinking water sources. Before releasing this rule, the EPA heard from hundreds of thousands of concerned members of the public through hearings and public comments. They demand stronger clean water protections.\n\nThe Waters of the U.S. rule will restore Clean Water Act coverage to many of our nation\'s water bodies, ensuring that families, anglers, and recreationalists who value and rely upon safe and clean water can know that their waters are protected. The rule will also provide certainty to small businesses, ranchers, and farmers who, like all of us, rely on clean water supplies to thrive in their enterprises. The draft rule is a positive step forward in making sure that clean water is able to be enjoyed by all for many generations to come.\n\nEPA will be soliciting public comment on their proposed rule, as is required under the rulemaking process. I am sure that toxic polluters who have benefited from the loopholes currently in place will be pressuring the administration to keep the status quo or weaken the rule. I know I will be encouraging my family and friends back home to share their views on this rule with the EPA and tell them why protecting clean water is so essential to us all.', ""You don't have to grow up in a farm town though to understand that clean water is fundamental to our daily lives.\nThe Clean Water Act -- a key environmental law that Congress passed in the '70s to protect our nation's clean water resources -- is fundamentally broken.\nDrinking water sources of over 117 million Americans are in peril, unprotected by the Clean Water Act and at risk to harmful chemicals.\nOur families and communities have been feeling the loss of clean water protections.\nThe Waters of the U.S. rule will restore Clean Water Act coverage to many of our nation's water bodies, ensuring that families, anglers, and recreationalists who value and rely upon safe and clean water can know that their waters are protected.""]"

The rule clarifies the EPA’s regulatory power under the Clean Water Act, after two recent Supreme Court decisions threw some protections into legal jeopardy.\n\nIn a statement, ASBC said it supports the proposed rule because it will give the business community more confidence that streams and rivers will be protected, and provide a consistent regulatory system based on sound science. The following may be attributed to Richard Eidlin, Co-founder and Policy Director for ASBC:\n\n“American business has always depended on the availability of clean water for its success, and EPA’s regulation in this area historically has been a prime example of the vital partnership between business and government. Whether a company is a food producer, a high tech manufacturer of silicon wafers, outdoor recreation guide or a beer manufacturer, businesses rely on clean water to produce high quality and safe products. Ever since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the EPA has been charged with ensuring that our water supply remains safe. “Today, we applaud the Agency for taking steps to clarify that small streams, wetlands and other tributaries are protected by the Act. Degradation and loss of wetlands or small streams can increase the risk of floods, threatening businesses. Moreover, dirty, polluted water creates unnecessary and sometimes very difficult economic challenges for communities and businesses alike. Today’s action by the EPA is good for the environment and good for business.”\n\nASBC member businesses and partners also commented on the proposed new rule.\n\n“On behalf of the employee owners at New Belgium Brewing and our Alternatively Empowered culture, we offer a toast to 40 great years of the Clean Water Act and to the EPA and Obama Administration\'s leadership to make sure our water -- and our beer -- continues to be of the highest quality. We are thrilled for these incremental protections announced today that will help improve whole system watershed health,” said Andrew Lemley, Government Relations Director for New Belgium Brewing Company, Fort Collins, CO. “As a small business owner who personally experienced the negative economic impact of a recent chemical spill in West Virginia\'s Elk River, I know how crucial it is for strengthening EPA regulations to protect our waterways,” said Nancy Ward, CEO, Cornucopia, Charleston, WV. ""Water is quite literally the main ingredient for the foods we eat, and it is also central to the daily operations of our business. Clean and protected water thus couldn\'t be more important to King Arthur Flour and our commitment to healthy foods and a healthy planet,” said Suzanne McDowell, VP of Human Resources, King Arthur Flour Company, Norwich, VT. “Protection of small streams and wetlands is critical for maintaining the health of our food supply, communities, and businesses dependent on clean water. Used for livestock and crop irrigation upstream, and in food production, breweries, home kitchens and restaurants further down, the incalculable economic and social value of unpolluted water requires more than adequate safeguards and protections for a strong economy,” said Hilary Baum, Director, Chefs for the Marcellus, a campaign of food producers and businesses dedicated to protecting NYC’s regional foodshed.\n\nThe American Sustainable Business Council and its member organizations represent more than 200,000 businesses nationwide, and more than 325,000 entrepreneurs, executives, managers and investors.

""These places are where we get our drinking water and where our families hunt, fish, swim and play.""\n\nThe rule is aimed at clarifying which streams, creeks, bogs and marshes fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act following two muddled Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 that left both industry and agencies in regulatory limbo (Greenwire, Feb. 7, 2011).\n\nThat the rule was proposed at all is a major win for environmental groups, sportsmen and other supporters of a broader take on federal jurisdiction.\n\nAfter the second Supreme Court decision in 2008, the George W. Bush administration established an approach to claiming jurisdiction over waters that greens faulted as too narrow. In the years since, they have attempted both legislatively and administratively to get more waters and wetlands automatically covered.\n\n""Whether we look back to the recent spill in West Virginia that left 300,000 people without drinking water or ahead to the dead zones that will blight Lake Erie and the Chesapeake Bay this summer, it\'s obvious that our waterways are not as clean or safe as we need them to be -- for our drinking water, for recreation, or for the health of our ecosystems and wildlife,"" said Margie Alt, executive director of Environment America.\n\n""Today\'s action by the EPA will help ensure that all our waterways get the protection they need so we can enjoy them for years to come.""\n\nBut the proposal would have major impacts for homebuilders, oil and gas companies, and agribusinesses that have been pushing back since the rulemaking effort began.\n\nIndustry groups and their congressional allies have called the proposal a power grab and said it will have broad implications across the economy (Greenwire, Nov. 13, 2013).\n\nThey have also questioned the administration\'s economic analysis showing that benefits outweigh costs (E&ENews PM, Dec. 20, 2013).\n\n""The \'waters of the U.S.\' rule may be one of the most significant private property grabs in U.S. history,"" Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement.\n\nThe Obama administration is making a concerted effort to reach out to the rule\'s foes, particularly those in agriculture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe proposed rule would maintain all current exemptions for agriculture, and McCarthy said today EPA worked with the Department of Agriculture to develop and include a list of 53 additional exemptions for agricultural conservation practices.\n\n\'Significant\' connection\n\nThe rule proposal would place all tributaries -- including those that flow only seasonally or when it rains -- under federal jurisdiction, meaning that a permit would be required for anyone who wanted to fill those areas or discharge pollution into them.\n\nThe Supreme Court\'s 2006 decision in Rapanos v. United States threw protections for ""intermittent"" and ""ephemeral"" streams into question, and in many places they simply have not been regulated.\n\nEPA says about 60 percent of U.S. stream miles fall into the ""intermittent"" category.\n\nIt\'s an even more pressing issue in the West. A 2008 EPA study says 94 percent of Arizona\'s streams don\'t flow year-round, 89 percent of Nevada\'s are dry most of the year, and 88 percent of New Mexico\'s are not perennial.\n\nGeographically isolated wetlands -- like the Great Plains\' Prairie Potholes -- have also been a major question mark following the two high court decisions.\n\nUnder today\'s rule proposal, wetlands that are adjacent to jurisdictional waters would be regulated, but geographically isolated wetlands would still require a regulator to decide on a case-by-case basis whether it significantly affects factors such as flooding, pollution or species downstream.\n\nThe Obama administration has added a specific request for comment on this issue, though.\n\n""The agencies are interested in comments, scientific and technical data, case law, and other information that would further clarify which \'other waters\' should be considered similarly situated for purposes of a case-specific significant nexus determination,"" the rule states, noting that situations could, for instance, be broken down by ecological regions or hydrologic landscape regions.\n\nHowever, McCarthy said that for other types of waters to be ruled jurisdictional, one would have to show not just that there is a downstream connection but that it is a ""significant"" connection.\n\n""These other upstream waters must be shown to have a significant nexus to downstream water quality,"" McCarthy said. ""If you\'re a pond or a wetland, it\'s not enough to show that the connections simply exist; you have to show that that pond or wetland -- either alone or in combination with similarly situated waters in the region -- significantly affects the alteration of physical, chemical or biological integrity of other jurisdictional waters that the Clean Water Act was intended to protect.""\n\nThe rule also specifically asks for comment on whether there are categories of waters that could automatically be ruled outside of jurisdiction without a case-by-case analysis.\n\nThe agencies will be accepting public comment on the proposed rule for 90 days after it is published in the Federal Register.\n\nClick here for more information on the proposed rule.', 'The Obama administration unveiled a regulatory proposal today that would bring nearly all rivers, streams and creeks under the protection of the Clean Water Act and add clarity on which wetlands would receive protection.\nIn the years since, they have attempted both legislatively and administratively to get more waters and wetlands automatically covered.\n""These other upstream waters must be shown to have a significant nexus to downstream water quality,"" McCarthy said.\nThe agencies will be accepting public comment on the proposed rule for 90 days after it is published in the Federal Register.\nClick here for more information on the proposed rule.']"

It’s a waste of taxpayer resources to treat a rainwater ditch with the same scrutiny as we would the Delaware Bay,” Kelly said.\n\nExpanding federal authority under the Clean Water Act would greatly increase the number of construction sites required to obtain appropriate permits, which will also result in the delay or impede construction projects. Moreover, additional permits will burden the current exorbitant backlog of permits ranging between15,000 to 20,000. Enacted in 1987, the Clean Water Act continues to be a source of confusion for both regulators and those subject to regulation – and just what land should fall under federal, as opposed to state or local, permitting authority. It was originally designed to provide federal protection to navigable waters and those used for interstate commerce, but the limits of that protection were never clear.\n\nThe new definition doesn’t just affect home builders. Farmers and ranchers could also feel an impact on their business practices. Even home owners could need wetlands permits before doing landscaping projects if regulators determined that their land included a ‘tributary’ and thus subject to federal oversight.\n\n“It’s clear to us that this new proposal is not at all what Congress intended when it told EPA to clarify its jurisdictional reach,” Kelly said. “The agency needs to go back to work on this. We need to protect the environment with a carefully crafted rule, not this hurried, catch-all attempt. Adding this layer of regulation makes the land development process more expensive and time consuming. That’s bad news for home buyers and for the economy.”', 'WASHINGTON, D.C. – March 25, 2014 – (RealEstateRama) — The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to expand the reach of the Clean Water Act will increase the cost of new homes without a corresponding benefit to America’s lakes, rivers and other water bodies, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) said today.\nWhile NAHB has long asked for the rulemaking, EPA’s proposal goes too far.\nExpanding federal authority under the Clean Water Act would greatly increase the number of construction sites required to obtain appropriate permits, which will also result in the delay or impede construction projects.\nEnacted in 1987, the Clean Water Act continues to be a source of confusion for both regulators and those subject to regulation – and just what land should fall under federal, as opposed to state or local, permitting authority.\nIt was originally designed to provide federal protection to navigable waters and those used for interstate commerce, but the limits of that protection were never clear.']"

The proposed rule will benefit businesses by increasing efficiency in determining coverage of the Clean Water Act. The agencies are launching a robust outreach effort over the next 90 days, holding discussions around the country and gathering input needed to shape a final rule.\n\nDetermining Clean Water Act protection for streams and wetlands became confusing and complex following Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006. For nearly a decade, members of Congress, state and local officials, industry, agriculture, environmental groups, and the public asked for a rulemaking to provide clarity.\n\nThe proposed rule clarifies protection for streams and wetlands. The proposed definitions of waters will apply to all Clean Water Act programs. It does not protect any new types of waters that have not historically been covered under the Clean Water Act and is consistent with the Supreme Court’s more narrow reading of Clean Water Act jurisdiction.\n\n“We are clarifying protection for the upstream waters that are absolutely vital to downstream communities,” said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. “Clean water is essential to every single American, from families who rely on safe places to swim and healthy fish to eat, to farmers who need abundant and reliable sources of water to grow their crops, to hunters and fishermen who depend on healthy waters for recreation and their work, and to businesses that need a steady supply of water for operations.”\n\n“America’s waters and wetlands are valuable resources that must be protected today and for future generations,” said Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) Jo-Ellen Darcy. “Today’s rulemaking will better protect our aquatic resources, by strengthening the consistency, predictability, and transparency of our jurisdictional determinations. The rule’s clarifications will result in a better public service nationwide.”\n\nThe health of rivers, lakes, bays, and coastal waters depend on the streams and wetlands where they begin. Streams and wetlands provide many benefits to communities – they trap floodwaters, recharge groundwater supplies, remove pollution, and provide habitat for fish and wildlife. They are also economic drivers because of their role in fishing, hunting, agriculture, recreation, energy, and manufacturing.\n\nAbout 60 percent of stream miles in the U.S only flow seasonally or after rain, but have a considerable impact on the downstream waters. And approximately 117 million people – one in three Americans – get drinking water from public systems that rely in part on these streams. These are important waterways for which EPA and the Army Corps is clarifying protection.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule clarifies that under the Clean Water Act and based on the science:\n\nMost seasonal and rain-dependent streams are protected.\n\nWetlands near rivers and streams are protected.\n\nOther types of waters may have more uncertain connections with downstream water and protection will be evaluated through a case specific analysis of whether the connection is or is not significant. However, to provide more certainty, the proposal requests comment on options protecting similarly situated waters in certain geographic areas or adding to the categories of waters protected without case specific analysis.\n\nThe proposed rule preserves the Clean Water Act exemptions and exclusions for agriculture. Additionally, EPA and the Army Corps have coordinated with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop an interpretive rule to ensure that 53 specific conservation practices that protect or improve water quality will not be subject to Section 404 dredged or fill permitting requirements. The agencies will work together to implement these new exemptions and periodically review, and update USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation practice standards and activities that would qualify under the exemption. Any agriculture activity that does not result in the discharge of a pollutant to waters of the U.S. still does not require a permit.\n\nThe proposed rule also helps states and tribes – according to a study by the Environmental Law Institute, 36 states have legal limitations on their ability to fully protect waters that aren’t covered by the Clean Water Act.\n\nThe proposed rule is supported by the latest peer-reviewed science, including a draft scientific assessment by EPA, which presents a review and synthesis of more than 1,000 pieces of scientific literature.

Today, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers have united to propose a rule that will strengthen the Clean Water Act, applied to safeguard American water quality since 1972.\n\nThe rule will improve protection of the water that one in three Americans rely on to drink. It will apply to over half of America’s streams and 20 million acres of wetlands and will close an increasingly troubling loophole in the law on cooling water permits and oil spill contingency plans, among other impacts.\n\nPolluting industries have led challenges to the Clean Water Act all the way the Supreme Court in 2001 and 2006. Their efforts increased confusion about and complexity within administration of the Act. In September 2013, the EPA moved forward on the issues, releasing a report that makes the scientific case for the rule by demonstrating the vital connection between smaller streams and wetlands and downstream waters. Citizens submitted over 150,000 public comments in support of the findings.\n\nPredictably, oil, gas, and electric utilities, as well as some agriculture, construction, mining, and manufacturing interests, object to the proposed EPA-Army Corps rule. Owners of thousands of miles of fuel pipelines that transect wetlands, factory farms whose manure and fertilizers run off into surface water, and Big Coal, which empties mountaintops into watercourses, oppose the measure.\n\nThe National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which represents the interests of independent not-for-profit, member-owned electric generation, transmission, and distribution utilities, has voiced some of their concerns:\n\n“Such an expansion of Clean Water Act rules would have significant impacts on co-ops by increasing the number and costs of permits needed for distribution and transportation corridor construction and maintenance and substations.”\n\nNRECA serves 40 million people (only 12% of the nation’s population) across the US, yet it owns 42% of America’s electric distribution lines, which cover 75% of the country. Paradoxically, the electric cooperatives are more renewable-friendly than the utility sector as a whole (11% vs 8%).\n\nAs conservative forces often do, NRECA states its intentions in an apparently environment-friendly way: “to take all appropriate actions to protect the interests of electric cooperatives and their members to ensure that any Clean Water Act requirements allow utilities as much flexibility as possible to meet environmental goals to enhance water quality through scientifically sound, cost-effective methods.” Key words of debate here: “flexibility,” “scientifically sound,” and “cost-effective.”\n\nEnvironmental interests note that the commonsense clean water rule does not protect any “new” waters not historically covered under the Clean Water Act. Also, it is consistent with the Supreme Court’s narrow readings of Clean Water Act jurisdiction.\n\nMargie Alt, executive director of Environment America, a federation of 29 statewide, citizen-funded environmental advocacy organizations, comments:\n\n“Whether we look back to the recent spill in West Virginia that left 300,000 people without drinking water [followed intensively by PlanetSave] or ahead to the dead zones that will blight Lake Erie and the Chesapeake Bay this summer, it’s obvious that our waterways are not as clean or safe as we need them to be—-for our drinking water, for recreation, or for the health of our ecosystems and wildlife. Today’s action by the EPA will help ensure that all our waterways get the protection they need so we can enjoy them for years to come.”\n\nSays EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy:\n\n“We are clarifying protection for the upstream waters that are absolutely vital to downstream communities. Clean water is essential to every single American, from families who rely on safe places to swim and healthy fish to eat, to farmers who need abundant and reliable sources of water to grow their crops, to hunters and fishermen who depend on healthy waters for recreation and their work, and to businesses that need a steady supply of water for operations.”\n\nThe Huffington Post published “Clearer Protections for Clean Water,” an explanatory blog by McCarthy, less than an hour ago.\n\nThe rule should help protect American waters from harmful development and previously unchecked pollution by energy companies. The EPA-Army Corps proposal is now under review at the White House Office of Management and Budget, which must approve it before publication in the Federal Register and acceptance of public comments.', 'It doesn’t take rocket science to draw a line between pollutants in small streams and wetlands and water quality downstream.\nToday, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers have united to propose a rule that will strengthen the Clean Water Act, applied to safeguard American water quality since 1972.\nThe rule will improve protection of the water that one in three Americans rely on to drink.\nPolluting industries have led challenges to the Clean Water Act all the way the Supreme Court in 2001 and 2006.\nAlso, it is consistent with the Supreme Court’s narrow readings of Clean Water Act jurisdiction.']"

For agricultural interests who have closely monitored how EPA would define navigable waters, the verdict is still out on whether EPA indeed has struck the proper balance on the proposal.\n\nDetermining Clean Water Act protection for streams and wetlands became confusing and complex following Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006. The rule does not protect any new types of waters that have not historically been covered under the Clean Water Act and is consistent with the Supreme Court’s more narrow reading of Clean Water Act jurisdiction, the government agencies said in a joint statement.\n\nFor the past three years, EPA and the Army Corps said they have listened to important input from the agriculture community regarding to clarifications to the Clean Water Act. As such, “all agricultural exemptions and exclusions from Clean Water Act requirements that have existed for nearly 40 years have been retained with clarification.”\n\nEPA said any normal farming activity that does not result in a point source discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S. still does not require a permit. Those activities include plowing, seeding, cultivating, minor drainage, and harvesting for production of food, fiber, and forest products, a fact sheet on the exemptions detailed.\n\nChandler Goule, National Farmers Union senior vice president of programs, said NFU has long advocated for increased certainty surrounding Clean Water Act requirements for family farmers and ranchers in the wake of complicating Supreme Court decisions. The draft rule clarifies Clean Water Act jurisdiction, maintains existing agricultural exemptions and adds new exemptions, and encourages enrollment in U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs.\n\n“In addition, farmers and ranchers who are voluntarily enacting certain conservation practices on their farms will be exempt from Clean Water Act Section 404 permitting requirements,” Goule said.\n\nThrough coordination with USDA, EPA and the Army Corps have ensured that 53 conservation practices that protect or improve water quality will not be subject to Clean Water Act dredge and fill permitting requirements. The agencies said they will work together to implement these new exemptions and periodically review, and update USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation practice standards and activities that would qualify under the exemption. Any agriculture activity that does not result in the discharge of a pollutant to waters of the U.S. still does not require a permit, EPA said.\n\nAn industry source, who has closely worked on the water regulatory scene for major agricultural groups, said that the basic problems that agriculture was worried about with the leaked draft proposal last fall remain.\n\nIf water is moving through drainage features and makes it into other waters, it could fall under EPA’s jurisdiction still, the source said. “It’s hard to understand where there’s any kind of limit to EPA and Corps’ of Engineers’ jurisdiction.”\n\nHe added that if farmers’ conservation practices are exempt, the features themselves could be considered being waters of the United States which carries significant regulatory implications.\n\n\n\nThe proposed rule will be open for public comment for 90 days from publication in the Federal Register.

The rule\'s clarifications will result in a better public service nationwide.""\n\nThe health of rivers, lakes, bays, and coastal waters depend on the streams and wetlands where they begin. Streams and wetlands provide many benefits to communities â€“ they trap floodwaters, recharge groundwater supplies, remove pollution, and provide habitat for fish and wildlife. They are also economic drivers because of their role in fishing, hunting, agriculture, recreation, energy, and manufacturing.\n\nAbout 60 percent of stream miles in the U.S. only flow seasonally or after rain, but have a considerable impact on the downstream waters. And approximately 117 million people or one in three Americans, get drinking water from public systems that rely in part on these streams. These are important waterways for which EPA and the Army Corps is clarifying protection.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed rule clarifies that under the Clean Water Act and based on the science:\n\nÂ· Most seasonal and rain-dependent streams are protected.\n\nÂ· Wetlands near rivers and streams are protected.\n\nÂ· Other types of waters may have more uncertain connections with downstream water and protection will be evaluated through a case specific analysis of whether the connection is or is not significant.

The move, designed to clarify rules under the federal Clean Water Act, has been expected for months and was backed by a report released this past December by EPA’s Science Advisory Board (SAB). The public now has about 3 months to comment on the rule, which is drawing opposition from agricultural groups and others.\n\n“We are clarifying protection for the upstream waters that are absolutely vital to downstream communities,” said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in a statement.\n\nThe rule will “better protect our aquatic resources, by strengthening the consistency, predictability, and transparency of our jurisdictional determinations,” added Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) Jo-Ellen Darcy.\n\nThe rule attempts to clear up confusion created by Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 that complicated efforts to regulate development in and around smaller streams and wetlands, particularly those that dry up for part of the year. EPA estimates that about 60% of U.S. stream segments flow seasonally or only after rain. But even such temporary water bodies can have a major impact on the health of downstream waters, EPA’s science board found, and agency officials argue that justifies their inclusion under Clean Water Act protections, which some agency critics have argued apply only to larger, more permanent water bodies.\n\nEnvironmental groups are praising the move. “EPA took an important step to finally rescue these waters from legal limbo,” said Peter Lehner, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, headquarted in New York City, in a statement. But he predicted that “[e]ven though these are common-sense protections, the polluters are sure to attack them.”\n\nCritics argue the agencies are overreaching and moving without a full accounting of the science. “In preparing this proposal, the EPA failed to incorporate adequate peer-reviewed science in accordance with the agency’s own statutory obligations,” said Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX), chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, in a statement. “It’s troubling that the Administration proposed this expansion before its independent science advisors have had the chance to complete its review of the underlying science. The Obama administration continues to sidestep scientific integrity in order to fast track an abusive regulatory agenda.”\n\nThe agencies, however, say they’ve fully assessed the science. EPA’s science advisers presented “a review and synthesis of more than 1,000 pieces of scientific literature,” according to their statement.

Drinking water supplies for more than one-third of Americans will be safer once this rule is put into place.”\n\nTogether with administrative guidance issued in 2003 and 2008, two Supreme Court decisions in the 2000s removed Clean Water Act protections for at least 20 million acres of wetlands, particularly prairie potholes and other seasonal wetlands essential to waterfowl populations throughout the country. Intermittent streams that provide critical habitat for fish, especially trout, and feed into the public drinking water systems for more than 117 million Americans also were put at increased risk of pollution and destruction.\n\n“Many of these small waters provide vital spawning and rearing habitat for trout and salmon. Simply stated, the proposal will make fishing better,” said TU President and CEO Chris Wood. “Restoring protections to these waters ensures healthy habitat for fish and a bright future for anglers.”\n\nAccording to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the rate of wetlands loss accelerated by 140 percent from 2004 to 2009, the years immediately after the Supreme Court rulings.\n\n“The economic benefits to the United States from these wetlands and streams are staggering,” said AFFTA president Ben Bulis. “For example, direct spending on hunting and fishing totals $86 billion each year in the United States, which ripples through the economy, generating $200 billion in total economic activity annually.”\n\nThe wording of the two Supreme Court decisions left state and federal regulators, landowners and manufacturers confused about which U.S. waters are protected by the Clean Water Act.\n\n“In a measured response to the Supreme Court’s decisions, the proposed rule will provide the clear direction necessary to conserve the nation’s wetlands and streams,” said WMI President Steve Williams. “In addition, it provides practical and necessary exclusions for farming and forestry activities. The rule recognizes the essential value of clean water for our nation’s citizens and our fish and wildlife resources.” “The proposed rule takes a moderate approach – based on the best available peer-reviewed scientific evidence – that falls within the limits of the Supreme Court decisions,” said Scott Kovarovics, executive director of the IWLA. “It preserves the existing exemptions for farming, forestry, mining and other land use activities, such as the exemption in the existing regulation for many wetlands converted to cropland prior to 1985, as well as exemptions written into the Clean Water Act itself that cannot be changed by administrative action.”\n\nThe rule also for the first time explicitly excludes many upland water features important for farming and forestry, such as:\n\nupland drainage ditches with no more than ephemeral water flows;\n\nartificially irrigated areas that would revert to upland should irrigation cease;\n\nartificial lakes or ponds used for purposes such as stock watering;\n\nartificial ornamental waters created for primarily aesthetic reasons; and\n\nwater-filled depressions created as a result of construction activity.\n\n“All sides of this debate and the Supreme Court have said a rulemaking is necessary to give regulators and the regulated community certainty as well as fulfill the Clean Water Act’s goal of ensuring fishable and swimmable waters,” said TRCP Center for Water Resources Director Jimmy Hague. “Now that the proposed rule is public, we can finally have this discussion based on fact and go about the process of restoring Clean Water Act protections to waters upon which America’s hunters and anglers rely.” “We are glad to have the Clean Water Act protections for our lakes, rivers and streams clarified to end the confusion,” said Jim Martin, conservation director of the Berkley Conservation Institute. “It simply makes no sense for the taxpayers to pay millions to clean up waters that were polluted, flooded and damaged when it makes the most sense to protect them in the first place.”\n\nInspired by the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, the TRCP is a coalition of organizations and grassroots partners working together to preserve the traditions of hunting and fishing.', 'WASHINGTON –-(Ammoland.com)- Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Environmental Protection Agency jointly released a proposed rule that would clearly define which streams and wetlands are protected by the Clean Water Act.\nThis action would begin restoring longstanding protections to many of the nation’s wetlands, streams and lakes, conserving critical fish and wildlife habitat and providing flood control, cleaner drinking water and a host of other benefits.\n“We simply cannot protect our rivers, lakes and bays without protecting the many small streams and wetlands that feed into them.\n“The economic benefits to the United States from these wetlands and streams are staggering,” said AFFTA president Ben Bulis.\n“In a measured response to the Supreme Court’s decisions, the proposed rule will provide the clear direction necessary to conserve the nation’s wetlands and streams,” said WMI President Steve Williams.']"

She added that the ""considerable period"" between the end of the Fed\'s economic stimulus program and the first rate increase could be six months, meaning that the first rate hike could happen as early as spring next year.\n\nHigher interests rates in the US, analysts said, would reshuffle the pattern of international fund flow in place since the global financial crisis in 2008, driving funds back to dollar assets and weakening emerging market currencies, including the yuan, against the greenback.\n\nAfter Yellen made the comments on Friday, the yuan continued to weaken against the dollar, trading as low as 6.22 at one point, its weakest level in more than a year.\n\n""The yuan has gone from being a most attractive carry trade bet in emerging markets to the worst in two months as the central bank\'s efforts to weaken the currency has caused volatility to surge,"" Geoffrey Kendrick, head of Asian currency and rates strategy at Morgan Stanley, said at a news conference last month.\n\n""Implied volatility in the currency rose in February by the most since May, when the Fed first signaled plans to cut stimulus.""\n\nShen Jianguang, Hong Kong-based chief economist with Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd, wrote in a commentary on Tuesday that the yuan has entered into a ""new era of two-way fluctuation"".\n\nRoom for appreciation is ""very limited"", he wrote, given that China\'s trade surplus has been shrinking, labor costs are rising, and it has already strengthened by more than 40 percent against the dollar since 2005.\n\nRoom for depreciation is limited, too, as the direction for fund flow is still inbound, and China\'s economic growth is still one of the world\'s fastest despite its recent deceleration.\n\n""Two-way fluctuation against the US dollar will happen more frequently and in a bigger range this year, while the yuan will remain basically stable against a basket of currencies,"" Shen said.\n\nBank of China Ltd said in a report that the yuan\'s recent decline will be short-lived and that China\'s trade surplus and huge foreign exchange reserve will support the currency\'s long-term appreciation.\n\nNathan Chow, a Hong Kong-based economist with DBS Bank Ltd, said that the recent yuan weakness and narrower onshore-offshore yuan spread are unlikely to reverse the currency\'s increasing global role in trade finance activities\n\n""A more flexible and volatile yuan exchange rate is likely to give rise to more genuine participation and less speculation in such activities,"" he wrote. ""The longer-term growth in yuan trade finance will be motivated more by companies seeking cost advantages and a desire to mitigate foreign exchange risks.""\n\nOn Tuesday, the yuan jumped on expectation that recent economic weakness will prompt Beijing to stimulate growth.\n\nThe yuan opened at 6.1828 per dollar, 131 basis points higher than Monday\'s close of 6.1959, amid a 26-basis-point increase in the daily reference rate to 6.1426.\n\nThe jump came as the flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers\' Index, issued by HSBC Holdings Plc, fell to 48.1 in March, its lowest level since July 2013. The PMI was down from February\'s final reading of 48.5 and 49.5 in January. It disappointed analysts who expected a modest pickup.\n\nSigns of a slowdown in China\'s economic growth were also factors in the yuan\'s previous weakening. A report released earlier in March revealed that Chinese exports declined by more than 18 percent in February from a year earlier, compared with a 10.6 percent increase in January, and a market expectation of a 6.8 percent increase.', 'The yuan closed at 6.1781 to the dollar on Monday, down 285 basis points from Friday.\nZhou Xiaochuan, the central bank governor, has been pushing the idea for years, but traders really started to embrace it this time as their long positions suffered badly from a nosedive in the yuan\'s exchange rate.\nThe yuan lost 1.4 percent in February along with another 1.2 percent lost so far this month, following 10 years of appreciation.\n""The longer-term growth in yuan trade finance will be motivated more by companies seeking cost advantages and a desire to mitigate foreign exchange risks.""\nOn Tuesday, the yuan jumped on expectation that recent economic weakness will prompt Beijing to stimulate growth.']"

44258,http://qz.com/191845/hong-kong-banks-have-loaned-165-of-the-territorys-gdp-to-china/,business,"['A few years ago, Hong Kong banks had issued almost no loans to mainland China. Now that number is at nearly $450 billion, according to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nThe regulator reports that, at the end of 2013, nearly 40% of Hong Kong banks’ total loan books were net claims on China, up from zero in 2010. Here’s a look at that trend as of Q3 2013 (some more recent charts from Reuters are here):\n\nBank for International Settlements \u200b\n\nThis mainland vulnerability of Hong Kong banks is stoking anxiety among investors. Not only is the country’s economy rapidly slowing, but a recent spate of defaults highlights the dire financial straits of many of the country’s borrowers, particularly those borrowing through shadow channels, which evade the balance sheets—and, therefore, required capital buffers—of Chinese banks. Bank of East Asia is the worst off, with 46% of its loans to China, says Reuters.\n\nThere are a good reasons this may sound way worse than it is. Hong Kong banks are required to hold relatively large amounts of capital as a buffer against default. In addition, a good portion of those “loans” are actually trade finance, credit issued to facilitate Chinese imports and exports that’s usually considered low risk because it’s short-term.\n\nA lot of the credit recorded as “trade finance” isn’t, though.\n\nAs we’ve discussed in the past, over-invoicing of exports has been a popular way of profiting on the mainland’s relatively high borrowing costs and the appreciation of the yuan against the dollar. Reporting the fake sale of exports allows traders to bring more yuan into the mainland than they actually earned settling their export order. That extra cash comes from borrowing dollars from Hong Kong banks at low rates, which traders swap for yuan. Instead of holding those in low-yielding Chinese bank accounts, many traders invest in shadow finance products, particularly in trust loan products, according to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch in a February note.\n\nBank of America/Merrill Lynch \u200b\n\nThis and other methods of betting on yuan appreciation contributed to around $500 billion of yuan bets outstanding as of February, when the government began weakening the yuan. The yuan recovered somewhat against the dollar today. But any trader who didn’t cover their yuan bets with hedges lost money a lot of money as a result of the yuan’s nearly 3% drop since late February. An anonymous source told Reuters loan defaults from these losses could hit Hong Kong banks.\n\nSome of that hot money came from banks in Taiwan, Singapore, the UK, and possibly South Korea. That’s part of why Standard and Poors, a ratings agency, says a Chinese “hard landing”—a drop to 5% annual GDP growth—would hurt many Asian banking sectors. But Hong Kong banks, says S&P, would “suffer significant credit losses” on their loans to the mainland.', 'A few years ago, Hong Kong banks had issued almost no loans to mainland China.\nThe regulator reports that, at the end of 2013, nearly 40% of Hong Kong banks’ total loan books were net claims on China, up from zero in 2010.\nHong Kong banks are required to hold relatively large amounts of capital as a buffer against default.\nAn anonymous source told Reuters loan defaults from these losses could hit Hong Kong banks.\nBut Hong Kong banks, says S&P, would “suffer significant credit losses” on their loans to the mainland.']"

Specifically, the currency decreased to 6.23 yuan to the US dollar on March 20. Moreover, since the beginning of 2014, this currency has fallen just over 2.5% in value.\n\nPreviously, many viewed the yuan as a safe currency to invest in as the currency increased approximately 9% in value since mid 2010. The Chinese government previously strictly controlled the value of the yuan, and not surprisingly, favorable exchange rates increased net exports. However, today, due to a more flexible government policy, the yuan can move 2% up or down a set rate on a daily basis.\n\nMany individuals believe that this strategy from the Chinese central bank will help to put an end to the influx of “hot money” into the country. This term refers to the process where money from foreign countries with low interest rates invest in China with the goal of making a significant amount of money.\n\nThat said, many investors look at the current value of the yuan as more of a reflection of the state of the Chinese economy. After all, the economy slowed down at the beginning of the year and financial defaults are becoming a larger problem in Chinese markets. For instance, very recently the Chaori Solar Energy company in Shanghai stated that it can no longer meet its bond payments. Additionally, the largest steel company in China recently defaulted on a debt to the amount of CNY 3 billion.\n\nIn years gone by, the Chinese government would have helped these companies by either providing extensions or bailouts; however, today, the government is not likely to intervene in these types of matters. With this type of policy, the Chinese economy will most likely strengthen in the long term.

Profits for the fourth quarter alone were 28.2 billion, a year-on-year rise of 12.8 percent and lower that the 15.3 percent profit growth in the third quarter.\n\n“Banks tend to book much larger loan provisioning in the fourth quarter, so we tend to factor in larger loan provisions,” Grace Wu, head China Banks for Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong, said before the earnings were released.\n\nSELLING OFF BAD LOANS\n\nInvestors are likely to take comfort in AgBank’s decline in non-performing loans (NPLs) and an increase in net interest margins.\n\nThe non-performing loan ratio fell slightly to 1.22 percent at end-December 2013 from 1.24 percent at end-September. So-called “special mention” loans, or those not classified as NPLs but considered at risk, also fell 19.1 billion yuan on the year.\n\nThe decline in the NPL ratio was due in part to asset disposals. AgBank sold off 4.1 billion yuan worth of bad loans to dedicated bad-loan asset managers in 2013, Chief Risk Officer Song Xianping said at an earnings briefing in Hong Kong.\n\nNon performing loans reached 87.8 billion yuan by the end of December, the bank said.\n\nThe fears of loan defaults follow a broad range of indicators that have depicted a slowdown in China’s economy in recent months.\n\nThe weaker economy has put pressure on banks ability to raise, and maintain, capital. AgBank’s tier-one capital ratio, a key measure of a bank’s ability to absorb losses, dipped to 9.25 percent at the end of 2013 from 9.35 percent at end-September.\n\nThe bank, however, maintained a dividend payout ratio of 35 percent, meeting a target that analysts had flagged as an important indicator of its confidence in its asset quality. A lower dividend ratio would have enabled the bank to boost its capital through retained earnings.\n\n“Greater efforts were made for the disposal of non-performing assets and write-off of bad debts to maintain the stability of our asset quality,” President Zhang Yun in the earnings statement.\n\nThe China Banking Regulatory Commission requires AgBank and other large lenders to meet a tier-one ratio of 7.9 percent by the end of 2014 and 9.5 percent by 2018 as it aggressively implements new capital adequacy standards introduced last year in line with the global rules known as Basel III.\n\nTo support banks capital-raising efforts, regulators are encouraging lenders to use hybrid instruments, which combine elements of debt and equity.\n\nLast week, China’s securities regulator unveiled rules for a pilot programme to allow banks and other listed firms to issue preferred shares, a form of equity that offers fixed dividends and is less dilutive than common equity.\n\nAgBank said it had prepared a plan to issue preferred shares and is awaiting more detailed rules from regulators before proceeding.
