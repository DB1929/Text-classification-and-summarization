These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nTAMPA, Fla. -- Obese women who maintained weight loss after bariatric surgery seemed to have a 71% lower risk of developing uterine cancer as compared with women who were obese and did not undergo surgery, investigators reported here.\n\nOverall, obesity almost tripled the risk of uterine cancer as compared with non-obese women. The cancer risk posed by obesity declined sharply in the subgroup of women who had bariatric surgery and remained significantly lower in patients who kept the weight off versus those who did not (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.27-0.32).\n\nThe retrospective analysis of data does not prove that bariatric surgery reduces the risk of uterine cancer but does add to a growing body of evidence that obesity increases a woman\'s risk of the cancer, Kristy Ward, MD, said during a presentation at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology meeting.\n\n""A history of bariatric surgery is associated with a substantial and clinically significant reduced risk of uterine cancer,"" said Ward, of the University of California San Diego. ""Our previous work, in agreement with the findings of others, has indicated that the risk of uterine malignancy increases linearly with BMI [body mass index].\n\n""Along with the findings of this current study, this supports that obesity may be a modifiable risk factor related to development of endometrial cancer.""\n\nMultiple studies have shown significant associations between obesity and various types of cancer. Among gynecologic malignancies, endometrial cancer has the strongest association with increasing body mass, estimated at about 40% of all endometrial cancers.\n\nProving that weight loss reduces cancer risk has been difficult, said Ward, as many patients regain weight over time, complicating long-term follow-up needed to study cancer. Observational studies have suggested a reduced risk of breast cancer after intentional weight loss.\n\nBariatric surgery leads to rapid and substantial weight loss, which tends to be greater and more durable as compared with other methods of weight loss, Ward continued. Good evidence supports resolution of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors following bariatric surgery. Evidence of a reduced cancer risk is more modest but continues to accumulate.\n\nWard and colleagues hypothesized that the risk of uterine malignancy would be reduced in women who had a history of bariatric surgery. To test the hypothesis, they reviewed admission records in the nationwide University HealthSystem Consortium database, limiting the search to the time frame of Jan. 1, 2009, to June 1, 2013.\n\nThe query produced records for 7,431,858 admissions, including 103,797 patients with a history of bariatric surgery and 44,345 cases of uterine cancer. Investigators separated the patients into currently obese and non-obese groups and further divided them into groups who had a history of bariatric surgery and those who did not.\n\nOverall, non-obese women with a history of bariatric surgery had the lowest risk of uterine cancer at 270/100,000 admissions. Non-obese women without a history of bariatric surgery had the second lowest risk at 496/100,000 admissions.\n\nAmong obese patients, those with a history of bariatric surgery had a uterine cancer rate of 682/100,000 admissions, and obese women without a history of bariatric surgery had the highest risk at 1,409/100,000 admissions.\n\nInvestigators then calculated the relative risk of uterine cancer as compared with women who were obese and had no history of bariatric procedures. Non-obese women without a history of bariatric surgery had an 81% lower risk (RR 0.19), followed by non-obese women with a history of bariatric surgery (RR 0.29).\n\nWomen who were obese despite having undergone bariatric surgery still had 52% lower risk of uterine cancer versus women who were obese and had no history of bariatric procedures (RR 0.48).\n\nAsked to address the potential underlying biologic mechanisms by which bariatric surgery might reduce uterine cancer risk, Ward said the mechanism remains undetermined, but some evidence suggests the surgery reduces inflammation, which is known to play a role in cancer evolution.\n\nIn response to another question from the audience, Ward said the investigators did not have the individual patient data needed to evaluate uterine cancer risk by type of bariatric surgery procedure.\n\nWard and colleagues disclosed no relevant relationships.\n\n2014-03-23T11:00:00-0400', '""A history of bariatric surgery is associated with a substantial and clinically significant reduced risk of uterine cancer,"" said Ward, of the University of California San Diego.\nThe query produced records for 7,431,858 admissions, including 103,797 patients with a history of bariatric surgery and 44,345 cases of uterine cancer.\nOverall, non-obese women with a history of bariatric surgery had the lowest risk of uterine cancer at 270/100,000 admissions.\nAmong obese patients, those with a history of bariatric surgery had a uterine cancer rate of 682/100,000 admissions, and obese women without a history of bariatric surgery had the highest risk at 1,409/100,000 admissions.\nNon-obese women without a history of bariatric surgery had an 81% lower risk (RR 0.19), followed by non-obese women with a history of bariatric surgery (RR 0.29).']"

""This risk likely continues to go up as BMI goes up.""\n\nBariatric surgery is often the last resort for obese patients after all other non-surgical weight loss efforts have failed.

In all cases, the surgery must be followed by lifestyle changes to ensure long-term weight loss success.\n\nA number of biological mechanisms link obesity to endometrial cancer. Excessive adipose or fat tissue, for example, raises circulating levels of estrogen, which is associated with tumor creation and metastasis. Obesity also causes chronic inflammation, boosting insulin resistance and increased estrogen levels.\n\n""The majority of endometrial cancers are estrogen-driven,"" said Ward. ""In a normal menstruating woman, two hormones control the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus). Estrogen builds up the endometrium and progesterone stabilizes it. A woman with excess adipose tissue has an increased level of estrogen because the fat tissue converts steroid hormones into a form of estrogen.\n\n""So there is too much estrogen, causing the endometrium to build up, but not enough progesterone to stabilize it. The endometrium continues to grow and can undergo changes into abnormal tissue, leading to cancer.""\n\nBariatric surgery has been shown to reduce the impact of these factors: hormone levels become normal; inflammation decreases; insulin resistance drops; weight loss allows for increased physical activity and improved overall health.\n\n""The obesity epidemic is a complicated problem,"" she said.

The research will be published in a special issue on gynecologic cancer prevention, treatment and survivorship in obese women in the April edition of the journal Gynecologic Oncology.\n\nUterine cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive organs, affecting about 50,000 women in 2013, according to the National Cancer Institute. Endometrial cancer – which occurs in the inner lining of the uterus – accounts for 95 percent of uterine cancers. About half of all cases of endometrial cancer can be traced to obesity. Obese women are two to four times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than those of normal weight.\n\n“We found that after women had bariatric surgery, their risk of uterine cancer plummeted and became the same or perhaps even a little less than in women who were not obese,” said Kristy Ward, MD, lead author and gynecologic oncologist at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.\n\n“Obesity is the second leading cause of preventable death, and this research adds to the growing evidence that reducing obesity reduces cancer. We need to focus on finding ways to help women lose weight, and for appropriate patients, bariatric surgery may be an option.”\n\nResearchers analyzed information from more than 7 million admissions of women to one of more 392 U.S. nonprofit academic medical centers or affiliated hospitals between Jan. 1, 2009 and June 1, 2013. Of those, 103,797 had previously had bariatric surgery and 424 (.4 percent) were diagnosed with uterine cancer. Of the 832,372 who were considered obese and had not previously undergone bariatric surgery, 11,729 (1.4 percent) were diagnosed with uterine cancer. In other words, obese women who had bariatric surgery were 3-1/2 times less likely to get uterine cancer than women who had not had the surgery. Among the nearly 6.5 million admissions of non-obese women who had not previously had bariatric surgery, 32,192 (.5 percent) were diagnosed with uterine cancer.\n\nThe benefit of bariatric surgery was even more pronounced among women who were able to keep the weight off. While just having bariatric surgery reduced the risk of getting uterine cancer by 71 percent, the risk reduction was 81 percent among women who had bariatric surgery and maintained a normal weight.\n\nApproximately 200,000 people have bariatric surgery every year to lose weight. Most of them are significantly overweight, often as much as 100 pounds above their ideal weight. There are several types of bariatric surgery, which either limit the amount of food the stomach can hold or bypass part of the small intestine, limiting the calories the body can absorb. The study didn’t differentiate between types of bariatric surgery.\n\nAbout SGOThe Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) is a 501(c)6 national medical specialty organization of physicians and allied health care professionals who are trained in the comprehensive management of women with malignancies of the reproductive tract.

The risk is reduced by 81 percent if the women are able to stay at a normal weight after their surgery.\n\n“Estimating from various studies that looked at increasing BMI and endometrial cancer risk, a woman with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 would have approximately eight times greater risk of endometrial cancer than someone with a BMI of 25,” Dr. Kristy Ward, an author of the study and senior gynecologic oncology fellow at the Department of Reproductive Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine, said in a press release. “This risk likely continues to go up as BMI goes up.”\n\nBariatric surgery is the process of making the stomach of a severely obese person much smaller by using a gastric band, removing part of the stomach, or re-adjusting a person’s small intestines to make a stomach pouch. Though it may seem like an “easy way out,” patients who undergo bariatric surgery must also follow through on their own lifestyle changes to ensure the weight loss is successful. This means eating healthier and taking part in more physical activity.\n\nIn order to be accepted for undergoing bariatric surgery, patients must have a BMI of 40 or greater, or have a BMI of 35 or greater with one of the following conditions: diabetes, obesity-related cardiomyopathy, obstructive sleep apnea, heart muscle disease or severe joint disease.\n\nObesity has been linked to endometrial cancer because excessive fat tissue contributes to an increase in estrogen, which in turn is associated with tumors and metastasis. Chronic inflammation is also caused by obesity, which boosts levels of estrogen and insulin resistance. “The majority of endometrial cancers are estrogen-driven,” Ward said in the press release. “In a normal menstruating woman, two hormones control the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus). Estrogen builds up the endometrium and progesterone stabilizes it. A woman with excess adipose tissue has an increased level of estrogen because the fat tissue converts steroid hormones into a form of estrogen.” This ultimately leads to a build-up of the endometrium and not enough progesterone to stabilize it.\n\nHowever, after bariatric surgery, women have been shown to have normalized hormone levels, a decrease in inflammation and insulin resistance, as well as an increase in overall health and physical activity. Not to mention that weight loss can reverse type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related diseases.\n\nA previous study found that weight loss can cut down on the risk for other types of cancer as well.

An estimated 4,000 people, mostly men, suffer from hemophilia B in the United States, compared with 700 in Canada, and 28,000 worldwide.\n\nCanadian health officials have approved a Biogen Idec Inc. drug that controls and prevents bleeding in patients with hemophilia B, marking the first approval of a new hemophilia treatment in nearly two decades and the entry of the Cambridge biotech into a market beyond multiple sclerosis medicines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiogen Idec has also filed for approval of Alprolix with regulatory bodies in Australia and Japan.\n\nThe company has been testing a similar treatment for the more common hemophilia A, which affects about 142,000 people globally. It anticipates regulatory decisions on that drug in midyear.\n\n“This is a new class of therapy that can decrease the burden of treatment,” said Glenn Pierce, senior vice president of hematology, cell, and gene therapies at Biogen Idec. “We are the first to bring this class to market, and it’s tremendously exciting. It helps patients lead more normal lives. It’s a major landmark in the treatment of hemophilia.”\n\nHemophilia B is a rare inherited disorder that impairs normal blood clotting in patients, leading to recurrent and extended bleeding that can cause pain and joint damage.\n\nBiogen Idec, the largest Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, said it received approval in Canada to market Alprolix to adults and children over 12 years old. The drug will be given through infusions once a week or once every two weeks. Currently, patients with the bleeding disorder must take drugs that have to be injected two or three times weekly.\n\nScientists discovered in the 1960s that people with hemophilia had deficiencies in certain proteins that are responsible for normal blood clotting. Without those proteins, it takes longer for blood vessels to repair themselves, presenting a risk of bleeding and accumulation of blood in joints.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly treatments involved taking proteins from the plasma of blood donors, but that proved dangerous at a time when the blood supply could be contaminated by the HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses. In the 1990s, researchers moved to create synthetic protein using recombinant DNA technology that identified and cloned genes responsible for encoding the proteins. Genetics Institute Inc., a Cambridge biotech research firm, won approval in 1997 for a drug based on that technology. It is now owned by US drug giant Pfizer Inc.\n\nBiogen Idec’s new treatments for hemophilia A and B use a “fusing” technology to prolong the effect of the proteins introduced into patients’ blood, and were discovered in academic labs at Harvard University and Brandeis University. The treatments were in preclinical development at Syntonix Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Waltham company Biogen Idec bought in 2007.\n\nSince then, Biogen Idec has been shepherding them through clinical trials in preparation for seeking regulatory approval.\n\nThe Cambridge company is the top seller of drugs to treat the neurodegenerative disease multiple sclerosis. It also receives revenue from sales of the cancer drug Rituxan, which it formerly comarketed with Swiss drug maker Roche AG.

Alprolix is the first approved long-acting hemophilia B therapy and is indicated to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes with prophylactic (protective) infusions starting at once weekly or once every 10 to 14 days.\n\nThis is the first regulatory approval worldwide for Alprolix, which is currently under review by regulatory authorities in several other countries, including the United States, Australia and Japan.\n\n“Health Canada’s approval of Alprolix marks the first significant treatment advance in hemophilia B in 17 years, and reinforces our commitment to developing innovative therapies that help address the critical needs of the hemophilia community,” said George Scangos, chief executive officer of Biogen Idec. “We believe that the safety, efficacy and prophylactic dosing schedule demonstrated with Alprolix will provide people with hemophilia B a meaningful new way to manage their condition.”\n\nThe World Federation of Hemophilia recommends a prophylactic (prevention of bleeding) regimen as the goal of treatment for people with severe hemophilia. Guidelines established by the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council of the National Hemophilia Foundation recommend prophylactic infusions two or more times a week with traditional hemophilia treatments. Frequent prophylactic infusions can be a burden to people with hemophilia and may reduce adoption to this type of treatment regimen.\n\nThe Health Canada approval of Alprolix is based on results from the global, Phase 3 B-LONG study, the largest registrational study in hemophilia B ever completed. It demonstrated that Alprolix safely and effectively prevented, or reduced, bleeding episodes with prophylactic infusions given once weekly or once every 10 to 14 days in adults and adolescents with severe hemophilia B. In addition, more than 90% of all bleeding episodes were controlled by a single Alprolix infusion.\n\n“Health Canada’s approval of Alprolix provides people with hemophilia B an important new option in maintaining a prophylactic regimen,” said Manuel Carcao, pediatric hematologist and co-director of the Comprehensive Care Hemophilia Program at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. “Alprolix, the first approved long-acting factor concentrate, has been shown to help individuals with hemophilia B achieve effective bleed prevention with prophylactic dosing once a week or once every 10 to 14 days.”\n\nHemophilia B is a rare, chronic, inherited disorder in which the ability of a person’s blood to clot is impaired, which can lead to recurrent and extended bleeding episodes. It is due to a substantial reduction of, or no factor IX activity, which is needed for normal blood clotting. People with hemophilia B experience bleeding episodes that can cause pain, irreversible joint damage and hemorrhage.

The drug was developed in collaboration with Merck & Co. (NYSE: MRK).\n\nToday, Merck announced the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion of vintafolide, along with its companion imaging agent, etarfolatide. The drugs were part of a group CHMP voted to approve during a March 17-20 meeting.\n\nNow that the CHMP has green-lighted vintafolide, the European Commission (EC) will issue a legally binding decision within about three months. If the EC approves, vintafolide will be granted a centralized marketing authorization that\'s valid in the 28 members of the EU.\n\nWhat\'s more, today Endocyte announced study results from its phase 2b target trial, which showed that risk of disease worsening or death was reduced by 25% for lung cancer patients treated with a combination of vintafolide and the chemotherapy drug docetaxel.\n\nHere\'s why vintafolide is going to be a huge win for ECYT and its investors.\n\nEndocyte\'s (Nasdaq: ECYT) Drug Is a Big Win\n\nVintafolide treats various cancers by targeting the folate receptor – a protein that is commonly expressed on the surface of many human cancers, like ovarian cancer.\n\nFolate is a B vitamin essential to cell growth and division, and characteristically rapidly dividing cancer cells often express highly elevated levels of folate receptors so they can capture enough folate to support their rapid growth.\n\nVintafolide acts by binding a small molecule to the folate receptor – it ""tricks"" the receptor into thinking it\'s the folate (or folic acid derivatives) it seeks to bind with to support cell growth and division.\n\nBut when vintafolide is accepted by the folate receptor, it releases a potent chemotherapy drug called vinblastine, which instead kills the cell.\n\nUsing a small molecule that\'s linked to a potent drug creates a ""small-molecule drug conjugate,"" and, with vintafolide, Endocyte succeeded in innovating the first-ever technology platform for creating them.\n\nMeanwhile, the companion imaging agent etarfolide is able to identify patients who are positive for the folate receptor and are therefore more likely to respond to treatment with vintafolide.\n\n""This is our second randomized study in a very challenging indication, where vintafolide has met the primary endpoint when used in patients selected with the companion imaging agent etarfolatide,"" Endocyte vice president of medical affairs Binh Nguyen, MD, PhD, said today regarding the positive phase 2b study results. ""These results provide further validation of our targeted approach to treatment using companion imaging and our SMDC technology.""\n\nThe trial tested the vintafolide/docetaxel combination across 199 patients who had experienced treatment failure with one prior chemotherapy regimen.\n\nECYT said there were no drug-related deaths in the group of patients taking a combination of the drug. The combination produced a 25% reduction in the disease worsening or causing death, compared with patients who only took the approved, available treatment.\n\nEndocyte has been working with Merck to bring vintafolide to the market.

Actually first it's a -- stock and today. We're looking at and outside the small drug maker had a very big -- doubling.

I believe it's called it the full allied I'd never heard -- before today probably most of us hadn't either because it's not on the market currently its experimental drug. Did a very positive phase two trial here in the United States as a treatment for lung cancer. And meanwhile over in Europe Europe's equivalent of the FDA. Recommended conditional approval of the drug as a treatment for ovarian cancer so one drug as a potential treatment for Q very serious cancers. And you can see. The reaction in the stock market the stock almost -- today it was a huge upside ya wanna -- the stock price over the past two days just got to put it side by side comparison to this when we can pull it up. We have a chart up there. -- explosive right he has that's a that's a pretty amazing that restoration and just 24 hours. It again this is all a matter of to the potential for FDA approval right. Yeah there -- still a long way from getting FDA approval as this is -- for lung cancer. Begin it was a feast -- trial it was a large trial meaning there -- -- you know there's big number of patients in the trial. And the results were very positive. This is the track you need to be on to ultimately get FDA approval there's no guarantee they will get -- -- that's a risk if you're investor but. This was very very positive news and then again over in Europe. There are saying we think this probably should get approved an achievement for ovarian cancer so one drug treats you cancer you can imagine. The potential market for this if it. Does prove successful in subsequent trial and -- -- keep in Iowa so we did some research on this and it's been a bit of a roller coaster after the company and that's. Signature drive five months -- -- shares fell. Because it -- into work any better lung cancer patients than one drug that was already in use so. If that's the case but now you've got conflicting reports kind of coming back and forth into the count those kinds of results. Com investors sort of put aside those reports that happened five months ago has focused on -- -- now. 00 -- they put that aside he said well forget that's old news. We've got this new trial I mean and and this is you know again typical scenario for an experimental drug you do multiple trials and you hope that each trial. The test results get better and better and better and ultimately in the FDA gives you approval so the fact they had that that child five months ago obviously was a negative for the stock but. They're not done at that point they -- they come back -- -- the drug they -- a different type of trial perhaps on a different. For type of lung cancer itself. And this specific trial was very non small cell and I'm not the doctors -- -- and pretend to be type of lung cancer but. Again the results were. Unambiguously positive. And so that was already gonna give the stock a rocket -- this morning and then again the EU saying for ovarian cancer we -- what we've seen with this drug so it it. It with a -- that this could be a platform. Drug meaning a drug that can treat multiple kinds of diseases and the the markets for those in the potential revenue for those are human. Yes well so if you had and aside before today you're fit -- you know obviously feeling pretty good about how things have been performing for your portfolio. But when these kinds of reports -- -- I mean how quickly if I want to get in on it too if I want to get. It on it now. Clearly I can't speak today -- Friday. It's right I think you are we what are what are typically historically and again I -- this is not getting an abacus -- -- -- -- and -- and outside or to sell it now it at that. But historically speaking that when we how these kinds of reports coming out what is the -- opportunity typically. For big pharma companies -- small groups walk up. You know these these smaller buyouts. Companies -- it's really kind of a lottery ticket right I mean this could be the peak rate friend aside big the next Trout can be really bad in the FDA could. Deny them for whatever reason and then the stocks gonna collapse. But if this drug proves to be. At as valuable as the investors today are suggesting it could be then this is just the beginning and that's really that's why there's so much excitement around by attack. -- part because then the medicines that they're creating are are so much better than they with the UC -- to create. And because if you get it right eight. These the other stock could just be getting started -- -- look at you know over the past it like Genentech -- Biogen. They started out like and -- site as well small experimental drug companies that became huge multi billion dollar companies. Because they have one or -- drugs that were able to be successful. So.

The stock briefly gained ground, peaking at $33.70 a share, its highest value since the stock’s IPO in 2011, before pulling back sharply. However, the retreat only took shares as low as $25.88 around 10:30 am EST, and by 11 am the stock was still trading at almost double its prior-day close.\n\nThe gains came on heavy volume, with nearly 10 million shares moving before 11 am EST. Average daily volume for Endocyte’s stock prior to March 21 was just over 700,000. What’s more, with just 36.18 million shares in its float, Endocyte saw almost one third of its total stock change hands in the first hour and a half of trading.\n\nThe news driving these gains, though, was firmly positive. In a phase 2b trial for vintafolide involving 199 patients suffering from lung cancer, Endocyte reported a 25-percent reduction in disease progression and death for those patients taking the drug.\n\n""We are pleased with the results of this study, as the vintafolide/docetaxel combination showed meaningful activity in patients with recurrent NSCLC, meeting the primary endpoint of the trial,"" said Endocyte’s VP of medical affairs Binh Nguyen, M.D., Ph.D. ""This is our second randomized study in a very challenging indication, where vintafolide has met the primary endpoint when used in patients selected with the companion imaging agent etarfolatide. These results provide further validation of our targeted approach to treatment using companion imaging and our SMDC technology. … We look forward to reviewing additional analysis of this study when the OS data has matured later this year to help inform potential further development of the vintafolide/docetaxel combination in NSCLC.""\n\nVintafolide is an oncology drug that attempts to fight cancerous growth by attacking folate receptors. From the company’s website:\n\n“Vintafolide (EC145) delivers a potent vinca alkaloid chemotherapy directly to cancer cells by targeting the folate receptor expressed on cancer cells, but not on most normal cells. Approximately 80–90% of ovarian and lung cancers express the receptor, as do many other types of cancer. Folate receptor status is determined by an etarfolatide (99mTc-EC20) scan.”\n\nThe drug received an orphan drug status for treating ovarian cancer in Europe in April of 2012 and is being developed as part of a partnership with Merck (MRK) .\n\nAs is often the case with biotech stocks that return positive clinical data, Endocyte quickly rendered most technical and fundamental analysis obsolete. Endocyte has produced revenue beginning in 2011 and rising steadily since then, but remains unprofitable.\n\nA look at Endocyte’s stock chart reveals that it was trading up channel since the start of the year with its 50-day SMA acting as a support level.

Inc. would begin selling the drug and its companion imaging agent later this year.\n\nThe drug, which will be sold by Merck, has received the brand name of Vynfinit while the imaging agent will have the brand Folcepri, and will be sold by Endocyte.\n\nAlso, West Lafayette-based Endocyte announced that vintafolide proved effective at treating non-small cell lung cancer in a Phase 2 trial.

And adding to the big day for both, Merck ($MRK) turned in positive Phase IIb lung cancer data for a drug that earned a blockbuster development deal back in 2012.\n\nThe CHMP decision is likely to trigger a fresh round of crowing and cackling among the bulls and bears in the market, who have made these two catalysts a flash point on the company\'s ($ECYT) progress as well as its future prospects with the drug. But Endocyte came out well ahead today, watching its stock price soar more than 175% on the EMA decision and trial results. And the advances are a big plus for Merck, which has identified vintafolide as one of its top cancer prospects in the pipeline as new R&D chief Roger Perlmutter works on a turnaround.\n\n""These positive CHMP opinions bring Merck and Endocyte one step closer to providing a personalized approach to address a significant unmet medical need in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,"" said Dr. Eric Rubin, vice president of clinical development for oncology at Merck Research Laboratories, in a statement.\n\nBinh Nguyen, vice president of medical affairs at Endocyte\n\nThere were no data in the non-small cell lung cancer trial announcement, but Merck says the drug hit the primary endpoint in the lung cancer study while demonstrating a ""trend"" toward a secondary endpoint on overall survival. The trial hasn\'t reached the point where the company can determine the final median OS rate.\n\nThere were originally three arms in the study: vintafolide alone, vintafolide in combination with docetaxel and docetaxel alone. Last October an independent review board told investigators to give up on the vintafolide-alone arm, which was seized by the bear crowd as a sign that the drug isn\'t all that powerful. That argument will be tested now with the actual results.\n\n""We are pleased with the results of this study, as the vintafolide/docetaxel combination showed meaningful activity in patients with recurrent NSCLC, meeting the primary endpoint of the trial,"" said Dr. Binh Nguyen, vice president of medical affairs at Endocyte, in a statement.

We look forward to reviewing additional analysis of this study when the OS data has matured later this year to help inform potential further development of the vintafolide/docetaxel combination in NSCLC.""\n\nMerck demonstrated an eager affinity for this drug in the spring of 2012 when the pharma giant signed up for a $1 billion partnership--$120 million upfront--for the drug. Merck, at a time Peter Kim was running the R&D shop, grabbed worldwide commercialization rights and agreed to share the U.S. rights with West Lafayette, IN-based Endocyte.\n\nVintafolide is a conjugated cancer therapy that matches folate to a potent chemotherapy. A variety of cancer cells bristle with folate receptors, allowing the drug to dock on the cancer cell and deliver its toxic payload of vinblastine. And the biotech has developed a diagnostic test that can be used to identify the patients most likely to benefit.\n\nEndocyte reported that in a Phase II study for ovarian cancer their drug plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) posted a median progression-free survival score of 5 months versus 2.7 months in the arm taking PLD alone. And a group of patients with 100% folate-receptor positive ovarian cancer had a PFS rate of 5.5 months versus 1.5 months for the PLD group. That was all statistically significant and something the company felt warranted conditional approval in Europe.\n\nBut Endocyte has been at the center of a bull/bear debate for some time now. The bulls have been running with company executives on this one while the bears have been pooh-poohing PFS rates when overall survival is what counts. And there were signs in the Phase II, outlined in a recent ""bear thesis"" on TheStreet, that the vintafolide arm trended to a higher risk of dying.\n\nThat debate is a long way from being finally settled one way or the other.

The conclusion was startling: smokers who used e-cigarettes weren’t more successful than those who smoke tobacco cigarettes in quitting smoking.\n\nAlmost 14% of the people who participated in the study did manage to quit smoking, but very few of those who did succeeded thanks to the e-cigarettes.\n\nAre you a smoker?

But a new study suggests that as a tool to help smokers quit, they may not be very effective.\n\nThe study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco was a small one, looking at 949 smokers, including 88 smokers who reported they also had used e-cigarettes in the last month.\n\nMost of the smokers said they wanted to quit one day, either in the next six months or later. Those who used e-cigarettes were more likely to say they planned to quit, with only 5 per cent of e-cig users saying they didn\'t expect to ever quit, compared to 13 per cent of those who didn\'t use e-cigs.\n\nBut when researchers asked the participants one year later whether they had successfully kicked smoking, the quit rates between the smokers and the e-cigarette users were not that different. After one year, 10.2 per cent of the e-cig smokers – eight smokers -- said they had quit smoking, compared to 13.8 per cent of the regular cigarette smokers.\n\n“You’ll hear lots of stories from people that say that e-cigarettes help them quit, but what we found was when we actually studied that systematically, we didn’t see a significant effect on cessation,” study co-author Dr. Pamela Ling told CTV News.\n\nThe study also found that women were more likely than men to use e-cigarettes. Younger adults under the age of 30, and people with less education were also more likely to use e-cigarettes.\n\nThe authors acknowledge that with only 88 e-cigarette users in the study, their study was small. But they say their data add to the debate and back up previous studies that e-cigarettes don\'t help smokers quit.\n\n""I feel having some data is better than no data. And many of the claims about e-cigarettes are based on no data,"" said Ling.\n\nThe authors add that there should be regulations to ban e-cigarette makers from claiming or suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective smoking cessation devices.\n\nElectronic cigarettes have become hugely popular in recent years, with surveys showing the number of people using the devices has skyrocketed in the last few years.\n\nMany enthusiasts say they like ""vaping"" on e-cigarettes, because it allows them to mimic the act of smoking in places where smoking isn\'t allowed, and they enjoy inhaling the flavoured ""juice"" inside the devices and exhaling the vapour.\n\nBut public health officials have been less convinced about e-cigs, with many noting there have been few good studies on the safety of the devices, nor on whether they really help smokers to quit.\n\nIn Canada, it\'s illegal to sell e-cigarettes with flavour cartridges – or ""juice"" – that contains nicotine unless a manufacturer applies to Health Canada for authorization. The federal agency says it has not approved any e-cigarettes, but nevertheless, it\'s not hard to find e-cigarette retailers in Canada selling nicotine-laced ""juice.""\n\nMelodie Tilson, the director of policy for the Non-Smokers\' Rights Association worries that e-cigarettes are readily available everywhere, which could entice a new generation of smokers, particularly since it\'s not hard to get one\'s hands nicotine ""juice.""\n\nShe says her group believes that e-cigarettes are vastly less harmful than cigarettes and have ""great potential"" to help smokers quit because “there’s no combustion, there’s no tobacco. But at the same time, we don’t know that they’re absolutely safe to use.”\n\nTilson says she wants to see more studies conducted on the safety and effectiveness of e-cigarettes as smoking cessation aids.\n\n“We want to base policy on much more rigorous studies…and other studies do show that e-cigarettes do help people quit, including one showing that e-cigarettes are at least as effective as nicotine patches,” she says.\n\nWith a report from CTV medical specialist Avis Favaro and producer Elizabeth St. Philip', ""But a new study suggests that as a tool to help smokers quit, they may not be very effective.\nBut when researchers asked the participants one year later whether they had successfully kicked smoking, the quit rates between the smokers and the e-cigarette users were not that different.\nAfter one year, 10.2 per cent of the e-cig smokers – eight smokers -- said they had quit smoking, compared to 13.8 per cent of the regular cigarette smokers.\nThe authors acknowledge that with only 88 e-cigarette users in the study, their study was small.\nBut they say their data add to the debate and back up previous studies that e-cigarettes don't help smokers quit.""]"

There is widespread agreement that inhaling from an e-cigarette, where a heating element vapourizes a liquid containing nicotine, is not as harmful as smoking a conventional cigarette, and proponents say that the products could save millions of lives. But some researchers and tobacco-control activists fear that the devices could make tobacco use seem socially acceptable again and may not assist people in actually reducing their addiction.\n\nPamela Ling, a tobacco researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues followed 949 people who detailed their smoking habits though an online survey, and found that 88 of those who had used e-cigarettes were no more likely to have quit or reduced their smoking after a year than other smokers. “We found that there was no difference in the rate of quitting between smokers who used an e-cigarette and those who did not”, even after controlling for factors such as the user\'s dependence on tobacco, Ling told Nature in an e-mail.\n\nShe added: “Advertising suggesting that e-cigarettes are effective for smoking cessation should be prohibited until such claims are supported by scientific evidence.” Her team reports the results today in JAMA Internal Medicine1.\n\nSmokers\' saviour?\n\nPeter Hajek, director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at the Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, says that many researchers think e-cigarettes represent “the best hope so far to put a stop to smoking-related death and disease by replacing deadly cigarettes with a safer alternative”.\n\nHajek says that the new paper shows only that e-cigarettes appeal to smokers who are heavily dependent on tobacco. The same results would be obtained if the survey looked at smokers who try nicotine-replacement treatments, he says, and the results have no bearing at all on whether e-cigarettes are or are not an effective method of smoking cessation. The conclusions the authors of the paper draw are “just not related in any way to the study finding"", says Hajek.\n\nThe regulation of e-cigarettes is a hugely debated area. Some scientists want the products regulated as medical devices, which would mean that they would be subject to tough quality controls and limits on advertising, and that their manufacturers would have to supply evidence to back up claims made for their products, such as the ability to aid smoking cessation. Both the United States and the United Kingdom are currently considering such regulation.\n\nBut other scientists say that such heavy regulation could kill the nascent industry, or leave it in the hands of the big tobacco companies, which have the deep pockets necessary to comply with such regulations.\n\nVaughan Rees, deputy director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, says that many existing e-cigarettes do not deliver enough nicotine to support total switching from conventional cigarettes. He adds that the study “provides an important addition to the growing body of research suggesting that e-cigarettes are not particularly good at promoting quitting”.\n\n“The public should be educated about the limits of e-cigarettes to support cessation,” he said in an e-mail.\n\n', 'Ina Fassbender/Reuters/CorbisThe controversy over electronic cigarettes has been reignited today with the publication of a study claiming that they do not help smokers to quit their habit.\nHajek says that the new paper shows only that e-cigarettes appeal to smokers who are heavily dependent on tobacco.\nThe conclusions the authors of the paper draw are “just not related in any way to the study finding"", says Hajek.\nHe adds that the study “provides an important addition to the growing body of research suggesting that e-cigarettes are not particularly good at promoting quitting”.\n“The public should be educated about the limits of e-cigarettes to support cessation,” he said in an e-mail.']"

Hence, as a tool, it was not very effective.\n\nE-cigarettes are metallic tubes which enable the conversion of liquid nicotine to a flavored inhalable vapor without the use of combustion. Their claim of getting a smoker to quit has made them popular. Many users like the fact that there is no smoke and thus it can be used in designated non-smoking areas. However, public health officials have been doubtful of the e-cigarette’s claims.\n\nThe small study focused on a group of 949 regular smokers, which consisted of 88 people who used e-cigarettes. For the baseline survey, they were asked if they had used e-cigarettes in the past month, and how many cigarettes they consumed in a day. Most of the 949 said that they were aiming to quit in the next six months, or after that. However, those using e-cigarettes were more vocal about their quitting plans.\n\nWhen participants were studied the next year, and asked if they had quit, the rates of kicking the habit were not very different. While 10.2 per cent of the e-cigarette smokers said they had quit smoking, 13.8 per cent of the regular cigarette smokers did. The researchers thus found that e-cigarette smokers were not any less likely to quit the habit one year later than people who resorted to regular cigarettes.\n\nThough the researchers do acknowledge that the study was small, it did add to the previous research on the ineffectiveness of e-cigarettes as quitting devices. Besides, many of the claims made by e-cigarettes were based on negligible data.\n\nThe researchers suggested that there should be regulations that prevented e-cigarette companies from claiming the same. This was because e-cigarettes were unregulated, and its consumers are unaware of how much nicotine goes into their bodies for lack of scientific evidence.\n\nThe study also found that women were more likely to use electronic cigarettes as compared to men. They were also mostly used by people under the age of 30. Its ready availability could lead to the formation of a new younger class of smokers.\n\nThe study overlooked the reason why the 88 smokers used e-cigarettes, and did not ask them how long they used them for. The problems in the study were also clear to its authors, who also spoke about the limitations.', 'The small study focused on a group of 949 regular smokers, which consisted of 88 people who used e-cigarettes.\nFor the baseline survey, they were asked if they had used e-cigarettes in the past month, and how many cigarettes they consumed in a day.\nHowever, those using e-cigarettes were more vocal about their quitting plans.\nWhile 10.2 per cent of the e-cigarette smokers said they had quit smoking, 13.8 per cent of the regular cigarette smokers did.\nThe study overlooked the reason why the 88 smokers used e-cigarettes, and did not ask them how long they used them for.']"

The ban includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco and pipes.\n\nThe decision comes based on the results of a 2011 survey that indicates the majority of students would prefer not to allow smoking on the school’s St. Paul campus.\n\nThe survey showed that 26 percent of Metro State students use tobacco, with 12 percent using on a daily basis.\n\nNicholas Theiss, spokesman for the school’s St. Paul campus, said that for the first year of the ban, the enforcement will be passive. This will mean there will be no immediate punishment for someone caught smoking.\n\nRather, signage put up around the campus will state that smoking isn’t allowed. Staff and students will also be able to get “nonfrontational communication cards,” Theiss said, and hand them to people seen smoking on campus. The cards inform smokers that they’re not allowed to smoke on-campus.\n\nIn May of 2015, the school will re-evaluate the passive enforcement method, and possibly add more punitive measures.\n\nTheiss explained that this message matches up with the school’s “family-oriented campus,” and matches with what the majority of faculty and staff have said.\n\n“A lot of students wouldn’t be bothered if Metro State went smoke free,” he said.\n\nThe move to ban smoking comes two years after Metro State implemented designated smoking areas around the grounds.\n\nBut those designated areas were not effective -- students at night classes can often smoke near the entrances to buildings, Theiss said.\n\nDespite the ban, Thiess said the university isn’t necessarily expecting to influence smokers’ habits overall.\n\n“We’re not telling anyone whether or not they can smoke, we just don’t want it to happen on our campus,” he said.\n\nThe university is partnering with the Association for Nonsmokers - Minnesota to communicate the new policy to students and staff, and also to offer resources for smokers who want to quit.\n\nThe policy prohibits using any smoking and tobacco products, including cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco and pipes.\n\nExceptions to the ban will be made for tobacco use in traditional Native American ceremonies, scientific studies and theatrical productions.\n\nContact Patrick Larkin at 651-748-7816 or at eastside@lillienews.com.

You’ve got to pass a law here regulating [e-cigarettes] as medical devices,” he told The Irish Times .\n\nBecause of the smoking ban, the State had the “moral virtue” and the “leadership” to do this, he said.\n\n\n\n‘Dropped the ball’\n\nThe EU “dropped the ball” on e-cigarettes, he said. Last year MEPs rejected a proposal to classify e-cigarettes as medicinal products.\n\nTrends in Ireland show that children born today will be in a smoke-free State by the time they turn 18 in 2032, he said.\n\nHowever, he fears this progress could be threatened if e-cigarettes discourage people from quitting by promoting dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes. If this is the case “we’re going to see the progress in Ireland stalled and possibly gone,” he added.\n\nE-cigarettes can help to “retain addiction” through dual use and the problem is not about how many cigarettes people smoke, but for how many years. “If I smoke 20 cigarettes a day and quit at 35, I’m going to be as healthy as a horse and may have no disease. If I cut down to 10 cigarettes [with the use of e-cigarettes] and continue smoking, it’s no different than if I was smoking 20,” he said. If unregulated, e-cigarettes could recruit a new generation of cigarette smokers for the industry. A recent Utah study showed that 9 per cent of children in the 12th grade (about 17 years old) were smoking e-cigarettes and 3 per cent cigarettes and they were “transferring over” to cigarettes, he said.\n\n\n\nIndependent research\n\nProf Connolly has concerns about allowing the tobacco industry to design and market e-cigarettes. He wants to see independent research done on e-cigarettes and the industry to do “human trials” before they “start doing experiments on whole countries”, he said.\n\nThere also needs to be more approval of the chemicals used in the products and more knowledge about what they do to people’s brains, he added.\n\nYesterday Minister for Health James Reilly said he would like to see e-cigarettes being brought in on the basis of “purely medicinal advice”.\n\nThe Government would “certainly” ban them for under-18s. However, he said they had a role in “helping people to quit” smoking.\n\nDr Reilly also said that legislation to ban smoking in cars where children are present will be ready in the “next number of weeks”.', 'However, if regulated, e-cigarettes could offer a “miracle” for getting people to quit smoking.\nBecause of the smoking ban, the State had the “moral virtue” and the “leadership” to do this, he said.\nHowever, he fears this progress could be threatened if e-cigarettes discourage people from quitting by promoting dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes.\nIndependent researchProf Connolly has concerns about allowing the tobacco industry to design and market e-cigarettes.\nHowever, he said they had a role in “helping people to quit” smoking.']"

So a study like this one from the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education is bound to draw attention.\n\nThe science on e-cigarettes is still young, adding to the confusion around the burgeoning $1.5 billion industry that the FDA will soon regulate. Absent federal oversight so far, some states and cities have enacted their own bans on the products, which deliver nicotine through a vaporized liquid instead of burning tobacco.\n\nResearchers writing in JAMA Internal Medicine found that use of e-cigarettes was not associated with “greater rates of quitting cigarettes or reduced cigarette consumption” after one year. The authors reached the conclusion based on self-reported data from 949 smokers, which included 88 who used e-cigarettes.\n\nStill, they’re the first to admit that their findings should be viewed with some caution. The study’s small sample size could have hurt their ability to draw a relationship between e-cigarettes and quitting smoking, they wrote. They also didn’t collect information on characteristics of use, such as motivation and frequency.\n\n“Nonetheless, our data add to the current evidence that e-cigarettes may not increase rates of smoking cessation,” wrote authors Rachel Grana, Lucy Popova and Pamela Ling.\n\nMitchell Katz, editor of the research journal, acknowledges that the evidence on whether e-cigarettes help to stop smoking is “contradictory and inconclusive.” Still, he argues, there’s not enough evidence to claim that e-cigarettes do help people to quit.\n\n“I agree with Grana and colleagues that sellers of e-cigarettes should not be able to advertise them as smoking cessation devices without sufficient evidence that they are effective for this indication,” Katz wrote.\n\nTom Glynn of the American Cancer Society, whose advocacy arm has lobbied for strict e-cigarette regulation, said he’s worried about the strong conclusion drawn by the study authors given the sample size and their own hedging.\n\n“This study has problems,” said Glynn, ACS director of Cancer Science and Trends. “What’s interesting is even the authors talk about the limitations.”\n\nThere hasn\'t been much previous research on this topic. A September study out of New Zealand found that e-cigarettes were ""modestly effective"" at helping people to quit smoking, about on par with nicotine patches.\n\nOther recent studies have been bearish on e-cigarettes’ potential as a smoking cessation tool. A study published earlier this month in JAMA Pediatrics found that middle and high school students who smoked e-cigarettes were also more likely to smoke cigarettes. But experts were also split on the meaning of those findings, the New York Times reported.\n\nUltimately, the FDA is expected to soon issue regulations on how the products may be marketed and sold.

Researchers followed nearly 1,000 smokers for a year and found that those who used e-cigarettes were no more likely to quit smoking or reduce their dependence on tobacco cigarettes compared to those who weren’t using the products at the beginning of the study. But the research, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine also raises more questions than answers since only 88 of the 949 smokers in the study reported using e-cigarettes.\n\nElectronic cigarettes are certainly trendy — look no further than the Vapefest taking place in the nation’s capital this week — but whether inhaling nicotine vapors actually helps smokers quit traditional cigarettes remains a subject of fierce debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat small sample size makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions, admits study leader Dr. Pamela Ling, an associate professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco. “We also looked at a broad population of smokers,” she said, “not just those who were specifically interested in quitting.”\n\nSetting those limitations aside, the study highlights the lack of evidence to determine whether e-cigarettes are a good smoking cessation aid — even though some smokers swear by them for helping them ease off their habit.\n\nOnly one clinical trial compared e-cigarettes with nicotine patches to help smokers quit, Ling said, and it found that both were about equally effective — or rather, equally ineffective since neither worked particularly well. Only 5 to 7 percent of the smokers in the study were able to completely stop lighting up regardless of which method they used.\n\n“Although there are no data showing that e-cigarette use helps with cessation, there is potential harm,” wrote Dr. Mitchell Katz, the deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine in an editorial that accompanied the new study.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe products — which contain nicotine in liquid form mixed with flavorings, colorings, and various chemicals — remain unregulated, though the US Food and Drug Administration might move this year to put them under the same rules as other tobacco products.\n\nEven more concerning are recent modifications that have turned once disposable e-cigarettes into larger, reusable gadgets that users fill with highly potent liquid nicotine. Such handling can be very hazardous since liquid nicotine can be toxic if applied to the skin or ingested, according to a Sunday article in the New York Times.\n\nLast year, the number of accidental poisonings linked to e-liquids increased to 1,351, a 300 percent increase from 2012; the latest 2014 data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers provided to The New York Times suggests that the number could reach 2,700 this year.\n\nWhether vaping itself poses health risks remains unknown, though that hasn’t stopped e-cigarette makers from proclaiming that the product provides the “freedom to have a cigarette without the guilt,” as actress Jenny McCarthy states on the blu eCigs website.\n\nIn a study published earlier this month, Ling and her colleagues reviewed 59 websites selling e-cigarette products and found that 95 percent of them made health-related claims: more than half claimed the product helped with smoking cessation, and three-quarters claimed the product does not produce secondhand smoke. (It does, though, produce vapor that others can inhale and which may pose health risks to bystanders.)\n\nSome manufacturers claimed on websites that their products were toxin free and didn’t contain the kinds of cancer-causing chemicals found in tar-ridden cigarettes. That’s something that requires more study to determine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Right now, we have an unusual situation with a product allowed on the market that’s making health and smoking cessation claims,” Ling said, “and manufacturers shouldn’t be allowed to make those claims without the science to support them.”\n\nDeborah Kotz can be reached at dkotz@globe.com.

40878,http://www.thedrum.com/news/2014/03/21/electronic-cigarettes-returning-cigarette-advertising-tv-screens,health,"['It’s almost 50 years since cigarette advertising was banned from British TV, and two decades since loose tobacco and cigar ads faced a similar fate. Last month however British American Tobacco returned to our screens as we start to see the world’s biggest tobacco firms pour millions of pounds into electronic cigarette advertising. Rory Sutherland, vice chairman, Ogilvy & Mather UK discusses.\n\nE-cigarettes are a disruptive innovation. Like many disruptive innovations, they emerge unexpectedly from the bottom up, not from the top down – and are pioneered not by large companies but by small start-ups. As such they are always rather annoying to a number of vested interests and large organisations.\n\nYou might assume I am referring to the tobacco industry here, and in part I am. But this natural resistance also extends to other interest groups – pharmaceutical companies who are heavily invested in patches and gums, and even anti-smoking groups who have made an enormous emotional investment in other solutions to the problem, and who may resent the idea that their problem is being solved in other ways by someone else entirely. Purists may also be naturally hostile to the idea of harm-reduction as opposed to outright abstinence.\n\nBut e-cigs are important in that they seem to satisfy cravings in a way that other substitutes may not. Addiction is highly complicated. Regular drinkers will become effectively drunk if they consume large quantities of tonic water from glasses of which the rims have been merely dipped in gin. A large part of addiction may lie not only in a chemical dependency but in the rituals and sensations attached to smoking – which e-cigs mimic in a way other replacement therapies don’t.\n\nThat’s why, for the moment, we should give this technology the benefit of the doubt.\n\nNone of this is to say that e-cigs are harmless. It is simply too early to say. There are almost certainly as-yet undiscovered risks attached to them. Some of the the appeal of e-cigarettes, let’s be candid, is that you can use them in places where you can’t smoke normal cigarettes (though this does not include aeroplanes, as I recently learned).\n\nBut some arguments are probably a bit desperate. I am instinctively suspicious of claims that they are ‘gateway drugs’ – that children will automatically progress from e-cigs to the real thing. First of all, appeals which rely on urges to ‘think of the children’ are quite often little more than emotional blackmail. Besides, the whole ‘gateway’ argument is a little fatuous: I am sure I could make the case that Lapsang Souchong is a gateway-drug to crack-cocaine if I chose my statistics selectively enough. And, to me, the magic of e-cigarettes is that, after using them for a while, the urge to use real cigarettes has disappeared almost completely – something I never thought would happen.\n\nLooking at it now, the e-cigarette market is at an interesting stage. It appears to be much like the car market in its early phases – an enormous number of players and a noisy plethora of competing brands.One effect of regulation may be to reduce this market to a much smaller number of competing brands – which ironically (through simpler choice) may have the effect of making the category more appealing to consumers, not less. (Good agencies might do well to try to spot the two or three contenders who stand to survive and flourish when the category is winnowed down).There is an interesting question marketers need to address in relation to the packaging and branding of e-cigarettes, as well as how they should be treated in advertising terms. This is an area I myself am conflicted about. If they’re not that harmful (and nicotine on its own probably isn’t), then marketing them as some form of entertainment is no worse than advertising coffee.My puritanical instincts would perhaps prefer that not to happen. Would I want to see a novelty brand with cartoon characters on the pack? No. However, regulators, at this early stage, should probably err on the side of slight indulgence: in any case human psychology is so perverse that overly harsh regulation may make the category cooler than it was before. (By contrast, I was intrigued to be told by my Dutch colleagues that no true Amsterdamer would dream of smoking dope in a coffee house, as decriminalisation has made these place unspeakably naff – fit only for German and English tourists).When the first e-cigarette TV ad aired, no-one was more surprised than me. Ogilvy had been approached by e-cigarette brands and led to expect that TV advertising would not be allowed. In its current form, I would argue that marketers need to figure out if the category needs advertising; I suspect it does, because marketing will have a crucial role in normalising the activity and making the category more credible. I also believe dedicated e-cigarette shops will help smokers with the face-to-face advice they need to make the switch. More controversially, I would favour an indulgent approach towards flavours – since if you get hooked on bubblegum-flavoured e-cigs, you’re less likely to relapse back to standard tobacco.Incidentally the benefits of nicotine need to be explored along with the costs: it is, after all, an appetite suppressant. There is a bit of a witch hunt against smokers which is as much motivated by snobbery and malice as altruism: there are plenty of other behaviours (drinking, gambling or talking about football) where the external harm is equally immense.', 'It’s almost 50 years since cigarette advertising was banned from British TV, and two decades since loose tobacco and cigar ads faced a similar fate.\nLast month however British American Tobacco returned to our screens as we start to see the world’s biggest tobacco firms pour millions of pounds into electronic cigarette advertising.\nAs such they are always rather annoying to a number of vested interests and large organisations.\nOgilvy had been approached by e-cigarette brands and led to expect that TV advertising would not be allowed.\nI also believe dedicated e-cigarette shops will help smokers with the face-to-face advice they need to make the switch.']"

40886,http://thehill.com/opinion/op-ed/201587-the-need-for-cancer-screening,health,"['My father, former Rep. Donald M. Payne (D-N.J.), like all too many Americans, didn’t realize the importance of screening for colorectal cancer until it was too late.\n\nBy the time he was screened, the cancer was so advanced that he died just a few weeks later. Had my father undergone a colonoscopy at an earlier age, I truly believe he would still be with us today. That’s why it has become my mission to raise awareness about these life-saving cancer screenings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMy father’s death was a wake-up call for me. I went in for my first screening at age 54 – four years after the recommended time to get a screening. At my initial examination, my gastroenterologist found and removed 13 polyps, and just a year later found and removed three more. They all turned out to be benign, but had I avoided the screening, the polyps could have turned cancerous, and I could have suffered the same fate as my father.\n\nThe good news, reported this month by the American Cancer Society, is that colorectal cancer diagnoses in the U.S. have dropped 30 percent in just the last decade for those aged 50 years and older. Much of this success is attributable to more people getting colonoscopy screenings within recommended age guidelines.\n\nThe sad news, though, is that this highly preventable disease is still the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women in the U.S., and according to the group, an estimated 50,000 people will die from this disease in 2014.\n\nBut there is hope. About half of these people could be saved by a timely colonoscopy. But when roughly 1 out of every 3 older Americans still is not up–to-date with this potentially life-saving procedure, we have a lot of work to do to raise awareness.\n\nBecause of my family history and previous examinations, I’ll be having regular colonoscopies until advised otherwise by my doctor. Testing is particularly important for African-American families because their rate is 20 percent above average. When people tell me they don’t want to undergo the procedure, I tell them, “Be a man. Get tested. You might just save your own life.” I push because no family should have to experience what we did.\n\nIt’s also why I am joining voices with Dr. Carla Ginsburg of Harvard Medical School, who serves on the leadership Cabinet of the American Gastroenterological Association. She has seen this needless suffering from the other side.\n\nFrom the physician’s perspective, what happened to the Payne family is all too common. About 1 out of every 4 people will have polyps by age 50. But because colorectal cancer may have vague or no signs or symptoms, many patients don’t think they need testing. Many may also think they cannot afford it, or put it off because they are fearful, squeamish or embarrassed by the nature of a colonoscopy. For all these reasons, only approximately 65 percent of older Americans have had timely screenings. We are working hard to make that at least 80 percent by 2018. We have also come together with the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy on an important initiative to highlight the value of colonoscopy and the gastroenterologists that perform this life-saving procedure.\n\nBut raising awareness is only part of the battle. Passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was a major victory in the fight against cancer. The law waives the co-insurance and deductible for many cancer-screening tests. For colonoscopies, however, if the screening leads to removal of a polyp, Medicare then automatically counts it as a therapeutic treatment for which patients then have to pay co-insurance.\n\nThis highly illogical loophole means that about half of the Medicare beneficiaries who choose to have a colonoscopy will pay for a screening that they thought was free. We applaud the Obama administration for issuing a correction to make sure that consumers who are commercially insured should not carry this financial burden. But now, is also the time for the administration to fix a loophole that exists by waiving co-insurance for Medicare patients who have a screening colonoscopy with polyp removal in the same encounter. Removing any financial barriers will not only save lives but also save huge amounts of money when compared to treating cancer.\n\nAs we enter the last week of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, we encourage each of you to get screened. Become part of that 80 percent and encourage your loved ones to become part of it as well.\n\nPayne has served New Jersey’s 10th Congressional District since 2012. He sits on the Homeland Security and the Small Business committees. Ginsburg, M.D., M.P.H., AGA fellow, is an assistant clinical professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a gastroenterologist in private practice at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass.', 'My father, former Rep.

You don’t need to get messy or anything. If you have a dog or a cat you’ve probably done far worse than you’re going to do here.\n\nThey’ve made it foolproof.

That really registered with me and I’ve taken great pains to try to pay that back whenever I can. I was very eager to jump on board. If this saves one individual of going through the eight months I went through with chemo and radiation, my work is done.\n\nDo you feel a responsibility as someone in the public eye to talk about this subject?\n\nIt’s something we can do because of whatever celebrity we have, so why not? Colorectal cancer is not a pretty cancer, it doesn’t have a lot of cachet to it, but if we can laugh at it … why not go ahead and embrace that? If you an laugh at it — I refer to it as “bum cancer” — and a big part of my healing was taking cancer’s power away. I’m sure that had a hand in me getting better.\n\nHow are you now?\n\nI’m great.

If the test results in the biopsy or removal of a growth, it is no longer a “screening” test and patients can be charged co-insurance and/or a co-pay.\n\nThe Maine Colorectal Cancer Control Program provides no-cost screening services for residents who do not have health insurance and connects them with the resources they need to prevent, detect, and survive colon cancer. Eligibility guidelines include age, income, insurance status, and health history. If you think you, a family member or friend might be eligible to receive services through this program, call the Colon Screening Hotline at 1-877-320-6800.\n\nDebbie’s story\n\nThat afternoon I got an email from a woman who ended up paying around $2000 for a colonoscopy she thought was a preventive test. Her insurance company said it wasn’t and that she would be responsible for out-of-pocket costs. She thought it was important for people to hear what happened to her so they wouldn’t find out the hard way, like she did.\n\nDebbie has ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects as many as 700,000 people in the United States. Because ulcerative colitis increases the risk of developing colon cancer, Debbie has to have a colonoscopy every two years. She’s covered by her husband’s health insurance and says that when she first started having colonoscopies, she never saw a bill.\n\nThat changed in 2010 when her husband got a new job and new health insurance. Debbie turned 50 that year — it’s recommended that people get their first colonoscopy at age 50 and Debbie assumed hers would be considered preventive. “I had called the insurance company,” she explains, “and was told I was fine for my preventive colonoscopy. I never thought ulcerative colitis would be an issue. I ended up paying $1500 toward the deductible and then 30% of the bill up to a certain amount. I didn’t try to appeal because I was so upset and so angry that it caused a flare-up of my colitis. I was like, ‘I cannot deal with this!'”\n\nPreventive vs. diagnostic colonoscopy\n\nI asked Linda Riddell, a fellow Bangor Daily News blogger who covers health insurance issues about Debbie’s predicament. She wrote this response on her Health Unsurance Blog:\n\n“You are bringing out a fine-print detail about the difference between preventive and diagnostic tests. Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurance has to cover preventive tests – including the colonoscopy for people age 50 to age 75 – without charging a co-pay. A test is “preventive” if the patient has no symptoms of disease. The very same test can be “diagnostic” if the patient has symptoms, or in your case, risk of disease.\n\nInsurers are not required to cover preventive (or “screening”) colonoscopies more frequently than the United States Preventive Task Force recommends. Their guidelines suggest every 10 years for colonoscopies. So, while ulcerative colitis patients may need colonoscopies more frequently, the insurer does not have to cover it with no co-pay.\n\nYou can press the issue with the insurer, by appealing when they deny the claim or charge you the co-pay. Another thing that Health Reform requires is a three-level appeal process, with independent people reviewing your claim and your argument. See HHS’s step-by-step process for appeals. It’s possible that the review process could lead to better coverage of your tests.”\n\nFour years later\n\nDebbie hasn’t had another colonoscopy since 2010. She says she simply couldn’t afford one. Her deductible is now $2500, but she’s afraid to put off the test any longer, so is scheduled to have one in June. Getting Linda’s information/link about how to go through the appeals process was helpful, because that’s exactly what she plans to do this time.\n\n“If I don’t have another flare-up,” she says, “I’ll probably try to put it through the appeals process and see what happens. I will try to do that if I can keep my wits about me. It’s just such a process. Why is the person with a healthy intestine allowed to have this procedure with no cost to them, but the minute you’re diagnosed with something, it’s a whole different ballgame? We’re the ones they should be allowing. It just doesn’t make sense.”\n\nDebbie says she’ll let us know what happens — with her colonoscopy and with her appeal."", 'For people on Medicare, the deductible will be waived for colorectal cancer screening tests even when polyps are detected and removed.\nDebbie has ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that affects as many as 700,000 people in the United States.\nShe’s covered by her husband’s health insurance and says that when she first started having colonoscopies, she never saw a bill.\nThat changed in 2010 when her husband got a new job and new health insurance.\n“I had called the insurance company,” she explains, “and was told I was fine for my preventive colonoscopy.']"

This year, they’re promoting the fact that we’re all bootylicious in our own way — and have launched a super-cheeky campaign.\n\nIt seems like perfect timing, thanks to celebs like Kim Kardashian and Rihanna, that belfies have become all the rage (in fact, I think I’ve seen their asses more than my own). Now we can all get in on the action while supporting an amazing cause, bringing to the forefront a type of cancer that’s been associated with a stigma and embarrassment for way too long. When caught early, colon cancer is 90 percent treatable through early screening.\n\nChris4Life is also part of an initiative called 80 percent by 2018 — where organizations are dedicated to eliminating colon cancer as a major public health problem, with a shared goal of reaching 80 percent of adults screened by 2018.\n\nThe art of the perfect belfie\n\nSnap pics of your honkey tonk badonkadonks and post them to your fave social media platforms using the #LoveYourButt hashtag (keep it PG please).

There were 23,900 new cases of this cancer in Canada in 2013, and as March is colon cancer awareness month, Dr. Sapna Makhija of the GI Health Centre in Burlington, Ontario, has a special message for women: Just do it.\n\n""Until recently women have been hesitant to seek medical attention. Historically, women had to be clean and proper. We don\'t like to discuss our bowels or look at our stools to see if there is anything different,"" says Dr. Makhija, a gastroenterologist who with two other female GI specialists has launched a clinic specializing in GI disorders. ""But colon cancer is the third most common cancer for women; over a lifetime, one in 15 women will be diagnosed with it and one in 31 will die.""\n\n""It\'s not a procedure that people look forward to,"" Dr. Makhija says, referring to the universally dreaded colonoscopy. And though the procedure is pretty common today, myths continue to plague it. For example, some people still think they don\'t need to be checked until they\'re over 50. ""But for patients with a family history of colon cancer, polyps, uterine or ovarian cancer, colonoscopies should be started earlier,"" she stresses. ""Say your mother was diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of 46, then her daughter or son would need to be checked at age 36. Yet most 36 year-olds would not think of getting screened for colon cancer."" On the other hand, only ten to 20 percent of people who have this cancer have a family history, so don\'t be complacent.\n\nThere\'s still a lot of misinformation around symptoms, she says, and some people dismiss the idea of screening because they say they have no symptoms. But colon cancer can have few symptoms until advanced; you want to catch it soonest. Rectal bleeding, dark stools, or a change in bowel habits lasting more than a few days are some worrisome signs. If you\'re over the age of 50, have a family history of cancer, or have any of these symptoms, make an appointment with your family doctor now. There are several tests that could be considered, including a fecal occult blood test, fecal imuno-chemical test (FIT), a flexible sigmoidoscopy, a double-contrast barium enema or a colonoscopy.\n\nFear and anxiety stops some people from making that colonoscopy appointment. And the fact that in Canada colonoscopy wait times, especially for outpatient hospital procedures, can be several months doesn\'t help; public not-for-profit clinics which are on the increase have less wait times -- sometimes just a few weeks.\n\nDr. Makhija adds that pain should not be a worry or a colonoscopy deal breaker because comfortable sedation is widely available. Anyone who has had a colonoscopy will tell you that the preparation, the day before it spent taking laxatives and running to the bathroom, is worse than the actual procedure. (To learn what to expect from this procedure, check out www.colonversation.ca.) ""There\'s still a social stigma to having a colonoscopy,"" she says. ""It\'s still considered a taboo subject.""\n\nTaboo it may be, but one recent U.S. report attributes the decrease in the incidence of colon cancer in older adults by 30 percent in the past decade to the tripling of the colonoscopy rate. ""Much of the credit for the lower incidence of colorectal cancer goes to improved uptake of colonoscopy among people ages 50 to 75,"" reported Charles Bankhead. The results came from data analyzed from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the National Center for Heatlh Statistics.\n\nDespite this, and the knowledge that colonoscopies can detect and successfully treat polyps which are precursors to bowel cancer -- in effect curing the potential cancer during the screening process -- millions of North Americans are still bottom shy and have avoided screening.\n\nThat may change, however. A recent report in www.medical newstoday.com noted that American colorectal cancer organizations have pledged to have 80 percent of Americans over the age of 50 screened by 2018. A worthy goal for Canada, too!\n\nMORE ON HUFFPOST:', '""But colon cancer is the third most common cancer for women; over a lifetime, one in 15 women will be diagnosed with it and one in 31 will die.""\n""It\'s not a procedure that people look forward to,"" Dr. Makhija says, referring to the universally dreaded colonoscopy.\n""But for patients with a family history of colon cancer, polyps, uterine or ovarian cancer, colonoscopies should be started earlier,"" she stresses.\nYet most 36 year-olds would not think of getting screened for colon cancer.""\nBut colon cancer can have few symptoms until advanced; you want to catch it soonest.']"

To help protect yourself, eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, exercise regularly and get screened before you experience symptoms.\n\nA sponsored article by Silver Cross Hospital.\n\nYour chances of developing colon cancer are higher if you have any of the following:\n\nHistory of large polyps (growths in the colon). A first-degree relative—mother, father, sister or brother—who had colon cancer before 65 years of age.\n\nA history of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or precancerous changes in the lining of the colon.\n\nColon cancer risk is noted at age 50. Most cases occur in people over 65 years of age. Fewer than 2 percent of cases occur in those individuals under 40 years of age.\n\nGet Screened\n\nYou may not know you have colorectal cancer because there are no warning signs in the early stages of the disease. The concept of screening is being tested when a person is feeling fine and has no symptoms or problems. The best way to know if you have colorectal cancer—before you have symptoms—is to be screened for the disease.\n\nSilver Cross Hospital is offering free Colon Cancer Screening kits during the month of March. Using the kit, you will collect a stool sample in your home and send it to the hospital's Lab to be tested for blood. Results are mailed back for patients to share with their physician. To request a colon cancer kit, click here or call 1-888-660-HEAL (4325).\n\nAnyone can be stricken with colorectal cancer. Men and women over age 50 have the greatest risk. You should have screenings earlier and more frequently if you have a family or personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps, or have a personal history of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nHowever, when symptoms do occur, they might include:\n\nany change in the usual pattern or frequency of bowel habits\n\ndiarrhea, constipation, or a feeling that your bowels have not emptied completely\n\nblood in the stool that is either bright-red or very dark\n\nstools that are narrower than usual\n\nfrequent gas pains, cramping or bloating.\n\nThe majority of colon cancer cases begin as small, non-cancerous growths—called polyps—that can become cancerous over time. Polyps may appear in either the colon or the rectum, both of which are part of the large intestine. Fortunately, up to 90 percent of colon and rectal cancers can be prevented just by finding and removing polyps before they become a cancer.\n\nFor a referral to a physician who diagnoses and treats colon cancer, click here or call the Silver Cross Physician Referral Service at 1-888-660-HEAL (4325)."", 'By Tracy Simons, Silver Cross HospitalColorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States today and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the country.\nOftentimes colorectal cancer can be detected and prevented if simple steps are followed.\nColon Cancer Risk FactorsResearchers are learning more about what causes colon cancer and how it grows and progresses, however, no one knows the exact cause of colon cancer, but we do know some of the risk factors.\nGet ScreenedYou may not know you have colorectal cancer because there are no warning signs in the early stages of the disease.\nAnyone can be stricken with colorectal cancer.']"

Laboratory tests have confirmed 13 cases of Ebola in Guinea so far, the first outbreak of the disease in West Africa.\n\n""The patients we have seen thus far have similar symptoms to those of the people in Guinea,"" Dahn said. ""Those people had the sickness and crossed over into Liberia\'s Lofa county for treatment. Five died.""\n\nSamples taken from those who died in Liberia had been sent to Conakry for testing, according to the Geneva-based WHO.\n\nIn Guinea, authorities have taken steps to quarantine suspected cases in the districts of Guekedou, Macenta, Nzerekore and Kissidougou.\n\nVIRULENT STRAIN\n\nIn neighbouring Sierra Leone, authorities set up a taskforce after the death of a 14-year-old boy who had attended the funeral of a suspected Ebola victim. Authorities are yet to confirm if the boy died of the disease.\n\nSierra Leone was receiving help from the WHO and the U.S. firm Metabiota, which investigates infectious disease threats, said Chief Medical Officer Brima Kargbo.\n\nInitial reports indicated a Canadian who showed Ebola-like symptoms after travelling to West Africa had tested negative for the virus, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters.\n\nEbola was discovered in 1976 in then-Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo. Scientists have identified the outbreak in Guinea as the virulent Zaire strain of the virus.\n\nBecause people who fall sick with it tend to vomit, have diarrhoea and suffer both internal and external bleeding, their bodies are often ""covered in virus"", explained Peter Piot, one of the co-discoverers of Ebola and now director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nThis means anyone in close contact with them - such as nurses, doctors and carers - is at risk, he said.\n\nEsther Sterk, a tropical diseases specialist at the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières, said after an incubation period of between 2 and 21 days, the virus causes a raging fever, headaches, muscle pain, conjunctivitis and weakness, before moving into more severe phases of causing vomiting, diarrhoea and hemorrhages.\n\n""Patients may have heavy bleeding, including from the nose or via their urine,"" she said in a briefing note on the disease.\n\nShe added, however, that while dangerous, Ebola remains rare. Since the virus was discovered in 1976, around 2,200 cases have been recorded. Of those, 1,500 were fatal.\n\nThe last major outbreak of the Zaire strain was in 2007, when 187 people died in Congo, a fatality rate of 74 percent.\n\nScientists are not clear how the virus - which also infects animals including bats, believed to be a major reservoir of the disease - crossed the continent from Sudan, Congo and Uganda.\n\nWith ethnic and family ties and trade making cross-border travel common in the region, the outbreak in Guinea is causing concern in nearby West African nations.\n\nMali said it was working with the WHO to put in place preventive measures, including stronger border control health checks, and a mechanism for coping with potential victims.\n\nThe WHO\'s Jasarevic said the main areas authorities should focus on were infection control, scaling up laboratory testing facilities and ensuring the best clinical management of confirmed cases of infection.\n\n""It\'s also about working with health workers so they know how to treat patients properly so they don\'t fall victim themselves,"" he said.', 'By Alphonso Toweh and Saliou SambMONROVIA/CONAKRY (Reuters) - West African nations scrambled on Tuesday to contain an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus suspected to have killed at least 59 in Guinea, with people presenting symptoms of the disease reported in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia.\nLaboratory tests have confirmed 13 cases of Ebola in Guinea so far, the first outbreak of the disease in West Africa.\nIn Guinea, authorities have taken steps to quarantine suspected cases in the districts of Guekedou, Macenta, Nzerekore and Kissidougou.\nVIRULENT STRAINIn neighbouring Sierra Leone, authorities set up a taskforce after the death of a 14-year-old boy who had attended the funeral of a suspected Ebola victim.\nWith ethnic and family ties and trade making cross-border travel common in the region, the outbreak in Guinea is causing concern in nearby West African nations.']"

It’s the first time in 20 years the virus has been reported in West Africa.\n\nEbola is one of the most deadly viruses known to mankind – there is no known cure.\n\nThe U.N. health agency said Tuesday at least 230 suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola have been recorded so far in Guinea and Liberia. The statement said 129 deaths in Guinea and 13 in Liberia have been linked to the disease.\n\n“The Ebola fever is one of the most virulent diseases known to mankind with a fatality rate up to 90 per cent,” said Ibrahima Toure, Guinea’s country director for the aid group Plan International.\n\nCommunities in the affected region travel freely, making the risk of the epidemic spreading very real. Such a spread could have devastating consequences, Toure said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAbout Ebola fever\n\nThe first case of Ebola was reported in 1976 in Congo. The virus is named after the river where it was recognized.\n\nThe virus gained international attention in the 1990s and 2000s after hundreds of deaths were reported in Uganda and Congo.\n\nThere are five distinct strains of the virus: Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, Reston, Sudan and Zaire.\n\nThe virus can be transmitted through direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. The World Health Organization (WHO) said transmission of the virus has also occurred through the handling of sick or dead infected animals, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, antelopes and fruit bats.\n\nSigns and symptoms of Ebola haemorrhagic fever\n\nEbola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) is often characterized by the sudden onset of intense weakness, fever, muscle pain, sore throat and headaches.\n\nThese symptoms are followed by diarrhea, vomiting, impaired liver and kidney function, and in some cases internal and external bleeding.\n\nIn later stages, some patients may bleed from their eyes, nose, ears, mouth or rectum. In some cases, patients may experience a bleeding or raised rash over their entire body.\n\nThe incubation period (the time from when the individual is exposed to the virus to when symptoms first appear) can range from two to 21 days.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nInfected people can spread Ebola for as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus.\n\nMost patients who become infected die.\n\nTreatment of EHF\n\nThere is no vaccine or treatment for EHF. Although a number of vaccines are currently being tested, the WHO said it could be years before a vaccine becomes available.\n\nIn severe cases, patients require intensive supportive care, including intravenous fluids to treat dehydration and maintaining the patient’s blood pressure.\n\nPreventative measures\n\nOfficials in Guinea blasted out messages on state radio and television, urging people to wash their hands frequently and avoid contact with sick people.\n\nThe WHO said because there is no treatment, the only way to reduce death during an Ebola outbreak is to raise awareness of infection risk factors.\n\nThe public can reduce their risk of contracting EHF by limiting their exposure to infected animals, avoiding direct contact with infected people, and wearing gloves and protective clothing around those infected.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press', 'Ebola is one of the most deadly viruses known to mankind – there is no known cure.\nStory continues below advertisementAbout Ebola feverThe first case of Ebola was reported in 1976 in Congo.\nIn some cases, patients may experience a bleeding or raised rash over their entire body.\nStory continues below advertisementInfected people can spread Ebola for as long as their blood and bodily fluids contain the virus.\nIn severe cases, patients require intensive supportive care, including intravenous fluids to treat dehydration and maintaining the patient’s blood pressure.']"

According to the World Health Organization, Ebola fever has a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent. There is no known cure.\n\nThe virus gained worldwide attention in the 1990s after an outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) killed 245 people. The severe, fast-acting nature of Ebola inspired a number of apocalyptic novels and movies, including the 1995 film Outbreak (1995).\n\nThere are five distinct strains of the Ebola virus: Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, Reston, Sudan and Zaire.\n\nWhile the virus hasn’t generated as much media interest in the past decade, it’s not for lack of outbreaks – prior to this latest one in Guinea, there were significant flare-ups in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Uganda and Sudan in the 2000s.\n\nHere’s a closer look at this dangerous and little-understood virus.\n\nWhen did it first emerge?\n\nA microscopic view of the Ebola virus. ((Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp.)) According to WHO, Ebola first appeared in 1976 in two areas at once: in Nzara, Sudan, and in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The latter was near the Ebola River, hence the name.\n\nHow is it transmitted?\n\nEbola is transmitted from person to person through bodily fluids.\n\nHumans first got the virus through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals. As WHO reports, “infection has been documented through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found dead or ill in the rainforest.”\n\nAccording to WHO, fruit bats are considered natural hosts for Ebola, and as a result, “the geographic distribution of Ebolaviruses may overlap with the range of the fruit bats.”\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nThree of the five Ebola strains have been associated with Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), which is characterized by internal and external bleeding. The virus\'s incubation period lasts about a week, and early symptoms can include chills, low-back pain, fatigue, diarrhea and headaches.\n\nAs the infection intensifies, individuals can experience bleeding from the eyes, ears and nose, as well as the mouth and rectum.\n\n“What happens, in any hemorrhagic fever, is your blood vessels start to leak, and so that’s why you get bruises in the skin,” says Dr. Jay Keystone, a renowned travel physician and professor in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\n“If your blood vessels are leaking out of the gut, you’re bleeding [out of the] rectum, and if your bleeding is in the stomach, you’re vomiting up blood.”\n\nIllness sets in between two to 21 days after infection. In most cases, the time between the start of the symptoms and death is one to two weeks.\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that the Ebola hemorrhagic fever has a fatality rate of up to 90 per cent. (Isaac Kasamani/AFP/Getty Images) While EHF leads to a lot of blood loss, that’s not usually the cause of death, Dr. Keystone says.\n\n“You die of shock from bleeding, but it’s more than that,” he says. The victim gets a viremia, which is when a virus enters the bloodstream and as a result, gains access to the rest of the body.\n\n“You start to get a breakdown of body function,: Dr. Keystone says. ""The kidneys fail, you may get secondary pneumonia. But in this case, it’s an overwhelming infection which causes a breakdown of tissue, release of what we call antigens, and then essentially you get a total body failure.”\n\nCan it be cured?\n\nThere are no known cures or vaccines, according to WHO.\n\nPatients are typically hospitalized and kept in intensive care, and may receive medications and intravenous fluids to cope with shock, as well as transfusions of fresh blood.\n\nHow is the current strain in Guinea different from the ones we saw in the 1990s and early 2000s?\n\nThe current strain is “more virulent,” says Dr. Keystone. Even so, he points out that Ebola’s reputation overshadows the actual threat.\n\nWhat terrifies the public is “the thought that 90 per cent of people die,” and that “it kills you within a matter of a few days,” he says.\n\nBut Ebola, which has killed about 2,000 people since the late-‘70s, is inferior, in terms of efficiency, to a virus such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which “spreads quietly, silently, and millions get infected.”\n\nWith Ebola, ""all the people who get it die,"" he says, which prevents those hosts from infecting more people.', '']"

Drugs or vaccines against the virus don't exist.\n\nSo far, the disease has occurred mainly in the remote villages of Central and West Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Sudan as well as Gabon, Ivory Coast and Uganda, and more recently, Guinea. Around 60 people have died there from the viral infection since mid-February.\n\nHow Ebola spreads\n\nThe Ebola virus is spread from person to person through the exchange of body fluids – it can't be transmitted through air particles. There has to be direct physical contact. Patients with the virus often infect those caring for them, explaining why the virus often spreads in hospitals. Transmission can also occur when mourners come to bid farewell to infected deceased relatives or friends and touch the corpse.\n\nAnimals can also be carriers of the virus, which is able to multiply in almost any of the host's cells. Fruit bats are especially known to be transmitters of the virus.\n\nThe Ebola virus originates from the tropical rain forests of central Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the class of filoviridae, which looks like long, thin threads when viewed under a microscope. There are several sub-types of the Ebola virus, of which only a few affect people. But, when the virus does, the infection is more often than not fatal.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nBetween two and 21 days after becoming infected, patients begin to feel weak and experience headaches, muscle aches and chills. They lose their appetite and feel lethargic, suffering from stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea. A so-called hemorrhagic fever sets in, accompanied by severe internal bleeding. This condition affects the gastrointestinal tract, spleen and lungs, eventually leading to the death.\n\nNo medication\n\nVaccines against the Ebola virus don’t exist, and once the virus has entered the body, no medication can eradicate it. The only way to limit the possibility of infection and an epidemic of this deadly disease is to take preventative measures. These include establishing hygiene practices in hospitals, wearing protective latex gloves and having adequate quarantine measures in place.\n\nThe Ebola virus was discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then, the World Heath Organization has registered 15 outbreaks across Africa, including Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2012. More than 1,300 people have died from the virus. At the moment, Guinea is experiencing an epidemic."", ""In 90 percent of cases, the Ebola virus is fatal.\nHow Ebola spreadsThe Ebola virus is spread from person to person through the exchange of body fluids – it can't be transmitted through air particles.\nThere are several sub-types of the Ebola virus, of which only a few affect people.\nNo medicationVaccines against the Ebola virus don’t exist, and once the virus has entered the body, no medication can eradicate it.\nThe Ebola virus was discovered in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.""]"
41013,http://www.dw.de/msf-we-dont-know-why-ebola-happens/a-17516533,health,"['DW: This is the first occurrence of Ebola in Guinea. Why now?\n\nArmand Sprecher: We don’t know why Ebola happens at any given moment, only that this virus is in constant circulation in bats. The assumption is that movements of the bat population transport the virus and then it moves into non-human primates like chimps or gorillas and then into humans usually through consumption of bushmeat. The bats roost in trees that are likely also used by non-human primate for the purposes of fruit collection and the like.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Ebola and what happens if it goes untreated?\n\nEbola starts off as a vague flu-like illness: One gets a fever, a sore throat, headaches and aches all over, making the sufferer profoundly weak. After a few days, vomiting and diarrhea set in and, in some case, we do see bleeding from the gums and nose and in the vomit and diarrhea. The bleeding isn’t dramatic, contrary to what you see in many Hollywood movies.\n\n\n\nDepending on the species of the virus, the case-fatality rate can range anywhere from 50 to 90 percent. Unfortunately for the people in Guinea, the species in this case has been identified as Ebola Zier which has a very high case-fatality ratio. Ninety-three percent of the people who get this particular species of the disease can die from it.\n\nGiven the flu-like symptoms, is it possible that the early signs of an outbreak were overlooked?\n\nMSF medical specialist Armand Sprecher\n\nIt’s often overlooked - that’s the problem. These outbreaks occur where people are routinely confronted by deadly diseases. Shigella dysentery, typhoid fever and malaria are all quite common in this region. Guinea has the added problem of Lassa fever being endemic to this area. So dying of a hemorrhagic fever isn’t particularly unusual. Ebola was probably mistaken for one of these early on. The clustering of illness in families and the infection of health care workers indicate that something is going on.\n\nOne measure the government has taken to stop the disease from spreading has been to impose restrictions on funerals. Why is it important to do that?\n\nTraditional African burial rituals involve mourners touching the corpse. This is problematic with deaths from Ebola because the disease can still be transmitted after death. So, in expressing their affection for the department, the mourners can become victims themselves.\n\nHow serious is the threat of this disease spreading to neighboring countries?\n\nMSF has been supplying medical equipment to Guinea to deal with the outbreak\n\nGiven Guinea’s location at a crossroads, it’s very easy to cross a border into Liberia or Sierra Leone. In fact, we’ve already heard that cases may have been detected in Sierra Leone. That’s under investigation and nothing has been confirmed. Liberia is equally easy to access from where the disease originated in Guinea. This will naturally complicate outbreak control. There will need to be additional isolation units and the like.\n\nSo what are the additional challenges facing aid organizations like Medecins Sans Frontiere and yourself?\n\nThe number one priority is getting those infected to a treatment unit where they can’t infect anyone else and where the health care workers can care for them. Once the victims have been assembled, they are asked to list all the people with whom they have come into contact since they were ill. In turn, health care workers check in with all those people listed. In a place like this where the roads are in such poor condition, moving around the community to check in with so many people is a significant logistical challenge.\n\nCan the local governments cope with the relief efforts?\n\nI guess that depends on how you define “cope.” Generally speaking, epidemics require rather extraordinary resources to contain further outbreaks. These resources are generally supplied by external agencies. We provide much of the safety equipment but, to the extent that we can, we train and work with local health care and medical organizations. It takes a certain kind of person to work closely with an Ebola victim. For very rational reasons, it’s not uncommon for health care workers to run in the other direction. So, the provision of medical resources depends on their willingness to engage with the disease.\n\nArmand Sprecher is a public health specialist at Medecins Sans Frontieres', 'Armand Sprecher: We don’t know why Ebola happens at any given moment, only that this virus is in constant circulation in bats.\nThe clustering of illness in families and the infection of health care workers indicate that something is going on.\nThe number one priority is getting those infected to a treatment unit where they can’t infect anyone else and where the health care workers can care for them.\nIn turn, health care workers check in with all those people listed.\nFor very rational reasons, it’s not uncommon for health care workers to run in the other direction.']"

41019,http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/03/ebola-outbreak-kills-59-guinea,health,"['The World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday confirmed an Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Guinea, signaling the first appearance of the disease in a West African country and the involvement of the most lethal strain of the virus.\n\nBased on information from Guinea\'s health ministry, the WHO said the ""rapidly evolving outbreak"" started in a forested area in the southeastern part of the country, with 49 cases and 29 deaths reported from four districts. In its Twitter account today, the WHO sharply upped the case count to 86 suspected cases—13 of them lab-confirmed—and 59 deaths.\n\nEarlier reports\n\nSpeculation about a ""mystery disease"" in Guinea has been swirling since roughly Mar 14, when FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board, started picking up foreign-language media reports about a highly lethal disease that first surfaced in the middle of February in Guinea\'s forest region, resembled a hemorrhagic fever with symptoms of diarrhea, fever, and fatigue, and had already killed four health workers.\n\nSome news accounts over the past few days said suspected Ebola cases had surfaced in Conakry, Guinea\'s capital, which is on the Atlantic coast on the opposite side of the country from the outbreak location. However, the WHO said on Twitter today that samples from two of three suspected cases in Conakry tested negative for the disease and that no samples were available for the third case.\n\nFour healthcare workers were infected by the disease, and health officials are investigating reports of suspected cases in bordering areas of Liberia and Sierra Leone, the WHO said.\n\nTests that confirmed the Ebola virus as the source of the outbreak were conducted at the Pasteur Institute in Lyon, France, the WHO said. Initial sequencing of the virus\' L gene showed strong similarity to the Zaire strain, the most lethal of the five Ebola subtypes, with a case fatality rate as high as 90%. Further tests are under way to confirm the finding.\n\nIn a Mar 22 ProMED-mail post, two of the scientists who were involved with the testing—Sylvian Baize, PhD, and Delphine Pannetier, PhD— wrote that they analyzed 12 samples, seven from clinical cases and five from contacts. They said they detected the Ebola virus in samples from six clinical cases and that viral isolation is in progress. ProMED-mail is the online reporting system of the International Society for Infectious Diseases.\n\nBaize and Pannetier wrote that the early genetic sequencing results that suggest the Zaire strain are consistent with the dramatic mortality observed so far in the outbreak.\n\nMulti-pronged response\n\nGuinea\'s health ministry, the WHO, and other health partners have launched several control measures to curb the outbreak. For example, the health ministry activated its national and district emergency committees to coordinate the outbreak response, and teams are in the field to look for additional cases and conduct contact tracing.\n\nDoctors Without Borders is working in affected areas to set up isolation centers and is helping transport patient and contact samples for testing at reference labs. Also, the Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network has taken steps to ensure that labs in Guinea and Sierra Leone have the filovirus diagnostic capacity they need.\n\nThe WHO said it and other groups are sending more experts to support Guinea\'s health ministry, as well as supplies and resources for managing patients and controlling the outbreak.\n\nUNICEF said in a Mar 22 statement that three children so far are among the outbreak fatalities and that it immediately rushed five tons of aid and medical supplies to the most affected areas.\n\nDr Mohamed Ag Ayoya, a UNICEF representative in Guinea, said in the statement, ""In Guinea, a country with a weak medical infrastructure, an outbreak like this can be devastating."" The agency said that even before the cause of the outbreak had been determined, it had already distributed medical supplies such as soap, rehydration solution, and chlorine bottles.\n\nUNICEF also raised concerns about urgently needed medical staff being among the outbreak\'s early victims. It said at least eight health workers who had contact with patients have died from the disease.\n\nECDC risk assessment\n\nMeanwhile, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in a risk assessment today said there are concerns about the risk of the disease\'s spread to neighboring Sierra Leone and that with an incubation period up to 3 weeks, Guinean health officials will probably detect more cases.\n\nIt\'s unlikely, but not impossible, that travelers infected in Guinea could arrive in Europe while incubating the disease and then get sick, the ECDC said, urging medical workers to be alert for travelers returning from tropical countries with symptoms such as fever, headache, and diarrhea. It said European citizens in Guinea aren\'t at risk of becoming infected unless they have direct contact with the body fluids of sick or dead infected people or animals.\n\nThe first known Ebola outbreak in humans was detected in 1976 in outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan. The virus spills over to humans from handling infected animals, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, and then spreads from human to human through close contact with blood or other body fluids of infected people. No vaccine or specific treatment is available.\n\nThe last outbreak involving the Zaire strain, one of five Ebola subspecies, occurred in the DRC in 2008, sickening 32 and killing 14, for a case-fatality ratio of 44%, according to background information from the WHO.\n\nSee also:\n\nMar 23 WHO Regional Office for Africa statement\n\nMar 22 PRO Med Mail post\n\nFluTrackers thread\n\nMar 22 UNICEF press release\n\nWHO Twitter account\n\nWHO Ebola hemorrhagic fever fact sheet\n\nMar 23 ECDC rapid risk assessment', 'Some news accounts over the past few days said suspected Ebola cases had surfaced in Conakry, Guinea\'s capital, which is on the Atlantic coast on the opposite side of the country from the outbreak location.\nTests that confirmed the Ebola virus as the source of the outbreak were conducted at the Pasteur Institute in Lyon, France, the WHO said.\nThey said they detected the Ebola virus in samples from six clinical cases and that viral isolation is in progress.\nDr Mohamed Ag Ayoya, a UNICEF representative in Guinea, said in the statement, ""In Guinea, a country with a weak medical infrastructure, an outbreak like this can be devastating.""\nThe first known Ebola outbreak in humans was detected in 1976 in outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Sudan.']"

This is the main finding of a new WHO report (1), released today, on the burden of disease related to ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor) air pollution. Specifically, 482 000 deaths are attributable to ambient air pollution and 117 200 deaths to household air pollution in the WHO European Region. While deaths from ambient air pollution occur in all European countries regardless of their income, those from household air pollution are over 5 times greater in low- and middle-income countries than wealthier ones.\n\nAir pollution – a risk factor for disease\n\nAir pollution is the largest contributor to the burden of disease from the environment. Health effects are due to exposure to small particulate matter (≤10 μm in diameter – PM10), which causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, as well as cancer. The new estimates are based on the latest WHO data on deaths and diseases from air pollution exposure. They highlight that exposure to air pollution is a more important risk factor for major noncommunicable diseases (such as ischaemic heart disease and stroke) than previously thought.\n\nNeed to improve air quality\n\nScience provides convincing arguments for decisive action to improve air quality and reduce related deaths and diseases in Europe. Evidence published by WHO/Europe last year (2), as part of the international project to review evidence on health aspects of air pollution (REVIHAAP), confirms that outdoor air pollution is an important risk factor for health.\n\nThese findings support the scientific conclusions of the WHO air quality guidelines and indicate that health effects can occur at air pollution concentrations lower than the guideline levels. Further, in October 2013, the International Research Agency on Cancer (IARC), a specialized agency of WHO, classified air pollution mixture and PM as carcinogenic to human beings (Group 1).\n\nWHO/Europe’s work on air pollution\n\nIn the 2010 Parma Declaration on Environment and Health, Member States in the WHO European Region committed themselves to preventing disease by improving outdoor and indoor air quality. WHO/Europe continues to work with Member States and in partnership with other regional actors, notably:\n\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), in the context of the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution and the Transport Health and Environment Pan-European Programme (THE PEP); and\n\nthe European Commission in the context of the revision of its policies on air quality.\n\nThe Task Force on the Health Aspects of Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, co-chaired by WHO/Europe’s European Centre for Environment and Health, will use the most recent results to intensify support to Member States that develop their policies independently from European Union (EU) processes.', 'Exposure to air pollution accounted for 7 million deaths worldwide in 2012, including almost 600 000 in the WHO European Region.\nSpecifically, 482 000 deaths are attributable to ambient air pollution and 117 200 deaths to household air pollution in the WHO European Region.\nWhile deaths from ambient air pollution occur in all European countries regardless of their income, those from household air pollution are over 5 times greater in low- and middle-income countries than wealthier ones.\nAir pollution – a risk factor for diseaseAir pollution is the largest contributor to the burden of disease from the environment.\nThe new estimates are based on the latest WHO data on deaths and diseases from air pollution exposure.']"

The seven million deaths annually were from a combination of indoor and outdoor air pollution.\n\nIn its research, the health organisation found strong links between indoor and outdoor air pollution and cardiovascular diseases – like strokes and ischaemic heart disease. These two were responsible for more than half of the deaths. There was also a strong link between exposure and cancer.\n\nThe worst-hit areas were in south-east Asia, but in total 3.3-million people died from indoor air pollution while 2.6-million died from outdoor air pollution. The indoor deaths were due to people cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. Around half of the world’s population – 2.9-billion people – use these as their primary means of energy and cooking.\n\nOutdoor pollution comes from sources such as industry, with excessive air pollution resulting from “unsustainable policies” by governments. The policies meant transport, energy production, waste management and industry were leading to deaths, the report said. “Healthier strategies will be more economical in the long term due to healthcare cost savings as well as climate gains.”\n\n“The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart diseases and strokes,” said Dr Maria Neira, the organisation’s director of public health, environmental and social determinants to health.\n\n“Fewer risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution.

Meanwhile, indoor pollution, which tends to result from cooking over coal or wood stoves, contributes to another 4.3 million deaths. Since some people are exposed to both types of pollution, WHO took the overlap into account to reach the overall seven million number.\n\n“The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,” WHO’s Dr. Maria Neira said in a statement. “Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.”\n\nIn 2008, the last time WHO officials attempted to calculate the number of deaths resulting from air pollution, the agency estimated that outdoor pollution killed 1.3 million people and indoor pollution killed 1.9 million. Research methods have advanced since then and now allow WHO to collect better data, particularly in rural areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough it’s clear that pollution is a big contributor to strokes and heart disease, it’s been linked to several other health issues as well. Long-term exposure to dirty air is connected to asthma, kidney damage, and autism. Last fall, WHO officially classified air pollution as a carcinogen, concluding that it puts people at a higher risk for lung and bladder cancers.\n\nThe dramatic impacts of air pollution have recently been evident in Paris, where officials started offering free public transportation to cut down on dangerous smog, and Beijing, where some “smog clinics” opened their doors to treat residents suffering from cardiovascular issues. China recently declared a “war on smog” to tackle the persistent public health issue.\n\nBut these issues are evident here in the United States, too, where an estimated 42 percent of the population lives in an area where air pollution often reaches dangerous levels.

In India, major sources of air pollution in the home are tobacco smoke and the smoke from the use of solid fuels with inefficient and leaky cook stoves.\n\nWHO/Ajay Pillarisetti\n\nMillions of women in rural India spend several hours every day cooking meals on smoky ovens or open fires within their homes. Because cooking chores most often fall to women, they and the young children around them are the first victims of smoke-related acute and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. According to WHO estimates, in 2012 there were close to 1.7 million premature deaths attributed to household air pollution from cooking in the South East Asia region with India shouldering the biggest burden. Most of these premature deaths were due to noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Indoor air pollution is also responsible for a significant number of acute respiratory illnesses in young children.\n\nHealth impact on women and children\n\nMany women do not realize that the smoke emitted from the traditional clay or brick stoves called chulhas is putting their and their family members’ lives in danger. The solid fuels they use in these ovens include a mix of wood, coal, crop residue and cow-dung. Their smoke contains many dangerous pollutants such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide.\n\n“Having an open fire in your kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour,” says Dr Kirk Smith, a Professor of Global Environmental Health from the University of California at Berkeley, who began to measure the air pollution exposure from cooking over open biomass cook stoves already in the 1970s. “Unfortunately, we have not made a lot of progress in the past decades and household air pollution is still the largest single health risk factor for Indian women and girls.”\n\nAn estimated 700 million people in India still rely on solid fuels and traditional cook stoves for domestic cooking despite their negative impact on peoples’ health. This figure has remained relatively constant over the last three decades despite efforts to improve access to cleaner energy sources such as gas and electricity also in rural areas.\n\n“Most of the initial initiatives to improve cook stoves promoted in the 1980s and 1990s in India were focused on enhancing stove energy efficiency and not necessarily on reducing emissions or exposure to smoke. But evidence from an increasing number of studies in India is paving the way for health-centric interventions,” explains Prof. Kalpana Balakrishnan from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health at Sri Ramachandra University in Chennai.\n\nNew WHO guidelines on health impacts of household cooking\n\nFor over a decade, WHO has been monitoring the use of solid fuels for cooking and related death and disease burden. The Organization is working with countries to raise awareness and build capacity to address the health impacts of indoor air pollution. WHO is also contributing to global initiatives for improving energy access like the United Nations Secretary General’s Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) initiative and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.\n\n“We are currently completing new indoor air quality guidelines for household fuel combustion,” says Dr Carlos Dora from the WHO Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “These guidelines will provide decision makers in countries and other partners with technical recommendations regarding fuels, cook stoves and household energy technologies with the best performance for protecting health.”\n\nWHO/ Heather Adair-Rohani\n\nThe new WHO guidelines will not only focus on the health impacts of household cooking in both developed and developing countries but also include recommendations on other home energy needs, including heating and lighting. They are expected to globally increase the use of clean household fuels and technologies that can protect the health of all family members.\n\nIndia has already started revising the national standards for cook stoves under the leadership of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. New stoves need to be tested, and have to give proof that they are less polluting and more efficient than existing traditional and improved models. The promotion of the best available fuels and technologies can make an enormous public health impact – particularly for women and children.', 'Clean household energy can save people’s livesAir pollution in and outside of people’s homes is the world’s largest single environmental health risk.\nAccording to WHO estimates, in 2012 there were close to 1.7 million premature deaths attributed to household air pollution from cooking in the South East Asia region with India shouldering the biggest burden.\nIndoor air pollution is also responsible for a significant number of acute respiratory illnesses in young children.\nThe Organization is working with countries to raise awareness and build capacity to address the health impacts of indoor air pollution.\nThey are expected to globally increase the use of clean household fuels and technologies that can protect the health of all family members.']"

This finding more than doubles previous estimates and confirms that air pollution is now the world\'s largest single environmental health risk. Reducing air pollution could save millions of lives.\n\nNew estimates\n\nIn particular, the new data reveal a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer. This is in addition to air pollution\'s role in the development of respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe new estimates are not only based on more knowledge about the diseases caused by air pollution, but also upon better assessment of human exposure to air pollutants through the use of improved measurements and technology. This has enabled scientists to make a more detailed analysis of health risks from a wider demographic spread that now includes rural as well as urban areas.\n\nRegionally, low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution.\n\n""Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly...""

""Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.""\n\nIncluded in the assessment is a breakdown of deaths attributed to specific diseases, underlining that the vast majority of air pollution deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases as follows:\n\nOutdoor air pollution-caused deaths - breakdown by disease:\n\n40% - ischaemic heart disease;\n\n40% - stroke;\n\n11% - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);\n\n6% - lung cancer; and\n\n3% - acute lower respiratory infections in children.\n\nIndoor air pollution-caused deaths - breakdown by disease:\n\n34% - stroke;\n\n26% - ischaemic heart disease;\n\n22% - COPD;\n\n12% - acute lower respiratory infections in children; and\n\n6% - lung cancer.\n\nThe new estimates are based on the latest WHO mortality data from 2012 as well as evidence of health risks from air pollution exposures.

""Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.""\n\nAfter analysing the risk factors and taking into account revisions in methodology, WHO estimates indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths in 2012 in households cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. The new estimate is explained by better information about pollution exposures among the estimated 2.9 billion people living in homes using wood, coal or dung as their primary cooking fuel, as well as evidence about air pollution\'s role in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancers.\n\nIn the case of outdoor air pollution, WHO estimates there were 3.7 million deaths in 2012 from urban and rural sources worldwide.\n\nMany people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap, mortality attributed to the two sources cannot simply be added together, hence the total estimate of around 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\n""Excessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry. In most cases, healthier strategies will also be more economical in the long term due to health-care cost savings as well as climate gains,"" says Dr Carlos Dora, WHO Coordinator for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. ""WHO and health sectors have a unique role in translating scientific evidence on air pollution into policies that can deliver impact and improvements that will save lives.""\n\nThe release of today\'s data is a significant step in advancing a WHO roadmap for preventing diseases related to air pollution.

41123,http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/03/the_gathering_place_to_hold_fr.html,health,"['CLEVELAND, Ohio -- When actress Angelina Jolie announced to the world last spring that she had undergone a preventive double mastectomy to lower her risk of breast cancer, many people found themselves hearing about the BRCA gene for the very first time.\n\nEveryone carries BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which produce proteins that help repair damaged DNA. When a woman carries mutated versions of those genes – a condition that is inherited - it puts them at increased risk for developing breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer.\n\nMen who inherit the mutated gene are at higher risk of developing breast cancer and are at higher risk for other types of cancers. Like women, men also can pass the gene onto their children.\n\nOn April 5 The Gathering Place is holding its first-ever symposium devoted solely to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The free, day-long event is geared toward not just women and men who have found out that they have inherited the mutated gene, but also those with a strong family history of cancer; those being treated for cancer but who have never had genetic counseling; and their loved ones.\n\nThe panels and workshops will provide information about subjects including genetic counseling, how to talk to children about genetic cancer, and emotional health and wellness.\n\nThe symposium comes at a time when BRCA is once again in the news.\n\nIn February, the Journal of Clinical Oncology published online the findings of a study showing that women with the mutated BRCA1 gene lowered their risk of ovarian cancer more if they had their ovaries removed by age 35, while women with the mutated BRCA2 gene could wait until their 40s.\n\nJolie, 38, who inherited the mutated BRCA1 gene, has stated in the past that she planned to have the surgery, called an oophorectomy, but has not indicated when.\n\nDonna Amendola already has made that choice. In the spring of 2012, at 41, she was diagnosed with breast cancer following a routine screening mammogram.\n\nAmendola’s mother had died of pancreatic cancer more than a dozen years earlier. Other family members had been diagnosed with other cancers. But there was no history of breast cancer.\n\nAbout the event\n\n""Understanding BRCA1 and BRCA2"" will be held from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday, April 5 at Corporate College East, 4400 Richmond Rd., Warrensville Heights. Registration strongly recommended; go to conta.cc/OR9XP4. For information contact Susan Marinac at marinac@touchedbycancer.org or (216) 595-9546.\n\nUntil her physician suggested that she get genetic counseling, Amendola had never before considered it.\n\n“I resisted and said there was no reason to go,” she said.\n\nGenetic testing revealed that she had the mutated BRCA2 gene.\n\nWithin months of her diagnosis and surgeries – first, a double mastectomy, then a total hysterectomy, Amendola found herself coordinating outreach for the local chapter of FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered).\n\n“I’ve had a crash course,” she said.\n\nSo far, Amendola is the only one in her family who has chosen to go through genetic counseling and genetic testing. Her two sons are too young to have a conversation about BRCA. But the thought of them or other family members having the gene is in the back of her mind, she said.\n\nHelping women figure out how and if to make those types of decisions is one of the promises panelist Dr. Holly Pederson sees for the event.\n\n“Get tested or not get tested for a known mutation? Should I get preventive surgery or not?” said Pederson, medical director of the Breast Clinic at Cleveland Clinic Beachwood Family Health and Surgery Center.\n\nAre you at risk for BRCA?\n\nRoughly 10 percent of all breast cancers and about 15 percent of ovarian cancers are believed to be hereditary. Among the risk factors for inheriting a mutated BRCA gene are a breast cancer diagnosis before age 50; an ovarian cancer at any age; being male and having breast cancer; multiple cases of breast cancer on the same side of the family; being of Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish origin.\n\n“We want raise awareness so that families ask their doctors, ‘Do you think I should talk to a certified genetic counselor about assessing my risk?’ ” said Pederson, who will take part in a physician panel. “The key is having a qualified genetic counselor decide whether genetic testing is right for that family.”\n\nDuane Culler, a genetic counselor at University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center, will co-lead a workshop for male partners of women who have tested positive for the mutated BRCA gene.\n\nFamilies who are newly dealing with a BRCA discovery – especially on the heels of a cancer diagnosis – are immediately tackling issues of treatment and risk reduction. Their spouses and partners are often neglected, Culler said.\n\n“It’s easy for people to say they can get whatever support they need, but connecting to that support – especially men who have a partner with the BRCA mutation – can be difficult,” Culler said.\n\n“There are lots of resources, not just medical but psychosocial support,” he said. Still, “A lot of people still feel isolated. It’s helpful to remind people that there are resources out there.”\n\nWhile women who have already tested positive for the BRCA mutation are already aware of their options, it is the young “previvor” group – women newly diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer who are still considering genetic counseling and testing – who often need the most guidance, Amendola said.\n\n“If you investigate your family tree, and if there’s a history of cancers – breast, ovarian, pancreatic – that looks like it might be genetic, consider talking to a genetic counselor,” she said.', 'When a woman carries mutated versions of those genes – a condition that is inherited - it puts them at increased risk for developing breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer.\nMen who inherit the mutated gene are at higher risk of developing breast cancer and are at higher risk for other types of cancers.\nOn April 5 The Gathering Place is holding its first-ever symposium devoted solely to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.\nThe panels and workshops will provide information about subjects including genetic counseling, how to talk to children about genetic cancer, and emotional health and wellness.\nIn the spring of 2012, at 41, she was diagnosed with breast cancer following a routine screening mammogram.']"

Those are among the conclusions of a study published recently in the BJS (British Journal of Surgery). The findings provide insights into how genetic advances will soon be affecting patient care.\n\n\n\nWhen a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, it\'s important to know as much about her tumour as possible to determine the best treatment. Most cases of breast cancer are sporadic, but a minority are hereditary and caused by one or more mutations in genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. To find such genetic mutations in newly diagnosed patients, researchers must sequence the woman\'s DNA, which is generally a relatively slow process that generates results weeks or months after patients have started treatment. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a newer method of sequencing DNA that processes large amounts of data. It\'s faster and more expensive than conventional sequencing, but in recent years it has become cheaper and more widely accessible by rapid advances in computing power. With the use of NGS, which will soon become the mainstay of clinical genetics, breast cancer units will likely be able to get the results of genetic testing before patients begin their breast cancer treatment.\n\n\n\nIn a collaboration between breast surgeons and medical geneticists at the Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital and Addenbrooke\'s Hospital in Cambridge, UK, Simon Pilgrim, MD, and his colleagues searched the medical literature to identify relevant studies relating to breast cancer genetics and then looked to see what impact NGS will have on breast cancer units as well as what opportunities will arise for improving treatment for patients.\n\n\n\nThe researchers found that because NGS will allow breast cancer clinicians to know whether patients carry high-risk mutations (which might increase their risk of developing another breast cancer in the same or other breast in the future) before the start of treatment, more women might opt for mastectomy instead of breast-conserving surgery or for double rather than single mastectomy. Dr Pilgrim noted that some of the mutations that are detected might also confer increased risks of developing other cancers, which would indicate the need to monitor at-risk patients closely for these cancers as well. ""The converse is also true,"" he said. ""NGS can be used to find genetic mutations in people with other hereditary cancers or conditions. For example, a woman with ovarian cancer might be found to have a BRCA1 mutation, and hence breast units must be prepared to handle questions about the management of breast cancer risk in patients referred by other specialties."" Dr Pilgrim added that NGS will have implications for the relatives of people found to have mutations linked to breast or other cancers, and therefore family members may also wish to undergo testing after appropriate counseling.\n\n\n\nIn the longer term, being able to identify patients with breast cancer who carry certain gene mutations before they start treatment will help researchers conduct clinical trials to establish which treatments are best for carriers of particular mutations. Dr Pilgrim noted that research already suggests that BRCA1-associated breast cancer is more responsive to certain chemotherapy drugs than sporadic breast cancers are.\n\nSource: British Journal of Surgery', ""Faster and cheaper DNA sequencing techniques will likely improve care for patients with breast cancer but also create challenges for clinicians as they counsel patients on their treatment options.\nWhen a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, it's important to know as much about her tumour as possible to determine the best treatment.\nNext generation sequencing (NGS) is a newer method of sequencing DNA that processes large amounts of data.\nWith the use of NGS, which will soon become the mainstay of clinical genetics, breast cancer units will likely be able to get the results of genetic testing before patients begin their breast cancer treatment.\nDr Pilgrim noted that research already suggests that BRCA1-associated breast cancer is more responsive to certain chemotherapy drugs than sporadic breast cancers are.""]"

Gynecologic cancer cells that have a BRCA mutation appear to be sensitive to veliparib, which targets an enzyme called PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase), according to a Phase II study being presented at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women’s Cancer in Tampa, Fla., March 22-25.\n\nPARP inhibitors prevent cancer cells from repairing themselves after experiencing DNA damage (for example from chemotherapy or radiation). Research has previously shown that veliparib is effective in combination with chemotherapy, but little data was available to indicate whether veliparib was effective as a single agent. Results of this multicenter trial suggest that it is. “One criticism of the PARP drugs is they are not active in patients who have developed resistance to other therapies, but we found veliparib appears to be effective in some platinum-resistant patients with recurrent or persistent disease,” said Robert L.

The median number of monthly treatment cycles was six (ranging from one to 22). Overall, 13 patients (26 percent) responded positively to the therapy, meaning the tumors shrank in size, including two patients in whom the tumors disappeared completely.

The findings, based on information from the nation\'s largest cancer database, are being presented at the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Annual Meeting on Women\'s Cancer in Tampa, Fla., March 22-25.\n\nWomen with cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal and vulvar cancer who were cared for at high-volume centers lived about a year longer than those cared for at low-volume centers, the study found. The number of women treated at high-volume centers steadily increased during the course of the 13-year study.\n\n""This trend is good news for women. Although these data don\'t tell us why more women are being treated at high-volume centers, gynecologic cancer care is becoming increasingly complicated, and doctors may feel more comfortable referring patients to high-volume centers and specialists,"" said Jeff F. Lin, MD, lead author of the study and a physician in the division of gynecologic oncology at Magee-Womens Hospital of University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""Based on this and other studies, we should be trying to steer even more patients to high-volume hospitals.""\n\nDr. Lin said there are a number of possible reasons women treated at high-volume centers live longer, including better coordination of care, better access to clinical trials that offer the most cutting-edge therapy, and greater likelihood of being treated by gynecologic oncologists, who specialize in the treatment and management of female reproductive cancers.\n\nResearchers retrieved data from the National Cancer Database (maintained by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer and American Cancer Society), identifying 863,156 female reproductive cancer patients treated at 1,666 centers. Centers providing care were divided into four quartiles, from the highest-volume centers (those that care for nearly 300 gynecologic cancer patients a year) to the lowest-volume centers (those that care for fewer than 20 patients a year). The median overall survival was 122.7 months for all gynecologic cancer patients treated in the highest-volume hospitals and 110 months for those treated in the lowest-volume hospitals, a difference of more than a year (12.7 months).\n\nThe difference was even more pronounced for certain specific cancers that are rare or require complex management. For example, the median survival was 49.4 months for ovarian cancer patients treated at the highest-volume centers vs. 32.5 months for those treated at the lowest-volume centers, a nearly 17-month difference. Median survival was 72.2 months for vaginal cancer patients treated at the highest-volume centers vs. 38.1 months for those treated at the lowest-volume centers, a difference of nearly three years (34 months).\n\nWhile the number of women treated yearly at each of the lowest-volume centers remained the same during the course of the study - about 18 per year - the number of women treated at high-volume centers steadily increased, particularly among those hospitals that treated the most patients. The average highest-volume hospital treated 188 patients a year in 1998 when the study began and 291 patients in 2011 when the study ended.\n\nHowever, elderly patients and those whose disease was more advanced were less likely to be treated at high-volume facilities. The older the patient, the less likely she would be treated at a high-volume center. For example, a 75-year-old patient was 20 percent less likely to be treated at a high-volume center than a 50-year-old patient.\n\n""These and other findings highlight areas to target for future improvement,"" said Dr. Lin.', 'The number of women treated at high-volume centers steadily increased during the course of the 13-year study.\nResearchers retrieved data from the National Cancer Database (maintained by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer and American Cancer Society), identifying 863,156 female reproductive cancer patients treated at 1,666 centers.\nCenters providing care were divided into four quartiles, from the highest-volume centers (those that care for nearly 300 gynecologic cancer patients a year) to the lowest-volume centers (those that care for fewer than 20 patients a year).\nFor example, the median survival was 49.4 months for ovarian cancer patients treated at the highest-volume centers vs. 32.5 months for those treated at the lowest-volume centers, a nearly 17-month difference.\nMedian survival was 72.2 months for vaginal cancer patients treated at the highest-volume centers vs. 38.1 months for those treated at the lowest-volume centers, a difference of nearly three years (34 months).']"

However, because this is one of the first studies to report these findings, the results need to be confirmed before hysterectomy should be routinely recommended, they note.\n\nThe study from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York focused on 525 women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who had RRSO without a hysterectomy to prevent the development of both gynecologic and breast cancers. This represented 79 percent of women undergoing risk-reducing surgery during the study period. Four of the 296 women with a BRCA1 mutation who did not have the uterus removed subsequently developed an aggressive form of uterine cancer. That translates into a 2.1 percent risk of developing an aggressive uterine cancer in the first 10 years following RRSO. This is approximately a 26-fold increased risk compared to what would be expected in the general population. Importantly, there was no increased risk found for the more common types of uterine cancer, and the increased risk of aggressive uterine cancer may have been associated with a prior history of breast cancer and/or use of tamoxifen, a breast cancer treatment.\n\nIn the study, 296 of the 525 women (56 percent) had a BRCA1 mutation, 226 (43 percent) had a BRCA2 mutation and three (.6 percent) had mutations in both genes. None of the women with a BRCA2 mutation developed uterine cancer. Researchers are continuing to study whether women with the BRCA2 mutation also are at higher risk for rare types of uterine cancer.\n\n""While the absolute risk is still relatively low, it is much higher than we would have expected for these aggressive uterine cancers,"" said Noah D. Kauff, MD, senior author of the study and director of ovarian cancer screening and prevention on the gynecology service at Memorial Sloan Kettering. ""Doctors should let their patients with BRCA1 mutations know that this report suggests they may be at risk for rare types of aggressive uterine cancer. However, whether or not a woman decides to have a hysterectomy at time of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy may depend on her age, prior cancer history and other risk factors.""\n\n\n\nWomen with a BRCA1 mutation have a 39 to 46 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer and a 50 to 85 percent chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetimes. Because of the high risk of developing those cancers, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network currently recommends that women with a BRCA1 mutation reduce their risk of developing both ovarian and breast cancer by having their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed between age 35 and 40 after childbearing is complete. The recommendation doesn\'t include removal of the uterus because there are extra risks to undergoing a hysterectomy, including higher risks of bleeding and infection, and potentially higher risks of long-term problems with bladder, bowel or sexual function. It also was believed that uterine cancers that do develop following RRSO were likely to be low risk. The new study suggests that may not be the case.', 'Four of the 296 women with a BRCA1 mutation who did not have the uterus removed subsequently developed an aggressive form of uterine cancer.\nThat translates into a 2.1 percent risk of developing an aggressive uterine cancer in the first 10 years following RRSO.\nImportantly, there was no increased risk found for the more common types of uterine cancer, and the increased risk of aggressive uterine cancer may have been associated with a prior history of breast cancer and/or use of tamoxifen, a breast cancer treatment.\nResearchers are continuing to study whether women with the BRCA2 mutation also are at higher risk for rare types of uterine cancer.\n""Doctors should let their patients with BRCA1 mutations know that this report suggests they may be at risk for rare types of aggressive uterine cancer.']"

They are based on a retrospective cohort study of 7,431,858 patients in the University HealthSystem Consortium database, which contains information from contributing academic medical centers in the United States and affiliated hospitals. Of this total, 103,797 patients had a history of bariatric surgery and 44,345 had a diagnosis of uterine malignancy.\n\nObesity is a widespread public health problem in the United States, with an estimated two-thirds of the U.S. adult population considered to be overweight or obese. The condition is strongly linked to a host of health risks, among them heart disease, diabetes and cancer, in particular endometrial cancer.\n\n""Estimating from various studies that looked at increasing BMI and endometrial cancer risk, a woman with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 would have approximately eight times greater risk of endometrial cancer than someone with a BMI of 25,"" said first author Kristy Ward, MD, the senior gynecologic oncology fellow in the Department of Reproductive Medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. ""This risk likely continues to go up as BMI goes up.""\n\nBariatric surgery is often the last resort for obese patients after all other non-surgical weight loss efforts have failed. To qualify, patients must be an acceptable surgical risk and be defined as either severely obese with a BMI of 40 or greater or have a BMI of 35 or greater with at least one related condition: diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity-related cardiomyopathy or heart muscle disease or severe joint disease.\n\nTypically, bariatric surgery involves reducing the size of the stomach using a constrictive gastric band, removing a portion of the stomach or resecting and re-routing the small intestines to a small stomach pouch. In all cases, the surgery must be followed by lifestyle changes to ensure long-term weight loss success.\n\nA number of biological mechanisms link obesity to endometrial cancer. Excessive adipose or fat tissue, for example, raises circulating levels of estrogen, which is associated with tumor creation and metastasis. Obesity also causes chronic inflammation, boosting insulin resistance and increased estrogen levels.\n\n""The majority of endometrial cancers are estrogen-driven,"" said Ward. ""In a normal menstruating woman, two hormones control the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus). Estrogen builds up the endometrium and progesterone stabilizes it. A woman with excess adipose tissue has an increased level of estrogen because the fat tissue converts steroid hormones into a form of estrogen.\n\n""So there is too much estrogen, causing the endometrium to build up, but not enough progesterone to stabilize it. The endometrium continues to grow and can undergo changes into abnormal tissue, leading to cancer.""\n\nBariatric surgery has been shown to reduce the impact of these factors: hormone levels become normal; inflammation decreases; insulin resistance drops; weight loss allows for increased physical activity and improved overall health.\n\n""The obesity epidemic is a complicated problem,"" she said. ""Further work is needed to define the role of bariatric surgery in cancer care and prevention, but we know that women with endometrial cancer are more likely to die of cardiovascular causes than they are of endometrial cancer. It\'s clear that patients who are overweight and obese should be counseled about weight loss, and referral to a bariatric program should be considered in patients who meet criteria.""', 'Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center report that bariatric surgery resulting in dramatic weight loss in formerly severely obese women reduces the risk of endometrial (uterine) cancer by 71 percent and as much as 81 percent if normal weight is maintained after surgery.\nOf this total, 103,797 patients had a history of bariatric surgery and 44,345 had a diagnosis of uterine malignancy.\nThe condition is strongly linked to a host of health risks, among them heart disease, diabetes and cancer, in particular endometrial cancer.\nBariatric surgery is often the last resort for obese patients after all other non-surgical weight loss efforts have failed.\n""Further work is needed to define the role of bariatric surgery in cancer care and prevention, but we know that women with endometrial cancer are more likely to die of cardiovascular causes than they are of endometrial cancer.']"

""And it\'s exactly what you\'d expect.\n\n""Students live in a university family, so when you have outbreaks like this it affects the larger community.""\n\nMumps is a viral infection passed through respiratory droplets. Its symptoms mimic those of influenza -- body aches, chills, fever and headaches, plus swelling of the salivary glands.\n\nThose infected are typically sick between 12 and 25 days. People are most infectious two days prior and five days after symptoms surface.\n\nIn one-third of cases, people do not develop symptoms, meaning they can pass along the virus without knowing it.\n\nThose who do exhibit symptoms are asked to cover their coughs and sneezes and isolate themselves so they don\'t infect others, Rodriguez said.\n\nMost children get mumps vaccinations when they\'re infants and get booster shots years later.\n\nThere is no cure for mumps, although physicians can treat the symptoms.\n\nOtherwise, those who are unsure if they were inoculated are encouraged to get the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella.\n\nIn 2006, the Midwest experienced a multi-state outbreak involving 6,584 people.

Of these, 41 are OSU students, staff and family members, and four are community members with OSU links. There are 18 people in Franklin County with mumps without a link to the OSU community.\n\n""These 18 cases are not linked to the university outbreak, or to each other,"" said Columbus Public Health spokesman Jose Rodriguez. ""That is what prompted us to declare a community outbreak.""\n\nMumps outbreak at Ohio State University has spread to the community.\n\nThe department is recommending that any community member who has not received full vaccination for mumps get both shots.\n\nHere\'s what you need to know about the mumps outbreak if you\'re a student, parent, or live in the Columbus area:\n\n1. Outbreaks happen.\n\nThe vaccine against mumps is effective, but it\'s not fail-safe. Two doses of the vaccine, which are usually delivered first at one year old and again at 4 to 6 years old, confer about 80 to 90 percent protection against the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPeople who have received only one dose, those who received both doses but did not mount an adequate immune response to the virus, and those who are not vaccinated serve as a sufficient population to maintain mumps outbreaks, particularly in settings where people live in close quarters, such as colleges and the military.\n\n""This is a very contagious disease, a respiratory disease that\'s spread like the cold or the flu,"" said Dr. Frank Esper, an infectious disease expert at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children\'s Hospital. ""We see substantial transmission on college campuses where you bring numerous people together from a wide geographic area in a small space.""\n\nFordham University in New York City had 13 cases in late February, according to the city\'s public health department. All of the infected students there had been vaccinated against mumps.\n\nThe last large-scale mumps outbreak was in 2009-10, when a boy traveled to the United Kingdom, where the disease is more common, and then spread the illness throughout a summer camp in New York. More than 1,500 people were eventually infected.\n\n2. Outbreaks don\'t mean the vaccine\'s useless.\n\nEven though most of the people who have mumps at Ohio State were vaccinated against the disease, it doesn\'t mean the MMR shot isn\'t working. In fact, Esper said, outbreaks like the ones at Ohio State and Fordham universities would likely be much worse if fewer people were fully vaccinated.\n\n""The reason that you\'re seeing 16 cases instead of 1,600 is because so many people are vaccinated,"" he said.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there have been sustained outbreaks of measles and repeated outbreaks of mumps because of large numbers of unvaccinated children in the population.\n\nAs the CDC explains it, it may seem like a high percentage of people who are vaccinated get the disease in the United States, but it\'s only because there are many more of these people in the population.\n\n""The fact is that vaccines provide substantive protection against contracting and spreading the virus, but nothing in life is 100 percent,"" said Esper.\n\n3. Watch out for symptoms.\n\nFortunately, most people with mumps recover completely after a few weeks. The most common symptoms are similar to those of the flu: high fever, aches and fatigue. The virus can also cause a tell-tale swelling of the parotid glands in the jaw, called parotitis, which can be painful and make swallowing and eating difficult.\n\n""The vast majority of people don\'t have anything more than a mild illness,"" Esper said.\n\nRare complications can include hearing loss, inflammation of the testes or ovaries, or inflammation of the lining of the brain. Death is extremely rare. In the 2009-10 outbreak, there were no deaths among the more than 1,500 infections.\n\nIf you do feel sick or notice symptoms, call your doctor right away, said Rodriguez. It\'s important that the disease be evaluated and reported, he said.\n\nIt\'s also possible that swelling of the jaw can become bad enough to make eating and drinking impossible, making IV fluids necessary, Esper said.\n\n4. Stay at home if you\'re sick.\n\nThe best thing you can do to help prevent the spread of the disease is to stay home and stay away from other people. Officials are recommending you stay home for at least five days after symptoms appear to avoid infecting others.\n\n""That\'s critical in a highly contagious disease like mumps that\'s transmitted like the flu,"" Rodriguez said. ""Isolation comes fairly easy when you\'re very sick.""\n\nRodriguez and Esper also recommend basic hand hygiene and cold and flu etiquette -- washing hands frequently, using hand sanitizer, covering coughs with the elbow -- to cut down on the spread of the virus.\n\n5. Get vaccinated.\n\nColumbus Public Health is recommending that community members who have not received the MMR shot, or who have only received one dose, get fully vaccinated.\n\n“During a community outbreak, protection against mumps is critical to our good health, our family’s health, and our community’s health,” said Dr. Teresa C. Long, Columbus Public Health Commissioner in a news release. “Mumps can lead to serious complications in people who are not vaccinated, especially adults.

This request means that affected students will be unable to attend school, perhaps for several days.\n\n“If you have such students in your classes, I ask that you offer them all reasonable accommodation to make up any quizzes or exams, labs, class activities, or other work they’ve missed while sparing their classmates from possible infection.”\n\nSome OSU students said they’re hoping everyone gets vaccinated.\n\n“I’m up to date on all my vaccinations and I make sure I stay on top of that so that’s, I rely on that to protect me. It is kind of scary though if you got a lot of people who aren’t vaccinated,” said Thomas Tekieli, a fourth-year in biology. “One of the things we learn about in microbiology is a lot of people who don’t have vaccinations, they can kind of decrease something you call crowd immunity, which is if you got a lot of people who are vaccinated, the virus can’t really be in the community too much, but if you got people who aren’t vaccinated, it can travel through them. And even people who are vaccinated, if they get a high dose, they can be affected by it.”\n\nTekieli said, though, he thinks the outbreaks provides a valuable learning opportunity.\n\n“I would say this should be a time to really drive public education about vaccines. There’s a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of fears,” he said.\n\nKelsey Ryan, a second-year in neuroscience, said she’s been worried about catching the mumps because she knows someone who has caught it.\n\n“I’m a little paranoid. Every time I start to feel sick, I think I’m getting the mumps,” she said. “There was a case in the research lab I work in, one of the researchers has it, so I’m a little leery about that.”\n\nRyan works in a lab in the Psychology Building.\n\n“(The woman who has mumps works) in the lab next to mine but I think she’s staying away,” she said. “I got an email today about, you know, ‘If you feel sick don’t come into the lab. We don’t want to spread the mumps any more than it already is.’”', 'The mumps outbreak has spread beyond Ohio State.\nNow at 63 cases, the outbreak has been declared “community-wide,” according to releases from Columbus Public Health.\nThere are 36 OSU students, four OSU staff members, one family member and four people with OSU community links who have the mumps.\nDr. Teresa Long, Columbus Public Health commissioner, said in a released statement that preventative measures are highly recommended.\n“During a community outbreak, protection against mumps is critical to our good health, our family’s health and our community’s health,” Long said.']"

Less than a year ago, David was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but he considered himself one of the lucky ones after recently being given a clean bill of health. David will share his amazing cancer story during the relay’s opening ceremony on Saturday morning before hosting the event for the fourth time. He said when he hosted the first relay at the Milton Showground, he was “blown away” by the brave cancer patients and survivors who took to the stage and told of their journeys. This year, it will be David spreading a message of hope and stressing the importance of early detection. During his annual health check in June last year, the 69-year-old was told he had prostate cancer. “It was only in its early stages, so it could be treated without surgery,” he said. “In September I had brachytherapy which involved the insertion of radiotherapy pellets into the prostate to kill the tumour from the inside. “I had a check-up about a month ago and the doctors were happy that the treatment had worked and the cancer was pretty much eradicated.” David said it would have been “a completely different story” if he had gone another year without a prostate exam. “I’m a very lucky cancer person really,” he said. David said when he agreed to become involved with the inaugural Relay for Life in 2011, he didn’t know what to expect or how the community would respond to the event. “I don’t think any of us knew how amazing it would be,” he said. During that first event he and many others were overcome with emotion and were moved to tears by the community’s passion. “Everyone was there for the same reason, with the same goal,” he said. “I was blown away by the stories that came out of that first event. “People made friends and felt they were not alone on their cancer journey. “It’s was the biggest community bonding experience I have ever witnessed in our area.” Now in its fourth year, David is expecting this weekend’s relay to once again “bring out the best in people”, and he is encouraging everyone to go along – even for a short time. “It’s something every person in our community should attend and experience,” he added. “It’s one of those things that you need to be a part of to understand. “I’m very proud to have been involved for the past four years.” Along with prevention and looking after yourself, David said talking to people and remaining positive was crucial for cancer patients. “People sometimes bottle things up and keep living their lives determined not to let the cancer take over. “I think it is important to talk about it and to share stories with others in a similar situation. “It’s a really weird world that you enter as soon as you find out you have cancer, but there’s so much help and support out there – it’s incredible.” The Relay for Life brings people together for one cause and raises funds for cancer research and community programs. David commended the committee that worked to get the event off the ground each year. “I take my hat off to the small but totally dedicated committee of passionate women led by Caz Boland,” he added. David will be joined by Sean Hendry as joint MC of the event that will kick off at 9.15am on Saturday and continue until 10am on Sunday.\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/storypad-FTM5aUYXcawf9UUg7jTZ5s/b20b9052-d5a9-41c4-85cd-6cc448376296.JPG/r4_0_1597_900_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg', 'news, local-newsDAVID Johnson will bring one key message to this year’s Relay for Life – early detection.\nLess than a year ago, David was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but he considered himself one of the lucky ones after recently being given a clean bill of health.\nDavid will share his amazing cancer story during the relay’s opening ceremony on Saturday morning before hosting the event for the fourth time.\nThis year, it will be David spreading a message of hope and stressing the importance of early detection.\nDuring his annual health check in June last year, the 69-year-old was told he had prostate cancer.']"

The relay has once again captured the hearts of the Milton-Ulladulla community, with more than 500 people set to take part in the 24-hour cancer council fundraiser – rain, hail or shine. Local youngsters have recognised how cancer does not discriminate young from old and many have joined teams or formed fundraising groups of their own. Captain of the Superheroes team, 16-year-old Tenayah Harris is taking part for the third year, and said the Relay for Life was something young people could get involved in to help their community. “It’s a chance to have fun and feel that you are raising money and helping people,” she said. “There’s lots of things for kids to do, like the disco, Zumba and yoga, plus you can have pizza for dinner. “Cancer affects everyone and it’s good to be able to do something, no matter how young you are.” Tenayah will be in disguise as Batman, while her friends will dress as Superwoman, Spiderman and even Magnificent Man as they take to the track. In the lead up to the event, the team will also host a superhero fundraising disco at Ulladulla High School tomorrow night (Thursday). Relay coordinator Caz Boland said it was great to see teenagers and people as young as four or five embracing the event. “It’s fantastic, the kids are really getting into the spirit of the relay,” she added. The relay will start with the opening ceremony at 9.15am on Saturday when participants will share stories of their cancer journeys and also visions of hope. Survivors and carers will be invited to take part in the opening lap of honour at 10am before being joined by members of more than 40 teams for the relay that will continue until 10am on Sunday. Caz said enthusiasm for the Milton-Ulladulla Relay for Life has not faded, despite being in its fourth year. “If anything, I think people are more enthusiastic than ever this year,” she said. “I was concerned that maybe people would start to get a bit over it, but the whole community continues to pull together every year.” Caz expects the community to once again surpass the relay target of $90,000, with almost $45,000 already in the bank. “We don’t have has many teams this year, but we have more individual participants that are already doing so much to bring the money in,” she said. “I am confident we can beat last year’s total of $132,000.” Anyone not in a team can still register online or at the registration tent during the event. Throughout the relay there will be a host of entertainment and activities for participants and the general public in the show arena and on the stage. Team members can take part in belly dancing or yoga classes, visit the craft tent, enjoy a massage or dance the night away at the silent disco. The Tribal Funk Orchestra will have relayers bouncing around the track, while the Glorious MUDsingers choir and Chook on a Hot Tin Roof ukulele group will bring unique sounds for the first time this year. A host of local acts will also hit the stage including Milton idol winner Chloe Dadd and runner up Jase Grant. Throughout the event there will be a charity auction, raffles, stalls, dance displays and the highly anticipated Miss Relay Pageant for the brave men. Caz said a highlight of the relay was the moving candlelight ceremony held at dusk on Saturday night. “The relay virtually stops and the lights are turned off while participants remember the loved ones or friends they have lost to cancer,” she said. “It’s such an emotional time.” The theme for this year’s relay is “H for Hope” and teams are encouraged to dress-up and decorate their camp sites accordingly. Caz said there would be a series of prizes and awards presented during the closing ceremony on Sunday morning, including the best dressed team, highest fundraisers and the most laps completed. She has invited people to get involved, take part and do their bit to fight back against cancer. Even if it is raining, relayers will don gum boots, raincoats and umbrellas and slosh their way around the track. “Cancer doesn’t stop when it rains, so we won’t be stopping either,” she said.\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/storypad-FTM5aUYXcawf9UUg7jTZ5s/697708b9-a7ab-4569-9adb-5867b692ccfa.jpg/r4_0_1597_900_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg', 'news, local-newsHEROES, head-bangers and hipsters will hit the track during this weekend’s “H for Hope” themed Relay for Life at the Milton showground.\nIn the lead up to the event, the team will also host a superhero fundraising disco at Ulladulla High School tomorrow night (Thursday).\nRelay coordinator Caz Boland said it was great to see teenagers and people as young as four or five embracing the event.\nCaz said enthusiasm for the Milton-Ulladulla Relay for Life has not faded, despite being in its fourth year.\nCaz said a highlight of the relay was the moving candlelight ceremony held at dusk on Saturday night.']"

Researchers found that just over three percent of death certificates registered between 1999 and 2009 attributed the deaths to alcohol- related crashes, whereas data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notes that around 21 percent of traffic deaths occurred in people over the legal limit to drive. However, it should be noted that not all traffic accident victims who die as a result of their injuries are subject to the blood testing - the number caps at around 70 percent.\n\nThe numbers are particularly crucial as injuries are the leading cause of death among people under the age of 45. Of these injuries, traffic accidents are arguably the best document, and thus easiest from which data can be extracted.\n\n""Alcohol misuse is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, it accounts for 89,000 deaths annually and of those, 49,500 are acute causes - they are injuries or poisonings,"" said the study\'s lead author Ralph Hingson to FoxNews.com.

They identified and reviewed 291 studies and literature from the last 43 years. Of those, 115 made the cut; most were short, lasting between six and 15 weeks.\n\n""This is the first-ever review, evidence-based recommendation, on the treatment of MS with CAM therapies,"" says Dr. Vijayshree Yadav, lead author and clinical director of Oregon Health and Science University\'s Multiple Sclerosis Center. ""There were 29 different therapies included in the guidelines. Nineteen studies looked at cannabis.""\n\nThe new guidelines will help clinicians determine if CAM therapies help reduce specific symptoms and prevent relapse or further disability; make the disease worse or cause serious side effects; or interfere with other MS therapies.\n\n""It looks like there is little evidence for the effectiveness of most CAM therapies to treat MS,""Yadav said. ""For most CAM therapies safety is unknown. We also did not find evidence to show (whether) the therapies interact with prescription MS drugs.""\n\nBecause so many people are using CAM therapies, more research is still needed, Yadav said.\n\nMultiple sclerosis damages the myelin coating around the nerve fibers in the central nervous system, according to the National MS Society, which in turn interferes with the transmission of nerve signals between the brain, spinal cord and the rest of the body.\n\nWomen are more often diagnosed than men, and symptoms generally appear between 20 and 50 years of age. The cause is unknown and there is no cure. But a number of treatments can slow the progression and help manage the often debilitating symptoms.\n\nAccording to the MS Foundation, symptoms typically include fatigue, spasticity (stiffness and involuntary muscle spasms most often in the legs), weakness, balance problems, numbness, vision loss, bladder and bowel issues, tremors and depression. Symptoms are varied, unpredictable, and no patient gets all of them. Most patients go through episodes or attacks and remissions. Sometimes the damage is permanent.\n\nThe researchers found certain forms of medical marijuana - oral cannabis extract and synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (or THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana ) could help reduce spasticity and pain for up to a year, but were ineffective against tremors. They also found Sativex, an oral cannabinoid spray, helps reduce stiffness and frequent urination but not MS-related tremors. Sativex, currently available in 25 countries to help treat MS, is not sold in the United States.\n\nA few other alternative treatments also showed some benefits.\n\n""For example, ginkgo biloba is used by many patients. The study did not find effectiveness for cognition, but possibly effective for fatigue."" Yadav said. ""Similarly, magnetic therapy is probably effective for fatigue but probably ineffective for depression. Reflexology showed some evidence that it might help lessen paresthesia (tingling or numbness or unusual skin sensations).""\n\nBoth fish oil and bee sting therapy were also found to be ineffective for MS-related relapses, neurologic disability, fatigue, MRI lesions (MS-related lesions on the brain or spinal cord) and quality of life, according to Yadav.\n\nStill researchers warn most CAM therapies are not FDA regulated, leading to concerns about using CAM and in particular cannabis, which can cause side effects that mirror the diseases\' symptoms like dizziness, thinking and memory problems.\n\nDr. Robert Fox, a neurologist and MS expert at the Cleveland Clinic, called the guidelines ""a very important step forward,"" but echoed those concerns.\n\n""There are important safety concerns with cannabinoid therapy including marijuana. These include cognitive side effects and mood disruptions, such as depression,"" he noted. ""Marijuana remains illegal in many states ...\n\nclinicians cannot recommend marijuana in states where it is still illegal.""\n\nAccording to Fox, up to 80% of people with MS use CAM treatments.\n\n""Patients will often seek CAM therapies for their disease,”says Fox. ""That makes it difficult for clinicians to always understand the potential benefits and side effects of the various therapies. These guidelines assimilate a large number of CAM therapies into a single source for clinicians by having a guideline for many CAM therapies all in one place so clinicians are better armed to counsel their patients.""', 'Medical marijuana might be the most effective complementary or alternative medicine to provide relief of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) according to new guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) released Monday.\nThe new guidelines will help clinicians determine if CAM therapies help reduce specific symptoms and prevent relapse or further disability; make the disease worse or cause serious side effects; or interfere with other MS therapies.\n""It looks like there is little evidence for the effectiveness of most CAM therapies to treat MS,""Yadav said.\nBecause so many people are using CAM therapies, more research is still needed, Yadav said.\n""Marijuana remains illegal in many states ...clinicians cannot recommend marijuana in states where it is still illegal.""']"

These are unconventional therapies used alongside or instead of doctor-recommended therapies.\n\nMedical News Today recently wrote a spotlight feature focusing on symptoms and treatments for the condition to coincide with National Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Month in March.\n\nIn that feature, Arney Rosenblat, associate vice president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told us that though there are currently 10 disease-modifying therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MS, ""there is deep unmet need for additional therapies, especially to treat progressive forms of disease for which there are few treatment options.""\n\nMarijuana treatment eases spasticity and pain\n\nResearchers from the current study, led by Dr. Vijayshree Yadav of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, focused on what impacts certain CAM therapies have on MS, including oral cannabis, medical marijuana pills, oral medical marijuana spray, ginkgo biloba, magnetic therapy, bee sting therapy, omega-3 fatty acids and reflexology.\n\nShare on Pinterest Medical marijuana taken in pill or oral spray form may ease symptoms of spasticity, pain and frequent urination in patients with MS, according to the new guideline.\n\nRegarding prevalence of CAM therapy use, Dr. Yadav says:\n\n""Using different CAM therapies is common in 33-80% of people with MS, particularly those who are female, have higher education levels and report poorer health. People with MS should let their doctors know what types of these therapies they are taking, or thinking about taking.""\n\nThe researchers note that for most of these CAM therapies, safety is not known, as there is not enough information to show whether they interact with prescription drugs for MS.\n\nHowever, while the latest guidelines show little evidence most CAM therapies can treat symptoms, medical marijuana pills and oral medical marijuana spray may alleviate symptoms of spasticity, pain and frequent urination in MS patients.\n\nBut before patients with the condition rush to medical marijuana dispensaries, the researchers say there is not enough evidence to show whether actually smoking marijuana helps treat symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, this therapy may not reduce tremor, and the team cautions that long-term safety of using medical marijuana in pill or oral spray form is unknown.\n\nSide effects of marijuana treatment \'should be considered\'\n\nAs with most treatments or therapies, the researchers say marijuana in a pill or spray could cause certain side effects. The more serious ones include seizures, dizziness, thinking and memory problems, and psychological problems, such as depression.\n\nFast facts about MS Most people experience first MS symptoms between the ages of 20 and 40.\n\nInitial symptoms are often blurred or double vision, red-green color distortion or blindness in one eye.\n\nMost MS patients have muscle weakness and difficulty with balance and coordination.\n\nThe last side effect raises concerns, as some people with MS have an increased risk for depression or suicide.

However, few guidelines exist to help patients determine the effectiveness of these therapies, according to study author Dr. Pushpa Narayanaswami.\n\n“We wanted to review the literature well and see where we went with it, to guide patients and physicians as well,” Narayanaswami, an assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, told FoxNews.com. “There’s nothing out there that looks at all of these to see how effective and safe they are.”\n\nThe researchers examined a wide array of CAM therapies, drawing from a list created by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a subsidy of the National Institutes of Health. In addition to medical marijuana, the researchers also studied other remedies including ginkgo biloba, magnetic therapy, bee sting therapy, omega-3 fatty acids and reflexology.\n\nIn a review of 2,608 studies, the researchers were able to assess which forms of CAM therapies had sufficient evidence to indicate that they may be effective for patients with MS. Overall, researchers discovered that certain forms of medical marijuana – a spray form and a pill form – appeared to have the most evidence indicating they may be helpful in patients with MS.\n\n“What we learned are these specific forms of medical marijuana can ease patients’ symptoms – specific symptoms of spasticity, or muscle stiffness … and helped with frequent urination,” Narayanaswami said.\n\nWhile medical marijuana provided relief for some symptoms, it did not alleviate other effects of MS, including tremors or urinary incontinence. Medical marijuana also carried some negative side effects, including dizziness, drowsiness, being off balance and cognitive problems in some people, researchers noted.\n\nWhile spray forms of medical marijuana are only available in Europe and Canada, some pill forms of medical marijuana have been approved in the U.S. to treat nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy.\n\nAmong other therapies tested, some were more effective than others.\n\n“Gingko biloba, an herb that lots of people use for memory, actually ended up having good studies that suggested it doesn’t really help thinking or memory problems in the patient population,” Narayanaswami said. “But there was a low level of evidence suggesting it may help reduce tiredness or fatigue.”\n\nMagnet therapy, in which people wear magnets on the body to relieve pain, also showed low levels of effectiveness at reducing tiredness or fatigue. And reflexology, a type of massage, showed some effectiveness at easing symptoms of tingling, or ‘pins and needles’ sensations common among people with MS.\n\nHowever, a low-fat diet high in omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil proved less effective for patients with MS.\n\n“There’s been some question whether a low-fat diet with fish oil can help MS patients and we found that it does not help,” Narayanaswami said. “It may be okay for general health, but it doesn’t help with disability or symptoms of MS.”\n\nThe researchers also found bee sting therapy, in which people voluntarily subject themselves to bee stings to relieve MS-related pain, was ineffective.\n\nResearchers advised that patients considering alternative therapies should be sure to consult their doctors – even when using therapies that have shown strong evidence for effectiveness.\n\n“I think one of the key messages is there’s little evidence that most therapies work. We don’t have good information on if they interact with prescription MS drugs, we don’t have good information about safety, so patients should talk to their doctors if they are using them,” Narayanaswami said. “It’s also important to note that the FDA doesn't regulate most of these therapies, so patients don’t really know they are getting.”"", 'Some forms of medical marijuana may help alleviate certain symptoms in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), according to new guidelines published in the journal Neurology.\nIn addition to medical marijuana, the researchers also studied other remedies including ginkgo biloba, magnetic therapy, bee sting therapy, omega-3 fatty acids and reflexology.\nWhile medical marijuana provided relief for some symptoms, it did not alleviate other effects of MS, including tremors or urinary incontinence.\nMedical marijuana also carried some negative side effects, including dizziness, drowsiness, being off balance and cognitive problems in some people, researchers noted.\nWhile spray forms of medical marijuana are only available in Europe and Canada, some pill forms of medical marijuana have been approved in the U.S. to treat nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy.']"

The disorder becomes visible between 20 and 40 years old but can be observed at any age. MS attacks when nerve damage occurs because of inflammation on the brain area, optic nerve, and spinal cord. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the attack but common signs include muscle spasms, problems walking, frequent need to urinate, double vision, eye discomfort, hearing loss, and fatigue.\n\nIn this study, the researchers from the Oregon Health and Science University\'s MS Center found that man-made marijuana pills, known as dronabinol and nabilone, and spray are effective in reducing spasms and pain brought by MS.\n\nThey reviewed more than four decades of research on alternative medicine treatments for MS including use of marijuana, which are known to have severe side effects like seizures, dizziness, depression, and memory problems. They studied the use of tetrahydrocannabinol and oral cannabis extract (marijuana pill), and Sativex oromucosal cannabinoid spray (marijuana spray).\n\nThey found that the benefits of taking marijuana pills and spray outweigh the side effects of it. They suggest that it can also be prescribed to MS patients as an ""off-label"" use but under a medical practitioner\'s discretion.\n\nThey also found that an average of 56.5 percent MS patients, which were women, use different alternative therapies to treat their symptoms.

There is significant unmet need for therapies that can address complex and painful symptoms often experienced by people with MS.”\n\nYadav and her colleagues wrote that there was “inadequate” data to determine whether smoked marijuana was safe or effective in treating symptoms of pain and spasticity in MS patients.\n\nAbrams, who has researched marijuana’s effects on pain, said the reason for this lack of data had to do with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA.\n\n“The NIDA is the only source of cannabis for research,” Abrams said. “NIDA has a mandate from the federal government to only study substances of abuse as substances of abuse.”\n\nThat view was echoed by Dr. David Bearman, the executive vice president for the Academy of Cannabinoid Medicine/Society of Cannabis Clinicians, who was not involved in the guideline study.\n\n“Part of the problem in the United States is that the NIDA has blocked almost all meaningful studies on cannabis,” Bearman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBearman argues that while synthetic cannabis pills do offer pain relief, marijuana is cheaper, has fewer side effects and can be more effective.\n\nHe said the MS guidelines appeared to be part of a trend in the last couple years in which mainstream medicine has begun to look at cannabis as it would any other therapeutic agent.\n\n“Hopefully we’ll see more of this in the future,” Bearman said. “I congratulate them on ignoring 100 years of propaganda.”\n\nYadav said she expected that doctors would be very cautious in considering the use of cannabis for their MS patients, due to legal issues and potential adverse side effects.\n\n“Because cannabinoids have known psychoactive properties, their potential for psychopathologic and neurocognitive adverse effects is a concern,” Yadav and her colleagues wrote. “Depression and predisposal to psychosis have been reported with long-term cannabis exposure.”', 'Patient surveys suggest that up to 80% of MS patients employ some form of alternative treatment, including the smoking of “street” marijuana.\nSpasticity, and pain from spasticity were very common symptoms in MS, he said.\n“Currently 20 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes ...\n“Part of the problem in the United States is that the NIDA has blocked almost all meaningful studies on cannabis,” Bearman said.\nAdvertisementBearman argues that while synthetic cannabis pills do offer pain relief, marijuana is cheaper, has fewer side effects and can be more effective.']"

Print.\n\nMILLERSVILLE, Md. – Anne Arundel County has seen an big increase in heroin use and overdoses.\n\n“So far this year, in this calendar year, we’ve had 85 heroin overdoses, 12 of them have been fatal,” says County Executive Laura Neuman.\n\nWhile the fight continues to get the drug off the streets, the county hopes equipping police with a lifesaving medicine will save the lives of overdose victims.\n\n“On those occasions where we respond first to one of these calls for service, for an overdose, we don’t want to be in a position where we’re literally watching someone die,” says Anne Arundel County Police Chief Kevin Davis.\n\nStarting this week, Narcan training will begin for the close to 700 officers that make up the county’s police force. Each officer will be given a kit with the drug, also known as Naloxone, which can counter the effects of an overdose due to heroin or prescription medications.\n\nThe plan to purchase the nasal spray version of Narcan began coming together when Davis met with the Fire Chief Michael Cox to discuss the rise in overdoses in the county. “We decided that the best way to tackle this is to arm and outfit our police officers with Narcan,” Davis said.\n\nTaking this step, Davis hopes they will also help reduce the amount of crime in the county. “We think fewer people who are eventually addicted to this nasty drug will ultimately bode well for the crime fighting picture in Anne Arundel County,” he says. The police department found that a majority of criminals who break into cars and steal property, such as precious metals, have an addiction problem.\n\nThe chief was quick to point out that a heroin problem doesn’t discriminate by socioeconomic status.\n\n“The middle class, the upper middle class, folks who live on $1.5 million houses on three acres. It impacts certainly everyone,” he says.\n\nMelissa Eppinger is the owner of a successful salon and spa in the county, but living comfortably didn’t protect her family from the struggles heroin use can bring. “Nothing prepared me to face the absolute heart break of having [crying] my own son struggle with addiction,” Eppinger says.\n\nHer 22-year-old son is in his eighth drug recovery program.\n\n“Almost expecting to get a call that your child has died is not a feeling that can be explained to anyone not going through it,” Eppinger says.\n\nShe says it was paramedics, with Narcan that saved her son one night when she found him suffering from an overdose. “I had found him after he had snuck out one evening, he was on the floor in-and-out of semi consciousness, his lips were blue,” she said.\n\nShe called 911 and within minutes paramedics where on scene with Narcan in hand. “He was given Narcan in the ambulance, and again at the hospital. Providing Narcan and training for the officer will save lives,” Eppinger said.\n\nNeuman, the county executive, says she has talked to three families who had lost loved ones to heroin overdoses. “This should be a wakeup call for all us, not just in Anne Arundel County, but in Maryland and across this country,” she said. “It gives us the opportunity to have an immediate impact when someone has overdosed from heroin.”\n\nRoy Myers is the medical director for the Anne Arundel fire department, he says administration of Narcan is easy to teach, plus “The side effects of Narcan are basically minimal, if the diagnosis is incorrect; it is not going to do any harm. ”\n\nA handful of police department around the nation have begun giving officers Narcan kits. “As far as I know, we are the only agency in Maryland and the largest in the country,” says Sgt.Dan Sereboff who will lead the training of officers.

Many of the overdoses occurred at shopping centers and malls.\n\nSeveral weeks ago the U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called on police and EMT's around the country to carry the drug to help curb the problem with deaths from heroin overdoses.\n\nOfficers are being trained now on how to give the nasal spray.\n\nCLICK HERE TO WATCH WBAL-TV'S REPORT.\n\nRead more from Anne Arundel County Police.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013, the Anne Arundel County Police Department began to observe a noticeable rise in heroin overdoses in the Southern portion of Anne County in areas such as Annapolis, Parole, and Edgewater. Through intelligence gathering, it was determined that the majority of the overdoses were occurring in public places such as malls and shopping centers and many of the people purchasing and using the heroin were traveling from other counties into Anne Arundel County. After obtaining this information and sensing the potential huge public safety and health issue, Anne Arundel County Police Chief Kevin Davis directed members of his Command Staff to put together a plan with a focus on targeting heroin dealers who travel to the area to purchase and/or sell heroin, potentially increasing the risk of overdoses in the County along with providing users with education and avenues for treatment. As a result, “Operation H.O.P.E. (Heroin Overdose Prevention and Eradication) was created.\n\nBased on observations and information obtained regarding heroin trafficking, members of the Anne Arundel County Police Department began working closely with other federal, state and local partners to identify, disrupt and target the operations of heroin dealers in Anne Arundel County while conducting interviews and gathering intelligence to ultimately make criminal arrests when probable cause existed.

Members of the Anne Arundel County Police Department are currently being trained by members of the Anne Arundel County Fire Department on how to use “Narcan”. “Narcan”, which police officers will administer through a nasal spray that they will be issued, has been successful in treating overdoses of heroin and other opiates by EMS providers for years. The drug reverses the effects of an overdose. During an opiate overdose, a patient may suffer a disruption in normal breathing. In some cases, breathing may stop altogether, quickly leading to death.\n\nDuring training, every patrol officer in the agency will receive a dose of naloxone. In Anne Arundel County alone so far in 2014, 85(*) people have suffered heroin overdoses. Of those overdoses, 12(*) were fatal. The Police Department has continued to combat the two most prevalent crimes in Anne Arundel County: theft from automobiles and theft of precious metals. The common denominator in these types of crimes is suspects addicted to the drug heroin. During the last several months, officers in several districts have made arrests during Operation H.O.P.E. resulting in seizures of suspected heroin.\n\n“The heroin problem that exists is not isolated to Anne Arundel County, and this is not an issue that law enforcement can arrest their way out of,” said Anne Arundel County Police Chief Kevin Davis. “A holistic approach, involving education, treatment and enforcement is needed to tackle this disease.

Gilead received a letter from the Congress’ Committee on Energy and Commerce raising concerns about the pricing of the drug.\n\n\n\nSovaldi was approved in December last year, as a combination therapy for treating patients suffering from HCV. The drug was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in the U.S. Gilead priced its potential blockbuster drug at $84,000 per treatment, which as per the U.S. lawmaker is beyond the affordability of most patients even with public or private insurance cover.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the lawmakers are concerned that if the drug is prescribed with other treatments, the cost will go up even further. Considering the fact that the prevalence of hepatitis C is higher in low-income and minority patients, the pricing policy from Gilead has come under severe criticism.\n\n\n\nThe letter has raised several questions including the methodology used by Gilead for the drug’s pricing and the extent to which the company is providing discounts to lower-income patients. Gilead has time until Apr 3, 2014, to respond to the questions raised in the letter.\n\n\n\nSovaldi’s approval was a milestone event for Gilead. The drug is expected to not only boost the company’s top line significantly but also to strengthen its position in the lucrative HCV market. Most importantly, with the approval of Sovaldi, the duration of therapy for HCV patients comes down to a minimum of 12 weeks as opposed to the current standard of care treatment of up to 48 weeks. As per Centers for Disease Control, around 3.2 million people are suffering from HCV in the U.S.\n\n\n\nSovaldi is off to a strong start and recorded sales of $136.4 million in its first few days in the market in the fourth quarter of 2013. We believe the drug has multi-billion dollar sales potential. At present, investor focus will remain on Gilead’s response to the questions raised in the letter.

Rep. Henry Waxman and several Democratic colleagues in Congress wrote Gilead CEO John Martin an excoriating letter on Friday, demanding to know why the drug costs so much--and whether Gilead ($GILD) is doing anything to make sure that poor patients get access to it.\n\n""The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,"" the letter stated. Not to mention taxpayers--the bulk of hepatitis C sufferers are either low-income patients on Medicaid, veterans treated by the Veterans Administration, or prisoners, whose care is government-financed.\n\nBy itself, the letter might not amount to much. As Reuters points out, the signatories are minority-party types in the House of Representatives. Some industry analysts figure the protestations are a lot of talk that will lead to little action. The facts are these: The FDA has no power over pricing. Attempts to grant Medicare negotiating power have fallen flat. And Gilead is a veteran of the pricing protest, experienced at soldiering forward in spite of the flak.\n\nBut the letter isn\'t on its own. It\'s just the latest salvo against hepatitis C drug prices, from public officials, healthcare experts, patient advocates and--most importantly--payers. Pharmacy benefits managers, including Express Scripts ($ESRX), have said they\'re planning to apply cost-effectiveness measures to hep C treatments and even exclude some of the new meds. A California cost-effectiveness board called Sovaldi a ""low value"" treatment because of its high price and suggested that it be restricted to the sickest patients.\n\nMeanwhile, some state Medicaid plans even say they\'ll hold off on the expensive drugs till patients have already suffered liver damage. That\'s a pledge that only makes logical sense as a negotiating ploy but illustrates the desperation of cash-strapped payers faced with broad use of an ultraexpensive drug.\n\nThe latest payer news came Friday from WellPoint, which said the new round of treatments, which includes Sovaldi, may be supereffective, but they\'re too superexpensive. WellPoint\'s commercial business is working with regulators and drugmakers to get prices down to a ""reasonable"" level, Reuters reports. And on the Medicaid side, the company is working with states to determine whether to exclude Sovaldi from its Medicaid managed care plans altogether.\n\nGilead figures that Sovaldi is a breakthrough cure and well worth the price. Preventing liver-disease complications will save the healthcare system money, EVP Gregg Alton told the NYT. ""We think the price is fair,"" Alton said.\n\nBut one problem is that hepatitis C affects millions of patients. Very expensive cancer drugs, on the other hand, are targeted at far fewer people. ""The worry is that the volume is just going to overwhelm the system,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Robin Karnauskas said (as quoted by The New York Times). ""What is really scaring folks is the volume,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted last week (as quoted by Reuters). Schoenebaum himself figures this year\'s Sovaldi sales will mount to at least $7 billion and perhaps as high as $12 billion. Those stratospheric numbers beg the question of how much is enough--or too much.\n\nAs the NYT points out, some people with hep C would never experience serious liver complications even if untreated. The nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review studied the issue and determined that treating all patients with Sovaldi rather than older drugs wouldn\'t save any money even over 20 years. Restricting treatment to those with more advanced liver scarring would, however, save money over a couple of decades, the institute found.\n\nSeveral analysts suggested that prices might come down once rival drugs from AbbVie ($ABBV), Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY) and others hit the market. Payers certainly hope to use the competitive threat as leverage to push prices down. Whatever happens, larger questions remain: What responsibility do drugmakers bear for their pricing in a ""rich"" country like the U.S.? Should Gilead (and its forthcoming competitors) consider the size of the market--and the burden on taxpayers and other payers--when setting prices? And can the ""rich"" U.S. afford to eschew the sort of price-negotiation that other countries routinely engage in?\n\n- see the Reuters news\n\n- get more from the NYT', ""The outcry about Gilead Sciences' $84,000 price for its hepatitis C wonder drug, Sovaldi, just got louder.\nNot to mention taxpayers--the bulk of hepatitis C sufferers are either low-income patients on Medicaid, veterans treated by the Veterans Administration, or prisoners, whose care is government-financed.\nIt's just the latest salvo against hepatitis C drug prices, from public officials, healthcare experts, patient advocates and--most importantly--payers.\nBut one problem is that hepatitis C affects millions of patients.\nAs the NYT points out, some people with hep C would never experience serious liver complications even if untreated.""]"

Prechter Bipolar Researcher Fund transformed skin cells from people with bipolar disorder into neurons that mimicked those found in their brains. They were then able to compare these nerve stem cells with cells derived from people without bipolar disorder – and study how the neurons responded to medications for the condition.\n\nDetailed in the journal Translational Psychiatry, this study marks the first time researchers have derived a stem cell line specific to bipolar disorder.\n\n“Once we have derived nerve cells, we’re able to study those cells and determine how they behave compared to other cells and how they behave in response to medications,” principal investigator Dr. Melvin McInnis, of the Prechter Bipolar Research Fund, told FoxNews.com. “So if we can understand the basic biological problems with these cells, we can potentially identify interventions that further how we understand the illness and how we treat it.”\n\nAlso known as manic-depressive illness, bipolar disorder is a brain condition characterized by intense shifts in mood – alternating between periods of high energy and mania to periods of severe anxiety and depression. While the condition is known to run in families, scientists still aren’t fully certain what causes its development, believing it to be a combination of genetics and other factors.\n\nAdditionally, the most common form of treatment for the disorder, lithium, is also somewhat of a mystery.\n\n“We really do not know and understand what drives these fluctuations in moods; we don’t understand how the medications truly work that help individuals with variability in their moods,” McInnis said. “We don’t know why an individual will become ill at a particular time. All we know is really at an observational level.”\n\nIn order to better understand what is happening in the bipolar mind, McInnis and his team took small samples of skin from individuals who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. These samples were then exposed to specific growth factors, which coaxed the cells into becoming induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) – meaning they had the ability to turn into any type of cell. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to an additional set of growth factors, which coaxed them into becoming neurons.\n\nThis process has also been used to better understand other complex brain disorders, such as schizophrenia and conditions that cause seizures. According to McInnis, the technique allows researchers to examine how cells behave as they develop into a whole new type of cell, as well as how they function when they finally become neurons.\n\n“It becomes a nerve cell and takes on all the properties of nerve cells and they start to interact with each other in the way nerve cells are want to do – such as sending nerve impulses,” McInnis said. “And it’s that behavior we’re able to monitor and measure.”\n\nThe researchers first examined gene expression in the stem cells, noticing very specific differences in the bipolar cells as they developed into neurons. Specifically, the bipolar stem cells expressed more genes for membrane receptors and ion channels compared to the non-bipolar stem cells. This suggests that genetic differences expressed during early brain development may contribute to the onset of bipolar symptoms.\n\nAdditionally, the nerve stem cells from bipolar patients had significantly different signaling patterns than the stem cells derived from people without the condition.\n\n“The experiment involved the cells sending message between each other – sending a nerve signal or a transmission signal. It’s like an electrical current firing; the cells ‘fire.’….And we noticed an intrinsically different pattern of nerve conduction, or cellular firing patterns, [in the bipolar nerve cells]. There appears to be different mechanisms that these cells are reacting to between each other.”\n\nMeanwhile, the bipolar neurons also reacted differently than the non-bipolar neurons when exposed to lithium. Though the stem cells didn’t completely normalize, McInnis said the drug had a calming effect on the way the cells fire.\n\nGiven the wealth of their findings, McInnis said this stem cell technique could fundamentally alter how bipolar disorder is understood and handled. Rather than using a “one-size-fits-all” approach to researching and treating the condition, doctors could potentially personalize the disorder for each patient, allowing them to find the best treatment techniques for each individual.\n\n“This research changes our approach to the problem, because we now have the technology to study the individual as an individual,” McInnis said. “We have the ability to look at specific biochemical pathways, particular mechanisms, and different cell types and see how they interact and how they behave. So the ideal would be if someone develops bipolar disorder, we could determine at the level of the cell the most appropriate treatment – using this technique to help us refine the treatment strategy.”', 'When it comes to understanding bipolar disorder, many questions remain unanswered – such as what truly causes the condition and why finding proper treatments is so difficult.\nDetailed in the journal Translational Psychiatry, this study marks the first time researchers have derived a stem cell line specific to bipolar disorder.\nSpecifically, the bipolar stem cells expressed more genes for membrane receptors and ion channels compared to the non-bipolar stem cells.\nAdditionally, the nerve stem cells from bipolar patients had significantly different signaling patterns than the stem cells derived from people without the condition.\nGiven the wealth of their findings, McInnis said this stem cell technique could fundamentally alter how bipolar disorder is understood and handled.']"

43427,http://www.newswise.com/articles/stem-cell-tourism-takes-advantage-of-patients-says-law-professor,health,"['Newswise — MADISON, Wis. – Desperate patients are easy prey for unscrupulous clinics offering untested and risky stem cell treatments, says law and bioethics Professor Alta Charo of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is studying “stem cell tourism.”\n\nStem cells are cells that can form many types of cells in the body, and that makes them inherently promising — and dangerous. “Stem cell tourism” refers to people traveling, both within the U.S. and abroad, in pursuit of advertised stem cell therapies to purportedly treat a variety of medical conditions.\n\n“The evidence for therapeutic use of stem cells is very limited, except for bone marrow stem cells, but patients all over the world are convinced stem cells will cure their disease,” says Charo. “While there are some very promising results in the early clinical trials for stem cell therapies using embryonic and other kinds of stem cells, the ‘treatments’ being advertised by these clinics are dubious, mostly ineffective, and sometimes positively harmful.\n\n“Patients are being hoodwinked, but there are dilemmas about tackling (the ‘treatments’) at regulatory or political levels.”\n\nThe outrage over failures in stem cell tourism is limited, Charo says. Patients may pay tens of thousands of dollars for procedures that may carry no promise of success — or carry grievous risks of failure. “Most people have no reason to pay attention, and those who are paying attention are sick, so they are focused on trying anything,” Charo says. “If it does not work, they are already in a bad position with plenty to think about.”\n\nDuring a search for stem cell therapies on the web, Charo found products that supposedly enhance the natural formation of stem cells in the skin alongside “approved and unapproved treatments in the United States, and stem cell clinics outside the United States, like a stem cell ‘treatment’ for spinal conditions that might be innocuous, but is probably useless.”\n\nSome American operators are trying to slip through Food and Drug Administration regulation, says Charo, who served as senior policy advisor in the Office of the Commissioner of the FDA between 2009 and 2011. The FDA regulates medical devices, tissue transplants and drugs, but not organ transplants or the way medicine is practiced.\n\nTo sell a product that can heal without claiming it is a drug, some clinics remove stem cells from a patient, grow them with “minimal manipulation,” and then reinsert the resulting cells back to the same patient. “There has been a long-running battle over whether that is a tissue transplant akin to organ transplantation and thus the practice of medicine, or a tissue transplant that is acting like drug,” Charo says. “If the latter, then what you do is subject to FDA [regulation], so you have to prove that your product is safe and effective, which almost always requires expensive clinical trials.”\n\nIn early February, an appeals court upheld the FDA’s ability to regulate manipulated stem cells as drugs, Charo notes. But the victory may be hollow: “Each case takes a tremendous amount of effort to bring suit, prove the facts and win the appeal, and many other clinics may open up in the meantime.”\n\nIn some countries, pretty much anything goes, Charo says. Almost half of stem cell treatments occur in China, but Mexico and Russia also have growing sectors. “Some clinics advertise brain injury treatment for patients who are in no condition to travel,” she says. “Patients, and especially parents of children with injury or disease, are often desperate. One child went to Russia and raw bone marrow was injected into the brain. It’s horrifying.”\n\nOne view of stem cell tourism comes from studies by Paul Knoepfler of the University of California, who found that most clinical trials occur in Europe and especially the United States, where regulation is strictest, “but the so-called ‘therapeutic’ clinic locations are mostly in China, Mexico and Costa Rica,” Charo says. She also cites research by Timothy Caulfield of the University of Alberta and Allen Petersen at Monash University in Australia, who are studying the motivations and effect of stem cell tourism.\n\nIt’s unclear how much harm these unregulated treatments are causing to medical tourists because in the absence of comprehensive regulation, there is no comprehensive follow-up data. “We already have had two reported deaths of children, and there are probably more people injured than anybody would imagine. It’s time we started complaining a little more loudly,” Charo says.\n\nLimits on advertising could slow medical tourism to unscrupulous clinics, but that tactic is legally troublesome, Charo says. “The International Society for Stem Cell Research tried to list effective and ineffective clinics, but it got letters charging it with business defamation. Even if they could have won … they did not have money for the litigation, so they took down the posting. It was tremendously frustrating.”\n\nConsumers, she says, could raise these issues with the Federal Trade Commission, which is charged with regulating false or misleading advertising, but gets few complaints on the issue. Scientists can work with fellow scientists, with patient-advocacy organizations and regulatory authorities such as the FDA.\n\nAt this point, Charo notes, “stem cells have become a magic word. Often new areas of science get that reputation; in 19th century medical devices, everything with electricity or magnetism was magic. Today it’s stem cells and nanotechnology. It is time to lose the hype without losing the hope.” ###', '“Stem cell tourism” refers to people traveling, both within the U.S. and abroad, in pursuit of advertised stem cell therapies to purportedly treat a variety of medical conditions.\n“The evidence for therapeutic use of stem cells is very limited, except for bone marrow stem cells, but patients all over the world are convinced stem cells will cure their disease,” says Charo.\n“Patients are being hoodwinked, but there are dilemmas about tackling (the ‘treatments’) at regulatory or political levels.”The outrage over failures in stem cell tourism is limited, Charo says.\nAlmost half of stem cell treatments occur in China, but Mexico and Russia also have growing sectors.\nShe also cites research by Timothy Caulfield of the University of Alberta and Allen Petersen at Monash University in Australia, who are studying the motivations and effect of stem cell tourism.']"

Bee sting therapy and omega-3 fatty acids, however, offer weak evidence supporting their use.\n\n""It\'s a very common practice in the MS patient population to try alternative therapies,"" said the author of the guidelines, Dr. Vijayshree Yadav, clinical director of Oregon Health & Science University\'s MS Center, in Portland.\n\nHealth effects of marijuana use remain unclear\n\n""The problem is there was never an evidence-based recommendation for MS patients or those taking care of patients,"" Yadav said. ""This is a first step to educate each audience.""\n\nThe guidelines are published in the March 25 issue of the journal Neurology.\n\nAffecting more than 2.3 million people worldwide, MS causes a variety of symptoms such as loss of balance, vision loss, bowel problems, slurred speech and numbness, which can come and go. The disease of the central nervous system is thought to be caused by an inflammatory response of the immune system, which attacks nerve tissue in the brain and spinal cord.\n\nAccording to the academy, two types of conventional drugs are available for the incurable disorder: disease-modifying therapies, which can slow progression and reduce the number of relapses, and symptomatic therapies, which relieve some symptoms but don\'t affect the course of the disease.\n\nMedical marijuana: What does science say?\n\nOf all the alternative therapies reviewed, the experts\' strongest support was for medical marijuana pills and spray, which moderate evidence indicated could ease MS patients\' pain, frequent urination and muscle rigidity known as spasticity. Not enough evidence showed whether smoking marijuana is helpful in treating MS symptoms , Yadav added.\n\nThe researchers said there can be serious side effects with medical marijuana, such as seizures, dizziness, thinking and memory problems, and depression. Since some people with MS face a higher risk for depression and suicide, patients should discuss the safety of medical marijuana with their doctor.\n\nBetween 33 percent and 80 percent of MS patients use various alternative therapies to treat their symptoms, especially women, those with higher education levels and those reporting poorer health, according to the academy. But the safety of most of these therapies is unknown, and most are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nTimothy Coetzee, chief advocacy, services and research officer for the National MS Society, was not involved in crafting the guidelines, but said the potential of marijuana and its derivatives as a treatment for MS symptoms is important. ""I think it really emphasizes our approach to support the rights of people with MS to work with their doctors, recognizing that they need to do this in the context of the legal regulations of the state they\'re in,"" he said.\n\nMarijuana-based spray isn\'t legally available in the United States, Yadav said, but is sometimes obtained by U.S. patients from Canada, where the spray is legally available.\n\nMan-made marijuana pills, known as dronabinol and nabilone, are FDA-approved for nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Yadav said MS patients can be prescribed the pills as an ""off-label"" use, at their doctors\' discretion.\n\nYadav said she was surprised to find benefits from the use of an alternative treatment known as magnetic therapy, in which magnets are placed on the skin to produce a magnetic force that is thought to improve body function. Moderate evidence showed magnetic therapy reduced tiredness in MS patients, but it did not help with symptoms of depression.\n\nCoetzee said the guidelines are important because they will help inform conversations between people with MS and their doctors about strategies they can employ to reduce symptoms, which are often a combination of conventional and alternative therapies.\n\n""We\'re at a place where we need to continue to understand and better appreciate the benefits of what we know and don\'t know about [alternative medicine],"" he said.

The group said there was not enough evidence to show whether smoking marijuana was helpful in treating in MS symptoms.\n\nMuscle spasticity is a common symptom of MS causing involuntary spasms, immobility, disturbed sleep and pain.\n\nThe Academy, which represents over 27,000 neurologists, also said there was little evidence that other types of complementary or alternative medicine therapies (CAM) were effective in treating MS.\n\nMany MS patients seek relief from their symptoms by turning to nonconventional therapies such as ginkgo biloba, magnetic therapy, bee sting therapy, omega-3 fatty acids, and reflexology – often without their doctor’s knowledge.\n\n“Using different CAM therapies is common in 33 to 80 percent of people with MS, particularly those who are female, have higher education levels and report poorer health,” said guideline lead author Vijayshree Yadav, MD, with Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.\n\n“People with MS should let their doctors know what types of these therapies they are taking, or thinking about taking.”\n\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic disease which attacks the body’s central nervous system and destroys the myelin sheath that protects nerve cells in the brain. An estimated 400,000 Americans have the disease and more than 2 million worldwide. There is no known cure.\n\nA medical marijuana spray called Sativex is already being sold in Europe, Canada and Mexico to treat MS spasticity, but it is currently not approved for use in the U.S.\n\nSativex was developed by British-based GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: GWPH), which plans to begin a Phase 3 clinical trial of Sativex on MS patients in the U.S. in the second half of 2014. Positive results could lead to approval by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOne study out of Germany that looked at over 300 patients found that Sativex reduced MS spasticity by 20% or more in 4 out of 10 patients who were previously unresponsive to conventional therapies.\n\nHowever, in a review of nearly two dozen other trials, a British medical journal said there was little evidence supporting the use of Sativex to treat muscle pain and spasticity in MS patients.\n\nIn its new guidelines, the American Academy of Neurology said the long term safety of medical marijuana was unknown.\n\n“Medical marijuana in pill or oral spray form may cause side effects, some of which can be serious. Examples are seizures, dizziness, thinking and memory problems as well as psychological problems such as depression. This can be a concern given that some people with MS are at an increased risk for depression or suicide. Both doctors and patients must weigh the possible side effects that medical marijuana in pill or oral spray form can cause,” the Academy said in a statement.\n\nThe Academy’s guidelines say ginkgo biloba may help reduce tiredness caused by MS, but not thinking and memory problems. Magnetic therapy may also help reduce tiredness but not depression. Reflexology may help ease symptoms such tingling, numbness and other unusual skin sensations.\n\nThe guidelines say bee sting therapy, a low-fat diet with fish oil, and a therapy called the Cari Loder regimen all do not appear to help MS symptoms such as disability, depression and tiredness.

One because they can spill it on their skin and have symptoms, or two because they can ingest it and have symptoms.\n\n""But also adults who are handling e cigarettes or refilling e cigarettes have the potential to get it on their skin as well and have the same symptoms: nausea and vomiting, some pallor and sweating, salivation. We\'ve seen a couple of cases with increased heart rate and blood pressure. We’re concerned that in a significant enough exposure we’d see cardiac affects and potentially nervous system affects including seizure.""\n\n""We’re looking at such a high concentrated product that some amounts including just a milliliter to two milliliters can equal numerous cigarettes so we\'ve seen calls for tobacco with children eating cigarettes and we do get a concern with that – but it takes a much smaller amount of the concentrated liquid to cause symptoms we’d be concerned about.""\n\nGlynn on the American Cancer Society\'s position on e-cigarettes\n\nOur position on e-cigarettes are that they’re intriguing. In the short run, we know that they are going to be less harmful than a traditional burn cigarette; there’s virtually nothing that is more harmful than a traditional burn cigarette. And they may have a role in helping some smokers stop. But there are many, many scientific medical and social questions still surrounding e-cigarettes, and at this point we can’t actively encourage their use until we have more independent science-based information and FDA regulation.\n\nGlynn on the debate over using FDA-approved cessation drugs and e-cigarettes\n\nI\'ve seen that argument for many years, and it’s just simply not the case. The FDA approved medications – all seven of them – five of them are nicotine replacement products, as well as two prescription products.\n\n""They have been moderately useful: they help maybe on the first try, maybe 10 to 15 percent of people quit smoking. People then need to recycle and try again and they become more useful – particularly if they’re used correctly.\n\nThe limited data suggests that e-cigarettes are probably in the same range as the nicotine replacement products and the other two medications. So the question then arises: If they’re about equal, why use something that hasn\'t been approved by the FDA? On the other hand – if they haven’t proved useful to someone – clinicians are not discouraging people from it — but basically saying do so with your eyes open.\n\nGuests', ""As e-cigarettes become more widespread, the nicotine liquid used to fill e-cigarettes has been found to be potentially dangerous.\nLiquid nicotine is a neurotoxin and small amounts - whether ingested or absorbed through the skin - can be lethal.\nHere & Now's Robin Young speaks with Ashley Webb, the director of the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Center, about whether she's seen a rise in nicotine poisoning from e-cigarettes.\nThe FDA approved medications – all seven of them – five of them are nicotine replacement products, as well as two prescription products.\nThe limited data suggests that e-cigarettes are probably in the same range as the nicotine replacement products and the other two medications.""]"

43456,http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2014/03/25/what-the-experience-of-swedish-snuff-can-teach-us-about-e-cigarettes/,health,"[""A new study in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests that e-cigarettes don't help tobacco smokers quit. This study will no doubt attract enormous attention because it relates to the hottest debate in tobacco control: Whether e-cigarettes are a boon or bane to public health. E-cigarette proponents see them as a way for cigarette smokers to transition to a less damaging way of consuming tobacco; opponents worry that e-cigarettes will entice non-smokers into using a product that will ultimately be a gateway to cigarette smoking. Until more definitive data are gathered on e-cigarettes, participants in this debate would do well to examine the experience of Swedish snuff (also known as “snus”).\n\nSnus is a smokeless tobacco that is mainly used in Scandinavia. Its use is damaging to health, but because it is not smoked and contains a low level of cancer-causing nitrosamines, the damage to users and those around them from snus is less than that of tobacco cigarettes. The fundamental question at play in the current e-cigarette debate was also raised regarding snus: Would it be a net harm or a net benefit to public health?\n\nA study of 15,000 Swedish males examined snus use and smoking among a younger (age 16-44) and older (age 45-84) cohort. About 18 percent of tobacco smokers had previously been snus users. This gateway effect from snus to cigarettes was more common for older than younger individuals. However, in both cohorts, the reverse pattern was far more common, leading to an overall drop in tobacco smoking. Among the younger cohort, snus accounted for six smoking quitters for each smoking starter. In the older cohort, the benefit was less: About two smoking quitters per starter. Given the size of these effects and the prevalence of snus use, it is entirely credible to argue that snus has contributed to the declining lung cancer rate in the Swedish population.\n\nThe Swedish results would seem to make a conclusive case for the public health benefits of snus. However, a subsequent study of 1151 Finnish men had starkly different results. Only 22 participants in the study had replaced tobacco smoking with snus use. The norm in this population was to use snus to supplement rather than replace cigarette smoking, tending to increase the physical dependence of tobacco users. Although not able to draw a definitive conclusion, the authors noted that “it is likely that snus use complicates the attempts to quit smoking”.\n\nThe science on snus is thus unsatisfying for those desiring a simple answer regarding the public health value of putatively less harmful forms of tobacco. In one context, snus was enormously beneficial. In another, it appears to have made things worse. The effect of snus also varied across historical time periods as younger and older people used it in distinct ways.\n\nThe experience of e-cigarettes may very well follow the same pattern - or perhaps it is better said - the same lack of a pattern. An empirically grounded, universally valid judgment on the impact of e-cigarettes may be difficult to attain. Whether they are a net positive or negative for public health will depend on the context in which they are used, the degree to which different generations adopt them, and the regulations society sets regarding them.\n\nAddiction expert Keith Humphreys, PhD, is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford and a career research scientist at the Palo Alto VA. He recently completed a one-year stint as a senior advisor in the Office of National Drug Control Policy in Washington.

Eighty-eight participants said they had used or were using e-cigarettes. The researchers then compared the sample’s rate of cessation with that of the e-cigarette subset.\n\nCase Closed?\n\nWith no significant difference observed between the two groups, it would appear that e-cigarettes have little effect on a smoker’s habits. But as several experts have pointed out, the methodology of the study does not permit any conclusions about the device’s capacity to aid quitting. The study simply determines how likely e-cigarette users are to quit.\n\nIf this methodological difference seems a bit fuzzy, try replacing the subset “e-cigarette user” with “smokers with ready access to quitting aids.” In order to evaluate the efficacy of this particular attribute, you’d have to look at success rates among the smokers who are actually trying to quit — not simply the likelihood of any subject quitting.\n\nAccording to Peter Hajek, director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at the Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, said that the conclusion drawn by the authors are “just not related in any way to the study finding.” He added that many researchers currently think e-cigarettes represent “the best hope so far to put a stop to smoking-related death and disease by replacing deadly cigarettes with a safer alternative.”\n\nSimilarly, in an Italian study published in 2013, researchers from the University of Catania found that heavy smokers who switched to a daily pack of e-cigarette nicotine cartridges quickly reduced their tobacco intake, with some dropping the habit entirely within three months. Although the study was not originally intended as a cessation test, 13 percent of the heaviest smokers had quit cigarettes by the end of the trial.\n\nSource: Grana RA, Popova L, Ling PM.

It found that smokers who also used e-cigarettes were no more likely to quit smoking after a year, compared to smokers who didn\'t use the devices.\n\nOutside experts say the small number of respondents, and a lack of data on whether they intentionally used e-cigarettes to help them quit smoking, mean the findings from the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco can\'t take the place of much more rigorous study on the subject.\n\nE-cigarettes were first introduced in China in 2004 and have since grown into a $2 billion industry. The battery-powered devices let users inhale nicotine-infused vapors, which don\'t contain the harmful tar and carbon monoxide in tobacco.\n\nAt issue is how strictly U.S. health regulators should control the products. Advocates say e-cigarettes can help smokers quit. Public health experts fear they can serve as a gateway to smoking for the uninitiated, particularly teenagers. Leading U.S. brands include blu by Lorillard Inc and products from privately-held NJOY and Logic Technology.\n\nA previous report from the UK found that people who use e-cigarettes primarily want to replace traditional cigarettes (see Reuters Health story here: reut.rs/1ceF7nT).\n\n""We did not find a relationship between using an e-cigarette and reducing cigarette consumption,"" Rachel Grana, the lead researcher on the new study, told Reuters Health.\n\nGrana and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco analyzed 2011 survey data collected from 949 smokers. Of those, 88 reported using e-cigarettes.\n\nWhen the researchers looked at those smokers\' responses a year later, they found that the people who reported using e-cigarettes in the 2011 survey were no more likely to quit smoking than the people who didn\'t use e-cigarettes.\n\nFor those who were still smoking in 2012, using e-cigarettes also didn\'t appear to change how many traditional cigarettes people smoked per day.\n\nThe researchers note that the small number of participants who reported using e-cigarettes may have limited their ability to detect a link between quitting smoking and using the device.\n\nDr. Michael Siegel, who was not involved with the new research, told Reuters Health that the new study had several design flaws, including that the researchers did not know why some of the participants tried e-cigarettes or how long they had used them. Siegel is an expert on community health at Boston University School of Public Health and has studied e-cigarette research.\n\nBy comparing people who smoked regular cigarettes and those who smoked e-cigarettes, the researchers are assuming ""that the groups are exactly equivalent in terms of their motivations and their levels of addiction to cigarettes,"" Siegel said. ""You can\'t make those assumptions. You\'re not dealing with comparable groups.""\n\nIn an emailed statement, Grana and fellow researchers acknowledged that they did not have information on the participants\' motivations to use e-cigarettes, but said their analysis took into account other factors known to be linked to quitting smoking, such as their stated intention to quit and how many cigarettes they already smoked each day.\n\n""These factors may also reflect motivations to use e-cigarettes, as e-cigarettes are frequently marketed and perceived as cessation aids,"" they wrote. ""While these factors predicted quitting as expected, we found that e-cigarette use did not predict quitting.\n\nSiegel also pointed out that only about eight percent of the people surveyed said they had any intention to quit smoking within the next month. He hopes people will reserve judgment on e-cigarettes until randomized controlled studies - considered the ""gold standard"" of medical research - are published.\n\n""We need solid data that\'s based on solid science before we make decisions,"" he said.

Glantz, PhD, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Tobacco Research and Education at UCSF, says:\n\n""The irony is that quitting smoking is one of the main reasons both adults and kids use e-cigarettes, but the overall effect is less, not more, quitting. While there is no question that a puff on an e-cigarette is less dangerous than a puff on a conventional cigarette, the most dangerous thing about e-cigarettes is that they keep people smoking conventional cigarettes.""\n\n""E-cigarettes should not be recommended as effective smoking cessation aids until there is evidence that, as promoted and used, they assist smoking cessation,"" adds Dr. Kalkhoran.\n\nE-cigarette regulation could boost quit-smoking potential\n\nIn the US, e-cigarettes are not currently regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which the study authors say could be hampering their potential as a smoking cessation aid.\n\nThey note that including the devices in smoke-free laws and policies could stop people from using e-cigarettes as a substitute for conventional cigarettes, which could increase the devices\' potential to be a help rather than a hindrance.\n\n""The way e-cigarettes are available on the market - for use by anyone and for any purpose - creates a disconnect between the provision of e-cigarettes for cessation as part of a monitored clinical trial and the availability of e-cigarettes for use by the general population,"" the researchers add.\n\nNot only is the effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation being questioned, but numerous studies have challenged the safety of the devices.\n\nLast month, a study reported by Medical News Today associated e-cigarettes with cancer-related cell damage, while an earlier study found flavored e-cigarettes contain chemicals linked to respiratory disease.', 'Though e-cigarettes are widely marketed as a smoking cessation aid, a new study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine suggests the devices may actually reduce the likelihood of smokers quitting.\nShare on Pinterest Smokers were 28% less likely to stop using conventional cigarettes if they used e-cigarettes, researchers found.\nThis means doctors in the UK could soon prescribe the device to patients who want to quit smoking.\nAccording to the researchers, this is the largest study to date to quantify whether e-cigarettes help smokers stop conventional smoking.\n""E-cigarettes should not be recommended as effective smoking cessation aids until there is evidence that, as promoted and used, they assist smoking cessation,"" adds Dr. Kalkhoran.']"

He has championed social justice issues throughout his career including the right of same-sex couples to marry; banning discrimination against transgender people; expanding access to health care; and increasing resources for anti-poverty programs.\n\n“As a gay man living with HIV, I am honored to lead one of the country’s oldest and most effective organizations in the battle against this disease which has raged on over 30 years,” said Sciortino. “My goal for AIDS Action in the years ahead is simple: continue the work that has resulted in lowering the rate of new HIV diagnoses in Massachusetts; provide the multitude of services needed to keep those living with HIV/AIDS connected with health care providers; and continue the public conversation about HIV needed to reduce the stigma that is still so closely associated with this disease.”\n\nSciortino will be the first person living with HIV to lead AIDS Action since its founding in 1982. The agency has been led since 2003 by Rebecca Haag. Under Haag’s leadership, AIDS Action merged with two smaller organizations in 2010 and 2011, and last year announced a new strategic partnership with Fenway Health.\n\nThis new model is one of the first of its kind in the nation and combines Fenway’s nationally recognized expertise in HIV care and treatment with AIDS Action’s community-based services. This is consistent with the movement in health care reform to provide a medical home model that addresses the comprehensive needs of patients to ensure better health care outcomes and lower health care costs.\n\n“I can think of no one better than Carl to lead AIDS Action in the years to come and to work closely with Fenway Health to maximize our partnership on behalf of those we serve,” Haag said. “Carl has been an invaluable legislative and advocacy partner over the last decade. He is uniquely positioned to advance the state and national conversation around treatment and care of those living with chronic conditions, and the need for health care reform to pay for the vital support services necessary to keep treatment costs sustainable.”\n\nSciortino was first elected to office in 2004. In 2011, he was named Legislator of the Year by the National Association of Social Workers. In 2010, the Massachusetts School Psychologists Association named him Legislator of the Year. He is a founding member of the Young Elected Officials Network. Prior to being elected to the state legislature, he worked as a research manager for Fenway Health.

Reading these words today, you might think Mr. Spratt sounds like a victim of the bad advice we got in the second half of the last century to eat a low-fat diet, and Mrs. Spratt sounds like a follower of the trendy meat-heavy ""Paleo diet"" loved by modern CrossFit worshipers and couch potatoes alike. Do you immediately identify with one half of the couple more than the other? Are you anti-saturated fat or pro-saturated fat? Are you pro-gluten or anti-gluten?\n\nWell, if you are like most Americans, you\'re likely to lick the Spratt\'s whole platter clean by yourself. The truth is most of us aren\'t very good at following strict low-fat or strict low-carb diets even if we proclaim to be solidly in one camp or the other.\n\nNow that we hear saturated fat may not be bad for us after all but whole wheat bread may be slowly killing nearly half of all Americans (see anything written by public television staple and Grain Brain author David Perlmutter), we are again presented with a seemingly stark choice about what type of diet to follow. And once again we could be headed down a dangerous dietary path due to a total misinterpretation of (or complete inability to follow) the latest advice. Last time we did this, we got a lot fatter and sicker. Read these profound words Dr. David Katz, Director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, posted in February:\n\nThe advice we got decades ago to cut dietary fat was never intended as advice to eat low-fat, high-starch, high-sugar cookies ... The advice to cut fat was intended to direct us to the naturally low-fat foods that existed at the time, namely vegetables, fruits, beans, lentils, whole grains, and lean meats.\n\nDr. Katz goes on to explain that we didn\'t even really reduce our fat intake. It seems the percentage of calories from fat in our diets went down slightly after dietary fat was deemed a public health threat, but this was only because we increased our total calorie intake by adding low-fat empty calories to our diet under the impression that we were doing something positive for our heart health and our weight.\n\nSo let\'s take a deep breath before we switch to a diet of butter and bacon. Even if Dr. Perlmutter and other bagel haters like William Davis, M.D., the author of Wheat Belly, and Dr. Loren Cordain, the founder of the Paleo movement, are correct about the pervasive dangers of gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley and rye) and high carbohydrate foods in general, does this mean we should immediately switch to a diet high in saturated fat? A common mistake dieters make is assuming that because something is not bad or perhaps even good for you, a lot more of it must be really good for you (hence why cereals marketed as whole grain take up nearly an entire aisle in the supermarket). As we learned from watching bellies expand on doctor recommended diets rich in healthy whole grains, this isn\'t usually the case.\n\nI eat a fairly high-fat (mostly the unsaturated variety) and low-carbohydrate diet. As a health coach, I suggest this way of eating to my clients and recommend all-natural, pastured (not from factory-farmed animals fattened up with antibiotics) animal products as part of a healthy diet. I try to eat as little flour as possible, but I enjoy whole carbohydrates like legumes, quinoa and brown rice in moderation because I love these foods and derive energy from them. I don\'t forbid any food group, but I follow and advocate what I call a ""real food diet"" because I believe it\'s nutrient-dense and far less inflammatory and more satisfying than a diet high in low-fat, processed wheat products. But I fear many people will hear the current trending advice to worry less about fat and more about gluten and make the same mistake Dr. Katz referenced.\n\nIf you opt to eat a higher fat diet, make sure you are actually eating a lower-gluten, lower-carbohydrate diet; otherwise, you are just eating more, period, and excess calories convert to fat. Switching from a supersize muffin to eggs for breakfast is a positive dietary change, but opting for eggs and bacon and then eating a muffin on a coffee break isn\'t going to be a recipe for weight loss. This sounds obvious, but so does what Dr. Katz says about the advice to eat less fat -- in hindsight. The average American indeed added a lot more empty calories from wheat-based carbohydrates and fat-free sugary treats but forgot to eliminate the fatty foods, thus creating the ultimate recipe for obesity and our modern healthcare crisis: a high-fat, high-carb, high-calorie diet.', 'So begins the popular children\'s nursery rhyme about a couple that between the two of them ""licked the platter clean.""\nDr. Katz goes on to explain that we didn\'t even really reduce our fat intake.\nBut I fear many people will hear the current trending advice to worry less about fat and more about gluten and make the same mistake Dr. Katz referenced.\nIf you opt to eat a higher fat diet, make sure you are actually eating a lower-gluten, lower-carbohydrate diet; otherwise, you are just eating more, period, and excess calories convert to fat.\nThis sounds obvious, but so does what Dr. Katz says about the advice to eat less fat -- in hindsight.']"

Eat mostly plants (veggies, fruits, nuts, beans and seeds). When you eat animal foods (meats, eggs and dairy products), make sure they come from animals that were fed mostly on plants.\n\nAnd, yes, Katz does acknowledge that this advice is very similar to Michael Pollan’s famous saying: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.”\n\nUniversal advice\n\nAn important aspect of these three common dietary principles, says Katz, is that they help everybody, no matter what his or her age or health concerns.\n\n“The notion that some combination of foods or nutrients is most important to the prevention and management of diabetes whereas another is most important to cardiovascular disease never made much sense and was very impractical,” he notes. “Given that people with diabetes are at heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, which should they choose?”\n\nKatz also warns about following any guidance “that places an exaggerated emphasis on any one nutrient or food.” Following such advice is “ill advised,” he says.\n\n‘Perpetual confusion and doubt’\n\nIf widely adopted, his (and Pollan’s) simple dietary message could have a significant and beneficial impact on the public health, says Katz, perhaps even reversing some of the more troubling medical trends of recent decades, such as the rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\n“This message, however, is at present a relatively feeble signal lost in a chorus of noise,” he writes. “In pursuit of marketing advantage, notoriety, or some other bias, the defenders of competing diets tend inevitably to emphasize their mutual exclusivities. This pattern conforms well with prevailing media practices, and the result is perpetual confusion and doubt.”\n\n“If as a society we were genuinely interested in consensus about the best dietary pattern, rather than a never-ending parade of beauty pageant contestants, the compatibilities and complementarities of all reasonable candidates for best diet would be fairly evident,” he adds.\n\nGetting there\n\nOf course, there’s also the challenge of getting people to change their eating habits, especially in the midst of that “chorus of noise.”\n\n“The average supermarket in the United States offers in excess of 40,000 products, the majority of which are processed foods in bags, boxes, bottles, jars, and cans — virtually all of which sport marketing messages, many pertaining to health,” writes Katz. “Additional marketing messages populate pages, airwaves, and cyberspace.”\n\nConsumers may need, he adds, the equivalent of a nutritional GPS to “traverse the foodscape and arrive at good health.”\n\nSome such tools are out there, Katz says. He points to the latest Weight Watchers point system, as well as NuVal, a food point-scoring system that he helped develop, as validated examples of approaches that can work.\n\nBut it’s going to take a huge effort, Katz acknowledges, to move consumers “there from here.”\n\n“The clutter of competing claims likely obscures the established body of knowledge and forestalls progress, much like the proverbial trees and forest,” he concludes. “We need less debate about what diet is good for health, and much more attention directed at how best to move our cultures/societies in the direction of the well-established theme of optimal eating, for we remain mired a long way from it.”\n\nYou can read Katz’s full report — including details about why your favorite dietary approach is not as evidence-based as you may believe — on the Annual Reviews in Public Health’s website.', 'His finding: None of the diets stands out as “best.” And anybody who tells you otherwise is just trying to establish a marketing advantage for their particular diet.\n“There have been no rigorous, long-term studies comparing contenders for best diet laurels using methodology that precludes bias and confounding, and for many reasons such studies are unlikely,” Katz writes.\nThose elements can be summarized, he adds, in three guiding principles:Eat minimally processed foods that come directly from nature.\nWhen you eat animal foods (meats, eggs and dairy products), make sure they come from animals that were fed mostly on plants.\n“In pursuit of marketing advantage, notoriety, or some other bias, the defenders of competing diets tend inevitably to emphasize their mutual exclusivities.']"

The pair rigorously compared low-carb, low-fat, low-glycemic, Mediterranean, mixed/balanced (DASH), Paleolithic, and vegan diets — and write-in vote Michael Pollan won!\n\nPollan’s seven-word diet of “Eat food, not too much, mostly plants” was the only conclusion from this extensive comparison.

Whereas the composition of some animals’ flesh may mimic that of mammoths, the composition of the flesh of animals most often appearing in the food supply does not.

They each have guidelines by which the dieter must abide, and to stray from the rules is to jump into the deep abyss of guilt and self-loathing.\n\nThese diets create a plan that is meant to serve as a temporary fix to a persistent problem. They lure in individuals with promises of quick results and solid weight loss backed by “groundbreaking” nutritional research. But in reality, these promises do not always deliver.\n\nA short-term diet isn’t a long-term solution. Diets are restrictive and temporary. They are formulated only to last a specific set of days and achieve the goal of weight loss. But the price paid may not be worth the outcome.\n\nMany of us have struggled with our weight or our self-image. Diets, in our definition, are restrictive regimens, for a period of time, to do something about this problem.\n\nHowever, when individuals have to restrict food items that may be beneficial for them, such as fats (healthy fats are needed for survival because they construct the plasma membrane and the mitochondrial electron transport chain), their bodies respond by slowing metabolism as a means to fight the “starvation” and stress it is undertaking.\n\nIn some cases, the diet is so restrictive that the dieter begins to suffer from malnutrition and eating disorders. In addition, the pounds lost are mainly from lean muscle mass because of its calorie burning capabilities, and the body sees it as a detriment in time of need. Pounds are ready to pounce back on. When the diet ends, they add on more weight.\n\nThere is no reason individuals should suffer through diets that can harm their bodies. A diet should be a lifestyle plan. Nutrition is a gradual long-term commitment that removes processed carbs, trans fats and refined sugars, and replaces the empty calories with nutrient-rich vegetables, fruits, lean meats, beans and other forms of protein, coupled with exercise, adequate sleep and sweets in scarcity.\n\nIt takes 21 days to break a habit and retrain taste buds. Eventually, your body will crave the nutrients it needs, and the once-silent health-conscious voice inside you will talk you into a lifetime approach to healthy, happy living.\n\nFaizah Shareef is a freshman majoring in biochemistry and nutrition.', 'The Atkins, Paleo and South Beach diets, to name a few, are diet fads that have run through our society at unfathomable speeds.\nThese diets create a plan that is meant to serve as a temporary fix to a persistent problem.\nDiets are restrictive and temporary.\nDiets, in our definition, are restrictive regimens, for a period of time, to do something about this problem.\nThere is no reason individuals should suffer through diets that can harm their bodies.']"

Virus Ebolavirus is responsible for causing this disease.\n\nThe first cases of Ebola were found in 1976 in Nzara (Sudan) and in Yambuku, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The original host of the disease is unknown but researchers consider animals, mainly bats, as its source.\n\nSymptoms of Ebola\n\nExperts say, the symptoms of Ebola start appearing between 2 and 21 days after initial contact. The common symptoms include fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea rash poor kidney and liver function. In rare cases, patient can also experience internal and external bleeding.\n\nThere is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola. Currently treatments and vaccines are under development but most have not been tested in humans. Patients suffering from this disease usually suffer dehydration. Hence, they are given oral or intravenous fluid containing electrolytes. Patients must be quarantined.\n\nWhy is the Guinea outbreak more worrisome than others?\n\nEbola outbreak is a common affair in Africa but this time the health experts are more concerned. This is because they believe it more contagious this time.\n\nDr.Mohamed Ag Ayoya, UNICEF Representative in Guinea, said, “In Guinea, a country with a weak medical infrastructure, an outbreak like this can be devastating. But since nearly everyone with the disease dies, it’s unlikely to infect mass numbers of people like, say, HIV.”', 'Guinea, a West African country, is facing the deadly Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak, killing at least 60 people.\nTill Monday, 86 suspected cases and 59 suspected deaths from Ebola were reported in Guinea.\n“13 blood samples taken from those suspected cases and deaths have been confirmed in Ebola,” Gregory Härtl, head of WHO public relations, said.\nEbola hemorrhagic fever is a fatal disease contracted by humans and nonhuman primates like chimpanzees monkeys and gorillas.\nEbola outbreak is a common affair in Africa but this time the health experts are more concerned.']"

(AP Photo/WHO, Christopher Black, HO, File) Monrovia/Conakry - West African nations scrambled on Tuesday to contain an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus suspected to have killed at least 59 in Guinea, with people presenting symptoms of the disease reported in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. Health authorities in Liberia said five out of six people who crossed the border from Guinea to seek treatment and showed symptoms of the fever had died. Liberia's Chief Medical Officer Bernice Dahn said it was not confirmed if the cases were Ebola, one of the most lethal infectious diseases known to humans, and tests were being carried out. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said a total of 86 suspected cases, including 59 deaths, had been reported in southeastern Guinea near the border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Laboratory tests have confirmed 13 cases of Ebola in Guinea so far, the first outbreak of the disease in West Africa. “The patients we have seen thus far have similar symptoms to those of the people in Guinea,” Dahn said. “Those people had the sickness and crossed over into Liberia's Lofa county for treatment. Five died.”\n\nSamples taken from those who died in Liberia had been sent to Conakry for testing, according to the Geneva-based WHO.\n\nIn Guinea, authorities have taken steps to quarantine suspected cases in the districts of Guekedou, Macenta, Nzerekore and Kissidougou.\n\nIn neighbouring Sierra Leone, authorities set up a taskforce after the death of a 14-year-old boy who had attended the funeral of a suspected Ebola victim. Authorities are yet to confirm if the boy died of the disease.\n\nSierra Leone was receiving help from the WHO and the U.S. firm Metabiota, which investigates infectious disease threats, said Chief Medical Officer Brima Kargbo.\n\nInitial reports indicated a Canadian who showed Ebola-like symptoms after travelling to West Africa had tested negative for the virus, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters.\n\nEbola was discovered in 1976 in then-Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo. Scientists have identified the outbreak in Guinea as the virulent Zaire strain of the virus.\n\nBecause people who fall sick with it tend to vomit, have diarrhoea and suffer both internal and external bleeding, their bodies are often “covered in virus”, explained Peter Piot, one of the co-discoverers of Ebola and now director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nThis means anyone in close contact with them - such as nurses, doctors and carers - is at risk, he said.\n\nEsther Sterk, a tropical diseases specialist at the international medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières, said after an incubation period of between 2 and 21 days, the virus causes a raging fever, headaches, muscle pain, conjunctivitis and weakness, before moving into more severe phases of causing vomiting, diarrhoea and hemorrhages.\n\n“Patients may have heavy bleeding, including from the nose or via their urine,” she said in a briefing note on the disease.\n\nShe added, however, that while dangerous, Ebola remains rare. Since the virus was discovered in 1976, around 2,200 cases have been recorded. Of those, 1,500 were fatal.\n\nThe last major outbreak of the Zaire strain was in 2007, when 187 people died in Congo, a fatality rate of 74 percent.\n\nScientists are not clear how the virus - which also infects animals including bats, believed to be a major reservoir of the disease - crossed the continent from Sudan, Congo and Uganda.\n\nWith ethnic and family ties and trade making cross-border travel common in the region, the outbreak in Guinea is causing concern in nearby West African nations.\n\nMali said it was working with the WHO to put in place preventive measures, including stronger border control health checks, and a mechanism for coping with potential victims.\n\nThe WHO's Jasarevic said the main areas authorities should focus on were infection control, scaling up laboratory testing facilities and ensuring the best clinical management of confirmed cases of infection.\n\n“It's also about working with health workers so they know how to treat patients properly so they don't fall victim themselves,” he said.\n\nReuters"", 'West Africa scrambles to contain Ebola threatFILE -A 43 year old Congolese patient, center, who has been confirmed to have Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is comforted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) nurse Isabel Grovas, left, and Doctor Hilde Declerck.\nLaboratory tests have confirmed 13 cases of Ebola in Guinea so far, the first outbreak of the disease in West Africa.\nIn Guinea, authorities have taken steps to quarantine suspected cases in the districts of Guekedou, Macenta, Nzerekore and Kissidougou.\nIn neighbouring Sierra Leone, authorities set up a taskforce after the death of a 14-year-old boy who had attended the funeral of a suspected Ebola victim.\nInitial reports indicated a Canadian who showed Ebola-like symptoms after travelling to West Africa had tested negative for the virus, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters.']"

The Canadian man reportedly presented with symptoms of a hemorrhagic fever which Saskatchewan health officials believe resemble the early stages of the Ebola virus.\n\nThe Canadian man with the Ebola virus reportedly became ill after visiting the nation of Liberia. As previously reported by The Inquisitr, the death toll from the outbreak in the region may be higher than 59 patients. French researchers are testing samples form Ebola virus victims in Guinea. The scientists believe they have identified the virus as the Zaire strain. The realization is not good news for either patients or those who have potentially been exposed to the virus. The Zaire strain is reportedly the deadliest of the five know Ebola virus strains.\n\nThe first known Ebola virus victim in Canada has undergone tests which have now been sent to Canada’s Public Health Agency’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Although results are expected later today, Dr. Denise Werker, Saskatchewan’s deputy medical health officer, thinks they may be inconclusive.\n\nDr. Werker also had this to say about the Canada Ebola virus case:\n\n“All we know at this point is that we have a person who is critically ill who traveled from a country where these diseased occur. There is no risk to the general public at all about this.”\n\nNot everyone in the region feels reassured by Dr. Werker’s statement. The man believed to have been stricken with the Ebola virus was on an airplane and walking around in the community before being admitted to the hospital. Fears that he may have passed along the virus abound in the region. Hospital workers are taking added precautions such as wearing masks, gloves, gowns, and boots when caring for the patient. Dr. Werker maintains that hemorrhagic fevers are not spread easily.\n\nTypically, Ebola virus hemorrhagic fevers are spread via direct with bodily secretions, blood, or objected contaminated with such fluids. If left untreated and no vaccine given, hemorrhagic fevers reportedly result in a more severe fever and internal bleeding.\n\nThe incubation period for hemorrhagic fever is up to 21 days, according to Dr. Werker. The Canadian man reportedly showed no signs of illness while traveling. “Viral hemorrhagic fever is a generic name for a number of rather exotic diseases that are found in Africa,” the doctor added.

Now health officials are taking lengths to contain the outbreak in Guinea, which has confirmed 87 cases and 61 deaths, the BBC reported Monday. The world recently waited in anticipation for the results of a man being hospitalized in Canada with similar symptoms. Thankfully Gregory Härtl, WHO’s head of public relations, tweeted earlier that the man had tested negative for the virus. The scare does make us ponder what implications a positive test result would have meant.\n\nYesterday health officials confirmed that an individual in Canada was being hospitalized after showing symptoms of the Ebola virus. “All we know at this point is that we have a person who is critically ill who travelled from a country where the diseases occur,"" said Denise Werker, a Canadian health official, News.com.au reported. The results have come back negative, the BBC reported, and the man is believed to be suffering from nothing more than a bad case of malaria.\n\nThe scare has pushed efforts to contain the virus in West Africa. Sixty-one deaths in Guinea have now been associated with the virus, but reports have also arisen in neighboring Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Liberia, Senegal, and Sierra Leone have remained on high alert. Experts reassure that the risk of transmission for Ebola is low seeing that it is usually transferred to humans from wild animals, or between humans by direct contact with contaminated blood, feces, sweat, through sexual intercourse, or by improper handling of infected corpses. The reported outbreaks most commonly occurred in areas where there was an unusually large number of chimps, gorillas, and antelope carcasses.\n\nEbola is officially known as the Ebola hemorrhagic virus and was first recognized in 1976. Its symptoms are similar to the flu and include headache, fever, muscle and joint pain, and a sore throat. Later symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. Some cases exhibit rash, reddened eyes, hiccups, and both internal and external bleeding. Death usually follows the virus, killing nine out of 10 victims either from a sudden drop in blood pressure or exsanguination.\n\nAlthough North America has avoided contamination with the Ebola virus, unless the outbreak is controlled in Africa, it is only a matter of time before the virus will successfully reach other continents.\n\nSource: Stephenson J.

The settlement dates back to a court case from 2010, when the group of states first alleged improper marketing of Four Loko.\n\nI was still in college in 2010 -- a junior, who, like many students was impressed by/wary of Four Loko\'s effects. When the suit was filed (because of several deaths and hospitalizations) and Phusion announced they would be removing the drink\'s caffeine and other stimulants (they did, rather quickly, though it still must contain some kind of energy supplement), I can remember students raiding local stores in order to build a stockpile, which they would, in some combination: sell above market prices, wistfully drain themselves over the next few months, or hand out free of charge for some of the same reasons that maybe motivate Santa Claus.\n\nSome homemade, spin-off concoctions were rumored to exist after Loko\'s ban, but they never gained serious prominence. Once 5-hour energy drinks rose in popularity (despite a string of terrible commercials after Michael Strahan\'s endorsement), combining alcohol and energy in the same drink wasn\'t necessary. After all, Lokos have a polarizing taste -- which might be why they\'re even still around today; their original fans still believe.\n\nThe states, however, weren\'t satisfied by Phusion\'s quick ingredient change. They wanted the product out of the college scene. The agreement reached today prohibits Loko from promoting products on college campuses (didn\'t see any such advertisements when I was in college, but I went to a small school), using models under the age of 25 or models who appear to be under the age of 21 (that just sounds discriminatory against the baby-face), and eliminating any pictures on their social media page that may promote binge drinking.\n\n""Alcoholic energy drinks are dangerous - especially for the teenagers and young adults they target,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. ""Today\'s agreement ensures that one company will no longer market a dangerous product to youth.""\n\nPhusion also had to pay $400,000 to state regulators (ouch).

The numerous violations include that Phusion allegedly promoted their product to underage persons, promoted dangerous and excessive consumption, failed to disclose the dangers of combining alcoholic beverages with caffeine to consumers and that before 2011 actually manufactured, marketed and sold caffeinated alcoholic beverages that were unsafe. Which they did and it tasted pretty awful (oh dear god, the memories of the watermelon flavor) and generally just made us miss Sparks.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Phusion has agreed to discontinue a number of practices related to the sale and promotion of its flavored malt beverages, especially those that were marketed to college students and paired with ads featuring actors who appeared to be underage. If that is the case, who the hell are they going to market to on their Facebook page then? Because it currently looks like Spring Break threw up all over it.\n\nPhusion also cannot promote mixing malt beverages with caffeine products, hire underage persons to promote alcoholic products (um, that seems like a given), hire models or actors for promotional material who are under the age of 25 or appear to be under the age of 21, promote flavored malt beverages on school or college property except at retail locations licensed to sell alcoholic products or use any college name, logos or mascot in any promotions material. All of this seems pretty common sense if you are selling a product that is toeing the line in taste when it comes to the popular college age pastime known as binge drinking.\n\nPhusion must also pay up $400,000 to the City Attorney of San Francisco and the State Attorney General who are signatories to the settlement and promptly remove from its website and social media any postings that depict or condone the misuse of alcohol. Which frankly, if you are drinking Four Loko, you are misusing alcohol. Currently there is a photo on their Facebook of a shirtless man wearing a snake drinking Four Loko, which we're not sure if that falls into a grey area of misuse or not. Regardless, keep on keeping on, party guy.\n\nMeanwhile, Red Bull and vodka continues to be the standard drink that leaves many folks on the bathroom floor feeling like their heart is about to jump out of their chest come 2 a.m. but no one seems to mind that combination. Mainly because Red Bull has been pretty smart not to actively promote the cult favorite cocktail. And who would have thought, the giant energy drink looking can of sugary sweet malt booze would go over so well with the cheap college crowd? We once saw some some friends chase vodka shots with Slimfast at a college party so we know it could always be worse. It just goes back to the fact that if you are drinking in excess make sure to know your liquor and your mixers, be smart and hopefully be able to afford something better than Four Loko or at least go old school with some MD 20/20."", 'Phusion, Makers Of Four Loko, Reach Settlement Over Consumer ViolationsBy Lisa White in News on Mar 25, 2014 6:45PM(Four Loko Facebook) Phusion Projects, LLC or better known as the masterminds behind the beverage Four Loko reached an agreement today to resolve allegations that Phusion was in violation with the marketing and sales of their flavored malt beverages to consumers.\nThe numerous violations include that Phusion allegedly promoted their product to underage persons, promoted dangerous and excessive consumption, failed to disclose the dangers of combining alcoholic beverages with caffeine to consumers and that before 2011 actually manufactured, marketed and sold caffeinated alcoholic beverages that were unsafe.\nWhich they did and it tasted pretty awful (oh dear god, the memories of the watermelon flavor) and generally just made us miss Sparks.\nIf that is the case, who the hell are they going to market to on their Facebook page then?\nWe once saw some some friends chase vodka shots with Slimfast at a college party so we know it could always be worse.']"

Scientists also suspect air pollution may be to blame for inflammation in the heart, leading to chronic problems or a heart attack.\n\nWHO estimated that there were about 4.3 million deaths in 2012 caused by indoor air pollution, mostly people cooking inside using wood and coal stoves in Asia. WHO said there were about 3.7 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2012, of which nearly 90 percent were in developing countries.\n\nBut WHO noted that many people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap, mortality attributed to the two sources cannot simply added together, hence WHO said it lowered the total estimate from around 8 million to 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\nThe new estimates are more than double previous figures and based mostly on modeling. The increase is partly due to better information about the health effects of pollution and improved detection methods. Last year, WHO\'s cancer agency classified air pollution as a carcinogen, linking dirty air to lung and bladder cancer.\n\nWHO\'s report noted women had higher levels of exposure than men in developing countries.\n\n""Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves,"" Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for family, women and children\'s health, said in a statement.\n\nOther experts said more research was needed to identify the deadliest components of pollution in order to target control measures more effectively.\n\n""We don\'t know if dust from the Sahara is as bad as diesel fuel or burning coal,"" said Majid Ezzati, chair in global environmental health at Imperial College London.\n\nKelly said it was mostly up to governments to curb pollution levels, through measures like legislation, moving power stations away from big cities and providing cheap alternatives to indoor wood and coal stoves.\n\nHe said people could also reduce their individual exposure to choking fumes by avoiding traveling at rush hour or by taking smaller roads. Despite the increasing use of face masks in heavily polluted cities such as Beijing and Tokyo, Kelly said there was little evidence that they work.\n\n""The real problem is that wearing masks sends out the message we can live with polluted air,"" he said.

This is in addition to pollution’s role in the development of respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.\n\n“Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents noncommunicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly,” Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General Family, Women and Children’s Health said. “Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.”\n\nAnalysing the risk factors, taking into account revisions in methodology, WHO estimates indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths in 2012 in households cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. The new estimate is explained by better information about pollution exposures among the estimated 2.9 billion people living in homes using wood, coal or dung as their primary cooking fuel, as well as evidence about air pollution's role in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancers.\n\nIn the case of outdoor air pollution, the agency estimates there were 3.7 million deaths in 2012 from urban and rural sources worldwide. The most air pollution-related deaths occurred in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, according to WHO, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and some 2.6 million related to outdoor pollution.\n\nMany people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap, mortality attributed to the two sources cannot simply be added together, hence the total estimate of around 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\n“Excessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry. In most cases, healthier strategies will also be more economical in the long term due to health-care cost savings as well as climate gains,” Carlos Dora, WHO Coordinator for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health said.\n\n“WHO and health sectors have a unique role in translating scientific evidence on air pollution into policies that can deliver impact and improvements that will save lives,” Dr. Dora added.\n\nThe release of today’s data is a step in the development of a WHO roadmap for preventing diseases related to air pollution. This involves the development of a WHO-hosted global platform on air quality and health to generate better data on air pollution-related diseases and strengthened support to countries and cities through guidance, information and evidence about health gains from key interventions.\n\nFor more details go to UN News Centre at http://www.un.org/news\n\nENDS\n\n© Scoop Media\n\n"", 'Air Pollution Now Linked To 1 In 8 Deaths WorldwideAir Pollution Now Linked To 1 In 8 Deaths Worldwide, UN Health Agency ReportsNew York, Mar 25 2014 - Air pollution – both indoor and outdoor – killed some 7 million people across the globe in 2012, making it the world’s largest single environmental health risk, according to new figures released today by the UN World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn particular, the new data, which cites air pollution as the cause of one in eight global deaths, reveals a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer.\nIn the case of outdoor air pollution, the agency estimates there were 3.7 million deaths in 2012 from urban and rural sources worldwide.\nThe most air pollution-related deaths occurred in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, according to WHO, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and some 2.6 million related to outdoor pollution.\n“Excessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry.']"

And half of those deaths are caused by household stoves, according to the WHO report published Tuesday.\n\nThe fumes from stoves that burn coal, wood, dung and leftover crop residues as primary cooking fuels contribute to heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and respiratory infections.\n\n""What people have had available to them are primarily wood, dung and crop residues,"" says Catlin Powers, an environmental health researcher specializing in air pollution at Harvard University who wasn\'t involved in the study.

Many of these people sit around the stove to keep warm or use the stove to heat their beds, so more efficient stoves may not be accepted if it forces them to change those habits.\n\n""Even if they are given the stove for free, they end up not using it,"" Powers says.\n\nThe bigger issue at hand is to get cleaner fuels to people, she adds, which will address not only the health hazards but also the environmental problems.\n\nBut because of population growth and increasing cost, the shift to cleaner and more efficient use of energy hasn\'t made much progress.

A tall order, but one in eight deaths in 2012 was caused by air pollution. And more likely than not, that one air-pollution-wrecked body lived its shortened life in a poor or developing country — probably in Asia.\n\nWHO’s latest air-pollution-linked mortality estimates double previous annual figures, due largely to medical discoveries about pollution’s poisonous effects. Scientists have been discovering that a shockingly long list of afflictions can be exacerbated or triggered by air pollution — everything from heart attacks and lung cancer to diabetes and viral infections. The inhalation of tiny particles is now regarded as the world’s largest single environmental health risk — responsible for an estimated 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\nAccording to the WHO, indoor air pollution killed 4.3 million people in 2012. It’s produced by stoves and heaters that are fueled with coal, wood, dung, and crop residue. Some 3 billion people rely on cooking and heating facilities like these. Women and young children were more heavily affected than men by indoor air pollution. Half of the kids who died in 2012 before reaching their 5th birthday were thought to have been killed by pneumonia linked to indoor air pollution.\n\nThe WHO also attributed 3.7 million premature deaths in 2012 to outdoor air pollution, which is largely caused by power plants, trucks, cars, and crop-burning — with 88 percent of those deaths in low- and middle-income countries, mostly in Asia.\n\n“The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,” WHO official Maria Neira said. “Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.”\n\nIf there’s a silver lining to this cloud of soot, it’s that the world’s homicidal air pollution problem is starting to capture the global attention it deserves. Globetrotting journalists have been filing breathless dispatches about China’s famously soupy smog. This report is sure to raise the profile of the issue as well.

Unlike food and water, which is often too scarce for the poorest of the poor, no one can horde, process, package or sell oxygen. Unfortunately, due to humanity’s carelessness, the breath of life is now the kiss of death for seven million people a year.\n\nAccording to a World Health Organization report released Tuesday, “In 2012 around 7 million people died -- one in eight of total global deaths -- as a result of air pollution exposure. This finding more than doubles previous estimates and confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk.”\n\nBreaking down the data, 3.7 million deaths are attributed to ambient air pollution, and 4.3 million deaths are attributed to household air pollution. What does this mean exactly?\n\nAmbient air pollution is outdoor air pollution -- literally, the air we have no choice but to breathe. Outdoor air pollution, however, is grossly concentrated in developing countries.\n\n“Some 88% of those premature deaths [attributed to ambient air pollution] occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the WHO Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions,” WHO explained in a March fact sheet.\n\nIn other words, combine the high concentration of people in countries like China and India, plus lax laws concerning emissions from transportation, housing, power generation, industry and waste disposal, and you have a global health crisis.\n\nThe greatest number of global air pollution deaths, however, occurs right in the home.\n\nIn the United States, we take for granted that 3 billion people worldwide cook and heat their homes with either open fires or small stoves, using wood, manure, crop waste, trash or coal as fuel. Living in a cramped space and breathing in dirty air causes over four million premature deaths annually, and more than “50% of premature deaths among children under 5 are due to pneumonia caused by particulate matter (soot) inhaled from household air pollution,” WHO states.\n\nSince it is generally women and children who spend most of their time in the home or cooking meals, they are exposed to extremely high levels of soot.\n\n“In poorly ventilated dwellings, indoor smoke can be 100 times higher than acceptable levels,"" WHO said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe burdensome task of gathering fuel also takes children away from school and women away from income generating jobs, and the lack of electricity lowers the ability to study, read, make crafts, or complete other activities due to poor lighting.\n\nAnd even though this seems like a problem confined to the lower classes, WHO warned, “Black carbon (sooty particles) and methane emitted by inefficient stove combustion are powerful climate change pollutants.”\n\nIs there a solution to this seemingly daunting crisis?\n\nIn 2011 U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon launched a global initiative called “Sustainable Energy for All.” Working with more than 80 developing countries, the program is helping to convert dirty energy sources to renewable ones, like wind, water and solar power.\n\nIn addition, the Clean Energy Ministerial is composed of 23 governments that account for 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions -- including the U.S., various European countries, Canada, China, Brazil, India, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates and others. Together, they are working to expand clean energy access and supply.\n\nMost recently, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, introduced March 10 the “Clean Cookstoves Support Act.” The bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., has a goal of “spurring the adoption of clean cookstoves in 100 million homes by 2020.”\n\nOf course, each and every one of us has a duty to care for the earth and our global brothers and sisters. This means reducing our individual carbon footprint by making difficult choices. Can you ride your bike to work once a week? Can you shop at local farmer markets and stores? Can you buy recycled or pre-used products? Can you lower your heater a few degrees?\n\nAs we are taught, God is found in the air, the gentle breeze. If we continue to pollute that air, where will we find God?\n\n“And a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave.” (Kings 19: 11-13)', 'According to a World Health Organization report released Tuesday, “In 2012 around 7 million people died -- one in eight of total global deaths -- as a result of air pollution exposure.\nThis finding more than doubles previous estimates and confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk.”Breaking down the data, 3.7 million deaths are attributed to ambient air pollution, and 4.3 million deaths are attributed to household air pollution.\nAmbient air pollution is outdoor air pollution -- literally, the air we have no choice but to breathe.\nOutdoor air pollution, however, is grossly concentrated in developing countries.\nThe greatest number of global air pollution deaths, however, occurs right in the home.']"

The vast majority were in Asia, with 180,000 in the Americas and Europe combined, said the WHO.\n\nIndoor air pollution led to 4.3 million deaths, of which 34% were caused by strokes, 26% heart diseases and 12% respiratory disease in children. Only 19,000 of these deaths were in rich countries, with the vast majority being in low- and middle-income countries. Because many people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution, the WHO said deaths attributed to the two sources cannot be added together.\n\n“The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,” said Maria Neira, director of WHO’s department for public health, environmental and social determinants of health. “Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.”\n\nSouth-east Asia, said the WHO, is now the most polluted region in the world, with 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution. This reflects the explosive growth of cities and industrial development in China and India, as well as continuing deep poverty in rural areas.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe new estimates are based not on an significant increase in pollution, but on improved knowledge of the links between air pollutants and heart diseases and cancers, in addition to known links with respiratory diseases. A 2008 WHO report estimated that outdoor pollution led to about 1.3 million deaths, while about 1.9 million people were killed by indoor pollution. A Lancet study last year suggested that the surge in car use in south and east Asia killed 2.1 million people prematurely in 2010. Last year, WHO’s cancer agency classified air pollution as a carcinogen, linking dirty air to lung and bladder cancer.\n\n“Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly,” said Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO assistant director general of family, women and children’s health. “Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.”\n\nMartin Williams, professor of air quality at the environmental research group, King’s College London, said: “This is an important study, and although the majority of attributable deaths occur in south-east Asia and the western Pacific, air pollution impacts on mortality and health are still a significant public health problem in Europe, including the UK.”\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAir pollution is increasingly linked with ill health and deaths in rich countries as traffic emissions rise. In the US, air pollution causes about 200,000 early deaths a year, with emissions from cars and trucks causing 53,000 and power generation 52,000, according to MIT’s environment laboratory. California suffers most from air pollution, with 21,000 early deaths.\n\nIn Europe, poor air quality is the top environmental cause of premature deaths in the EU, causing more than 100,000 premature deaths a year and costing from £300bn-£800bn a year in extra health costs, said Janez Potočnik, the EU environment commissioner.\n\nAir pollution causes 29,000 early deaths a year in the UK and similar numbers in France and Germany.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nguardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2014', 'Air pollution has become the world’s single biggest environmental health risk, linked to around 7 million – or nearly one in eight deaths in 2012 – according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIndoor air pollution led to 4.3 million deaths, of which 34% were caused by strokes, 26% heart diseases and 12% respiratory disease in children.\n“Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.”South-east Asia, said the WHO, is now the most polluted region in the world, with 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution.\nA 2008 WHO report estimated that outdoor pollution led to about 1.3 million deaths, while about 1.9 million people were killed by indoor pollution.\nLast year, WHO’s cancer agency classified air pollution as a carcinogen, linking dirty air to lung and bladder cancer.']"

Despite the increasing use of face masks in heavily polluted cities such as Beijing and Tokyo, Kelly said there was little evidence that they work.\n\n“The real problem is that wearing masks sends out the message we can live with polluted air,” he said. “We need to change our way of life entirely to reduce pollution.”', 'Scientists also suspect air pollution may be to blame for inflammation in the heart, leading to chronic problems or a heart attack.\nWHO estimated that there were about 4.3 million deaths in 2012 caused by indoor air pollution, mostly people cooking inside using wood and coal stoves in Asia.\nWHO said there were about 3.7 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2012, of which nearly 90 percent were in developing countries.\nBut WHO noted that many people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution.\nLast year, WHO’s cancer agency classified air pollution as a carcinogen, linking dirty air to lung and bladder cancer.']"

The women appear to be at risk for the deadly uterine tumors even after having removed their ovaries as a measure of lowering their main cancer risk.\n\nThe gene, known as BRCA1, and the BRCA2 gene have been known to carry mutations that put women at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers, but a link to uterine tumors was not previously known.\n\nHowever, researchers reported that four high-risk cases of uterine cancer were identified among a group of 296 women with BRCA1 mutations who were part of the prospective cohort study. Uterine cancer cases were not identified among women with BRCA2 in this study.\n\nOne of the study’s authors, Dr Noah Kauff of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, is reported by AP as saying: “One can happen. Two all of a sudden raises eyebrows, and four is highly suspicious.”\n\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) notes on its website that mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 can be inherited from one’s mother or father and that children of a parent carrying one of these gene mutations has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the mutation.\n\nThe NCI notes that in the general population, 12 percent of women will develop breast cancer compared to 55 to 65 percent of women inheriting the harmful BRCA1 mutation and 45 percent of women inheriting the harmful BRCA2 mutation. Ovarian cancer risks are also increased among women with these gene mutations.\n\nNow women with these gene mutations should also be aware of their uterine cancer risk.\n\nKauff is also reported to have said that: “Doctors should let their patients with BRCA1 mutations know that this report suggests they may be at risk for rare types of aggressive uttering cancer. Whether or not a woman decides to have a hysterectomy at the time of reducing salpingo-oophorectomy may depend on her age, prior cancer history, and other risk factors.”\n\nSources\n\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/news/medical/article/Study-ties-breast-gene-to-high-risk-uterine-cancer-5343937.php\n\nhttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA\n\nhttp://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/gynecologic-cancer/news/online/%7Bd7d298ba-5090-466f-a025-daff427026e6%7D/brca1-mutation-increased-risk-for-rare-uterine-cancers-after-salpingo-oophorectomy', 'The women appear to be at risk for the deadly uterine tumors even after having removed their ovaries as a measure of lowering their main cancer risk.\nHowever, researchers reported that four high-risk cases of uterine cancer were identified among a group of 296 women with BRCA1 mutations who were part of the prospective cohort study.\nUterine cancer cases were not identified among women with BRCA2 in this study.\nOvarian cancer risks are also increased among women with these gene mutations.\nNow women with these gene mutations should also be aware of their uterine cancer risk.']"

However, because this is one of the first studies to report these findings, the results need to be confirmed before hysterectomy should be routinely recommended, they note.\n\nThe study from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York focused on 525 women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who had RRSO without a hysterectomy to prevent the development of both gynecologic and breast cancers. This represented 79 percent of women undergoing risk-reducing surgery during the study period. Four of the 296 women with a BRCA1 mutation who did not have the uterus removed subsequently developed an aggressive form of uterine cancer. That translates into a 2.1 percent risk of developing an aggressive uterine cancer in the first 10 years following RRSO. This is approximately a 26-fold increased risk compared to what would be expected in the general population. Importantly, there was no increased risk found for the more common types of uterine cancer, and the increased risk of aggressive uterine cancer may have been associated with a prior history of breast cancer and/or use of tamoxifen, a breast cancer treatment.\n\nIn the study, 296 of the 525 women (56 percent) had a BRCA1 mutation, 226 (43 percent) had a BRCA2 mutation and three (.6 percent) had mutations in both genes. None of the women with a BRCA2 mutation developed uterine cancer. Researchers are continuing to study whether women with the BRCA2 mutation also are at higher risk for rare types of uterine cancer.\n\n“While the absolute risk is still relatively low, it is much higher than we would have expected for these aggressive uterine cancers,” said Noah D. Kauff, MD, senior author of the study and director of ovarian cancer screening and prevention on the gynecology service at Memorial Sloan Kettering. “Doctors should let their patients with BRCA1 mutations know that this report suggests they may be at risk for rare types of aggressive uterine cancer. However, whether or not a woman decides to have a hysterectomy at time of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy may depend on her age, prior cancer history and other risk factors.” Women with a BRCA1 mutation have a 39 to 46 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer and a 50 to 85 percent chance of developing breast cancer in their lifetimes. Because of the high risk of developing those cancers, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network currently recommends that women with a BRCA1 mutation reduce their risk of developing both ovarian and breast cancer by having their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed between age 35 and 40 after childbearing is complete. The recommendation doesn’t include removal of the uterus because there are extra risks to undergoing a hysterectomy, including higher risks of bleeding and infection, and potentially higher risks of long-term problems with bladder, bowel or sexual function. It also was believed that uterine cancers that do develop following RRSO were likely to be low risk. The new study suggests that may not be the case.\n\nAbout SGOThe Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) is a 501(c)6 national medical specialty organization of physicians and allied health care professionals who are trained in the comprehensive management of women with malignancies of the reproductive tract. The Society’s membership, totaling more than 1,800, is primarily comprised of gynecologic oncologists, as well as other related medical specialists including medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, nurses, social workers and pathologists.

From there, the researchers were able to coax the cells to develop into neurons.\n\nUnder a microscope, the research team noticed differences between bipolar neurons and neurons from the brains of people without a mental disorder.\n\nResearchers found that the bipolar neurons expressed more genes for membrane receptors and ion channels, specifically those that transfer calcium between cells.\n\nBecause calcium is crucial to neuron growth and development, the researchers say their findings support the theory that small genetic differences during early brain development are crucial to the onset of bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses.\n\nThey also discovered small differences in the cells’ microRNA—which helps to determine which genes are expressed and how—in bipolar patients, supporting the idea that several genetic vulnerabilities are responsible for the development of bipolar disorder.\n\nSee 9 Celebrities Who Battled Bipolar Disorder »\n\nFully Customized Treatments on the Horizon\n\nThe University of Michigan team also exposed the bipolar neurons to lithium and observed how it altered their calcium signaling. Researchers say this will allow them to study therapies on a patient's individual neurons in a laboratory setting.\n\nWith this line of research, the current trial-and-error approach to treating bipolar disorder could be tailored to specific patients and assessed at a microscopic level. It could mean fewer unwanted side effects from medications and quicker identification of effective treatments, the researchers said.\n\n“We're very excited about these findings. But we're only just beginning to understand what we can do with these cells to help answer the many unanswered questions in bipolar disorder's origins and treatment,” Dr. Melvin McInnis, principal investigator at the Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Fund, said in a statement.\n\nThe research team is currently building up more stem cell lines from more patients with bipolar disorder, which can take months, and they will share them with other researchers at the university.\n\nImage courtesy of the University of Michigan Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Lab.\n\nLearn How Creativity is One Upside of Bipolar Disorder »"", 'Bipolar disorder is a complex mental health condition that affects an estimated 200 million people worldwide.\nWhile our understanding of depression and mania stretch all the way back to ancient Greece, just how these two stages of bipolar disorder develop and intersect has largely remained a mystery.\nBut new research published Tuesday in the journal Translational Psychiatry shows how the first-ever bipolar stem cell lines can give us clues as to how brain cells develop in people with bipolar disorder.\nImage courtesy of the University of Michigan Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Lab.\nLearn How Creativity is One Upside of Bipolar Disorder »']"

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is popular among MS sufferers, though can prove difficult to access as the industry isn\'t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nNew guidelines on how to most effectively use medical marijuana have been published in the journal Neurology, outlining the benefits of the substance and the outcomes experienced by MS patients. The disease, characterized by rigid muscles (also known as spasticity), unstable balance, loss of vision, and slurred speech, was largely found to respond positively to medical marijuana pills and sprays, though occasional adverse side effects were also noted.\n\nDizziness, drowsiness, seizures, depression, and patchy memory loss affected a small amount of MS sufferers who tried medical marijuana. However, MS sufferers are more inclined to embrace CAM therapies, with the research ultimately looking at data from 2,608 studies. ""We\'re at a place where we need to continue to understand and better appreciate the benefits of what we know and don\'t know about [alternative medicine],"" said Timothy Coetzee of the National MS Society, who was not involved with writing the guidelines. ""I view it as integrated care. It\'s important we continue to keep our options open so people with MS can live their best lives.""\n\nApart from easing spasticity, marijuana pills and sprays were also notable for reducing frequent urination. Sprays are currently unavailable in the United States, though it\'s thought that MS patients have other means of obtaining them - such as purchasing them across the border in Canada. Other alternative therapies reviewed included gingko biloba, bee sting therapy, omega-3 fatty acids, magnetic therapy, and reflexology. Gingko biloba, more commonly used to sharpen memory, was instead found to reduce fatigue to some degree. Surprisingly, magnetic therapy also saw some evidence in its favor, again reducing fatigue and tiredness. A diet high in omega-3 fatty acids (such as from fish oil supplements) was found largely ineffective, as was bee sting therapy.\n\nThe study\'s leader, Dr. Vijayshree Yadav, stressed the need for traditional medical supervision when trying CAM therapies. ""Using different CAM therapies is common in 33-80% of people with MS, particularly those who are female, have higher education levels and report poorer health. People with MS should let their doctors know what types of these therapies they are taking, or thinking about taking,"" said Yadav.\n\nThe study was published in Neurology on March 25 2014.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Times reports.\n\nAccording to this newspaper, Democrat Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills) and two Democratic lawmakers wrote a letter to the Foster City, California, asked Gilead Chief Executive John C. Martin to explain the rationale for selling Sovaldi for $1,000 per pill.\n\nPrevious therapies for hepatitis C helped only about half of patients and had numerous side effects. Clinical trials of Gilead’s Sovaldi, on the other hand, have shown cure rates approaching 90% with far fewer complications. The lawmakers noted those potential benefits for patients, but criticized the high price of the medication, which could impose substantial costs on taxpayer-funded Medicaid programs and lead to premium increases for those with employer or individual health coverage.\n\nIn their letter, which the L.A. Times had access to, Waxman, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said, “our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.” The lawmakers expect a response from the company by April 3.\n\nGilead has defended its pricing and said that Sovaldi represents a major advance over existing treatments for hepatitis C. The new therapy, the company said, can avoid the long-term medical expenses related to liver failure, cancer, and transplants. “We had heard the concerns raised in the letter and had reached out to a number of members of Congress prior to this letter to address those concerns,” said Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller to the L.A. Times. “We look forward to the opportunity to meet with them.”\n\nLeft unchecked, some hepatitis C infections result in liver damage, liver cancer, or death. Chronic hepatitis C infection affects about 3 million people in the U.S., and more Americans are expected to find out they have the disease as screening becomes more common. Beyond this new hepatitis C drug, employers and insurers are concerned about a growing number of expensive specialty medications that are coming onto the market, claiming that the wide adoption of these drugs could undermine efforts to rein in soaring medical costs.\n\nA recent report estimated the annual cost could top $18 billion if half of all California patients with hepatitis C received Sovaldi, which costs $84,000 for a 12-week course, or another new drug, Olysio, which costs about $66,000. This month, a panel of California medical experts met to discuss those potential costs and determined that Sovaldi was a “low-value” treatment in light of its high price tag.', 'Increasingly concerned about the high cost to taxpayers and consumers, U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc. to justify the price of its new $84,000 drug for hepatitis C patients, the L.A.

46342,http://www.medicaldaily.com/lawmakers-pen-note-gilead-sciences-hepatitis-c-drugmaker-about-high-cost-breakthrough-treatment,health,"['Biotech company, Gilead Sciences, broke through an incredibly important barrier last December when it introduced the Hepatitis C drug Sovalidi (sofosbuvir), which is capable of curing more patients in a shorter time frame. But with one course of treatment costing as much as $84,000, the company has caused concern among U.S. lawmakers and insurance companies, many of which won’t cover the expenses.\n\nWith about 3.2 million people in the U.S. ill with Hepatitis C (HCV), Sovaldi was supposed to be the end-all of the disease. HCV is a contagious liver disease that, for most people, isn’t detectable. However, for the 75 to 85 percent of people who develop chronic HCV, it can lead to liver problems like cirrhosis — a scarred liver — and liver cancer. Sovaldi was, and still is, so promising because it can treat a wider range of people who couldn’t tolerate other treatments, which happened often, or whose HCV came back after undergoing treatment. While previous treatments had cure rates between 65 and 75 percent, Sovaldi’s cure rate was 90 percent and up, depending on which drug it was used with.\n\nBut when it came to pricing for the drug, Gilead decided it would be determined by tiered pricing based on countries’ per capita gross national income. In the U.S., that meant $84,000; in Germany, $66,000; and in the UK, $57,000, Reuters reported. In Egypt, where HCV rates are the highest in the world, Gilead promised one course of therapy for only $900.\n\nAll these factors, together, sparked concern from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, who worry the steep pricing works negatively against the public’s health. “Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it. The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” they wrote in a letter to Gilead. “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”\n\nSovaldi underwent an expedited approval process with the Food and Drug Administration after it was designated a “breakthrough therapy.” The first of its kind, it treats HCV without the help of interferon injections, a mainstay of previous treatments that left scores of patients with severe side effects such as anemia, insomnia, fatigue, depression, and skin rashes. In comparison, Sovaldi paired with another old drug, ribavirin, only caused fatigue and headache.\n\nDespite the exorbitant costs of developing a drug, which can be about $1.3 billion, Gilead is set to make far more in sales this year alone — between $7 billion and $12 billion, Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst for ISI Group, told Reuters. If Gilead doesn’t bring prices down willingly, they will eventually drop as competing companies like AbbVie, Bristol Myers-Squibb, and Merck & Co. catch up with their own drugs. “We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he told Reuters. “In my mind, that is what will drive pricing down.”', 'With about 3.2 million people in the U.S. ill with Hepatitis C (HCV), Sovaldi was supposed to be the end-all of the disease.\nHowever, for the 75 to 85 percent of people who develop chronic HCV, it can lead to liver problems like cirrhosis — a scarred liver — and liver cancer.\nBut when it came to pricing for the drug, Gilead decided it would be determined by tiered pricing based on countries’ per capita gross national income.\nIn Egypt, where HCV rates are the highest in the world, Gilead promised one course of therapy for only $900.\nThe costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” they wrote in a letter to Gilead.']"

That’s a drop of 12.5 percent since Feb. 25, when the index closed at 2,854.26. However, the gauge of 121 drugmakers is still up 5 percent since the year began and nearly 55 percent during the past 12 months.\n\nReceptos was one of the biggest local losers among major biotech companies in the San Diego area, falling 9.3 percent to close at $42.42. That loss dropped its market value below $1 billion.\n\nZogenix fell just over 7 percent to close at $3.02, and Orexigen fell nearly 6 percent to close at $6.96.\n\nSome members of Congress and certain advocacy groups have recently criticized Zogenix over its marketing of a new opioid drug, Zohydro, that does not include abuse-deterrent technology. But for most other local biotechs, there was no easily identifiable factor behind their stock-price decline.\n\nLOCAL COMPANIES Slide in stock price of local biotechnology companies on Monday: *Orexigen: -6% *Receptos: -9.3 % *Zogenix: -7.1%\n\nA general concern across the biotech sector is that a backlash has developed against the high price of some biotech drugs, such as Gilead Sciences’ new medication for hepatitis C, Sovaldi, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in December. That drug’s $84,000 treatment cost, or about $1,000 a pill, has been greeted with outrage. Foster City-based Gilead said the price is justified because Sovaldi cures the great majority of infections — and ultimately saves money when compared with other treatments.\n\nThe protests against Sovaldi are “political grandstanding” and part of a negotiating process, said John McCamant, editor of the Berkeley-based Medical Technology Stock Letter. Gilead needs to provide more information to justify the price of Sovaldi, and the company will probably do so in the next few weeks.\n\nAs a biotech investor, McCamant said, he sees the falling prices of the past few weeks as a potential opportunity to buy Gilead stock.\n\n“The fundamentals remain intact,” McCamant said. “One of the most interesting things about this drug is that it will be the biggest launch of a new drug in history. It’s on track to exceed Lipitor,” which has been a blockbuster statin medication.\n\nMcCamant said Sovaldi’s earnings potential was a “double-edged sword.”\n\n“Whether you and I like it, it’s Gilead’s responsibility to their shareholders for a price they feel they can get a real return on,” he said.\n\nBut Jonathan Krinsky, a technical analyst studying biotech charts at MKM Partners, said the outlook for biotech stocks in the immediate future is negative.\n\nA “fairly sizable correction over the next few months” is possible for the Nasdaq Biotech ETF, a security tied to biotech stock prices, Krinsky said.\n\nBloomberg News contributed to this report.\n\nbradley.fikes@utsandiego.com\n\n(619) 293-1020\n\nTwitter: @sandiegoscience', 'Biotech stocks in San Diego and across the country dropped Monday, continuing a monthlong downward movement that has interrupted what was previously a bull market.\nReceptos was one of the biggest local losers among major biotech companies in the San Diego area, falling 9.3 percent to close at $42.42.\nAs a biotech investor, McCamant said, he sees the falling prices of the past few weeks as a potential opportunity to buy Gilead stock.\nBut Jonathan Krinsky, a technical analyst studying biotech charts at MKM Partners, said the outlook for biotech stocks in the immediate future is negative.\nA “fairly sizable correction over the next few months” is possible for the Nasdaq Biotech ETF, a security tied to biotech stock prices, Krinsky said.']"

With over 28 confirmed cases, what was most striking about this outbreak was that 97% of the cases had been vaccinated against Mumps. Unfortunately for the surrounding community, this strain of the disease has been spreading, leaving the campus grounds. As of March 25, 10TV announced that 69 cases have been reported in Franklin County, Ohio, with 52 of those linked to the University. CNN also reported that cases of Mumps have been found at Fordham University in New York.\n\nWith the disease spreading into the community and even surrounding states, many health officials are worried about how far this infestation could travel. Mumps is a highly contagious disease, spread through respiratory contact (like sneezing and coughing), just like the common cold or flu, and sometimes having the vaccine is not enough.\n\nOhio State has been talking with other Universities to discuss their preparedness level against Mumps. While covering your mouth when you sneeze and washing your hands a lot is a good way to avoid the disease, equally as crucial is making sure you have both your MMR vaccinations. This vaccine, protecting against Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR), is given in two doses, usually during childhood. While the vaccine isn’t 100% effective – it’s 88%, to be exact – it seriously lowers your chance of contracting the disease. Along with lower stats, the CDC has informed the country that people who are properly vaccinated and still get Mumps may not get as sick.\n\nWhat happens if you do come down with it? The CDC recommends the following:\n\n1. Stay at home for five days after symptoms begin.\n\n2. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.\n\n3. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.\n\nAll these things are similar to what you would do if you came down with a slight cold. The key difference is, if you find yourself battling the Mumps, you need to contact your health care provider immediately, as symptoms of this rare disease can get ugly. Other manifestations of the disease can be inflammation of the brain, ovaries, or testicles, and sometimes deafness. For these reasons it is all too important to make sure you are up to date on your Mumps vaccine (even take a booster if you want!) and exercise good hygiene in order to avoid contracting this spreading disease.\n\nphoto credit: Gene Hunt via photopin cc', 'This past February Ohio State University was struck by a sudden case of the Mumps.\nWith over 28 confirmed cases, what was most striking about this outbreak was that 97% of the cases had been vaccinated against Mumps.\nWith the disease spreading into the community and even surrounding states, many health officials are worried about how far this infestation could travel.\nFor these reasons it is all too important to make sure you are up to date on your Mumps vaccine (even take a booster if you want!)\nand exercise good hygiene in order to avoid contracting this spreading disease.']"

That leaves much of Africa prone to economic shock from continuing episodes.\n\nOn Tuesday the World Health Organization reported a “rapidly evolving” outbreak of Ebola in Guinea after 86 people were affected, including 59 dead -- but a virus like this costs more than lives.\n\n“Basically it's deployment of people, that’s the biggest thing,” said Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO representative, who said medical teams were sent from Europe and around Africa to reach the area in Guinea.\n\nHe said it’s difficult to determine the costs, since emergency efforts involve such a complicated combination of transportation, equipment and skilled work to track down the virus. But beyond immediate expenses, the Ebola virus can also have lasting economic effects on tourism, trade and medical research.\n\nThere is still no known cure or vaccine for the Ebola, and the virus’s relative rarity means few ventures are working to find them. Experts say progress will be slow, since Ebola simply isn’t a priority for big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe virus tends to kill quickly, and since infected people can’t move easily it can often be contained. The death rates fatalities are much lower than for other diseases such as AIDS or malaria.\n\n“If you count all of the cases of Ebola since the discovery, it’s below 10,000,” Stephan Guenther, head of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, told Bloomberg. “It’s definitely not of commercial interest.”\n\nBut on March 5, Canadian firm Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp. unveiled a project with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which agreed to a fast-track grant to develop TKM-Ebola, an anti-Ebola viral therapeutic, according to a company press release. It would augment what the Canadian company had already put into the project as part of a $140 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense starting in 2010.\n\nEconomic fallout\n\nNot surprisingly, after a 2012 outbreak, the Uganda Tourism Association said it expected to lose millions of dollars as people canceled their vacations. It was most keenly felt in the Kibaale district, which is home to a national park known for its abundant population of mountain gorillas and was otherwise a top vacation spot.\n\nBut the tourists were “absolutely petrified,” according to John Hunwick, a British businessman who told the Associated Press that he had lost $6,000 when clients canceled their trips.\n\nBut fears of the disease have affected more than a few tropical vacations.\n\nIn 1990 two Japanese international airlines stopped importing certain species of monkeys, which were known to carry the disease, to protect the country from possible exposure. Korean Airlines later followed suit.\n\nThis caused the costs of medical research to skyrocket, as the price of monkeys jumped from $1,500 to more than $4,000 within just six years, according to a case study published soon after.\n\n“The Ebola virus and the decision not to import the rhesus, cynomolgus and African green monkeys into Japan not only directly affects trade in that there is less trade in these monkeys, but possibly indirectly affects trade in that helpful research is not being done, and new products are not being made.”\n\n“It has been speculated that medical advances are not being made because there are no monkeys to experiment on,” the report added."", 'But beyond immediate expenses, the Ebola virus can also have lasting economic effects on tourism, trade and medical research.\nThere is still no known cure or vaccine for the Ebola, and the virus’s relative rarity means few ventures are working to find them.\nExperts say progress will be slow, since Ebola simply isn’t a priority for big pharmaceutical companies.\nEconomic falloutNot surprisingly, after a 2012 outbreak, the Uganda Tourism Association said it expected to lose millions of dollars as people canceled their vacations.\nIn 1990 two Japanese international airlines stopped importing certain species of monkeys, which were known to carry the disease, to protect the country from possible exposure.']"

An outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus is believed to have killed at least 59 people in Guinea and may already have spread to neighboring Liberia, health officials said Monday, March 25, 2014. (AP Photo/WHO, Christopher Black, HO, File) EDITORIAL USE ONLY\n\nHealth workers in protective hazmat suits treated patients in quarantine centers on Tuesday in a remote corner of Guinea where Ebola has killed at least 60 people in West Africa\'s first outbreak of the deadly virus in two decades.\n\nSeven patients are being hospitalized at one isolation ward in Gueckedou in southern Guinea, while two others are being treated elsewhere, said Doctors Without Borders. The aid group said it is sending mobile teams into the surrounding countryside in search of people who may have been exposed since the first cases emerged last week.\n\n""To confine the epidemic, it is critical to trace the entire transmission chain,"" said Dr. Esther Sterk, a tropical medicine adviser for the medical group. ""All individuals who have had contact with patients who may be contaminated are monitored and isolated at the first sign of infection.""\n\nSix of the seven blood samples sent to France from Guinea had tested positive for Ebola, specifically the Zaire strain of the disease originating from Congo which has up to a 90 percent fatality rate, the World Health Organization said Tuesday.\n\nEbola has no vaccine or specific treatment. Its initial symptoms—high fever, weakness and headache—can mimic malaria, a much more common disease in West Africa. Once the virus has caused hemorrhaging, though, victims can start vomiting blood or bleeding from their nose and gums.\n\nSome 1,500 of the 2,220 cases recorded since the virus was first discovered in 1976 have been fatal, experts say. So far the fatality rate in Guinea has been 70 percent, according to Dr. Sakoba Keita, a spokesman with the health ministry.\n\nThose grim statistics are fueling fear amid the first outbreak in this part of West Africa in 20 years. So far at least 60 people have died in Guinea, a desperately poor country with limited health facilities, Keita said.\n\nThe outbreak has raised alarm in neighboring countries. Across the border in Liberia, officials are already investigating eight cases—including five deaths—suspected of having links to the Guinea cases. Those patients traveled across the border into Liberia in search of medical treatment, health officials said there.\n\nAuthorities in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast say they are closely monitoring along their borders for possible cases.\n\nThe last case reported in West Africa was in Ivory Coast back in 1994. More recent outbreaks have emerged in Congo and Uganda.\n\nIt is unclear why the virus has now emerged in Guinea though Dr. Armand Sprecher, a public health specialist with Doctors Without Borders, said the virus is carried by bats in the region.\n\n""It comes out of its reservoir when people eat bats or when bats share a tree with chimps or gorillas who are eating fruit,"" he explained. ""The chimps and gorillas become sick and become easy targets for bush meat hunters.""\n\nGrieving relatives also can contract the virus when they come into contact with the bodies of victims during communal funerals, health officials say.

But large outbreaks like this have happened only about once per decade, and most years the WHO records a handful of cases or none at all.\n\nIn comparison, according to the WHO, malaria kills 1.2 million people annually, while 100,000 to 120,000 people die every year from cholera.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada has posted a list of 32 of the most prominent diseases travellers need to be concerned about.\n\nMark Tyndall, head of the division of infectious diseases at the Ottawa Hospital, says that worried flyers should consult a travel physician to find out if there are specific health concerns and precautions for the regions they plan to visit.\n\n“We have quite a good network in Canada of travel clinics, and if people are traveling, they should take advantage of these places where people know exactly what [travellers] should be concerned about for different countries,” he says.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the most infectious diseases around the world.\n\nFood- and water-borne diseases\n\nCountries such as Mexico and Cuba are popular destinations for Canadian travellers, but visitors run the risk of contracting food- and water-borne illnesses due to bacteria such as E. Coli, which can contribute to so-called “traveller’s diarrhea,” as well as diseases such as hepatitis A, which in extreme cases can lead to liver damage.\n\nAccording to the Public Health Agency of Canada, E. Coli and hepatitis A thrive in “locations with poor sanitation or unsafe food handling practices.”\n\nThere are immunizations available for hepatitis A.\n\nAs for those nasty E. Coli bacteria, Tyndall says “we can’t do much about that other than equip people with some antibiotics to take with them in case they get diarrhea.”\n\nTyndall says typhoid fever, a bacterial disease transmitted through food or water contaminated with the feces of an infected person, remains a particular concern in many Asian countries. A typhoid infection typically lasts four weeks, and can include severe stomach pain, internal hemorrhaging and even fits of delirium.\n\nA typhoid vaccine is available, although it is not 100 per cent protective, says Tyndall.\n\nInsect-borne diseases\n\n“Vector-borne” diseases — or diseases transmitted by insects and ticks — affect millions of people every year.\n\nMalaria, the most deadly vector-borne disease, kills more than 1.2 million people annually - mostly African children under the age of five, according to WHO.\n\nInsect-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are typically found in subtropical countries and are transmitted by mosquitoes. Both diseases can produce headaches, joint pain and vomiting, but the latter can develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can lead to significant blood loss.\n\nThere is no effective vaccine for either disease.\n\nAirborne diseases\n\nFor many people, the most frightening diseases are those that are transmitted via the air. Spread by coughing and sneezing, measles is one of the most contagious viruses known to science.\n\nMeasles, which produces a fever and severe rashes, kills an estimated 122,000 children every year, according to the U.S.-based Measles & Rubella Initiative. Most North Americans are immunized as children against measles, but it remains a major concern in India and southern Africa.\n\nTuberculosis, another airborne disease, killed 1.3 million people in 2012, according to WHO. It is a leading killer of people with HIV. TB is caused by bacteria that typically affect the lungs, leading to chronic cough, fever and weight loss. Travellers can be vaccinated for TB.\n\nDiseases transmitted by bodily fluids or blood\n\nAlthough Ebola gets a lot of media attention, the Lassa hemorrhagic fever is far more prevalent, says Jeffrey Lee, an assistant professor in the department of laboratory medicine and pathobiology at the University of Toronto.\n\nThe Lassa virus, which is endemic in west African countries such as Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria, infects between a quarter to half a million people a year and kills nearly 10,000 people annually, Lee says.\n\n“With Ebola, we have these [small] outbreaks, but the Lassa virus is definitely more of an emerging virus,” he adds.\n\nAs with Ebola, there is no vaccine for Lassa.\n\nLike Ebola, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is transmitted by bodily fluids — typically through unprotected sex or the sharing of dirty needles. HIV can develop into auto-immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which weakens a person’s immune system to the point where the body can no longer fight off infection. Although the death rate of HIV/AIDS has dropped significantly in the past decade, it still killed an estimated 1.6 million people in 2012, according to WHO.\n\nHIV is a worldwide health concern, but Tyndall says that given the public awareness of it, he says he “can’t remember seeing a return traveller who contracted HIV.”\n\nHe acknowledges that “there’s a lot of risky behaviour that people engage in,” but when it comes to HIV, he advises travellers to simply use common sense.\n\n“Whether you’re in Canada or Nairobi, you probably don’t want to have unprotected sex with people you don’t know.”\n\nAlso on HuffPost', 'An outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the west African nation of Guinea has revived fears of a global contagion, but infectious disease experts say Ebola poses little threat to travellers.\nIn terms of transmission, he adds, “there are far worse diseases out there.”The biggest recorded outbreak of Ebola was in 2000 in Uganda, with 425 infected and 224 dying as a result, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada has posted a list of 32 of the most prominent diseases travellers need to be concerned about.\nInsect-borne diseases“Vector-borne” diseases — or diseases transmitted by insects and ticks — affect millions of people every year.\nInsect-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are typically found in subtropical countries and are transmitted by mosquitoes.']"

Picture: Saliou Samb Monrovia/Conakry - West African nations scrambled on Tuesday to contain an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus suspected to have killed at least 59 people in Guinea, with symptoms of the disease reported in neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia as well. The spread of Ebola, one of the most lethal infectious diseases known, has spooked nations with weak health-care systems. In Guinea's south-east, home to all the confirmed cases, residents are avoiding large gatherings and prices in some markets have spiked as transporters avoid the area. Health authorities in Liberia said they had now recorded eight suspected cases of Ebola, mainly in people who crossed the border from Guinea. Five of these had died but tests were still being carried out to check if the cases were indeed Ebola. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said a total of 86 suspected cases, including 59 deaths, had been reported in south-eastern Guinea near the border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Laboratory tests have confirmed 13 cases of Ebola in Guinea so far, the first outbreak of the disease in West Africa. “People are really frightened. They have seen people die in a matter of just two or three days. They are constantly worried who is going to be the next fatality,” said Joseph Gbaka Sandounou, who manages operations for aid agency Plan International in Guekedou.\n\n“People have never experienced anything like this before. Rumours are rife among communities who are trying to come up with their own explanations.”\n\nSamples taken from those who died in Liberia had been sent to Conakry for testing, according to the Geneva-based WHO.\n\nIn Guinea, authorities have taken steps to quarantine suspected cases in the districts of Guekedou, Macenta, Nzerekore and Kissidougou.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, authorities set up a task force after the death of a 14-year-old boy who had attended the funeral of a suspected Ebola victim. Authorities have yet to confirm if the boy died of the disease.\n\nA Canadian who displayed Ebola-like symptoms after travelling to West Africa had tested negative, the WHO said.\n\nEbola was discovered in 1976 in then-Zaire, now Democratic Republic of Congo. Scientists have identified the outbreak in Guinea as the virulent Zaire strain of the virus.\n\nBecause people who fall sick with it tend to vomit, have diarrhoea and suffer both internal and external bleeding, their bodies are often “covered in virus”, explained Peter Piot, one of the co-discoverers of Ebola and now director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nThis means anyone in close contact with them - such as nurses, doctors and carers - is at risk, he said.\n\nThe virus causes a raging fever, headaches, muscle pain, conjunctivitis and weakness, before moving into more severe phases of causing vomiting, diarrhoea and haemorrhages.\n\nIn the southeastern Guinea town of Macenta, prices - especially for products like chlorine - have risen due to shortages, resident Mamady Drame said.\n\nPeople have also started avoiding shaking hands. “Can you imagine that people are hesitant to even greet each other?

Eighty-six people have so far been infected. Authorities are urging restriction of movement and observance of hygiene to prevent further infections.\n\nThe cases have mainly been reported in the four southern districts of Guéckédou, Macenta, Nzérékoré and Kissidougou near the border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has dispatched some 33 tons of medicines and equipment to Guinea to help curtail the epidemic which is infecting 1-3 people a day.\n\n“It’s happening along the border, so what we’ve been doing now is to start a collaboration between these neighbouring countries,” said Francis Kasolo, director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Disease Prevention and Control Unit in Africa. “Conferences are being held between these three countries to ensure that whenever there is a suspected case it can be identified quickly and appropriate response can be taken.”\n\nIn Guinea’s Guéckédou area, district health chief Moussa Kolié said: “We have begun training nurses to help contain as much as possible the spread of new cases.” Funeral gatherings and unnecessary hospital visits were being discouraged, he said.\n\nMSF has deployed medical teams to Guinea’s affected areas, where the organization is setting up isolation centres and people thought to have been in contact with those infected are traced and also quarantined.\n\n“This is the only way to try and contain the spread,” Reinaldo Ortuno, a doctor with MSF, told IRIN.\n\nOrtuno pointed out that the failure of the epidemiology surveillance system explains the high number of cases registered so far.\n\nSakoba Kéïta, head of Guinea’s Health Ministry disease prevention unit, called for the observance of basic hygiene and avoiding eating meat the origin of which is unknown.\n\n“We are calling on those who attended funerals of those who died of this disease to present themselves for identification and wash all their items with chlorine solution… and ensure they get medical observation for at least three weeks to one month,” Kéïta said.\n\nEbola is transmitted to humans through contact with blood, body fluids or organs of infected animals. Infections have been reported in Africa following the handling of chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, or antelopes and porcupines in tropical forests, according to WHO.\n\nLiberia\n\nLiberia’s Health Ministry confirmed that five people have died of suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the north of the country. The four women and one child are said to have come from Guinea to seek treatment in Foya in Liberia’s northern Lofa County. Chief Medical Officer Bernice Dahn said a medical team had been sent to the area.\n\n“The team is already investigating the situation, tracing contacts, collecting blood samples and sensitizing local health authorities on the disease,” Dahn told reporters.\n\n“This disease has really caught us off-guard. People are now avoiding each other in the town. There are no more greetings. Panic is overshadowing hospitality”\n\nHowever, the deaths have yet to be confirmed as being due to Ebola. “We need to confirm these cases to know what we are dealing with,” said Peter Clement, WHO’s acting country director.\n\n“The key message is that … we shouldn’t panic because it can be prevented. All of us should be responsible. It can be contained. We are working hand-in-hand with the Ministry of Health to be able to mobilize the necessary support,” Clement said.\n\nLiberia’s Health Minister Walter Gwenigale said market traders who cross to Guinean markets should avoid venturing into the affected districts of Guinea. “If you are living along the border and you really do not have any reason to go into towns where this disease is reported, you do not have to go there,” he said.\n\nGuinea’s public health system is weak and has been reliant on donor funding which was suspended due to political instability, affecting public services.\n\n“The government does not even have a laboratory to quickly verify the nature of this [Ebola] disease. This is why the death toll is high,” said Conakry resident Fodé Camara\n\nIn Liberia, the health sector has yet to fully recover from the devastation of the country’s civil war. “Most of the hospitals, clinics and equipment were destroyed during the years of civil conflict. The strengthening of the health sector faced financial problems. The country heavily relied on the international community for health infrastructure and aid,” said health worker Martha Paye.\n\n“This disease has really caught us off-guard”\n\nAuthorities in Guinea and Liberia have urged citizens not to panic, but many are scared of contracting Ebola, which has emerged in West Africa for the first time.\n\n“This disease has really caught us off-guard. People are now avoiding each other in the town. There are no more greetings. Panic is overshadowing hospitality. Bodies can’t be washed [before burial], but that is alright because prevention is better than cure,” said Guéckédou resident Atanasse Tinkiano.\n\nGuinea’s government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara said health and public awareness measures were being taken and “I think that if all these measures are respected, the worst can be avoided.”\n\n“I am deeply worried,” said Liberian journalist Jallah Grayfield. “What is mostly disturbing is that the disease has no cure.”\n\nac/jl/pc/ob/cb', 'Ebola is transmitted to humans through contact with blood, body fluids or organs of infected animals.\nLiberiaLiberia’s Health Ministry confirmed that five people have died of suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the north of the country.\nPanic is overshadowing hospitality”However, the deaths have yet to be confirmed as being due to Ebola.\n“The government does not even have a laboratory to quickly verify the nature of this [Ebola] disease.\n“This disease has really caught us off-guard”Authorities in Guinea and Liberia have urged citizens not to panic, but many are scared of contracting Ebola, which has emerged in West Africa for the first time.']"

The latest official statistics put the toll at 86 suspected cases and 60 deaths. The priority of the teams on site is to identify patients with Ebola symptoms and isolate them, while providing high-quality care. In cooperation with the Ministry of Health, MSF created an isolation facility in Guéckédou and is setting up another in Macenta. Both towns are in the Forestière region of southern Guinea. Mobile teams are also evaluating the situation in Kissidougou and Nzérékoré and are monitoring bordering countries closely, particularly Sierra Leone and Liberia, where suspected cases have been reported.\n\nEbola: the basics\n\nEbola refers to several strains of the same virus, first identified in humans in 1976 in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), along the Ebola River. Ebola viruses produce devastating illnesses, most often leading to death. They cause hemorrhagic fevers, which lead to internal and external bleeding, similar to Marburg fever, which results from a related virus. There is no treatment and no vaccine.\n\nCertain species of bats living in the tropical forests of Central and West Africa are thought to be Ebola’s natural reservoir. While they carry viruses, they show no symptoms and appear to contaminate large monkeys and humans through their droppings or bites. Humans can also catch the virus after contact with infected animals, dead or living, or from other infected persons.\n\nThe last Ebola epidemics killed several dozen people in late summer 2012 in Uganda and DRC. Although it is very dangerous, Ebola remains rare. Since the virus was discovered in 1976, approximately 2,200 cases have been recorded. Of those, 1,500 were fatal. However, sporadic cases and, even, epidemics have certainly gone undetected because they occur in very areas where people lack access to medical care.\n\n***\n\nDr. Esther Sterk specializes in tropical diseases at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). She has worked on many missions, including several Ebola epidemics in Uganda and DRC, most recently in summer 2012.\n\nWhat are Ebola’s distinctive features?\n\nThis is a rare disease. Epidemics are limited, but they create panic every time because Ebola is fatal in 25 – 90% of cases. After an incubation period of two to 21 days, the virus causes a raging fever, headaches, muscle pain, conjunctivitis and general weakness. The next phase involves vomiting, diarrhea and, sometimes, a rash. The virus spreads in the blood and paralyzes the immune system. It is particularly formidable because the body does not detect these viruses right away. When the organism does respond, it is often too late. By then, the viruses have created blood clots, which block vital organs and cause major hemorrhages. Patients may have heavy bleeding, including from the nose or via their urine.\n\nThe disease is transmitted by contact with the fluids of infected people or animals, such as urine, sweat, blood or mother’s milk. Family members and health care workers treating patients are at great risk of infection. The high mortality rate and bleeding are so frightening that health care workers often flee, abandoning patients.\n\nFuneral traditions in which family members wash the body of the deceased are also a major means of transmission in African communities.\n\nHow does MSF respond to Ebola epidemics, given that there is no treatment?\n\nAlthough there is no cure for this disease, we can reduce its very high mortality by addressing the symptoms. This includes administering a drip to patients who have become dehydrated from diarrhea and by confirming that they do not have a different disease, such as malaria or a bacterial infection like typhoid. Vitamins and anti-pain medication can also be useful. When the person loses consciousness and bleeds copiously, there is no hope. At that point, we ease the patient’s pain and stay with him until the end.\n\nStory continues', 'The priority of the teams on site is to identify patients with Ebola symptoms and isolate them, while providing high-quality care.\nIn cooperation with the Ministry of Health, MSF created an isolation facility in Guéckédou and is setting up another in Macenta.\nEbola viruses produce devastating illnesses, most often leading to death.\nThe last Ebola epidemics killed several dozen people in late summer 2012 in Uganda and DRC.\nShe has worked on many missions, including several Ebola epidemics in Uganda and DRC, most recently in summer 2012.']"

46443,http://www.chattanoogan.com/2014/3/26/272726/Roy-Exum-Were-Lousy-And-Other-Stuff.aspx,health,"['Wow! It sure didn’t take long for word to get out that Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke had signed a “Memorandum of Understanding” with the Service Employees International Union just two days before workers at the Volkswagen plant repelled a $5 million effort by the United Auto Workers in mid-February. Give me another reason why we just got ranked among the lousiest communities in America.\n\nA new Gallup poll named the top 10 communities in the country yesterday for “overall well-being” and, while the Provo-Orem area of Utah was first on the list, Chattanooga was nowhere to be found. Instead the Gallup folks also listed the “Bottom 11 Communities” of 189 they surveyed across America and – presto – Chattanooga was at the bottom of that list.\n\nOh, to be honest, that means Chattanooga is only the 11th worst (in descending order) and our union strife is certainly not the only factor the “well-being” criteria considers. According to the pollsters there are “six sub-indexes, which individually examine life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviors, and access to basic necessities.”\n\nThe top five areas in the country on Gallup’s yearly list are the Provo area; Boulder, Colo.; Fort Collins-Loveland, Colo., Honolulu, Hawaii; and San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA. The Provo-Orem area had a composite score of 71.4 while Huntington-Ashland, WV, was the only community to score lower that 60 with a 59.5 index, which made it the worst of the whole bunch.\n\n“Chattanooga TN-GA” had a 62.9 rating so I can’t figure out what put us above three other places that had an identical number – Evansville IN-KY; Mobile, AL; and Shreveport-Bossier City, LA. Another West Virginia City, Charleston, was second among the worst, followed by Redding, CA; Spartanburg, SC; Hickory-Lenoir-Morgantown NC; and Beaumont-Port Arthur, TX.\n\nThe new release by Gallup read, “With about 80 percent of Americans living in urban or suburban areas, the role of cities in spearheading the well-being of the U.S. is significant. City leadership -- be it government, business, faith-based, community-based, or education -- plays a critical role in the success or failure of a city to embrace and sustain a culture of well-being.”\n\nThe Gallup poll is very important for two reasons. First, large companies and corporations study it when searching for new facilities and areas to expand. Secondly, and much more significantly, it is a clear indication of how important every single vote is in this, the 11th worst community in America when it comes to well-being.\n\n* * *\n\nHolly Warlick, whose top-seeded Lady Vols are now cruising in the NCAA tournament, will be the guest speaker at the Orange Grove Center when the annual “Breakfast of Champions” is held on Friday, April 11, at 7:30 a.m.\n\nLast year UT football coach Butch Jones wowed the crowd but Warlick may be more popular if she brings a big basketball trophy with her -- the Tennessee women have already posted two wins in the “Big Dance” by 24 and 16-point margins. The Lady Vols, now 29-5 after winning 15 of the last 16 games, play in the semifinals this Sunday in Louisville. The women’s Final Four will be in Nashville April 6 and 8.\n\n* * *\n\nA new study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that Tennessee now leads the country in employees who make the minimum wage of $7.25. It was reported that 7.4 percent of employees in Tennessee are paid the bare minimum, an increase of 31,000 people from the year before. Nationally the number of minimum-wage workers has dropped.\n\n* * *\n\nDo you think people will remember there were snow flurries on Lookout Mountain yesterday when temperatures will be in the mid-60s tomorrow? I know all about how “March comes in like a lion” but the lamb needs to hurry up.\n\n* * *\n\nQUICK ONE LINERS …\n\n-- I wrote about the Common Core on Tuesday, the exact same day the state of Indiana voted to pull out of the program. Oklahoma’s legislature is considering the same action. As South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley noted, “They’re still trying to put us all in one basket, and we’re not to be put in one basket.”\n\n-- A teacher writes to me, “Students today are told parents that they can do no wrong. With that piece of information they come to school thinking that they can say and do anything they wish. It would amaze you the things that are said to teachers today in our high schools. I know this because I once was a teacher myself ... Without proper discipline the greatest teacher in the world cannot impart information to children of any age.”\n\n-- The city of Chattanooga’s puzzling agreement with the Service Employees International Union is attracting a lot of stares and raised eyebrows. As one expert noted, “I am amazed that this policy agreement which has both a contract and a financial component to it was signed by the Mayor. This is a Council role, not an executive role. He has to have authorization.”\n\n-- Apparently some bills in the Tennessee legislature are being hijacked and changed so committee chairmen like Mark White (R-Memphis) are asking members to promise they won\'t let bills morph into something unauthorized. During a recent meeting of the House Education Subcommittee, White had this exchange with Raumesh Akbari (D-Memphis):\n\nWHITE: ""If your bill, when it moves out of this committee, is amended in any way, other than the intention of your bill, will you bring it back to this subcommittee?""\n\nAKBARI: ""I definitely will.""\n\nWHITE: ""OK, thank you very... You forget to say cross your heart and hope to die?""\n\nAKBARI: ""Cross my heart, hope to die, so help me God."" (laughing)\n\n-- As far as states were ranked according to “well-being” by yesterday’s Gallup Poll, North Dakota was tops, West Virginia was last and Tennessee was No. 47, three ahead of Alabama.\n\nroyexum@aol.com', 'Instead the Gallup folks also listed the “Bottom 11 Communities” of 189 they surveyed across America and – presto – Chattanooga was at the bottom of that list.\nAnother West Virginia City, Charleston, was second among the worst, followed by Redding, CA; Spartanburg, SC; Hickory-Lenoir-Morgantown NC; and Beaumont-Port Arthur, TX.\nThe Lady Vols, now 29-5 after winning 15 of the last 16 games, play in the semifinals this Sunday in Louisville.\nIt was reported that 7.4 percent of employees in Tennessee are paid the bare minimum, an increase of 31,000 people from the year before.\n(laughing)-- As far as states were ranked according to “well-being” by yesterday’s Gallup Poll, North Dakota was tops, West Virginia was last and Tennessee was No.']"

West Virginia includes at least part of two low-ranking metro areas, and the state also ranked last in the country for well-being in 2013.\n\nOn the other hand, California ranked 17th for well-being in 2013 and, in the current survey, has three metro areas in the top 10, Gallup said.\n\nWhen looking at just the nation\'s 52 largest metro areas (with a population of 1 million or more), San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, Calif. ranked first in overall well-being, followed by San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont, Calif., and Washington, D.C.-Arlington-Alexandria, which spans parts of Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia.\n\nThe metro area with the best scores for physical health and access to basic necessities was Holland-Grand Haven, Mich., while San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles, Calif., ranked highest in work environment.\n\nCity leadership, such as government and community-based leadership, play a critical role in how well a city sustains a culture of well-being, according to Gallup.\n\n""There are tangible policies that communities can adopt to actively cultivate and improve residents\' well-being,"" Dan Buettner, founder of Blue Zones LLC, a project by Healthways that aims to make communities healthier, said in a statement. These include policies that nugget people into healthy activities, such as those that would make it easier to walk to the store and get access to fresh produce, Buettner said.\n\nThe survey results are based on telephone interviews with more than 531,000 U.S. adults conducted between Jan. 2, 2012 and Dec. 30, 2013.\n\nFollow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner.

That\'s a one spot drop from the prior year – but Minnesota is the only state to be in the top five both years. North Dakota finished first, South Dakota second, and Nebraska third. (Note: You can see the full 43-page report by clicking here).\n\nThe index, according to its creators, ""provides an in-depth, real-time view of Americans’ perceptions of their well-being."" It looks at 55 measures of well-being that go beyond traditional data, Gallup Healthways says.\n\nThe grades are determined by surveying a number of residents in each state – 3,690 in Minnesota\'s case – about their quality of life, broken up into six different sub-categories. Minnesota\'s highest marks from its own residents came in Basic Access and Physical Health; the state finished second overall in both categories. It ranked sixth in Life Evaluation, seventh in Emotional Health and eighth in Work Environment. It\'s worst grade came in the Healthy Behaviors category, where it ranked 15th.\n\nBroken down to cities, the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington in the Minnesota-Wisconsin region ranked fourth among large communities (San Jose, San Francisco-Oakland, and Washington D.C. area came in ahead). Among all cities, regardless of size, it finished 13th overall. Duluth is 64th overall.\n\nMadison, Wisconsin ranked 10th among mid-size communities (and 16th overall); Sioux Falls, South Dakota was fifth in small communities (22nd overall).\n\nProvo-Orem in Utah topped the overall list.\n\nNorth Dakota continues its recent run of topping national rankings: The state led the country in job creation in 2013, came in as the happiest state in a recent ranking, and shot up the charts more than any of its counterparts in terms of the number of millionaires. Fresh in the midst of an oil boom, North Dakota ranked first overall – jumping way up from 2012\'s ranking of 19th.\n\nMinnesota and North Dakota were two of six states Gallup Healthways says distinguish themselves as America\'s top well-being states, by averaging a composite score of 68.4 or higher during all six years of the index\'s existence.

This is an eighth of all deaths in the world.\n\nWith a total of 5.9 million pollution-related deaths, low and middle income countries in Southeast Asia including India and countries in the Western pacific were the worst off.\n\nUnion health ministry had set up a committee in January 2014 to examine the health effects of air pollution.\n\nRisks from air pollution are far greater than previously thought, particularly in terms of heart disease and strokes. Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution. The evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we breathe, said Dr Maria Neira, director of WHOs department of public health, environmental and social determinants of health.\n\nThe biggest culprits for indoor air pollution in countries like India are solid fuels like wood crop wastes, charcoal and coal used in open fires for cooking. Globally about 3 million people cook this way, often in poorly ventilated spaces where indoor smoke can be up to 100 times more than acceptable levels for particles like soot that penetrate into lungs.\n\nWith more than 50% of premature deaths among children due to pneumonia caused by inhaling this soot and 3.8 million premature deaths annually due to non-communicable diseases like stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer attributed to exposure to household air pollution, indoor air pollution is the cause of high levels of maternal and infant mortality WHO estimates state outdoor pollution was responsible for 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012, of which 88% were in countries in Southeast Asia and Western Pacific due to burning of agricultural waste, forest fires and charcoal production.\n\nPhotos: Former Infosys honcho V Balakrishnan declares Rs 189-cr in assets\n\nIt will not suffice to say that pollution is a side-effect of development.

WHO said there were about 3.7 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2012, of which nearly 90 percent were in developing countries.\n\nBut WHO noted that many people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap, mortality attributed to the two sources cannot simply added together, hence WHO said it lowered the total estimate from around 8 million to 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\nThe new estimates are more than double previous figures and based mostly on modelling. The increase is partly due to better information about the health effects of pollution and improved detection methods.

Scientists also suspect air pollution may be to blame for inflammation in the heart, leading to chronic problems or a heart attack.\n\n“We all have to breathe, which makes pollution very hard to avoid,” said Frank Kelly, director of the environmental research group at King’s College London, who was not part of the WHO report.\n\nOther experts said more research was needed to identify the deadliest components of pollution in order to target control measures more effectively.\n\n“We don’t know if dust from the Sahara is as bad as diesel fuel or burning coal,” said Majid Ezzati, chair in global environmental health at Imperial College London.\n\nThe hardest-hit regions were what the WHO labels Southeast Asia, which includes India and Indonesia, and the Western Pacific, ranging from China to the Philippines. They accounted for 3.3 million deaths related to indoor pollution and 2.6 million for the outdoor form, for a total of 5.1 million once the overlap is taken into account.\n\nIn Africa, the combined death toll was 680,000, while some 400,000 died in the Middle East, 287,000 in low- and middle-income European countries and 131,000 in Latin America.\n\nHigh-income nations of Europe saw 295,000 deaths, while 96,000 died in North America and 68,000 in rich Pacific countries, including Australia and Japan.\n\nDespite the increasing use of face masks in heavily polluted cities such as Beijing and Tokyo, Kelly said there was little evidence that they work.\n\n“The real problem is that wearing masks sends out the message we can live with polluted air,” he said. “We need to change our way of life entirely to reduce pollution.”\n\nWomen more at risk\n\nWHO’s report noted women had higher levels of exposure than men in developing countries.\n\n“Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves,” Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General for family, women and children’s health, said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the WHO, some 2.9 billion people in poor nations live in homes where fires are the main method of cooking and heating, and thus breathe in soot.\n\n“Having an open fire in your kitchen is like burning 400 cigarettes an hour,” said environmental health expert Kirk Smith, of the University of California at Berkeley, noting that indoor pollution is the largest single health risk for women and girls in India, for example.\n\nIn addition to the impact on individuals, 500,000 premature deaths a year are thought to be caused by air pollution in China, for example, the economic burden is huge.\n\nA joint report by the World Bank and Chinese authorities released Tuesday showed that pollution-related death and illness cost the country as much as $300 billion a year.\n\n“You can’t buy clean air in a bottle,” said Carlos Dora, the WHO’s public and environmental health coordinator. “The air is a shared resource.

This finding more than doubles previous estimates and confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk. Reducing air pollution could save millions of lives.\n\nIn particular, the new data reveal a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer. This is in addition to air pollution’s role in the development of respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.\n\nThe new estimates are not only based on more knowledge about the diseases caused by air pollution, but also upon better assessment of human exposure to air pollutants through the use of improved measurements and technology. This has enabled scientists to make a more detailed analysis of health risks from a wider demographic spread that now includes rural as well as urban areas.\n\nRegionally, low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution.\n\n“Cleaning up the air we breathe prevents non-communicable diseases as well as reduces disease risks among women and vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly,” says Dr Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General Family, Women and Children’s Health.\n\n“Poor women and children pay a heavy price from indoor air pollution since they spend more time at home breathing in smoke and soot from leaky coal and wood cook stoves.”\n\nThe new estimates are based on the latest WHO mortality data from 2012 as well as evidence of health risks from air pollution exposures. Estimates of people’s exposure to outdoor air pollution in different parts of the world were formulated through a new global data mapping. This incorporated satellite data, ground-level monitoring measurements and data on pollution emissions from key sources, as well as modeling of how pollution drifts in the air.\n\n“The risks from air pollution are now far greater than previously thought or understood, particularly for heart disease and strokes,” says Dr Maria Neira, Director of WHO’s Department for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “Few risks have a greater impact on global health today than air pollution; the evidence signals the need for concerted action to clean up the air we all breathe.”\n\nAfter analyzing the risk factors and taking into account revisions in methodology, WHO estimates indoor air pollution was linked to 4.3 million deaths in 2012 in households cooking over coal, wood and biomass stoves. The new estimate is explained by better information about pollution exposures among the estimated 2.9 billion people living in homes using wood, coal or dung as their primary cooking fuel, as well as evidence about air pollution's role in the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancers.\n\nIn the case of outdoor air pollution, WHO estimates there were 3.7 million deaths in 2012 from urban and rural sources worldwide.\n\nMany people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution. Due to this overlap, mortality attributed to the two sources cannot simply be added together, hence the total estimate of around 7 million deaths in 2012.\n\n“Excessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry. In most cases, healthier strategies will also be more economical in the long term due to health-care cost savings as well as climate gains,” says Dr Carlos Dora, WHO Coordinator for Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health. “WHO and health sectors have a unique role in translating scientific evidence on air pollution into policies that can deliver impact and improvements that will save lives.”"", 'Air pollution exposure responsible for 7 million deaths in 2012, says WHO26th Wednesday, March 2014 - 06:09 UTC Full articleExternal air pollution can be appreciated in the overcrowded cities with clogged transport systemsInternal air pollution is caused by people living in homes using wood, coal or dung as the primary cooking fuelIn new estimates the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that in 2012 around 7 million people died - one in eight of total global deaths – as a result of air pollution exposure.\nIn particular, the new data reveal a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases, such as strokes and ischemic heart disease, as well as between air pollution and cancer.\nRegionally, low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the largest air pollution-related burden in 2012, with a total of 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution and 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution.\nIn the case of outdoor air pollution, WHO estimates there were 3.7 million deaths in 2012 from urban and rural sources worldwide.\n“Excessive air pollution is often a by-product of unsustainable policies in sectors such as transport, energy, waste management and industry.']"
