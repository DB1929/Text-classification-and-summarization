Electronic implants are placed on top of the retina and work in conjunction with an external camera, glasses, and video processing unit. Images captured by the camera are converted into a signal and sent to the implants, stimulating the retina’s remaining healthy cells to pass the signal along to the optic nerve — and ultimately allowing the eye to “see” again.\n\nHow is the bionic eye working out for Pontz so far?\n\n“It’s awesome. It’s exciting — seeing something new every day,” he says.\n\nPontz is one of just four Americans to be fitted with the artificial retina; the system was only cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration last year. But with the success that bionic eye procedures have had in Europe over the past few years, the high-tech device is expected to find continued success in the U.S., too. Twelve centers — including one at the University of Michigan where Pontz received his implant — are now accepting patient consultations.\n\nThanks to the bionic eye, Pontz can now make out glimpses of his cat, his grandson, and his wife Terri. And though Terri drives her husband nearly 200 miles to the university for check-ups and occupational therapy, she says she’ll gladly make the long trek.\n\n“What’s it worth to see again?

It was a statement of hope rather than science.\n\n\n\nResearchers in France and the United States had discovered what was behind the AIDS epidemic, and the news was not as promising as Heckler would have the public believe. Yes, it was a virus, but not just any virus. The retrovirus discovered that year, later named HIV, is part of a family of viruses known to camouflage themselves within human DNA. No one knew how to treat them. For most virologists, the end of the epidemic seemed far away. When Heckler made the stunning announcement in 1984, perhaps her forceful language was compensation for years of White House inaction.\n\n\n\nIn 1982, a reporter at a White House briefing asked President Ronald Reagan�s press secretary, Larry Speakes, if the president had any reaction to the AIDS crisis. He responded, �What�s AIDS?� The reporter said that it was known as the �gay plague� and was responsible for hundreds of deaths. The room erupted in laughter. Speakes brushed off the question as a playful lark. Reagan did not make his first major speech on the issue until May 1987. By then, the epidemic had spread to 113 nations, 36,000 Americans were infected with HIV, and 21,000 Americans had died of AIDS.\n\n\n\nIn 1984, the stigma associated with HIV was crushing. Some of those we depend on most in an emergency � firefighters, police officers, doctors and hospitals � refused to take care of people with HIV. Those with AIDS found the physical manifestations of the disease � sunken cheeks and purplish pock marks called Kaposi�s sarcoma � isolating. HIV-positive children, notably Ryan White, were banned from school.\n\n\n\nThe virus brought the ugliness of homophobia to light. Insidiously, it even invaded our science. Some researchers refrained from working on the disease because of its association with gay men. Others found themselves having to defend their work on a disease perceived by critics as a lifestyle choice. Dr. Anthony Fauci, today the head of the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Disease, famously rebutted detractors when he said, �What lifestyle did the fetus undertake to acquire the disease?�\n\n\n\nIn the 30 years since we discovered HIV, the stigma surrounding it has lessened, but it has never completely dissipated. And new threats loom: apathy and ignorance. AIDS advocacy groups are suffering from �prevention fatigue.� The waning interest in prevention has propelled rising HIV infections in adolescents and young adults in comparison with other age groups. Of the estimated 1.1 million Americans living with HIV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that 16 percent do not know their HIV status. This number is significantly higher for those ages 13 to 24; 60 percent of these individuals don�t know they are infected. Young adults are also more likely to delay treatment, waiting until the virus causes irreparable damage to the body.\n\n\n\nWe�ve also seen the rise of what AIDS policy advocates call �HIV shaming�: situations in which gay men openly discriminate against those with HIV. A generation far removed from the dark days of the disease may not realize that more than 1 million lives are still lost to AIDS annually.\n\n\n\nIn the midst of the cultural lethargy surrounding HIV, the science has never been stronger. Today, thanks to new therapies, people with HIV can live long, healthy lives.\n\n\n\nThere is a small group of patients whose HIV has been cured by radical therapies and whose experiences have fueled promising clinical trials. After two infants were cleared of the virus, we have new hope for eradicating HIV in children.\n\n\n\nA drug called Truvada reportedly is able to reduce the risk of becoming infected with HIV by 75 percent. But it�s used by only a small percentage of those who could benefit from it. The drug has suffered from a poor reputation because some derisively call it a �party drug� and those who take it �Truvada whores.� It�s become a sad example of how cultural attitudes can hamper medicine.\n\n\n\nThirty years ago, Dr. Robert Gallo, the co-discoverer of HIV, stood next to Heckler at that news conference. He felt uneasy when he heard Heckler say a vaccine would be available in two years. Over the next three decades, many guarantees would be made about HIV, almost all of them empty promises. Yet today, Gallo sees the situation finally changing. He says that a �functional cure, I believe, is definitely achievable.�\n\n\n\nAnd in December, the White House announced a $100 million initiative toward finding a cure for HIV. This investment has the potential to make an enormous difference. But research is only one piece of the puzzle. Our ability to treat and cure HIV in the future is threatened by the continued stigma, apathy and ignorance surrounding the virus. HIV at 30 still has a long way to go.\n\n\n\nNathalia Holt is a research scientist and the author of �Cured: How the Berlin Patients Defeated HIV and Forever Changed Medical Science.�', 'By then, the epidemic had spread to 113 nations, 36,000 Americans were infected with HIV, and 21,000 Americans had died of AIDS.\nThose with AIDS found the physical manifestations of the disease � sunken cheeks and purplish pock marks called Kaposi�s sarcoma � isolating.\nWe�ve also seen the rise of what AIDS policy advocates call �HIV shaming�: situations in which gay men openly discriminate against those with HIV.\nIn the midst of the cultural lethargy surrounding HIV, the science has never been stronger.\nOur ability to treat and cure HIV in the future is threatened by the continued stigma, apathy and ignorance surrounding the virus.']"

Since then, the treatment of HIV/AIDS has revolutionized medicine worldwide.\n\nBefore Secretary Heckler made the announcement, over 1,750 Americans had already died from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or from complications of it, and over 2,300 were living with AIDS. The discovery allowed health experts to mass produce large quantities of the virus, which would help them find treatments and develop a cure (which is still nonexistent).\n\n""With the discovery of both the virus and this new process, we now have a blood test for AIDS. With a blood test, we can identify AIDS victims with essentially 100% certainty,"" said Heckler back in 1984, in an interview with MSNBC News.\n\nNonetheless, the virus is survivable, which is a medical milestone. The number of people receiving HIV treatment in low, and middle-income countries have increased 40-fold since 2002. Thanks to the World Health Organization and its partners, awareness of the virus has dramatically increased and each year an International AIDS Conference takes place to determine the status of the virus and how countries can improve HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care.\n\nAt the end of 2012, 35.3 million people were living with HIV. Approximately 50,000 new HIV cases are documented each year in the United States, and you can find information on other countries across the world on the WHO website. Over 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV, according to CDC statistics from 2010, and 44% of those are African American, followed by 31% White, and 21% Hispanic.\n\nHIV is a sexually transmitted infection that is also spread by contact with infected blood, or from mother to child during pregnancy. The virus interferes with your body\'s ability to fight the organisms that cause HIV and it destroys immune cells called ""T lymphocytes"" that play a critical role in cell-meditated immunity. The virus eventually progresses into Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which kills 1.6 million people annually across the world.\n\nYou can read more about the HIV/AIDS virus on the CDC and WHO webistes.', 'On this date thirty years ago, Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler announced the discovery of HIV as the cause for the AIDS virus.\nBefore Secretary Heckler made the announcement, over 1,750 Americans had already died from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or from complications of it, and over 2,300 were living with AIDS.\n""With the discovery of both the virus and this new process, we now have a blood test for AIDS.\nThe number of people receiving HIV treatment in low, and middle-income countries have increased 40-fold since 2002.\nThe virus eventually progresses into Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which kills 1.6 million people annually across the world.']"

It lives in and grows in us like weeds in a beautiful garden. We, the young people of the Diaspora, have been diagnosed with an illness called “stigma.” Youth of African descent strikingly have become critically unaware of the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS on our community.\n\nWithout a doubt, African-American youth in the United States are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. We are the 59 percent affected — 59.5 percent of all newly infected youth were African American in 2010.We are plagued with the separation of our people with this misconception that solely LGBTQ, specifically bisexual/gay male persons of color are responsible for this epidemic. However, this is not the case at all.\n\nYet, this alone has placed heterosexual blacks on the backburner of not being educated on the issue and leaves room for an increase in infection rates. It is a must that we remember Umoja, which means unity. It is imperative that we lean not on our own understanding and open up the floor to conversations we tend to avoid and suffocate ignorance in its entirety. We all are humans and HIV affects everyone worldwide, especially African Americans of all backgrounds and sexual preferences\n\nWe must unify ourselves in education and let us take our sisters and brothers by the hand and go out and get tested. We need to have conversations and spread the word, not the virus. African Americans represented 44 percent of all new HIV infections in 2010, despite representing only 12 percent of the overall U.S. population, according to the CDC. We are all responsible to decrease that number. As part of that statistic, we can be motivated to fight the stigma of HIV/AIDS by recognizing the facts.\n\nNational Youth HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, which was held earlier this month, reminds us that we cannot allow this virus to continue to plague the community. As we black youth observe Youth Pride this weekend in D.C., we must love ourselves and our people by carrying the importance of black love.\n\nSo, I came up with this acronym: E.N.D., which stands for Educate, Notify and Donate. First, educate. It is imperative that we learn more about HIV/AIDS and how we can remain in solidarity to know our status and encouraging other people of color to do the same. Secondly, we have to notify one another of the statistics and remember that we are all at risk of contracting this virus. Lastly, donate your time, mind, and efforts to advancing awareness. Monetarily invest in resources that support all of our people affected by the virus as well as those who aren’t.\n\nNational Youth HIV/AIDS Awareness Day was the beginning and definitely not the end of our struggle to enhance our mindsets and promote love for one another by diminishing the stigma and taking steps to lower the statistics.\n\nPeace and love my sisters and brothers and remember E.N.D: Educate, Notify, and Donate.', 'We, the young people of the Diaspora, have been diagnosed with an illness called “stigma.” Youth of African descent strikingly have become critically unaware of the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS on our community.\nWithout a doubt, African-American youth in the United States are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS.\nNational Youth HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, which was held earlier this month, reminds us that we cannot allow this virus to continue to plague the community.\nAs we black youth observe Youth Pride this weekend in D.C., we must love ourselves and our people by carrying the importance of black love.\nPeace and love my sisters and brothers and remember E.N.D: Educate, Notify, and Donate.']"

Here, she writes about why, even in the aftermath of a devastating diagnosis, she decided to dedicate her life to helping others.\n\nIt was 1991. A doctor’s sympathetic voice was saying “I’m sorry, Mary,” explaining in gentle terms that my marriage to Brian had brought me not only two beautiful children but also one very ugly virus. I’d tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\n\n\nThere were no life-sustaining therapies then. Brian was soon dead, and I was planning how our two little boys would survive being orphans. In fact, the development of anti-retroviral drug therapies has kept me alive. But word of my impending death had already planted hard questions in my soul: Why am I here? Where will I find joy? Does my life — or, do I — really matter?\n\nI was wrestling with such questions when I spoke to the Republican National Convention in 1992. AIDS was everywhere that political season, on the streets and in the news. Against the backdrop of fury and fear, I admitted, “I would never have asked to be HIV-positive. But I believe that in all things there is good purpose, and so I stand before you, and before the nation, gladly.”\n\nMary Fisher, center, actor Richard Gere, right, and Harvard AIDS Institute chairman Max Essex at an AIDS benefit event in Boston in 1995.

This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\n\nIf, in my own life, there has been “good purpose” in living with AIDS, it has been this: I have learned, repeatedly, that we experience satisfaction and purpose in our lives when we do something kind and caring for others. And, yes, it is that simple.\n\n\n\nOne of my books is a simple journal of photographs and stories about caregivers in the AIDS epidemic. These were people who’d given their lives to the dying. When I asked what gave them strength, they’d tell me stories of the man who smiled when given a cool glass of water, or a patient who’d picked a flower for them, or the dying woman who mouthed, with her last breath, “Thank you for loving me.” They could not save those they loved, but they could love them with good deeds and simple kindnesses.\n\nAnd we may think of scientists and researchers as brainy geniuses who are untroubled by passion. But I’ve met these people: mothers and sisters, fathers and sons, they juggle household budgets and Little League schedules. They giggle and they weep. What fueled their relentless search for the AIDS virus was not a pursuit of fame; it was knowing the pain of the illness, the grief of the dying. What drove them to the point of exhaustion was the desire to save my life. They cared.\n\nBut I’m not a life-saving scientist. I’m just a mother, a worker, a friend. What can I do — really, what can I do — that matters to others?\n\nI can approach each day as an opportunity instead of a burden. When I wake, groggy and longing for coffee, before my brain goes racing off, I can take time to say I’m grateful to be alive. I can see the day as a gift I’ve received, not a right I’ve earned.\n\nI recently met Thomas Morgan who’d invented a 100 Good Deeds Game. He defined a good deed as something we go out of our way to do and tell no one about. Then he challenged his school-aged daughter and son to do a hundred such acts of kindness. His idea inspired me to design the 1GD Bracelet.\n\nThe 1GD bracelet reminds people to stop and commit one good deed. Today\n\nThe 100 Good Deeds collection is intended to inspire simple acts of kindness. Each bracelet reminds us to do good, one deed, one bead, one act of kindness at a time. It recognizes that most of us are willing to help others but we don\'t always see opportunities to help because we aren\'t looking. Or we\'re in a hurry. Or we think we shouldn\'t get involved. We have a hundred reasons not to do what our hearts tell us to do. Every time our fears say ""don\'t do it,"" our bracelet says ""do it!"" It reminds us that getting involved is exactly what we need to do for each other.\n\n\n\nIn the few short weeks we’ve had the 100 Good Deeds website, we’ve heard of people who, when the person in front of them at the grocery check-out ran short of money, paid the stranger’s bill. Anonymously. Someone gave an hour’s babysitting to a frazzled young mother. Someone sent a thank-you note to their local police chief because she provides protection for the community. Such deeds are both good and small. But they matter.\n\nThe world is full of crises and agonies. AIDS continues to ravage and kill, especially the young. Cancer found me in 2012, and finds millions of others each year. Poverty and hunger, riots and wars, screamers on talk radio — it’s enough to make us all weary.\n\nThe antidote to such weariness is within our reach.

158085,http://www.medicaldaily.com/hiv-cause-aids-turns-30-how-far-has-treatment-come-and-where-it-going-278230,health,"['Thirty years ago today, Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler announced before Washington that scientists had discovered the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and it was, she said, “a variant of a known human cancer virus.""\n\nThe assessment was mostly correct. Her later forecast — that a vaccine would be developed within two years — was not. Three decades later and the world is still without a vaccine, let alone a cure. As of this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV has led some 30 million deaths worldwide since the epidemic began in 1981. Each year, roughly 2.5 million people contract the virus, with 50,000 of those infections occurring in the U.S. It is among the top 10 deadliest diseases on the planet.\n\nThe Breakthroughs\n\nThat’s not to say science isn’t putting up a valiant fight. In the 30 years since Secretary Heckler made the historic announcement, for example, researchers have uncovered that HIV isn’t just an ordinary virus. It comes from a family of retroviruses, which means it encodes its own genome in the host in a backward process from other viruses. This makes detecting the virus prior to infection extremely difficult, and part of the reason 1.1 million people are living with HIV in the U.S., while 16 percent of those people don’t know they’re infected.\n\nDr. Robert Gallo, the co-discoverer of HIV as the cause of AIDS, says that of discoveries made in the last 30 years, the advances that strike him as the most monumental happened slightly before the causal discovery, namely, the ability to treat viruses. “It was thought you’d need laser-sharp therapy to inhibit a virus without destroying our cells in the process,” Gallo told Medical Daily. But even in the 1970s, it was found that many retroviruses, including HIV, were susceptible to straightforward attack. “This proved to the pharmaceutical industry that it was doable, and they came running in.”\n\nIn the years that followed, the rush to develop antiretroviral therapies has accelerated immensely. Most recently, in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada as the first and only drug intended to prevent the spread of HIV infection. However, due to poor public awareness, and despite scientific research that dispels such myths, the drug has developed a reputation as a recreational drug used to increase sexual behavior.\n\nMeanwhile, other progress has been made in early treatment, to an extent Gallo called a “functional cure” — where the infection hasn’t exited the body, but the patient has left viral therapy. Two babies have been reported in remission from their HIV, as the infection was passed to them in utero, then treated within hours after the mother gave birth. Such advances offer glimmers of hope in a field that must otherwise rely on lifetime HIV management if sufferers are to live normal, healthy lives free from outside infection from third-party diseases.\n\nCancer is one of these hurdles, Gallo points out. In his current research, performed at the University of Maryland: College Park and the Global Virus Network, a collaboration founded in 2011 by Gallo and a group of like-minded colleagues, Gallo seeks to understand the carcinogenic role HIV can play in host victims. For instance, Kaposi’s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor often associated with AIDS, but caused by the human herpesvirus 8, is invisible in the presence of HIV. But HIV also increases the replication of the virus, increasing its presence. “So a wimpy virus becomes carcinogenic, giving rise to Kaposi’s sarcoma, which has now virtually disappeared for people who have access to therapy,” Gallo said. These, he explains, in combination with insights into lymphoma, have been the “greatest advances” in HIV research.\n\nFor the Next 30 Years\n\nOne of the paralyzing limits of these advances, however, is that learning how to fix the problem doesn’t mean science can do it — similar to the way your brain knows it’s looking at an optical illusion, but that knowledge does nothing to shake the illusion’s effect. Developing a vaccine for HIV needs the development of durable antibodies that can fight the virus quickly enough, before the virus mutates, and broadly enough to cover the various forms of HIV.\n\n“We know these antibodies exist in infected people, but after a long wait and after a lot of different variants of the virus emerges,” Gallo said. “We need to be able to have them at the get-go before infection.”\n\nAn intermediate hurdle is public awareness — much of what’s stopping wider acceptance of HIV as a disease on-par with cancer is the leftover stigma from the 1980s. This demotivates people to seek treatment, ultimately hamstringing science’s ability to draw upon new cases for research. Politically, the hope of finding a cure is present: Last year’s World AIDS Day in December saw the White House set aside $100 million for HIV research. More broadly, however, the current fight motivates people to overcome the inertia of complacency and stop seeing HIV as an impenetrable wall — even if science does have its limits.\n\n“There are still resistant variants that emerge, and there are a lot of people that are infected that are not being treated,” Gallo explained. But even with the catalog of people treating those who carry the disease in the best of circumstances, patients still have an increased risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, and still take drugs they’d prefer not to take. “So, as a society, it is important that there not be complacency, but also as an individual.”', 'As of this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV has led some 30 million deaths worldwide since the epidemic began in 1981.\nIn the 30 years since Secretary Heckler made the historic announcement, for example, researchers have uncovered that HIV isn’t just an ordinary virus.\nMost recently, in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada as the first and only drug intended to prevent the spread of HIV infection.\nThese, he explains, in combination with insights into lymphoma, have been the “greatest advances” in HIV research.\nPolitically, the hope of finding a cure is present: Last year’s World AIDS Day in December saw the White House set aside $100 million for HIV research.']"

And on April 23, 1984, researchers at NIH’s National Cancer Institute, led by Dr. Robert Gallo, announced they had found the cause.\n\nThirty years later, Gallo is still in the lab as director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland.\n\n“Thirty years; it makes me feel so young,” the 76-year-old said with a chuckle as he reflected on all that has happened in the battle against AIDS.\n\nWhen the first AIDS cases began making headlines, Gallo was working on a retrovirus linked to a form of leukemia. Another doctor, James Curran, then the head of the AIDS program at the Centers for Disease Control, urged Gallo to get involved. Curran kept pushing, and Gallo says he started to notice similarities between patients with the leukemia retrovirus HTLV1 and those with AIDS.\n\n“I thought we might want to get involved in this, that this virus might be similar to the one we are working on,” he recalls. He took the challenge, perhaps a bit unwillingly at first, with a new retrovirus as the prime suspect in the AIDS mystery.\n\nHe tapped his leukemia research for clues and techniques. But this was a medical and scientific hunt very different from any he had embarked on before. There would be no retreating to the lab, focusing on the pure science.\n\n“AIDS became unusual in the sense that the patients were more in our face,” he says.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the AIDS activists, who fought hard to keep their cause in front of the medical community. Gallo says it seems everyone knew someone suffering from the disease. “You saw them; you met them — it was too fast, too many.”\n\nThere was no Eureka moment in the search for the AIDS virus. There were times of elation when they developed the first cell lines — or permanent cell cultures — or were able to identify random samples sent by the CDC.\n\nBut mostly, the hunt for the cause of AIDS evolved slowly, painstakingly, in the lab. First came the identification of the AIDS virus, then the first reliable and inexpensive blood test, and in time the pharmaceutical industry produced a series of ever-improving treatments.\n\nThe search for a full cure and a vaccine continue, but has proven perhaps far more difficult due to the unique nature of the AIDS retrovirus.\n\n“I think the notion of a total virological cure, where you can say ‘these people don’t have a single virus particle left in their body’ — I think that is a fantasy,” says Gallo.\n\nInstead, he points to the possibility of what he calls a “functional cure,” where patients with HIV can no longer transmit the virus and no longer need medication.\n\nAs for a vaccine, Gallo says, “as usual, HIV presents enormous challenges, and this one is super-enormous.”\n\nHe says most of the clinical vaccine trials have been failures, or, at best, inconclusive. One candidate is now being examined at the Institute of Human Virology, but the antibodies it creates do not last.\n\nGallo says it is a “basic science problem,” and he worries that people will get tired of funding the research. Still, he says he is hopeful about the prospect that someone will eventually create a vaccine that produces long-lasting antibodies.\n\n“I can’t be 100 percent sure it is solvable, but I think so,” he says. “I have to believe so. We have a lot invested in it and I think we have to try.”\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and on the WTOP Facebook page.', 'When the first AIDS cases began making headlines, Gallo was working on a retrovirus linked to a form of leukemia.\nCurran kept pushing, and Gallo says he started to notice similarities between patients with the leukemia retrovirus HTLV1 and those with AIDS.\n“You saw them; you met them — it was too fast, too many.”There was no Eureka moment in the search for the AIDS virus.\nFirst came the identification of the AIDS virus, then the first reliable and inexpensive blood test, and in time the pharmaceutical industry produced a series of ever-improving treatments.\nThe search for a full cure and a vaccine continue, but has proven perhaps far more difficult due to the unique nature of the AIDS retrovirus.']"

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is plagued with long waiting lists and inefficient systems, is failing to adequately connect former military service members with the health care they need.\n\nOver the past several years, delays in simple and routine screenings have prevented doctors from diagnosing cancer in time to save vets’ lives. CNN identified several specific VA hospitals in South Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona where the situation is particularly dire. Those facilities have placed thousands of veterans on a waiting list for simple gastrointestinal procedures, like a colonoscopy.\n\nThe Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system in Arizona is a particularly egregious offender. There, at least 40 veterans died while waiting in line for an appointment with a doctor. CNN found evidence that many of these individuals were placed on a secret waiting list that’s not entered electronically and not shared with the U.S. government. That way, when the VA hospital provides the government with its official list, it appears as though veterans are promptly receiving care — when in reality, some people are waiting for more than a year.\n\n“The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VA’s own internal rules,” Dr. Sam Foote, who recently retired after working for Phoenix’s VA system for 24 years, told CNN. “They wouldn’t take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times, when in fact they were not.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the former service members who died, 71-year-old Navy veteran Thomas Breen, urgently needed to see an urologist over concerns about the blood in his urine, particularly since his family has a history of cancer. His son explained that Breen was so proud of his military service that he would go “nowhere but the VA” for his treatment. But making an appointment took months. When Breen’s wife finally received a call from the VA about the urologist, Breen had already passed away from Stage 4 bladder cancer.\n\nThe issue has attracted the attention of Congress. At the beginning of this year, members of Congress began demanding answers about the unnecessary deaths linked to inadequate VA services. The U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee is monitoring the long wait times and attempting to push for more consequences for the VA officials responsible for the hospital systems. And Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) is calling for hearings on the possible neglect specifically within the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system.\n\nBut the problem isn’t limited to delayed cancer diagnoses. There’s also evidence that U.S. veterans are waiting months to receive treatment for their serious mental illnesses — and that’s contributing to some preventable deaths, too. Some veterans have committed suicide while they’re stuck in line waiting for care. This dynamic threatens to continue, since the suicide rate among young veterans has tripled over the past three years. Nonetheless, cuts included in the budget sequester threaten to compromise veterans’ access to mental health care even further.\n\nOver the past year, the VA has been working to eliminate a backlog of hundreds of thousands of unprocessed medical claims, but there are still about 400,000 overdue compensation claims left. In addition to those 400,000 veterans who are waiting for benefits, another 265,000 former service members have filed appeals with the VA claiming their disability benefits were mistakenly denied or cut.', 'The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is plagued with long waiting lists and inefficient systems, is failing to adequately connect former military service members with the health care they need.\nThose facilities have placed thousands of veterans on a waiting list for simple gastrointestinal procedures, like a colonoscopy.\nThe Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system in Arizona is a particularly egregious offender.\nAnd Sen.

The Phoenix VA director said in an e-mail to employees that the veteran didn\'t seek treatment that day.\n\nSix months before that, another Phoenix vet committed suicide, and his family released his suicide note, which said the government gave him ""no help"" for the injuries he suffered in combat, and that he was unable to receive immediate medical care.\n\nAs for the latest allegations surrounding delays in care, McCain and Flake have asked the Senate committee for an investigation and a hearing.\n\nAdditionally, McCain\'s office released a letter he wrote to Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, asking for more information about the allegations. McCain has tried to deal with the VA\'s backlog problem before, but McCain says it certainly looks like it\'s just getting worse:\n\n""As a result, I have dedicated two of my staffer in Phoenix and a staffer in my DC office to handle the problems with the VA system in Maricopa County, sending inquiries for, and otherwise helping, veterans wherever possible to schedule appointments critical to their health, as well as conducting oversight of the VA generally. I am appalled by the number of veterans who stated to my office that the VA was just ""waiting"" or ""hoping"" that they would die and be one less burden on the system. These increasing individual delays clearly illustrate systemic problems with how effectively the VA is providing care to our veterans.""\n\nMcCain also listed out nine questions he\'d like answers for from the VA head, which address pretty much all of the major allegations:\n\n1. Did, as was recently reported, at least forty veterans die while waiting unreasonably for the delivery of medical care by PVAHCS? If so, to what extent were those delays a causal factor in their deaths? What does the nation-wide data in this regard show? 2. Does PVAHCS keep multiple lists of veterans awaiting care? If so, what is the purpose of keeping multiple lists? Is this practice intended to obscure how long veterans have been awaiting care? 3. What is the actual average wait time for PVAHCS patients? Have any previously reported average wait times been based on the alleged deceptive unofficial list system? 4. To what extent have these multiple waiting lists obscured actual waiting times? 5. What mechanism is in place to guarantee a veteran is placed on the EWL as soon as he/she requests an appointment? 6. PVAHCS reportedly paid out bonuses to VA officials for reducing wait times, even though those reductions only occurred by manipulating wait lists. How many officials received bonuses by reducing wait times through the waitlists manipulation? What did each official receive as a bonus? What was PVAHCS\'s aggregate spending on such bonuses? 7. According to a recent report by the Department of Veterans Affairs, no Phoenix patient deaths in recent years have resulted in ""adverse disclosures"" to family members. Those disclosures are required when medical negligence or mistakes contribute to a patient\'s death. Given that as many as 40 deaths have allegedly resulted from delays in treatment due to the multiple waiting list issue, why were no ""adverse disclosures"" made regarding those reported patient deaths? Will ""adverse disclosures"" be issued? If not, why not? 8. What is the ratio of doctors to patients in the Phoenix VA Health Care System? Has that ratio has an adverse impact on patient waiting times? 9. Has an OIG team or other VA oversight body already addressed a waiting list problem at PVAHCS and what changes, if any, were recommended? If recommendations were made, what if anything did PVAHCS due to implement these recommendations? If not, why not?\n\nGot a tip?

The virus still remains just in two nations, Guinea and Liberia, despite rumors that it is starting to spread to other countries.\n\nEbola is a kind of hemorrhagic fever that is transmitted from animals to humans. The disease is a group of viruses that affect different body systems. Currently, Ebola doesn\'t have a vaccine to prevent people from infection. The virus has a total of five strains and after the outbreak in West Africa, only three strains have been identified.\n\nWHO stated that Guinea reported 208 Ebola clinical cases, including 136 deaths, while Liberia reported 34 cases and 11 deaths. Sierra Leone reported 19 suspected Ebola cases, but all tested negative for the virus.\n\nEbola\'s spread into West Africa is unprecedented and health officials in the region do not have any experience with the world\'s deadliest virus. The virus was typically found in East or Central Africa. Ebola kills up to 90 percent of infected patients, spreading in the blood and quickly shutting down the immune system. It causes headache, high fever, muscle pain and bleeding, and is contagious if infected body fluids are touched.\n\nUnited Nations Children\'s Fund (UNICEF) deployed a team of 12 members to Lofa County to prevent the spread of Ebola. The members visit one house at a time to spread information about proper precautionary measures to help prevent further spread of the disease. UNICEF connects to the local communities directly to inform them how they can avoid the disease and suggest infection-control practices on how to respond should they get sick, to prevent spreading it to even more people. Some people, if the disease is caught early and treated, have recovered.\n\n""The Liberian Government, with its partners, has done a great job spreading out information on Ebola, but in a country where illiteracy is high and the communication infrastructure is weak, media efforts must be complemented by community engagement and dialogue,"" Sheldon Yett, a representative of UNICEF Liberia, said. ""This is particularly important in Lofa, where the highest number of confirmed and suspected Ebola cases have been reported.""\n\nThe campaign\'s key message is: ""Protect yourself, your family and your community: Let us stop the spread of Ebola together.""

The Ebola outbreak has been centered in the countries of Guinea and Liberia.\n\nThe largest number of cases have been in Guinea, where 136 people have died. In Liberia another 11 have died.\n\nWhat makes the current outbreak of Ebola highly rare is that it usually occurs in central or eastern Africa. Western African nations don’t have experience dealing with the deadly virus, and inexperienced government health officials and doctors are facing more challenges in their response.\n\nThe symptoms of Ebola can include a high fever, internal bleeding and external bleeding. The virus spreads through the bloodstream and shuts down the immune system. From there it causes high fever, headache and muscle pain.\n\nNo cure has ever been found for Ebola, making a high death toll likely whenever there is an outbreak. The vaccine for Ebola, which is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo, also has a high death rate.\n\nDoctors Without Borders, a medical aid organization, has called the outbreak “unprecedented” because cases in the past were limited to a small area.\n\nThe rising death toll has come somewhat as a surprise to local officials in Guinea, who were optimistic that the Ebola outbreak was over. Last week, they thought that the outbreak was close to ending and that they were out of the woods. As the death toll slowed down and travel restrictions increased, officials said that they had things under control.\n\n“The number of new cases have fallen rapidly,” Rafi Diallo, a spokesman for Guinea’s health ministry, told Reuters. On the day of the interview, April 15, there were 159 confirmed or suspected cases of the disease. “Once we no longer have any new cases…we can say that this is totally under control.”\n\nThough the Ebola outbreak in west Africa is unusual, the high death toll is not. The virus is among the deadliest in the world and typically kills up to 90 percent of those who become clinically infected.\n\nThere have been rumors that Ebola has spread to other countries, but the World Health Organization (WHO) said earlier this week that the death toll is limited to just Guinea and Liberia. In Sierra Leone, almost two dozen people were tested for suspected cases of Ebola, but did not have it.\n\nIn Guinea, there have been 208 clinical cases of Ebola and Liberia has had 34 clinical cases.

Liberia, meanwhile, reports 13 deaths.\n\nHunters and restaurant owners in the central Ivorian town of Bouake are upset that clients have begun to steer clear of the strong taste of the agouti, a beast with a long snout and brown fur that can reach half a metre (1.6 feet) in length.\n\nLast week, the minister\'s recommendation was still going unheeded or ignored by some traders and hunters in Bouake\'s main bushmeat market. One hunter openly carried a dead rodent.\n\nEmile, a customer in his 40s who seemed slightly tipsy, asked for ""Ebola meat"", meaning braised agouti. ""Ebola can\'t survive alcohol or hot water,"" claimed the scarred Rigobeli, who had just eaten a large meal.\n\nBut such scenes are swiftly becoming a thing of the past. An official ban on bushmeat - including antelopes, chimpanzees and porcupines as well as agoutis - has been enforced and a week later, the Bouake market was empty.\n\nState officials from the water and forestry service and in the health sector are patrolling the whole country in search of offenders. They recently burned 200 kilos (440 pounds) of smoked game found in the capital Yamoussoukro.\n\nThe stakes are high. Wild animals are carriers of often deadly haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola for which there is no medical cure. The fruit bat has been singled out as a likely vector in the west African outbreak.\n\nPeople subsequently contaminate each other by direct contact with blood, bodily fluids and the tissue of infected patients, including dead ones during their burial.\n\nThe current strain of Ebola kills 90 percent of its victims and suspect cases have been reported in Sierra Leone and Mali, while Senegal has closed its border with Guinea.\n\nFear of the disease runs high in Ivory Coast, another of Guinea\'s neighbours, though no cases have yet been reported. People have begun to listen to official warnings and instructions.\n\nSecret signs\n\n""We like agouti very much, but we would rather save our lives,"" said Ernest, a man in his 30s. ""As an Ivorian, I appreciate this meat. But with the risk of Ebola, I\'ve changed, I don\'t eat any more,"" Kassoum agreed.\n\nNot everybody plays by the rules. A restaurant owner, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had established a code with some of her most loyal customers, hardened eaters of bushmeat.\n\n""When they come in, those who can\'t do without agouti give me a signal in secret and I make sure that other customers believe I am serving them beef,"" she explained.\n\nAdele Coulibaly, 48, whose restaurant used to specialise in game, has converted to beef and fish, but in the process she has lost customers and income. She is sceptical about the government\'s recommendations.\n\n""When I was born, my mother was in this line of work and there was never any disease,"" she said. ""Bushmeat has nothing to do with Ebola.""\n\nOn the other hand, the restrictions imposed by the Ebola outbreak could help wildlife to recover. A ban of game hunting has been in force since 1974, but remained largely ineffective because of the popularity of the meat.\n\nAgoutis, antelopes, chimpanzees, porcupines and other species are all in danger of extinction in Ivory Coast, but today they have at least a few weeks\' respite.\n\nIronically, ""Ebola is a good thing for the preservation of wildlife,"" said Colonel Jerome Ake, the Yamoussoukro regional director for water and forestry.\n\nA break in hunting will also benefit the natural environment, since hunters flush out game by starting large brush fires, which they are not always able to keep under control.\n\nIn the past 10 years, such blazes have killed 120 people and destroyed more than 5,000 square kilometres (1,900 square miles) of forest and other land, a region twice the size of Luxembourg. But in these days of Ebola, fewer fires are likely to be started.\n\nExplore further West Africa gears up to fight Ebola, killer fevers\n\n© 2014 AFP', 'West Africa\'s first outbreak of Ebola fever is bad news for gourmets in Ivory Coast, but brings respite from the hunter to species sought out for tasty meat but feared to carry the disease.\nEmile, a customer in his 40s who seemed slightly tipsy, asked for ""Ebola meat"", meaning braised agouti.\n""Ebola can\'t survive alcohol or hot water,"" claimed the scarred Rigobeli, who had just eaten a large meal.\nThe fruit bat has been singled out as a likely vector in the west African outbreak.\nExplore further West Africa gears up to fight Ebola, killer fevers© 2014 AFP']"

The FDA currently regulates cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco.\n\n“This proposed rule is the latest step in our efforts to make the next generation tobacco-free,” said HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\nConsistent with currently regulated tobacco products, under the proposed rule, makers of newly deemed tobacco products would, among other requirements: Register with the FDA and report product and ingredient listings; only market new tobacco products after FDA review; only make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA confirms that scientific evidence supports the claim and that marketing the product will benefit public health as a whole; and not distribute free samples.\n\nIn addition, under the proposed rule, the following provisions would apply to newly “deemed” tobacco products: Minimum age and identification restrictions to prevent sales to underage youth; requirements to include health warnings; and prohibition of vending machine sales, unless in a facility that never admits youth.\n\n“Tobacco remains the leading cause of death and disease in this country. This is an important moment for consumer protection and a significant proposal that if finalized as written would bring FDA oversight to many new tobacco products,” said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg, M.D. “Science-based product regulation is a powerful form of consumer protection that can help reduce the public health burden of tobacco use on the American public, including youth.”\n\n“Tobacco-related disease and death is one of the most critical public health challenges before the FDA,” said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “The proposed rule would give the FDA additional tools to protect the public health in today’s rapidly evolving tobacco marketplace, including the review of new tobacco products and their health-related claims.”\n\nThe FDA proposes different compliance dates for various provisions so that all regulated entities, including small businesses, will have adequate time to comply with the requirements of the proposed rule.\n\nProducts that are marketed for therapeutic purposes will continue to be regulated as medical products under the FDA’s existing drug and device authorities in the Food, Drug &Cosmetic Act.\n\nThe proposed rule will be available for public comment for 75 days. While all comments, data, research, and other information submitted to the docket will be considered, the FDA is requesting comments in certain areas, including:\n\nThe FDA recognizes that different tobacco products may have the potential for varying effects on public health and is proposing two options for the categories of cigars that would be covered by this rule. The FDA specifically seeks comment on whether all cigars should be subject to deeming, and which other provisions of the proposed rule may be appropriate or not appropriate for different kinds of cigars.\n\nThe FDA seeks answers to the many public health questions posed by products, such as e-cigarettes, that do not involve the burning of tobacco and inhalation of its smoke, as the agency develops an appropriate level of regulatory oversight for these products.

158164,http://fox2now.com/2014/04/24/fda-releases-proposed-e-cigarette-regulations/,health,"['(CNN) — The Food and Drug Administration is making another attempt at regulating electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.\n\nOn Thursday, the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, water pipe tobacco and hookahs. Currently, the FDA only has regulatory authority over cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco.\n\nWhen these recommendations are finalized following a 75-day public comment period, the age limit to buy the products is expected to be at least 18, although individual states could choose to set it higher.\n\nHealth warnings would also be required and the sale of the products in vending machines would be prohibited. Initially, the only health warning required for e-cigarettes would be about the potential for addiction to nicotine.\n\nManufacturers would be required to register all their products and ingredients with the FDA. They would only be able to market new products after an FDA review, and they would need to provide scientific evidence before making any claims of direct or implied risk reduction associated with their product.\n\nCompanies would also no longer be allowed to give out free samples.\n\nAfter the public comment period and once the proposed rules are finalized, manufacturers will have 24 months to submit an application to allow their products to remain on the market or submit a new product application.\n\nE-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor. They are usually battery-operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine. When heated, the liquid in the cartridge turns into a vapor that’s inhaled.\n\nMost look like cigarettes, cigars or pipes, but some resemble pens or USB memory sticks. Because they have not been fully studied, the FDA says it’s unknown what health risks they pose, how much nicotine or other chemicals are actually being inhaled or whether there is any benefit to using them.\n\nLast year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the percentage of high school students who reported ever using an e-cigarette more than doubled in one year, from 4.7% to 10% between 2011 and 2012.\n\nAs electronic cigarettes have increased in popularity, so have the number of calls to poison control centers nationwide. According to a recent CDC report, poison control centers logged 215 calls involving e-cigarettes in February alone. Of those calls, 51% involved children.\n\n“It’s really the wild, wild west out there,” says Margaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner. “Because e-cigarettes are increasingly in the marketplace. They’re coming in different sizes, shapes and flavors in terms of the nicotine in them, and there’s very worrisome data that show that young people in particular are starting to take up e-cigarettes, especially the flavored ones and that might be a gateway to other harmful tobacco products.”\n\nHamburg says they don’t know how many types are on the market, another reason why regulation is critical.\n\n“We’re already conducting research and working with partners in the research community to better understand patterns of use of these e-cigarettes and to learn more about the way in which they work and the delivery of the nicotine through e-cigarettes. But until we can really regulate them, we can’t have all the information we need and we can’t take all the actions that we might want to to be able to best address the public health issues associated with them.”\n\nNicotine is a drug and poison experts say the concentrated liquid form used in e-cigarettes is highly toxic even in small doses. It can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin.\n\n“Responsibly marketed and properly regulated, it is possible that e-cigarettes could benefit public health if they help significantly reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco-related disease,” Matthew Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in February.\n\nBut a lot of unanswered questions remain, according to Dr. Michael Eriksen, dean of the School of Public Health at Georgia State University, one of 14 U.S. institutions conducting FDA-funded research on electronic cigarettes,\n\n“How concentrated is liquid nicotine? Are there impurities in it? Is it properly handled like a pesticide?” he says. “Nicotine is a pesticide fundamentally and we take so many precautions about pesticides for our lawns and how to wear gloves. But what precautions do consumers take when they put the nicotine vials in? People treat it [liquid nicotine] as sugar when it’s a toxin.”\n\nHarold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, believes nicotine is highly addictive whether used in a regular cigarette or an e-cigarette.\n\nSo how safe are e-cigarettes? Hamburg says it’s buyer beware.\n\n“We think that there’s a lot of information that needs to be understood about e-cigarettes and their use. We’re trying to help provide some of that information through research that we’re conducting,” she says.\n\n“But we need the tools that regulation provides to be able to get critical new knowledge about e-cigarettes and to be able to put in place a framework that will protect the American public and potentially e-cigarette users, and really address the issues of what are the health consequences and what are the potential benefits.”\n\nHamburg believes these new rules will change the landscape.\n\nIf the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she says, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans.\n\nBy Saundra Young, CNN', '(CNN) — The Food and Drug Administration is making another attempt at regulating electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.\nOn Thursday, the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, water pipe tobacco and hookahs.\nCurrently, the FDA only has regulatory authority over cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco.\nThey are usually battery-operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine.\nIf the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she says, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans.']"

While many regard the nicotine-laced water vapor as a potential substitute for cancer-causing cigarette smoke, health experts are still studying the range of possible health effects the product has on users, SmokeFree Wisconsin Executive Director Maureen Busalacchi said.\n\nSince their first sales in 2007, e-cigarettes have seen a global boom, with total sales nearly doubling last year to $1.7 billion, according to CNBC.\n\nHowever, the new industry barely rivals the $350 billion tobacco industry, which serves America’s 42 million smokers, Tobacco Atlas reported.\n\nThe new FDA regulations will cover cigars and pipe tobacco, products that have been largely unregulated until now, and ban the sale of e-cigarettes and all other tobacco products to individuals under 18 years of age, the New York Times reported.\n\nThursday’s release of the regulations will be hundreds of pages long and will likely set off nationwide lobbying efforts from the e-cigarette industry, according to the New York Times.\n\nE-cigarettes vaporize liquid nicotine, giving users a nicotine rush without the harmful carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke. Depending on the product, e-cigarettes contain around 20 chemicals while conventional cigarettes contain more than 400 chemicals, according to the Electronic Cigarette Association.\n\nMichael Ellis, owner of Madison smoke-shop Knuckleheads, said he has seen e-cigarettes become increasingly popular products.\n\nEllis said e-cigarettes that do not contain any nicotine are widely popular among Madison’s college population.\n\n“College age kids just enjoy smoking them recreationally, just because it’s fun to do once in a while,” he said. “They taste good, you can pass them around with your friends and, most importantly, it’s not nearly as harmful as anything else that you’d be putting in your lungs other than air.”\n\nE-cigarettes are also highly popular among individuals looking to quit smoking, as smokers can feed their nicotine addiction without the harmful effects of tobacco smoke, Ellis said. Because there is no second hand smoke or carcinogens, e-cigarettes are a healthier option for smokers, he said.\n\nWhile supporters contend e-cigarettes are healthier than conventional cigarettes, experts have raised concerns on the effect the emerging industry is having on the nation’s youth.\n\nAccording to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2011 and 2012 the rate of minors using e-cigarettes more than doubled from 4.7 percent to 10 percent. The study also found that more than 75 percent of those minors also smoke conventional cigarettes.\n\nBusalacchi rejected the notion that e-cigarettes are a safe alternative to conventional cigarettes due to the many uncertainties, which the FDA rules will likely address.\n\n“There’s a whole list of folks who would not be recommended to use these products,” Busalacchi said. “That tells us that these aren’t necessarily safe. We don’t know enough about them.”\n\nBrenda McIntire contributed reporting to this story.', 'However, the new industry barely rivals the $350 billion tobacco industry, which serves America’s 42 million smokers, Tobacco Atlas reported.\nThe new FDA regulations will cover cigars and pipe tobacco, products that have been largely unregulated until now, and ban the sale of e-cigarettes and all other tobacco products to individuals under 18 years of age, the New York Times reported.\nThursday’s release of the regulations will be hundreds of pages long and will likely set off nationwide lobbying efforts from the e-cigarette industry, according to the New York Times.\nE-cigarettes vaporize liquid nicotine, giving users a nicotine rush without the harmful carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke.\nThe study also found that more than 75 percent of those minors also smoke conventional cigarettes.']"

Durbin, Illinois Democrat and vocal critic of youth-oriented tobacco marketing, declared, “Shame on the FDA.”\n\n“Faced with a responsibility to protect our children from an addiction to a product that can harm them, the FDA strained to create a political compromise,” he said. “Prohibiting sales to kids but doing nothing to protect children from candy-flavored marketing in children’s venues is an awful outcome. Parents across America lost their best ally in protecting their kids from this insidious product.”\n\nThe agency said critics of its proposal need to understand this is a step-by-step process. Additional tobacco products had to come under the FDA’s mantle before the agency could take on specific aspects of their promotion, sale and use, it said.\n\nProducts that would be subject to regulation include e-cigarettes, cigar and pipe tobacco, nicotine gels and water pipe (“hookah”) tobacco.\n\nManufacturers would have to register with the FDA, report product ingredients and submit their health claims for scrutiny.\n\nCompanies could not sell the newly regulated tobacco products to customers younger than age 18. They would have to put health warnings on labels, and their products could not be dispensed in vending machines at places where children might be present.\n\n“We’re taking another important step toward the goal of a tobacco-free generation,” former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said.\n\nThe proposal branches from a tobacco-control law signed by President Obama in 2009, and the move to rope in e-cigarettes affects a burgeoning, unregulated market.\n\n“When it comes to e-cigarettes, it’s the wild, wild west,” said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nE-cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes, but work by heating up liquid nicotine into an aerosol rather than burning tobacco. The FDA regulates the sale and marketing of tobacco products such as cigarettes and chewing tobacco, but until Thursday had not released a rule governing e-cigarettes and other tobacco-derived goods.\n\nUse of e-cigarettes among middle- and high school-age Americans doubled from 2011 to 2012, government officials said, and some lawmakers worry that young e-cigarettes smokers are more likely to make the jump to traditional cigarettes.\n\nSupporters of e-cigarettes say there is no evidence to support that claim and that many people use e-cigarettes as an alternative to smoking, not a steppingstone to tobacco.\n\nAltria, the parent company for Philip Morris USA, expressed support for Thursday’s proposal, saying the FDA has “an unprecedented opportunity to advance public health goals by recognizing that some types of tobacco products may have significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes.”\n\n“We believe FDA should adopt a regulatory framework that recognizes the differences in tobacco products and fosters innovation that may benefit public health,” it added.\n\nAnother e-cigarette manufacturer said the rules could have been a lot worse.\n\n“These regulations will increase the barrier to entry to e-cigarettes and will definitely raise costs for our brands to operate, but not as initially feared,” said Michael Tolmach, CEO of Clifton, N.J.-based Eonsmoke. “At first glance it seems that the regulations will not stifle innovation within our sector while still allowing oversight to ensure solid manufacturing practices and responsible marketing.”\n\nAnti-smoking advocates said the proposal is welcome news, but the government should stop dragging its feet.\n\n“Great first step,” John R.

The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) gave the FDA authority to immediately regulate cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, smokeless tobacco products, and roll-your-own tobacco. But even though other combustible tobacco products also present great dangers to both individual and public health, the FDA was required to take additional steps before it could regulate them. These include rapidly emerging products which particularly appeal to youth such as little cigars and hookah. Rules were also required to include e-cigarettes which have virtually exploded upon the market without any limitations on their marketing and sale, or oversight of their safety or ingredients, including separately sold vials of ""nicotine juice.""\n\nWe applaud the FDA\'s action to take this necessary first step to regulate electronic cigarettes, little cigars, cigarillos and hookah. However, we\'re concerned that these rulemaking proposals may fail to include premium cigars which would not adequately respond to the recent call to action by the US Surgeon General to quickly end the use of all combusted tobacco products. We are also concerned that the regulations do not immediately ban candy flavored little cigars that are highly appealing to youth, women, and low socio-economic populations. We are also disappointed to see no restriction on these same candy flavors in e-cigarettes.\n\nWe welcome the FDA\'s decision to immediately begin the process for issuing regulations to extend the prohibition of marketing practices like free samples, vending machine sales, and outdoor advertising to all tobacco products and restricting sales of all tobacco products to those under 18.\n\nAccording to Robin Koval, President and CEO of Legacy, ""We welcome this important first step in the proposed regulations and plan to be active participants in the public comment period in an effort to ensure their rapid implementation. Little cigars and hookah are every bit as addictive and dangerous as cigarettes and it is essential that they be subject to the same regulations.\n\nWhile the evidence is mounting that e-cigarettes are less harmful than combustible forms of tobacco and may provide real benefits for adults who want to quit smoking, they have no business being used by or marketed to young people. With the rise in reports of poisoning, it is also essential that common-sense manufacturing and sales standards be imposed immediately."" She added, ""But at the same time, we are deeply disappointed that the regulations do not remove candy-flavored tobacco products and we will strongly urge the FDA to move immediately to take these products off the market. We will also continue to push FDA to take the full steps necessary steps to ban all marketing with significant appeal or reach to youth.""\n\nLegacy helps people live longer, healthier lives by building a world where young people reject tobacco and anyone can quit.

Hamburg, M.D.\n\nToday we usher in a new chapter in FDA’s role in tobacco control, which began nearly five years ago when the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act enabled us to regulate certain tobacco products, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Now, FDA has proposed a rule that would extend our authority to additional products meeting the legal definition of a tobacco product. This would include electronic cigarettes, some or all cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, waterpipe (hookah) tobacco and dissolvables not already under the FDA’s authority, as well as future tobacco products.\n\nThe tobacco product marketplace is evolving at a dizzying pace with many unanswered questions about the health effects of novel products. Especially in the shadow of alarming increases in the number of youths using unregulated products like electronic cigarettes and cigars, it’s more crucial than ever to help prevent early tobacco use that could lead to a lifetime of nicotine addiction. The proposed rule—which would “deem” other tobacco products to be subject to FDA authority—is poised to help make that happen.\n\nFDA is committed to protecting public health. Expanding our authority over tobacco products gives FDA additional tools to help reduce the number of illnesses and premature deaths associated with the use of tobacco products. Under FDA’s proposal, these powerful regulatory tools would include age restrictions, rigorous review of new tobacco products and claims, and health warnings.\n\n“Deeming” – and the new health warning requirements included in the proposed rule – would also help to correct a misperception by consumers that tobacco products not regulated by FDA are safe alternatives to currently regulated tobacco products. Equally important, “deeming” would allow FDA to issue future regulations regarding these products, including regulations to reduce their harmfulness, if we determine that would be appropriate to protect public health.\n\nAs we work to finalize the proposed rule, we welcome comments and will consider all that are submitted, as well as any data, research and other information submitted to the docket for this proposed rule.

Currently, the FDA regulates cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless products such as snuff.\n\nThe proposed rules won\'t ban advertising unless the products make health-related claims nor will they ban the use of flavors such as chocolate or bubble gum, which public health officials say might attract children.\n\n""This is an important moment for consumer protection,"" said FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, noting tobacco remains ""the leading cause of death and disease in this country."" The rules will require manufacturers to report their ingredients to the FDA and obtain its approval. They also ban free tobacco samples and most vending-machine sales.\n\n""Some of these regulations will be very restrictive,"" said Ray Story, founder of industry group TVECA (Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association), who added he obtained his own pre-release copy of the rules. He said they could be costly for smaller businesses and slow the growth of a product that advocates say has helped many smokers kick the habit.\n\nStill, Story said, consumers might benefit, because ""it provides them a product that will be consistent."" E-cigarettes contain varying ingredients and levels of nicotine that are heated into a vapor that users inhale in a practice known as ""vaping."" Most look like conventional cigarettes but some resemble everyday items such as pens and USB memory sticks.\n\nThe rules come as e-cigarette sales, buoyed by TV ads with Hollywood celebrities , have soared in recent year and debate has risen about whether the devices are more apt to lure kids toward tobacco or help adults quit smoking.\n\nAn increasing number of states have cracked down by extending indoor smoking restrictions to e-cigarettes. Last month, U.S. poison centers reported a surge in illnesses linked to the liquid nicotine used in the devices.\n\nWhile they don\'t contain many of the harmful chemicals of conventional cigarettes, the FDA found trace amounts of toxic and carcinogenic ingredients in several samples in late 2008 when the e-cigarette market was just beginning in the United States. It sought to regulate them as drug-delivery devices, but in 2010, a federal judge ruled it could only do so if they made therapeutic claims. So in April 2011, the agency said it would regulate them as tobacco products, because the nicotine is derived from tobacco leaves.\n\n""It\'s taken more than three years to issue a proposed rule, which we think is inexcusable,"" said Vince Willmore of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an anti-smoking group. ""It\'s allowed a Wild West marketplace with irresponsible marketing and no control over the product."" He says the FDA should quickly finalize the rules, which face a 75-day public comment period and further review.\n\nThe proposed rules walk a narrow path. They will require tobacco products that weren\'t on the market by Feb. 25, 2007 — a date set by a federal law — to apply for FDA review within 24 months after the rules are issued. The products can stay on the market pending FDA\'s review, says Mitch Zeller, director of FDA\'s Center for Tobacco Products, adding they can seek an exemption from additional reviews if minor changes are made.\n\nDespite these requirements, the proposal doesn\'t contain the marketing restrictions sought by some critics that were almost sure to trigger litigation. Craig Weiss, CEO of NJoy, a top-selling e-cigarette, said he supports ""reasonable regulation"" but would ""respond very forcefully to any attempt to limit my free speech right to promote my product.""\n\nSeveral dominant e-cigarette manufacturers, which now include the nation\'s three largest cigarette makers — Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard — have embraced limited regulation such as a ban on sales to minors. Yet they\'ve argued that their e-products shouldn\'t be regulated as tightly as conventional cigarettes — an approach the FDA appears to be taking.\n\nThe FDA said the rule aims to bolster product safety. It said since e-cigarettes have not been fully studied, consumers have no way to know how much nicotine or other chemicals they contain and whether they\'re safe or beneficial.\n\n\n\n\n\nFDA\'s 20-year road to regulating tobacco:\n\nAugust 1996: FDA issues rules to ban tobacco sales to minors and its advertising near schools or playgrounds\n\nMarch 2000: U.S. Supreme Court, in 5-4 decision, rules that Congress did not give FDA such authority\n\nDecember 2008: FDA, after detaining import shipments of e-cigarettes, declares they\'re unapproved drug delivery devices\n\nApril 2009: E-cigarette distributor Smoking Everywhere files suit against the FDA, joined a month later by Sottera (doing business as NJOY)\n\nJune 2009: Congress passes law granting FDA authority to regulate tobacco products\n\nJanuary 2010: U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia bans FDA from stopping e-cigarette imports\n\nJune 2010: FDA issues final rules to ban the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to minors and to restrict their marketing\n\nDecember 2010: U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Manufacturers would also have to place health warnings on e-cigarette products that say nicotine is addictive, though they would have two years to do so if the regulation is made official.\n\nHowever, the FDA did not propose limiting advertising, flavored products or online sales — all things that e-cigarette critics deem important to keep these products away from kids.\n\n""Without swift action from the administration to finalize the rule and take the necessary regulatory steps, many manufacturers of these products can continue to engage in practices, such as advertising and use of flavors, which make them attractive and accessible to youth,"" said American Cancer Society\'s Cancer Action Network CEO, Dr. John Seffrin.\n\nIn the absence of federal restrictions, major cities such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles have severely restricted e-cigarette use in recent months. In New York City, for example, anyone ""vaping"" an e-cigarette will soon only be allowed to do so in the privacy of their own home or in designated smoking areas.\n\nE-cigarette smoking or ""vaping"" simulates tobacco smoking by vaporizing a liquid solution. The vapor is flavored and can contain nicotine; the health benefits or risks of e-cigarettes are still a subject of debate.\n\nThough there is no definitive study on the safety of e-cigarettes, one study published in The Lancet showed that those who use the electronic products are not much more likely to quit smoking than anyone who uses a nicotine patch. The finding runs counter to many claims made by e-cigarette proponents, who say vaping helps people wean off of smoking.\n\nThe FDA proposal ""lays the foundation"" for other actions and activities, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told NBC News. “We want to move as quickly as we can but it is a process and it will take time.""\n\nAfter a public-comment period of 75 days, and after the proposed rules are finalized, manufacturers will have 24 months to submit an application for their products to remain on the market.\n\n“We don’t know as much about the safety and risks of e-cigarettes and that is why we want to be able to regulate them,” said Hamburg.', 'The new rules would ban e-cigarette sales to minors, and manufacturers of such products would have to disclose the e-cigarette ingredients to the FDA.\nSee also: I Used the Internet to Quit SmokingFurthermore, the new rules would prohibit companies from handing out free e-cigarette samples, as well as selling e-cigarette products through vending machines (except in adult-only venues).\nE-cigarette smoking or ""vaping"" simulates tobacco smoking by vaporizing a liquid solution.\nThe vapor is flavored and can contain nicotine; the health benefits or risks of e-cigarettes are still a subject of debate.\nThe FDA proposal ""lays the foundation"" for other actions and activities, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg told NBC News.']"

158191,https://wtvr.com/2014/04/24/fda-e-cigarettes-rules/,health,"['(CNN) — The Food and Drug Administration is making another attempt at regulating electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.\n\nOn Thursday, the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, water pipe tobacco and hookahs. Currently, the FDA only has regulatory authority over cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco.\n\nWhen these recommendations are finalized following a 75-day public comment period, the age limit to buy the products is expected to be at least 18, although individual states could choose to set it higher.\n\nHealth warnings would also be required and the sale of the products in vending machines would be prohibited. Initially, the only health warning required for e-cigarettes would be about the potential for addiction to nicotine.\n\nManufacturers would be required to register all their products and ingredients with the FDA. They would only be able to market new products after an FDA review, and they would need to provide scientific evidence before making any claims of direct or implied risk reduction associated with their product.\n\nCompanies would also no longer be allowed to give out free samples.\n\nAfter the public comment period and once the proposed rules are finalized, manufacturers will have 24 months to submit an application to allow their products to remain on the market or submit a new product application.\n\nE-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor. They are usually battery-operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine. When heated, the liquid in the cartridge turns into a vapor that’s inhaled.\n\nMost look like cigarettes, cigars or pipes, but some resemble pens or USB memory sticks. Because they have not been fully studied, the FDA says it’s unknown what health risks they pose, how much nicotine or other chemicals are actually being inhaled or whether there is any benefit to using them.\n\nLast year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the percentage of high school students who reported ever using an e-cigarette more than doubled in one year, from 4.7% to 10% between 2011 and 2012.\n\nAs electronic cigarettes have increased in popularity, so have the number of calls to poison control centers nationwide. According to a recent CDC report, poison control centers logged 215 calls involving e-cigarettes in February alone. Of those calls, 51% involved children.\n\n“It’s really the wild, wild west out there,” says Margaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner. “Because e-cigarettes are increasingly in the marketplace. They’re coming in different sizes, shapes and flavors in terms of the nicotine in them, and there’s very worrisome data that show that young people in particular are starting to take up e-cigarettes, especially the flavored ones and that might be a gateway to other harmful tobacco products.”\n\nHamburg says they don’t know how many types are on the market, another reason why regulation is critical.\n\n“We’re already conducting research and working with partners in the research community to better understand patterns of use of these e-cigarettes and to learn more about the way in which they work and the delivery of the nicotine through e-cigarettes. But until we can really regulate them, we can’t have all the information we need and we can’t take all the actions that we might want to to be able to best address the public health issues associated with them.”\n\nNicotine is a drug and poison experts say the concentrated liquid form used in e-cigarettes is highly toxic even in small doses. It can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin.\n\n“Responsibly marketed and properly regulated, it is possible that e-cigarettes could benefit public health if they help significantly reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco-related disease,” Matthew Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in February.\n\nBut a lot of unanswered questions remain, according to Dr. Michael Eriksen, dean of the School of Public Health at Georgia State University, one of 14 U.S. institutions conducting FDA-funded research on electronic cigarettes,\n\n“How concentrated is liquid nicotine? Are there impurities in it? Is it properly handled like a pesticide?” he says. “Nicotine is a pesticide fundamentally and we take so many precautions about pesticides for our lawns and how to wear gloves. But what precautions do consumers take when they put the nicotine vials in? People treat it [liquid nicotine] as sugar when it’s a toxin.”\n\nHarold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, believes nicotine is highly addictive whether used in a regular cigarette or an e-cigarette.\n\nSo how safe are e-cigarettes? Hamburg says it’s buyer beware.\n\n“We think that there’s a lot of information that needs to be understood about e-cigarettes and their use. We’re trying to help provide some of that information through research that we’re conducting,” she says.\n\n“But we need the tools that regulation provides to be able to get critical new knowledge about e-cigarettes and to be able to put in place a framework that will protect the American public and potentially e-cigarette users, and really address the issues of what are the health consequences and what are the potential benefits.”\n\nHamburg believes these new rules will change the landscape.\n\nIf the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she says, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans.', '(CNN) — The Food and Drug Administration is making another attempt at regulating electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.\nOn Thursday, the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, water pipe tobacco and hookahs.\nCurrently, the FDA only has regulatory authority over cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco.\nThey are usually battery-operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine.\nIf the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she says, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans.']"

And so far they’ve been totally unregulated.\n\nThe fact remains we have no idea what’s in these things. E-cigarettes vaporize vials of liquid that contain nicotine but the other ingredients are a mystery.\n\nKeep in mind that it took years for the big tobacco companies to reveal all the chemicals in cigarette smoke, including things like ammonia, methane and arsenic.\n\nThese new regulations would force companies selling e-cigarettes to register with the FDA and provide a detailed description of ingredients and manufacturing process.\n\nThe proposed rules would also ban their sale to minors.

""We will have the authority as a science-based regulatory agency to take critical actions to promote and protect the health of the public.""\n\nThe proposal will be subject to public comment and further review by the agency before becoming final. But once that happens the rule would impose new restrictions, including:\n\nA ban on the sale of e-cigarettes to minors.\n\nA prohibition on distributing free samples.\n\nA ban on selling e-cigarettes in vending machines unless they are in places that never admit young people.\n\nA requirement that e-cigarettes carry warnings that they contain nicotine, which is addictive.\n\nE-cigarette manufacturers would be required to disclose the ingredients in their products.\n\nE-cigarettes are plastic or metal tubes about the size of a traditional cigarette that heat a liquid solution containing nicotine. That creates a vapor that users inhale. Their popularity has soared in recent years.\n\nSome have welcomed the trend as a way to prevent people from smoking traditional cigarettes, which are far more dangerous, and to help smokers quit.\n\nOthers fear the devices will addict nonsmokers to nicotine and eventually lead to more people smoking. That has fueled calls for the FDA to assert its authority over the devices. Although e-cigarettes are generally considered much safer than traditional cigarettes, some fear that not enough research has been done to know what risks they may have.\n\n""We call the current marketplace for e-cigarettes the Wild Wild West,"" said Mitchell Zeller, who heads the FDA\'s Center for Tobacco Products. ""We will be in a position to ensure that the products are as safe as they could possibly be.""\n\nThe FDA had previously attempted to regulate e-cigarettes, but that effort was thwarted in court. The agency recently signaled, however, that it planned to try again. Thursday\'s announcement will make that official.\n\nThe proposal would also require any new e-cigarettes to get FDA approval before being sold, and demand that current products provide a justification for remaining on the market.\n\nThe announcement stopped short of more aggressive regulation that some critics had called for, including restricting or banning fruit flavors and other sweeteners that may appeal to young people.\n\nIt also won\'t restrict television advertising and online sales, as some had hoped. But Zeller and Hamburg said Thursday\'s move is the first step that could lead to such measures if the agency determines that those are needed.\n\n""This announcement starts the process that will give us the authority to actually get out there and regulate e-cigarettes,"" Hamburg said.\n\nThe FDA also is proposing regulation of a variety of other tobacco-related products, including cigars, nicotine gels, pipe tobacco and water pipes.\n\nE-cigarette companies and anti-smoking advocates had just started to review the FDA\'s proposal. But at least initially the industry welcomed the FDA\'s plans, apparently relieved the agency had not gone further.\n\n""We are extremely relieved that all e-cigarette companies will be regulated, and forced to achieve and maintain the same high standards that Vapor Corp., and several of our responsible competitors, have been imposing on ourselves for years,"" said Jeffrey Holman, president and director of the Dania, Fla., company said in an email to Shots.\n\nPublic health advocates generally welcomed the move as an important first step, but expressed disappointment that the agency had failed to regulate the devices more aggressively right away.\n\n""This action is long overdue,"" said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. ""It is inexcusable that it has taken the FDA and the administration so long to act.

But health and public policy experts can’t say for certain whether the electronic devices are a good thing or a bad thing overall, whether they help smokers kick the habit or are a gateway to ordinary paper-and-tobacco cigarettes.\n\nThe proposed rules, issued Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration, tread fairly lightly. They would ban sales to anyone younger than 18, add warning labels and require FDA approval for new products.\n\nSome public health experts say a measured approach is the right one. They think the devices, which heat a nicotine solution to produce an odorless vapor without the smoke and tar of burning tobacco, can help smokers quit.\n\n""This could be the single biggest opportunity that’s come along in a century to make the cigarette obsolete,"" said David Abrams, executive director of the Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at the American Legacy Foundation.\n\nStill, some wonder whether e-cigarettes keep smokers addicted or hook new users and encourage them to move on to tobacco. And some warn that the FDA regulations could have unintended consequences.\n\n""If the regulations are too heavy-handed, they’ll have the deadly effect of preventing smokers from quitting by switching to these dramatically less harmful alternatives,"" said Jeff Stier, senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank in Washington.\n\nScientists haven’t finished much research on e-cigarettes, and the studies that have been done have been inconclusive. The government is pouring millions into research to supplement independent and company studies on the health risks of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products — as well as who uses them and why.\n\n""There are far more questions than answers,"" acknowledged Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nBut he said the proposed rules ""would result in significant public health benefits, including through reducing sales to youth, helping to correct consumer misperceptions, preventing misleading health claims and preventing new products from entering the market without scientific review by FDA.""\n\nThe FDA has left the door open to further regulations, such as a ban on TV advertising and fruit- or candy-flavored e-cigarettes — measures that some anti-smoking groups and members of Congress are demanding.\n\n""It is inexcusable that it has taken the FDA and the administration so long to act. This delay has had serious public health consequences as these unregulated tobacco products have been marketed using tactics and sweet flavors that appeal to kids,"" the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said in a statement.\n\nThe FDA said it wants more evidence before it rushes into more regulations.\n\nAny further rules ""will have to be grounded in our growing body of knowledge and understanding about the use of e-cigarettes and their potential health risks or public health benefits,"" FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said.\n\nElectronic cigarettes are becoming a big business. The industry started on the Internet and at shopping-mall kiosks and has rocketed from thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide, with a choice of more than 200 brands.\n\nSales are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013. Tobacco companies have noticed that e-smokes are eating into cigarette sales, and they have jumped into the business, too.\n\nSmokers like e-cigarettes because the nicotine-infused vapor looks like smoke but doesn’t contain the thousands of chemicals, tar or odor of regular cigarettes. Some smokers use e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking tobacco, or to cut down.\n\n""If the product as I use it now becomes illegal, I’m not sure what’ll happen. I’ll probably end up smoking again,"" said 38-year-old Jason Todrick of Huntington Beach, Calif., who kicked his more than 20-year smoking habit two years ago using an e-cigarette.\n\nIn addition to mandating warning labels that say nicotine is an addictive chemical, the rules would require e-cigarette makers to disclose their products’ ingredients. They would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products.\n\nIn addition, they couldn’t give out free samples or sell e-cigarettes in vending machines unless they are in a place open only to adults, such as a bar.\n\nThe public and the industry will have 75 days to comment on the proposed rules. There is no timetable for when the FDA will issue its final rules. Many believe the process will wind up in court.\n\n""It seems to be a responsible approach — and shows the FDA’s commitment to look at particular e-cigarettes in a science-based way rather than just conjecture,"" said Jason Healy, president of Blu e-cigs, which is owned by the tobacco company Lorillard Inc. and is the largest player in the market. Blu accounts for almost half of e-cigarettes sold.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the FDA proposed extending its authority to regulate cigars, hookahs, nicotine gels and pipe tobacco.', 'The proposed rules, issued Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration, tread fairly lightly.\nSome public health experts say a measured approach is the right one.\n""There are far more questions than answers,"" acknowledged Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.\nThey would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products.\nAlso on Thursday, the FDA proposed extending its authority to regulate cigars, hookahs, nicotine gels and pipe tobacco.']"

Officials didn’t provide a timetable for that action.\n\nMembers of Congress and public health groups have raised concerns over e-cigarettes and questioned their marketing tactics.\n\n“When finalized (the proposal) would result in significant public health benefits, including through reducing sales to youth, helping to correct consumer misperceptions, preventing misleading health claims and preventing new products from entering the market without scientific review by FDA,” said Mitch Zeller, the director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nThe FDA said the public, members of the industry and others will have 75 days to comment on the proposal. The agency will evaluate those comments before issuing a final rule but there’s no timetable for when that will happen. The regulations will be a step in a long process that many believe will ultimately end up being challenged in court.\n\nE-cigarettes are plastic or metal tubes, usually the size of a cigarette, that heat a liquid nicotine solution instead of burning tobacco. That creates vapor that users inhale.\n\nSmokers like e-cigarettes because the nicotine-infused vapor looks like smoke but doesn’t contain the thousands of chemicals, tar or odor of regular cigarettes. Some smokers use e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking tobacco, or to cut down. However, there’s not much scientific evidence showing e-cigarettes help smokers quit or smoke less, and it’s unclear how safe they are.\n\nThe industry started on the Internet and at shopping-mall kiosks and has rocketed from thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide who can choose from more than 200 brands. Sales are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013. Tobacco company executives have noted that they are eating into traditional cigarette sales, and their companies have jumped into the business.\n\nSome believe lightly regulating electronic cigarettes might actually be better for public health overall, if smokers switch and e-cigarettes really are safer. Others are raising alarms about the hazards of the products and a litany of questions about whether e-cigarettes will keep smokers addicted or encourage others to start using e-cigarettes, and even eventually tobacco products.\n\n“Right now for something like e-cigarettes, there are far more questions than answers,” Zeller said, adding that the agency is conducting research to better understand the safety of the devices and who is using them.\n\nIn addition to prohibiting sales to minors and requiring health labels that warn users that nicotine is an addictive chemical, e-cigarette makers also would be required to register their products with the agency and disclose ingredients. They also would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products.\n\nThey also couldn’t use words such as “light” or “mild” to describe their products, give out free samples or sell their products in vending machines unless they are in a place open only to adults, such as a bar.\n\nCompanies also will be required to submit applications for premarket review within two years. As long as an e-cigarette maker has submitted the application, the FDA said it will allow the products to stay on the market while they are being reviewed. That would mean companies would have to submit an application for all e-cigarettes now being sold.\n\n(© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Are teens buying them and getting hooked on traditional tobacco products with e-cigs as a gateway, or are these alternatives a great way to kick the habit? Anti-tobacco activists have been pressing the FDA for years to get involved, and they have finally proposed their first rules for the market:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration will for the first time regulate the booming market of electronic cigarettes, as well as cigars, pipe tobacco and hookahs, under a proposal to be released Thursday. The move would begin to place restrictions on e-cigarettes, a nearly $2 billion industry thatfor years has operated outside the reach of federal regulators. If adopted, the government’s plan would force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, stop handing out free samples, place health warning labels on their products and disclose the ingredients. Makers of e-cigarettes also would be banned from making health-related claims without scientific evidence.\n\nThe FDA isn’t exactly rushing into regulatory oversight. Congress passed a law five years ago that gave the FDA the authority to create regulatory oversight into e-cigarettes and other tobacco products, but they’ve only now proposed their first rules for the industry. That has been a source of frustration for activists:\n\nCongress passed a law in 2009 giving the FDA broad power to regulate cigarettes, including requirements for new warning labels, restrictions on ads and explicit approval of new products. The law also gave the FDA the authority to broaden its jurisdiction over other tobacco-related products. While the agency has long indicated that it planned to do just that, action has been slow in coming. “In the absence of any meaningful regulation, the e-cigarette manufacturers have acted as if it’s the wild, wild West, with no rules and no restraints,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who had not seen the particulars of the FDA proposal. “Their advertising is exactly the same type of advertising that made cigarettes so appealing to young people” decades ago.\n\nThe “wild, wild West”? Pardon me if my recollection is a bit off, but the wild in the wild wild West didn’t refer to a lack of FDA oversight. The product has not gotten regulatory attention, or arguably enough research into its health impacts, but that’s hardly the same thing as anarchy and violence. It’s that kind of hyperbole that makes most Americans skeptical of the motives behind the push to expand regulation, even where an arguably rational basis exists.\n\nIncluding cigars and pipe tobacco in the effort makes skepticism even more understandable. E-cigs are a relatively new phenomenon that might require more study, but that’s not true of cigars — even those sold with fruit flavoring, which to this occasional cigar smoker sounds awful. Nor is it true of pipe tobacco or hookah products. Those categories of tobacco do not (usually) get inhaled and do not have the same kind of massive consumption that cigarettes do.\n\nFurthermore, it’s a little odd that the FDA is choosing to crack down on all of these at the precise moment that states are moving to legalize medicinal and recreational marijuana, which gets deeply inhaled and is hallucinogenic to boot. Yes, this is a federal effort and those are states making legalization choices, but the voter impulse on consumables is decidedly libertarian these days. Is that so difficult to notice in the Beltway?', 'Are teens buying them and getting hooked on traditional tobacco products with e-cigs as a gateway, or are these alternatives a great way to kick the habit?\nThe “wild, wild West”?\nPardon me if my recollection is a bit off, but the wild in the wild wild West didn’t refer to a lack of FDA oversight.\nIncluding cigars and pipe tobacco in the effort makes skepticism even more understandable.\nNor is it true of pipe tobacco or hookah products.']"

A law passed in 2009 gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco and stipulated the agency could extend its jurisdiction to other nicotine products after issuing a rule to that effect.\n\nFDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said at a briefing that the proposal represented the first “foundational” step towards a broader set of potential regulations that would establish quality standards and include restrictions on flavouring and marketing.\n\nThe current proposal “lays the foundation for many more actions and activities,” she said.\n\nIn the short term, the rules would prohibit companies from distributing free e-cigarette samples, forbid vending machine sales except in adult-only venues and prohibit sales to minors.\n\nCompanies would be required to warn that nicotine is addictive, but no other health warnings would be required. The addiction warning would have to be added no later than two years after the rule is finalised. They would not be able to make health claims in any advertising.\n\nThe proposal is subject to a public comment period of 75 days.\n\nIf finalised, companies would be required to submit new and existing products to the FDA for approval. They would have two years to submit their applications from the time the rule goes into effect. Companies may continue selling their products and introducing new products, pending the FDA’s review.\n\nIn the meantime, they would be required to register with the FDA and list the ingredients in their products. They would not be required to adhere immediately to specific product or quality control standards. That could come later, Hamburg said.\n\nEvolving “vaping” industry\n\nE-cigarettes and other “vaping” devices generate roughly $2 billion a year in the United States, and some industry analysts see e-vapour sales outpacing the $85-billion traditional cigarette industry within a decade.\n\nAdvocates of e-cigarettes, battery-powered cartridges that produce a nicotine-laced inhalable vapour, claim they are a safer alternative to smoking traditional cigarettes since they do not produce lung-destroying tar. But there is little data about the long-term safety of the products.\n\nThe FDA’s proposal leaves many questions unanswered about how new products would be regulated over the long run. One key question relates to the mechanism by which products are approved.\n\nUnder the current law, new tobacco products can be approved if they can demonstrate they are “substantially equivalent” to a product that was on the market before February 15, 2007. It is unclear, however, whether any e-cigarettes were on the market before that date to be used as a benchmark.\n\nMitch Zeller, head of the FDA’s tobacco division, said at a briefing that the agency would be seeking additional information during the public comment period on whether the “substantial equivalence” pathway is even valid for e-cigarettes.\n\nIf it turns out not to be, e-cigarette companies would have to apply through a different process that would require them to prove their products are appropriate for public health, a higher hurdle to clear.\n\nAlso unclear is the fate of some cigars. The current proposal would include e-vaping products and other tobacco products, but premium cigars may be excluded. The FDA said it would seek public comment on whether all cigars should be regulated equally. One option proposed by the agency is to regulate them all. The other is to define a category of premium cigars that would not be subject to the FDA’s authority.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, premium cigars are considered those wrapped in whole tobacco leaf, made manually by combining the wrapper, filler and binder, have no characterising flavour, have no filter, tip, or non-tobacco mouthpiece and are relatively expensive.\n\nTobacco company Lorillard Inc, owner of the blu e-cigarette brand, is the dominant player in the field, followed by privately held NJOY and LOGIC Technology. The three account for an estimated 80 per cent of the market.', 'Washington: The US Food and Drug Administration proposed measures on Thursday that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to consumers younger than 18, but would not restrict flavoured products, online sales or TV advertising, likely disappointing some public health advocates.\nIn the short term, the rules would prohibit companies from distributing free e-cigarette samples, forbid vending machine sales except in adult-only venues and prohibit sales to minors.\nThe FDA’s proposal leaves many questions unanswered about how new products would be regulated over the long run.\nUnder the current law, new tobacco products can be approved if they can demonstrate they are “substantially equivalent” to a product that was on the market before February 15, 2007.\nThe current proposal would include e-vaping products and other tobacco products, but premium cigars may be excluded.']"

We’re calling this the first step ….”\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe public will have 75 days to comment on the proposal.\n\n“The blueprint — which is hundreds of pages long — is sure to set off a frantic lobbying effort in Washington as affected industries try to head off the costliest, most restrictive regulations,” Sabrina Tavernise writes in the New York Times. “The industry has several trade associations, and a number of them have met with Obama administration officials about the regulations over the past several months …,” she continues.\n\n“Once the proposed rules are finalized, manufacturers will have 24 months to submit an application to allow their products to remain on the market or submit a new product application,” writes CNN’s Saundra Young.\n\n“Until we have the authority to regulate e-cigarettes, we cannot provide the information that the American public wants about the relative risk and safety of these products,” the FDA’s Hamburg told CBS News. “... We cannot put in place certain restrictions that might be appropriate with respect to how the products are made, the kind of flavorings, the kind of marketing, etc.”\n\nE-cigarettes, as defined by the FDA, “are battery-operated products designed to deliver nicotine, flavor and other chemicals. They turn chemicals, including highly addictive nicotine, into an aerosol that is inhaled by the user,” in a process commonly called “vaping.”\n\nTo be sure, people have been using e-cigarettes to quit tobacco products and believe them to be relatively harmless.\n\n“E-cigarette enthusiasts say vaping is far safer than smoking cigarettes, and some experts say that may well be the case,” as NBCNews’s Maggie Fox writes. But, said American Heart Association president Dr. Mariell Jessup in response, “It’s being marketed a lot that the smoke is harmless and we don’t know that. We shouldn't be fooled by the promises that these devices, these nicotine delivery systems, are safe.”\n\nThe briefing yesterday was conducted with the understanding that the press would not report on it until the “blueprint” was released today. That didn’t stop everybody else from having their say once details hit the Internet last night. There were already more than 70 comments to Tavernise’s story — reasoned, passionate and on all sides of the issue — early this morning.\n\n“Twitter never sleeps,” writes the Washington Post’s Gail Sullivan in a story posted at 5:12 a.m. “So when the news broke in the dead of night that the Food and Drug Administration wants to regulate e-cigarettes, the response was swift.”\n\nMost of the tweets Sullivan cites are negative about regulation, such as @TheBradBlog’s “Good news, teens! When FDA bans sale of #ecigs to ya, u can always bum a dangerous real cigarette from a friend!” But, says @aaronmfisher, “Selling death makes money and individuals sell their souls. #ecigarettes.”\n\n“This is the year that e-cigs went completely mainstream,” writes “Jordan” on the Electronic Cigarette Brands Guide, citing “HUGE” technological advances that allow for more vapor, better taste and cheaper product. “The new electronic cigarettes on the market today make the ones from the beginning of 2013 look archaic.”\n\n“There are more than 250 brands of e-cigarettes and an estimated 4 million Americans use them, according to the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association,” ABC News’ Gillian Mohney reports.\n\nWells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog tells the Times’ Tavernise that “the [FDA] proposal would probably lead to consolidation” in the industry. “It benefits the entrenched players,’ she said, referring to the three big tobacco companies that produce e-cigarettes, Lorillard, R.J. Reynolds and Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris U.S.A., as well as larger e-cigarette producers, like Njoy and Logic,” Tavernise writes."", 'We’re calling this the first step ….”advertisement advertisementThe public will have 75 days to comment on the proposal.\n“E-cigarette enthusiasts say vaping is far safer than smoking cigarettes, and some experts say that may well be the case,” as NBCNews’s Maggie Fox writes.\nThere were already more than 70 comments to Tavernise’s story — reasoned, passionate and on all sides of the issue — early this morning.\nWhen FDA bans sale of #ecigs to ya, u can always bum a dangerous real cigarette from a friend!” But, says @aaronmfisher, “Selling death makes money and individuals sell their souls.\nWells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog tells the Times’ Tavernise that “the [FDA] proposal would probably lead to consolidation” in the industry.']"

158247,http://kgmi.com/news/030030-fda-moves-to-ban-sale-of-e-cigarettes-to-minors/,health,"['By Toni Clarke\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed rules on Thursday that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under 18, but would not restrict flavored products, online sales or advertising, which public health advocates say attract children.\n\nThe long-awaited proposal would subject the $2 billion e-cigarette industry to federal regulation for the first time.\n\nFDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said at a briefing that the proposal represented the first “foundational” step towards broader restrictions if scientific evidence shows they are needed to protect public health.\n\nCritics of e-cigarette advertising say it risks introducing a new generation of young people to conventional cigarettes when little is known about the long-term health impact of the products. And they lamented the fact that limits were not included in the proposed rule.\n\n“It’s very disappointing because they don’t do anything to rein in the wild-west marketing that is targeting kids,” said Stanton Glantz, a professor at the Center of Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco. “They should not have been so timid.”\n\nHamburg said the current proposal “lays the foundation for many more actions and activities.”\n\nVince Willmore, a spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, said the proposal “by no means does everything we think needs to be done, but it starts the process. What is critical now is that they finalize this rule and then move quickly to fill the gaps.”\n\nNO FREE SAMPLES\n\nA law passed in 2009 gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco and stipulated the agency could extend its jurisdiction to other nicotine products after issuing a rule to that effect. E-cigarettes use battery-powered cartridges to produce a nicotine-laced inhalable vapor.\n\nIn the short term, the rule would prohibit companies from distributing free e-cigarette samples, forbid vending machine sales except in adult-only venues and prohibit sales to minors. Companies would be required to warn that nicotine is addictive, but no other health warnings would be required. The addiction warning would have to be added no later than two years after the rule is set. The companies would not be allowed to make health claims in any advertising.\n\nThe proposal is subject to a public-comment period of 75 days. Willmore said the FDA should aim to establish the rule within a year.\n\nSome are skeptical that restrictions on marketing or flavors will come any time soon.\n\n“The reality of these things is that every step takes years,” said Glantz. “By not addressing the youth-directed marketing it means it won’t be addressed for a very long time.”\n\nSome e-cigarette companies that sell primarily through convenience stores were surprised at the lack of restrictions on online sales, since it can be difficult to verify a customer’s age over the internet.\n\n“The internet thing is very surprising to me,” said Miguel Martin, president of Logic Technology, one of the biggest e-cigarette manufacturers. “It reduces the visibility of the sales of the products and the type of products that the government has awareness of.”\n\nThe rules would require companies to submit new and existing products to the FDA for approval. They would have two years to submit applications from the time the rule goes into effect. Companies may continue selling their products and introducing new products pending the FDA’s review.\n\nIn the meantime, they would be required to register with the FDA and list the ingredients in their products. They would not be required to adhere immediately to specific product or quality control standards. That could come later, Hamburg said.\n\nEVOLVING “VAPING” INDUSTRY\n\nE-cigarettes and other “vaping” devices generate roughly $2 billion a year in the United States, and some industry analysts expect their sales to outpace the $85 billion conventional-cigarette industry within a decade.\n\nAdvocates of e-cigarettes claim they are a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, since they do not produce lung-destroying tar. But there is little data about their long-term safety.\n\nThe FDA’s proposal leaves many questions unanswered about how new products would be regulated over the long run. One key question relates to how products are approved.\n\nUnder current law, new tobacco products can be approved if they are “substantially equivalent” to a product that was on the market before February 15, 2007. It is unclear whether any e-cigarettes were on sale before then, to be used as a benchmark.\n\nMitch Zeller, head of the FDA’s tobacco division, said at a briefing that the agency would be seeking more information during the public-comment period on whether the “substantial equivalence” pathway is even valid for e-cigarettes.\n\nIf it is not, e-cigarette companies would have to use a different process, which would require them to prove their products are appropriate for public health, a higher hurdle to clear.\n\nAlso unclear is the fate of some cigars. The current proposal would include e-vaping products and other tobacco products, but premium cigars may be excluded. The FDA said it would seek public comment on whether all cigars should be regulated equally. One option proposed by the agency is to regulate them all. The other is to define a category of premium cigars that would not be subject to the FDA’s authority.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, premium cigars are considered those wrapped in whole tobacco leaf, made manually by combining the wrapper, filler and binder, have no characterizing flavor, have no filter, tip, or non-tobacco mouthpiece and are relatively expensive.\n\nTobacco company Lorillard Inc, owner of the blu e-cigarette brand, is the dominant player in the field, followed by privately held NJOY and Logic. The three account for an estimated 80 percent of the market.\n\n(Editing by Larry King)', 'In the short term, the rule would prohibit companies from distributing free e-cigarette samples, forbid vending machine sales except in adult-only venues and prohibit sales to minors.\nIn the meantime, they would be required to register with the FDA and list the ingredients in their products.\nUnder current law, new tobacco products can be approved if they are “substantially equivalent” to a product that was on the market before February 15, 2007.\nIt is unclear whether any e-cigarettes were on sale before then, to be used as a benchmark.\nThe current proposal would include e-vaping products and other tobacco products, but premium cigars may be excluded.']"

Vote Now in Urgent Poll\n\nUrgent:\n\nAssess Your Heart Attack Risk in Minutes. Click Here.\n\nThe sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under 18 would be banned under rules proposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, but flavored products, online sales or advertising would not be restricted.The long-awaited proposal would subject the $2 billion e-cigarette industry to federal regulation for the first time, according to Reuters FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said at a briefing that the proposal represented the first ""foundational"" step towards broader restrictions if scientific evidence shows they are needed to protect public health.Critics of e-cigarette advertising say it risks introducing a new generation of young people to conventional cigarettes when little is known about the long-term health impact of the products. And they lamented the fact that limits were not included in the proposed rule.""It\'s very disappointing because they don\'t do anything to rein in the wild-west marketing that is targeting kids,"" said Stanton Glantz, a professor at the Center of Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California San Francisco. ""They should not have been so timid.""Hamburg said the current proposal ""lays the foundation for many more actions and activities.""Vince Willmore, a spokesman for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, said the proposal ""by no means does everything we think needs to be done, but it starts the process. What is critical now is that they finalize this rule and then move quickly to fill the gaps.""A law passed in 2009 gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco and stipulated the agency could extend its jurisdiction to other nicotine products after issuing a rule to that effect. E-cigarettes use battery-powered cartridges to produce a nicotine-laced inhalable vapor.In the short term, the rule would prohibit companies from distributing free e-cigarette samples, forbid vending machine sales except in adult-only venues and prohibit sales to minors. Companies would be required to warn that nicotine is addictive, but no other health warnings would be required. The addiction warning would have to be added no later than two years after the rule is set. The companies would not be allowed to make health claims in any advertising.The proposal is subject to a public-comment period of 75 days. Willmore said the FDA should aim to establish the rule within a year.Some are skeptical that restrictions on marketing or flavors will come any time soon.""The reality of these things is that every step takes years,"" said Glantz. ""By not addressing the youth-directed marketing it means it won\'t be addressed for a very long time.""Some e-cigarette companies that sell primarily through convenience stores were surprised at the lack of restrictions on online sales, since it can be difficult to verify a customer\'s age over the internet.""The internet thing is very surprising to me,"" said Miguel Martin, president of Logic Technology, one of the biggest e-cigarette manufacturers. ""It reduces the visibility of the sales of the products and the type of products that the government has awareness of.""The rules would require companies to submit new and existing products to the FDA for approval. They would have two years to submit applications from the time the rule goes into effect. Companies may continue selling their products and introducing new products pending the FDA\'s review.In the meantime, they would be required to register with the FDA and list the ingredients in their products. They would not be required to adhere immediately to specific product or quality control standards. That could come later, Hamburg said.E-cigarettes and other ""vaping"" devices generate roughly $2 billion a year in the United States, and some industry analysts expect their sales to outpace the $85 billion conventional-cigarette industry within a decade.Advocates of e-cigarettes claim they are a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, since they do not produce lung-destroying tar. But there is little data about their long-term safety.The FDA\'s proposal leaves many questions unanswered about how new products would be regulated over the long run. One key question relates to how products are approved.Under current law, new tobacco products can be approved if they are ""substantially equivalent"" to a product that was on the market before February 15, 2007. It is unclear whether any e-cigarettes were on sale before then, to be used as a benchmark.Mitch Zeller, head of the FDA\'s tobacco division, said at a briefing that the agency would be seeking more information during the public-comment period on whether the ""substantial equivalence"" pathway is even valid for e-cigarettes.If it is not, e-cigarette companies would have to use a different process, which would require them to prove their products are appropriate for public health, a higher hurdle to clear.Also unclear is the fate of some cigars. The current proposal would include e-vaping products and other tobacco products, but premium cigars may be excluded. The FDA said it would seek public comment on whether all cigars should be regulated equally. One option proposed by the agency is to regulate them all. The other is to define a category of premium cigars that would not be subject to the FDA\'s authority.Under the proposed rule, premium cigars are considered those wrapped in whole tobacco leaf, made manually by combining the wrapper, filler and binder, have no characterizing flavor, have no filter, tip, or non-tobacco mouthpiece and are relatively expensive.Tobacco company Lorillard Inc, owner of the blu e-cigarette brand, is the dominant player in the field, followed by privately held NJOY and Logic. The three account for an estimated 80 percent of the market.', 'And they lamented the fact that limits were not included in the proposed rule.\nE-cigarettes use battery-powered cartridges to produce a nicotine-laced inhalable vapor.In the short term, the rule would prohibit companies from distributing free e-cigarette samples, forbid vending machine sales except in adult-only venues and prohibit sales to minors.\n""Some e-cigarette companies that sell primarily through convenience stores were surprised at the lack of restrictions on online sales, since it can be difficult to verify a customer\'s age over the internet.\n""It reduces the visibility of the sales of the products and the type of products that the government has awareness of.\nThe current proposal would include e-vaping products and other tobacco products, but premium cigars may be excluded.']"

Currently, the FDA only has regulatory authority over cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco.\n\nWhen these recommendations are finalized following a 75-day public comment period, the age limit to buy the products is expected to be at least 18, although individual states could choose to set it higher.\n\nHealth warnings would also be required and the sale of the products in vending machines would be prohibited. Initially, the only health warning required for e-cigarettes would be about the potential for addiction to nicotine.\n\nManufacturers would be required to register all their products and ingredients with the FDA. They would only be able to market new products after an FDA review, and they would need to provide scientific evidence before making any claims of direct or implied risk reduction associated with their product.\n\nCompanies would also no longer be allowed to give out free samples.\n\nAfter the public comment period and once the proposed rules are finalized, manufacturers will have 24 months to submit an application to allow their products to remain on the market or submit a new product application.\n\nE-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor. They are usually battery-operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine. When heated, the liquid in the cartridge turns into a vapor that’s inhaled.\n\nMost look like cigarettes, cigars or pipes, but some resemble pens or USB memory sticks. Because they have not been fully studied, the FDA says it’s unknown what health risks they pose, how much nicotine or other chemicals are actually being inhaled or whether there is any benefit to using them.\n\nLast year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the percentage of high school students who reported ever using an e-cigarette more than doubled in one year, from 4.7% to 10% between 2011 and 2012.\n\nAs electronic cigarettes have increased in popularity, so have the number of calls to poison control centers nationwide. According to a recent CDC report, poison control centers logged 215 calls involving e-cigarettes in February alone. Of those calls, 51% involved children.\n\n“It’s really the wild, wild west out there,” says Margaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner. “Because e-cigarettes are increasingly in the marketplace. They’re coming in different sizes, shapes and flavors in terms of the nicotine in them, and there’s very worrisome data that show that young people in particular are starting to take up e-cigarettes, especially the flavored ones and that might be a gateway to other harmful tobacco products.”\n\nHamburg says they don’t know how many types are on the market, another reason why regulation is critical.\n\n“We’re already conducting research and working with partners in the research community to better understand patterns of use of these e-cigarettes and to learn more about the way in which they work and the delivery of the nicotine through e-cigarettes. But until we can really regulate them, we can’t have all the information we need and we can’t take all the actions that we might want to to be able to best address the public health issues associated with them.”\n\nNicotine is a drug and poison experts say the concentrated liquid form used in e-cigarettes is highly toxic even in small doses. It can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin.\n\n“Responsibly marketed and properly regulated, it is possible that e-cigarettes could benefit public health if they help significantly reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco-related disease,” Matthew Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in February.\n\nBut a lot of unanswered questions remain, according to Dr. Michael Eriksen, dean of the School of Public Health at Georgia State University, one of 14 U.S. institutions conducting FDA-funded research on electronic cigarettes,\n\n“How concentrated is liquid nicotine? Are there impurities in it? Is it properly handled like a pesticide?” he says. “Nicotine is a pesticide fundamentally and we take so many precautions about pesticides for our lawns and how to wear gloves. But what precautions do consumers take when they put the nicotine vials in? People treat it [liquid nicotine] as sugar when it’s a toxin.”\n\nHarold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, believes nicotine is highly addictive whether used in a regular cigarette or an e-cigarette.\n\nSo how safe are e-cigarettes? Hamburg says it’s buyer beware.\n\n“We think that there’s a lot of information that needs to be understood about e-cigarettes and their use. We’re trying to help provide some of that information through research that we’re conducting,” she says.\n\n“But we need the tools that regulation provides to be able to get critical new knowledge about e-cigarettes and to be able to put in place a framework that will protect the American public and potentially e-cigarette users, and really address the issues of what are the health consequences and what are the potential benefits.”\n\nHamburg believes these new rules will change the landscape.\n\nIf the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she says, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans.', '(CNN, April 24, 2014) — The Food and Drug Administration is making another attempt at regulating electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.\nOn Thursday, the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, water pipe tobacco and hookahs.\nCurrently, the FDA only has regulatory authority over cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco.\nThey are usually battery-operated and come with a replaceable cartridge that contains liquid nicotine.\nIf the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she says, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans.']"

Imagine seeing a $50 bill on the floor in a rest stop bathroom. It’s been visibly stepped all over, torn, and is now a lovely shade of brown. Chances are that it won’t even last 15 more minutes on the floor, no matter how unappealing it may look. Even though we don’t necessarily get our money off bathroom floors, the amount of germs and pathogens on the average dollar bill would suggest that. Some countries are taking measures to clean their contaminated currency, but just how successful are these techniques in keeping money sterile?\n\nDirty Money\n\nAccording to Jane Carlton, lead researcher on the Dirty Money Project at New York University, each dollar bill carries thousands of types of bacteria on its surface. Although most of the bacteria is harmless, some is not. Her project aims to take a closer look at the types of organisms that are living on U.S. paper money with the hope of providing information to health workers that may help them catch disease outbreaks before they spread very far. “We’re not trying to be fear mongers, or suggest that everyone goes out and microwave their money, but I must admit that some of the $1 bills in New York City are really nasty,” Carlton told WYSO. The researcher explained that some of the bacteria found on the money include microbes from the mouth and vagina, and even traces of anthrax. In the United States, bank tellers will accept worn and soiled money, and put them to the side in order to pull them from circulation. However, tellers are allowed to refuse to accept money that is visibly contaminated. Scientists currently are not sure how much of a role money plays in transmitting pathogens and fueling outbreak, but some countries have made efforts to decrease this risk.\n\nPlastic Money\n\nThe idea of plastic money was first introduced in Canada in 1996. According to The Telegraph, since then, other countries including, Papau New Guinea, Romania, New Zealand, and Vietnam have also introduced plastic cash. Great Britain announced that after 300 years of cotton-based notes, they will begin their switch to plastic currency beginning in 2016. The plastic bills, which are actually made from a material called plastic polymer film, are advertised as more hygienic than traditional paper bills. A study by the University of Ballarat in Australia found that there were usually fewer bacteria on polymer bills than cotton-based ones. “The thing about a polymer note is that it is not absorbent. There is a cleanliness benefit, which is a health issue,” Philippe Etienne, managing director for a company that manufactures bank-note paper for 23 countries, told The Wall Street Journal. However, a contrasting study found that certain bacteria tended to survive longer on the polymer bank notes than cotton-based ones. The study determined that the polymer structure allowed for the growth and transmission of multi-drug resistant pathogens. However, it also found that cotton-based money was not much better in hygiene.\n\nMoney Sterilization\n\nIn the mid-1990s in Japan, a company called Hitachi introduced an ATM that would sterilize bank notes. According to Forbes, this was done by heating them to 392 degrees. Although a novel idea, the notes are re-contaminated as soon as they are touched by human hands. Bacteria feed on the oils residue we leave after touching something. Although the oil can be cleaned off with solvents, Forbes also explained that the cleaning process can seriusly damage security features such as holograms and magnetic or fluorescing ink. This is likely to be one of the reasons the Japanese money cleaning ATMs never caught on very well on an international level. A study released last year revealed that scientists have developed a safer money cleaning process which superheats CO2 to 600 degrees at 5,000 PSI. At this level, it behaves both like a gas and liquid and is able to clean notes without damaging their anti-forgery measures. This is not readily available yet, but some hope it will help save billions spent on replacing worn bills by having them cleaned rather than destroyed.\n\nSources:\n\nVriesekoop F, Russell C, Alvarez-Mayorga B, et al.

They\'re teeming with life.\n\nEach dollar bill carries about 3,000 types of bacteria on its surface, scientists have found. Most are harmless. But cash also has DNA from drug-resistant microbes. And your wad of dough may even have a smudge of anthrax and diphtheria.\n\nIn other words, your wallet is a portable petri dish.\n\nMade from plastic, Canadian $100 bills are resistant to liquids and tearing. But are they better than cotton-based bills at keeping dangerous bacteria at bay? (Mark Blinch/Reuters /Landov)\n\nAnd currency may be one way antibiotic-resistant genes move around cities, says biologist Jane Carlton, who\'s leading the Dirty Money Project at the New York University.\n\nThe project offers an in-depth look at the living organisms shacking up on our cash. One goal of the work is to provide information that could help health workers catch disease outbreaks in New York City before they spread very far.\n\n""We\'re not trying to be fear mongers, or suggest that everyone goes out and microwave their money,"" Carlton tells Shots. ""But I must admit that some of the $1 bills in New York City are really nasty.""\n\nSo far, Carlton and her colleagues have sequenced all the DNA found on about 80 dollar bills from a Manhattan bank. Their findings aren\'t published yet. But she gave Shots a sneak peak of what they\'ve found so far.\n\nThe most common microbes on the bills, by far, are ones that cause acne. The runners-up were a bunch of skin bacteria that aren\'t pathogenic: They simply like to hang out on people\'s bodies. Some of these critters may even protect the skin from harmful microbes, Carlton says.\n\nOther money dwellers included mouth microbes — because people lick their fingers when they count bills, Carlton says — and bacteria that thrive in the vagina. ""People probably aren\'t washing their hands after the bathroom,"" she says.\n\nWhat about the potential traces of anthrax DNA? Not a cause for alarm, Carlton says.\n\n""Anthrax is a very common bacteria in soil,"" Carlton says. ""People who work with soil, like farmers, are often exposed to it. It\'s only when anthrax is weaponized and sent through the mail that it causes those issues.""\n\nAnd some of the DNA that looks like anthrax\'s could have come from a harmless relative, she notes.\n\nThe DNA survey also detected genes that make bacteria impervious to penicillin and methicillin. The latter make MRSA bacteria such dangerous pathogens.\n\n""Now we know that viable bacteria are on money and could serve as a mode of transmission for antibiotic-resistant genes,"" Carlton says. ""Money is a frequent route of contact between people in New York City.""\n\nAt this point, though, scientists don\'t how important money is for transmitting pathogens and fueling disease outbreaks.\n\nWould changing the material for dollar bills are made from help to keep them cleaner? The jury is still out.\n\nSome countries, such as Canada, have started printing money on flexible sheets of polymer film, a fancy plastic. One study found less bacteria, in general, grew on these plastic bills than cotton-based ones, like the dollar and euro notes. But another study reported that microbes survive longer on polymer-based bills, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.\n\nUntil the ideal material gets figured out, the best protection against money\'s invisible inhabitants is also the simplest one: Wash your hands after handling cash.\n\nCopyright NPR 2019.', 'You may have heard that dollar bills harbor trace amounts of drugs.\n""We\'re not trying to be fear mongers, or suggest that everyone goes out and microwave their money,"" Carlton tells Shots.\nSome of these critters may even protect the skin from harmful microbes, Carlton says.\n""Now we know that viable bacteria are on money and could serve as a mode of transmission for antibiotic-resistant genes,"" Carlton says.\nWould changing the material for dollar bills are made from help to keep them cleaner?']"

The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nAbout 85% of the patients were men and their average age was 34. In nine cases the patient died.\n\nWhile the study doesn’t identify a particular level of risk of marijuana use, it does call for more research on the subject, and warns doctors that there seems to be at least some danger.\n\n“Currently people think (cannabis is) harmless,” says lead study author Emilie Jouanjus, at the Université Toulouse III – Paul Sabatier. “What I think is very important from my work is that we see cannabis use may lead to very serious complications on the cardiovascular system.”\n\nJouanjus was surprised to find all but one of the patients with cardiovascular problems were under the age of 50. She believes this study shows only the tip of the iceberg, as people usually under-report their cannabis use.\n\n“This study shows a some preliminary evidence of cardiovascular harm from marijuana but isn’t conclusive,” Dr. Allen Taylor, chief of cardiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, told CNN in an e-mail. “The study’s limitations are important in that we can’t know how high the risk is, just that there is a signal of risk between marijuana smoking and heart troubles.”\n\nTaylor says it’s a shame that more isn’t known about the potential harms of cannabis.\n\n“It seems that public perception is ahead of the science,” he says. “We should remain open to the scientific facts as they evolve.”\n\nOnly 20% of patients in the study had a known history of heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. The other patients may have had unknown cardiovascular risk factors or a history that was not documented in the medical file.\n\n“I’m not saying that any user of cannabis would suffer from any of these complications,” Jouanjus says. But “we do not have enough information to say that cannabis use is safe.”\n\nDr. Shereif Rezkalla. who wrote an editorial accompanying the study in JAMA, said doctors should be required to ask about marijuana use when they see a cardiac patient.\n\n“The perception that marijuana is safe is deep-seated in the public and even amongst some health professionals,” says Rezkalla, a cardiologist at Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin.\n\nTaylor cautions that while this study doesn’t provide a final answer on the link between cannabis and serious heart problems, “it at least gives one pause to suggest to patients it may not be a heart-healthy habit.”\n\nPrevious research has suggested marijuana use may double the risk of stroke in young adults.\n\nBy By Trisha Henry, CNN', '(CNN) – Young people who use marijuana may be at risk for heart attacks and other serious cardiovascular problems, a new study suggests.\nFrom 2006 to 2010, they found 35 reports of patients who had experienced cardiovascular complications following cannabis use.\nThe study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n“We should remain open to the scientific facts as they evolve.”Only 20% of patients in the study had a known history of heart disease or risk factors for heart disease.\nThe other patients may have had unknown cardiovascular risk factors or a history that was not documented in the medical file.']"

Of the nearly 2,000 reported complications related to marijuana, the researchers found that 2 percent, or 35 cases, involved heart problems. These cases included 20 people who suffered a heart attack, and nine who died.\n\nResearchers found most patients were men, with an average age of about 34. Regular marijuana users with a family history of heart disease had an increased risk of heart disease, according to the study, published April 23 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nMany of the patients also had other risk factors for heart disease, such as smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol, the researchers noted. Nevertheless, nearly half of the patients were regular users of only marijuana.\n\nResearchers also found a small increase in heart problems over time. In 2006, only 1.1 percent of the reported complications were heart related, but that rate increased to 3.6 percent in 2010. [Marijuana: 5 Surprising Facts About Pot]\n\n""The general public thinks marijuana is harmless, but information revealing the potential health dangers of marijuana use needs to be disseminated to the public, policymakers and health care providers,"" said study researcher Émilie Jouanjus, a medical faculty member at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse in France.\n\nConsidering 1.2 million people in France use marijuana regularly, the number of reported complications may seem small. The researchers said, however, that the surveillance system may miss many drug-related complications.\n\nThis type of study cannot demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship between marijuana and heart problems, but the findings underscore the need for more research on this topic, experts said.\n\n""The study is very small and has many limitations, but it is a warning sign,"" said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist and the director of Women\'s Heart Health of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York.\n\n""The perception is that marijuana is a magical drug, that it\'s totally safe, and we can use it in medical treatment. What we don\'t know about are the negative effects, the potential harms,"" said Steinbaum, who is also an op-ed contributor to LiveScience.\n\nSeveral previous reports have linked marijuana use with serious heart problems. In one study involving nearly 4,000 patients, researchers found that people\'s risk of heart attacks increased five times in the first hour after marijuana use. This five-fold increase in risk is a little higher than the risk for sex, about the same as that for intense exercise, and much less than the risk caused by cocaine, which increases one\'s chance of having a heart attack 25-fold, the researchers told reporters last year.\n\nPrevious studies have also suggested marijuana use could increase heart rate and blood pressure, and reduce the blood\'s ability to carry oxygen, which may contribute to the higher risk for heart attacks.\n\nAltogether, the new findings and evidence from previous studies suggest that, like any other drug, marijuana has its own share of risks.\n\n""There is clear clinical evidence to suggest a therapeutic benefit of inhaled marijuana for the management of a number of chronic, debilitating conditions. However, clinical evidence also suggests the potential for serious cardiovascular risks associated with marijuana use, including myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmias, stroke and even death,"" Dr. Shereif Rezkalla, a cardiologist at the Marshfield Clinic, in Marshfield, Wisconsin, wrote in an editorial accompanying the new study.\n\nMore on LiveScience and MNN:\n\nThis story was originally written for LiveScience and has been republished with permission here.

Now, new research published in the Journal of the American Heart Association reveals that using the drug may also increase the risk of cardiovascular complications and even lead to death, particularly for young and middle-aged adults.\n\nMarijuana, also known as cannabis, is the most commonly used illegal drug in the US. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, around 52% of Americans aged 18-25 years use marijuana in their lifetime, while approximately 44% aged 26 years or older use the drug.\n\nIt is well known that the drug can cause brain impairments. Medical News Today recently reported on a study suggesting that even casual use of marijuana can alter areas of the brain involved in emotion and motivation.\n\nBut the investigators of this most recent study, led by Émilie Jouanjus, PhD, of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse in France, say that in previous studies, the team found that many young marijuana users were hospitalized as a result of cardiovascular complications.\n\nTo investigate further, the team analyzed data from the French Addictovigilance Network between 2006 and 2010, which looked at complications reported following marijuana use.\n\n'Compelling evidence on cardiovascular effects of marijuana'\n\nFrom 1,979 marijuana-related complications reported, the team identified 35 cases linked to cardiovascular and vascular conditions. The majority of these cases were in males of an average age of 34.3 years.\n\nThe team says that 22 of the cases were heart related, of which 20 were heart attacks.

This is a problem that could be applied globally.\n\nJouanjus therefore stresses that information revealing potential health dangers of marijuana - such as the data in this most recent study - needs to be presented to the public, policymakers and health care providers in order to abolish the general view that marijuana is harmless.\n\nThis is not the only study to link marijuana use to cardiovascular problems. Last year, Medical News Today reported on a study revealing that marijuana use may double the risk of stroke among young adults."", ""'Compelling evidence on cardiovascular effects of marijuana'From 1,979 marijuana-related complications reported, the team identified 35 cases linked to cardiovascular and vascular conditions.\nNine of the patients with these cardiovascular problems died.\nShare on Pinterest Researchers have linked marijuana use to increased risk of cardiovascular problems, particularly for young and middle-aged adults.\nCommenting on the findings, Jouanjus says:The investigators say that it is likely marijuana use and any related health problems are underreported.\nThis is not the only study to link marijuana use to cardiovascular problems.""]"

These were cases of peripheral arteriopathies, and cardiac and cerebrovascular disorders, some of which resulted in the death. These findings conducted us to conclude that marijuana is a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease in young adults.\n\n\n\nMedicalResearch.com: Were any of the results unexpected?\n\nDr. Jouanjus: In a previous study, we had been stunned to observe several very serious cases of cardiovascular complications in young cannabis users (Jouanjus et al. British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 2011: 71; 758-65). With the present work, we were willing to explore at the national level whether such cases were described, and to survey their evolution across time. Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disorders and peripheral arteriopathies arisen in 34 years old (on average) cannabis users confirmed our fears. Cases were remarkably serious, or even lethal. Moreover, their report has constantly increased, especially during the last three observed years. This result is surprising considering that cardiovascular complications, when toxic cause is suspected, are more commonly attributed by doctors to cocaine or amphetamine use. These results raise concern about the harmful potential of marijuana and its impact on public health, notably because its medicinal use has become more prevalent in particular since some governments are legalizing its use.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What should clinicians and patients take away from your report?\n\nDr. Jouanjus: Cannabis use is commonly thought to be harmless, however, there is now compelling evidence on the growing risk of cannabis-associated adverse cardiovascular effects, especially in the Young. It is therefore important that users as well as clinicians be aware of this. Doctors, including cardiologists, must consider cannabis use as one of the potential causes of cardiovascular disorders. Indeed, exposure to cannabis should be systematically investigated in patients presenting with cardiovascular problems. This should contribute to improve the clinical management of cannabis using patients, as well as prognosis of the pathologies their suffer from.\n\nMedicalResearch.com: What recommendations do you have for future research as a result of this study?\n\nDr. Jouanjus: The surveillance of cannabis-related reports of cardiovascular disorders needs to be maintained. Furthermore, fundamental experiments would be of interest to ascertain the mechanisms through which cannabis may trigger such cardiovascular disorders, especially since its medicinal use is increasing. Actually, the precise pathways involved are still debated and remain somehow controversial. Their elucidation would help in understanding how harmful cannabis may be, in particular in young people.

On a nearby bench, a mother adjusted masks on two small boys.\n\nIt was a sign of the alarm in this humid Red Sea city after a 47 percent jump in the past month in the number of confirmed cases of MERS, a virus identified in Saudi Arabia two years ago and which can cause coughing, fever and pneumonia.\n\nOf the 91 new cases announced in the kingdom in April, 73 were in Jeddah. Many of those infected were healthcare workers.\n\n“Everyone I know, my friends, neighbours, relatives, it’s like we were on the dark side,” said Lamya Gazzaz, a former nurse and longtime Jeddah resident, speaking of the early days of the outbreak when rumours swirled around the city.\n\n“There was lots of confusion. Relatives kept their children at home. People were worried about going to hospitals for their appointments,” she added.\n\nAnother Jeddah resident, 35-year-old Roula, who did not want to give her family name, said many of her friends were scared.\n\n“My friend’s uncle died two days ago after going to a hospital. I didn’t even go to the funeral because I’m worried they might be carrying the virus. Everyone who did go wore a mask,” she said.\n\nPublic concern has been heightened by the spread of rumours on social media that there were many undiagnosed cases, as well as accusations of government cover-ups and inadequate hygiene procedures in some hospitals.\n\nThe Health Ministry has denied such charges. But the authorities struggled in the early stages of the outbreak to gain control of the public message, simply issuing stern warnings against the spreading of rumours.\n\nLINK TO CAMELS?\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) says it is “concerned” and has offered to help investigate the outbreak in Saudi Arabia and another in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSince MERS first emerged in April 2012, some 253 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been reported to the WHO, including 93 deaths. While the vast majority are in Saudi Arabia, there have also been cases in Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, as well as Europe, North Africa and Asia.\n\nThe WHO said the source of infection remains “undetermined”, but evidence is growing of a link to camels, believed by many experts to be the animal reservoir of the virus.\n\nMERS is from the same virus family as SARS, which killed some 800 people worldwide after emerging in China in 2002.\n\nOn Monday, King Abdullah replaced health minister Abdullah al-Rabeeah, a noted surgeon whose attempts to reassure the public with reminders that MERS is not easily spread between people were dismissed by many Saudis as an attempt to downplay the gravity of the situation.\n\nDespite heading a team that separated a pair of conjoined twins on April 10, when three new MERS cases were identified in Jeddah, al-Rabeeah lacked the popular touch of the man who has replaced him on an acting basis, Labour Minister Adel Fakieh.\n\nFakieh’s first moves in his new job were to tour Jeddah’s King Fahd Hospital, where some of the cases were discovered, and to pledge to uphold “the principles of transparency”.\n\nKing Fahd Hospital felt unusually quiet for a major city health facility this week.\n\nAlmost every person in the building wore masks. Posters in the mainly empty waiting rooms advised on preventative measures such as wearing masks and gloves and frequent hand-washing.\n\n“It’s normal for there to be a panic during an outbreak because it’s a high mortality event. People get the flu and then in five or six days they’re on a ventilator,” said Maun Nizar Feteih, a consultant pulmonologist in Jeddah.\n\n“Even as healthcare workers, we panic because we see colleagues - doctors and nurses we work with - who are suddenly in intensive care. But ... I think things are moving in a positive direction,” Feteih added.\n\nHe said authorities had worked to educate both healthcare workers and patients about prevention and had collaborated with hospitals to isolate suspected and confirmed cases.\n\nLOSS OF CREDIBILITY\n\nThat view was not universally shared by people working in Jeddah hospitals, however.\n\n“Healthcare workers lost trust in the Health Ministry. It lost its credibility,” said a senior healthcare worker in the city with decades of experience.\n\nShe pointed to what she described as poor file-keeping, an initial lack of protective clothing and proper guidance and resistance by some administrators to report MERS cases.\n\nIn the expensive Khaldiya neighbourhood, where the pink flowers of bougainvillea bushes spill over the tops of residential walls, the al-Sudais pharmacy was doing a roaring trade in face masks and hand-sanitising gels.\n\n“Jeddah people are scared. They come in here and buy vitamins, calcium tablets, pain killers and flu drugs. They buy four or five cartons of face masks at a time and boxes of hand sanitisers,” said Gassan Youssef, 22, a salesman.\n\nBut not all of those walking the city’s muggy streets or strolling the marbled corridors of its chilled shopping malls were worried about being infected while out in public.\n\nA taxi driver waved a dismissive hand across his bushy grey beard and said dozens of people died in car crashes on Jeddah’s roads every week. “Why should we worry because one or two people get this virus?” he asked.', 'Of the 91 new cases announced in the kingdom in April, 73 were in Jeddah.\nAnother Jeddah resident, 35-year-old Roula, who did not want to give her family name, said many of her friends were scared.\nSince MERS first emerged in April 2012, some 253 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been reported to the WHO, including 93 deaths.\nMERS is from the same virus family as SARS, which killed some 800 people worldwide after emerging in China in 2002.\nShe pointed to what she described as poor file-keeping, an initial lack of protective clothing and proper guidance and resistance by some administrators to report MERS cases.']"

Here are some commonly asked questions about Mers.\n\n1. How many countries have had confirmed cases of Mers?\n\nAs of now, cases have been confirmed in the following countries: France, Germany, Italy, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and recently, the Philippines.\n\n2. Can I still travel to these countries?\n\nYes, you can still travel, but travelers are advised to follow standard precautions when travelling to these countries.\n\n3. What if I got sick after travelling to these countries? Does it mean I have Mers?\n\nIt depends on the symptoms. If you experience cough or shortness of breath within 14 days after traveling from these countries, it's better to have a checkup and mention to the doctor that you had travelled.\n\n4. What are the available treatments/vaccines for Mers?\n\nThere is no vaccine for Mers. Only a supportive treatment can be provided by hospitals depending on the clinical condition of the patient.\n\n5. Was it transmitted from bats to humans?\n\nRecent studies suggest that Mers is genetically related to a virus found among bats in southern Africa. However, it's not yet confirmed whether Mers originated from bats.\n\n6. Is it true that it came from camels too?\n\nStudies show that a specific virus likely to the Mers has also been found among camels. However, there is much to prove about the virus found among camels being identical to those in humans.\n\n7. Are people advised to avoid animal contact or animal products?\n\nThe World Health Organization advised people to avoid contact with sick animals and to minimize intake of raw or undercooked animal products. Examples of these are milk and meat, which can potentially contain high risk of infection. Observe proper hygiene at all times.\n\nAlso read: 10 important facts you should know about Mers\n\nContent courtesy:Medarabiais a healthcare and medical network in the Middle East.\n\nDisclaimer: All content on this page has been provided by Medarabia and Khaleej Times is not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information provided here.\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\nMore >\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVote\n\n"", '7 frequently asked questions about Mers and their answersWith Saudi Arabia reporting two more deaths from Mers, the total toll in the kingdom has gone up to 83.\nHere are some commonly asked questions about Mers.\nHow many countries have had confirmed cases of Mers?\nRecent studies suggest that Mers is genetically related to a virus found among bats in southern Africa.\nStudies show that a specific virus likely to the Mers has also been found among camels.']"

At one time, he cut his visit to France to return home to Jizan and be with the people as they faced at the Rift Valley Fever,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the country’s health ministry said on Thursday that two more patients who became infected with the virus have died, and that 13 others have contracted the virus.\n\nThe new cases were reported in the capital of Riyadh, as well as Jeddah and the Islamic holy cities of Makkah and Medina.\n\nThe deaths bring to 83 the number of people who have died in the kingdom since contracting the virus in September 2012. The kingdom has recorded a total of 285 confirmed cases.\n\nOn Monday, King Abdullah removed the country’s health minister following a recent spike in MERS cases. The unscheduled visit by the monarch was the latest indication of a new approach taken by the Saudis to deal with Mers as the health ministry announced new cases, including the first case in Makkah, the city where pilgrims from all over the world perform the rituals of Umrah throughout the year and the rituals of pilgrimage once a year.\n\nThe presence of the virus in the city would mean much higher risks of international contacts, especially considering that the holy month of Ramadan is due this summer, when Muslims from around the world converge on the city to perform the Umrah.\n\nSaudi authorities have reassured the local and international communities that the outbreak was not an epidemic.\n\nAbdullah Mirghalani, assistant deputy Haj minister, told local daily Al Eqtisadia that the Health Ministry had not declared the situation an emergency and that the Haj Ministry would act only in accordance with decisions made by health authorities.\n\nEarlier this week, King Abdullah replaced the country’s health minister Abdullah Al Rabeeah with Labour Minister Adel Faqih on an acting basis.\n\nThe new minister’s action was to visit a hospital in Jeddah hit by a high cases of the virus to assess the situation and assure the local community.\n\nOn Thursday, he denied reports that schools would be shut down to contain the potentially deadly virus.\n\n“What was said about suspending classes lacks credibility,” the minister posted on his Twitter account. “No statement to that effect has been issued and the [health] ministry will update the media and society with any information.”\n\nThe World Health Organisation said on Wednesday that the recent cluster of cases among health workers was a cause of concern as the virus had clearly been contracted from a human patient and not directly from an animal host.\n\n“WHO is unaware at this point in time of the specific types of exposure in the health care facilities that have resulted in transmission of these infections, but this remains a concern,” the UN agency said.\n\n“Therefore, WHO has offered its assistance to mobilise international expertise to Saudi Arabia and UAE to investigate the current outbreaks in order to determine the transmission chain of this recent cluster and whether there is any evolving risk that may be associated with the current transmissibility pattern of the virus.”\n\n- with inputs from AP and AFP', 'Manama: Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz has arrived in Jeddah, the Red Sea city worst hit by the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) coronavirus, to reassure the people there, a Saudi official said.\nMeanwhile, the country’s health ministry said on Thursday that two more patients who became infected with the virus have died, and that 13 others have contracted the virus.\nThe new cases were reported in the capital of Riyadh, as well as Jeddah and the Islamic holy cities of Makkah and Medina.\nOn Monday, King Abdullah removed the country’s health minister following a recent spike in MERS cases.\nEarlier this week, King Abdullah replaced the country’s health minister Abdullah Al Rabeeah with Labour Minister Adel Faqih on an acting basis.']"

In fact, the cases announced so far in April represent 43 per cent of all MERS cases diagnosed since the first known infections in April of 2012.\n\nIt took two years since those first cases for the global tally to hit the 200 mark. That happened in late March. Now the combined total announced by the WHO and affected countries is over 360 cases.\n\nThe WHO statement said it is particularly worried about two outbreaks in health-care facilities, calling them significant. One is occurring in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, while the other is in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nWhile the UAE has announced a couple of dozen cases in recent days, the lion\'s share of the spike has occurred in Saudi Arabia, which has announced 80 new cases in the past week.\n\nEarlier this week Saudi Arabia\'s executive council fired the country\'s health minister. While no official reason was given, it is believed dissatisfaction with his handling of the MERS outbreak was behind the move.\n\nThe WHO noted about three quarters of the recently diagnosed cases involve person-to-person spread of the virus, with most of the affected people contracting the virus in hospitals.\n\n""Approximately 75 per cent of the recently reported cases are secondary cases, meaning that they are considered to have acquired the infection from another case through human-to-human transmission,"" said Dr. Ala Alwan, regional director of the WHO\'s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office.\n\n""The majority of these secondary cases have been infected within the health-care setting and are mainly health-care workers, although several patients are also considered to have been infected with MERS-CoV"" — CoV is short for coronavirus — ""while in hospital for other reasons.""\n\nThe two countries have also exported cases. A man from Greece who became ill with a gastro-intestinal ailment while in Jeddah sought care in a hospital there. Later he flew home with symptoms of MERS and has been confirmed as a case.\n\nA man from Malaysia who was in Saudi Arabia on a religious pilgrimage contracted the virus and died after returning to his home country. And a nurse who tested positive for the virus in UAE flew home to the Philippines.\n\nAmong the 24 cases that Saudi Arabia reported Wednesday was a Turkish man who was in the country as a pilgrim. The Saudi ministry of health says the man is in hospital in Mecca in stable condition.\n\nUntil recently, Saudi officials have reluctantly shared information, preferring, it appeared, to deal with the problem on their own. The WHO and outside experts have plead with authorities there to conduct what\'s known as a case control study to try to figure out how an animal virus — likely coming from camels — is infecting people. But to date there has been no such study done or if one has been done its results have not been shared.\n\nBut in recent days Saudi officials have spoken of seeking help from the WHO and international experts. And WHO said Wednesday it has offered to mobilize international expertise through its Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to help both Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nOne expert who has been following MERS developments closely is Dr. Allison McGeer, an infection control expert and a key figure in Toronto\'s SARS outbreak response.\n\nMcGeer, who is head of infection control at Toronto\'s Mount Sinai Hospital, said it is hard from a distance to gauge what going on with MERS, but she expressed concern about the apparent size of the Jeddah outbreak.\n\nMcGeer travelled to Saudi Arabia in the spring of 2013 to investigate and help control an earlier hospital outbreak at Al Ahsa. She said containing the virus there was easy — which leads her to wonder why the Jeddah outbreak appears to be so large and difficult to stop.\n\nShe said one possibility is that infection control measures are failing. But McGeer said Saudi Arabia has good infection control expertise.\n\nAnother option, she noted, is that something may have changed in the virus, making it more transmissible than it was last year. But she said there isn\'t evidence to suggest the virus has changed enough to be able to spread efficiently from person-to-person in the community, like cold and flu viruses do.\n\nStill, SARS did most of its damage in hospitals, where it spread well among patients and health-care workers. And people familiar with SARS who are watching MERS see many parallels between the two.', 'The World Health Organization expressed concern Wednesday about the recent sharp rise in MERS cases in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nIn fact, the cases announced so far in April represent 43 per cent of all MERS cases diagnosed since the first known infections in April of 2012.\nOne is occurring in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, while the other is in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.\nWhile no official reason was given, it is believed dissatisfaction with his handling of the MERS outbreak was behind the move.\nAmong the 24 cases that Saudi Arabia reported Wednesday was a Turkish man who was in the country as a pilgrim.']"

The day's toll brings the total number of cases in the country to 285, including 83 deaths, since the virus was first recognized in 2012.\n\nThe cases include nine from the capital of Riyadh as well as eight from Jeddah, which has been the site of a large healthcare-associated cluster.\n\nFive patients are reported from the holy city of Mecca.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization is reporting nine more confirmed cases in the United Arab Emirates, including several linked to a 45-year-old paramedic who died of the disease early in April in Abu Dhabi.\n\nOne of those cases, a 52-year-old woman from Abu Dhabi, may be linked to the continuing healthcare-associated cluster in Jeddah; the WHO says she was in Jeddah from April 5 to 16 and visited a hospital there three times.\n\nAnd two studies in Emerging Infectious Diseases add to the evidence that camels play a role in the disease, including one that suggests MERS was circulating in Africa years before it was first recognized in humans.\n\nAnalysis of stored blood samples collected during the period 2009 through 2011 at abattoirs in Nigeria, Tunisia, and Ethiopia found that a high proportion of the animals had had antibodies to the MERS coronavirus, according to Chantal Reusken, PhD, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands.\n\nIn Nigeria and Ethiopia, more than 93% of animals were seropositive for the MERS virus, while rates in Tunisia ranged from 30% to 54%, depending on the age of the animals.\n\nOne implication of the finding, the authors argued, is that human cases might have occurred or be occurring outside the Arabian Peninsula and are being missed.

One incentive was the 2007 contamination of pet food from China with melamine, which killed hundreds of dogs and cats in the U.S.\n\n“That was a tragic thing for pets, and it was sort of a wake-up call for everyone involved in food safety,” said Dan McChesney, an FDA veterinary medicine official. “If this could happen with pet food, why couldn’t it happen with human food?”\n\nLivestock feed is generally safe, and the FDA is not aware of any problems with brewers’ grain, McChesney said. The agency did not intend to force beer makers to come up with costly food safety plans, but it is concerned about potential contamination between the factory and the farm, he said.\n\nBrewers noted their grain is already covered by food safety rules for humans.\n\nMore regulation “just looked like it was a solution looking for a problem,” said Deb Carey, co-owner of New Glarus Brewing Wisconsin.

The change was noted in a blog posted Thursday on the FDA’s website by Michael R. Taylor, the agency’s deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine.\n\nAdditional Photos Farmer Norman Justice displays spent grain that he feeds his cattle along with their regular feed at his farm in Gorham. The spent grain comes from Allagash Brewing Co. in Portland. 2014 Press Herald File Photo/John Patriquin Related Headlines Grain partnership between Maine brewers, farmers in peril\n\n“The FDA has gotten the message, loud and clear, that this is a perfectly safe practice, and should be allowed to continue,” said U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree in a news release.\n\n“They have even acknowledged that it just doesn’t make sense to create strict new food safety rules that would end this age-old practice,” said Pingree, a member of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\nThe proposed rule change was part of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, which gave the FDA sweeping authority to overhaul federal food safety regulations. It came about because of concerns about tainted pet food from China. The rule would have covered all types of foods destined for pets, farm animals and zoos.\n\nTaylor noted in his blog that the FDA received a significant number of objections to the proposed rule change, which would have required brewers to dry and package their mashed brown sludge before giving it or selling it to farmers. Opponents said that step would have been cost-prohibitive.\n\nThe proposal ignited opposition including a letter to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg signed by several U.S. senators, including Republican Susan Collins and independent Angus King of Maine.\n\nTaylor said that, after further consideration, the proposed rule would have imposed costs on farms and breweries without adding value for food or feed safety. “That, of course, would not make common sense, and we’re not going to do it,” Taylor wrote.\n\nCollins and King, in their letter to Hamburg dated March 31, said they recognized the importance of food safety but asked the FDA to reconsider its position, given the potential for economic harm.\n\nMany breweries in Maine donate their spent grain to farms, a tradition that saves farmers money on livestock feed.\n\nThe practice also saves breweries disposal costs for the spent grain, a mash substance that is created after brewers heat barley and other grains to extract sugars, proteins and nutrients.\n\n“Since at least the Middle Ages, brewers have donated or sold (often for very little money) these spent grains to farmers,” the senators wrote. “A recent study indicates that nearly 90 percent of spent grains produced by craft brewers is used for animal feed. The proposed rule would effectively end this centuries-old practice.”\n\n“Inevitably, limiting a source of free, or nearly free, animal feed will mean additional costs for the farmers,” the senators argued.\n\nNorman Justice, who raises beef cattle on a farm in Gorham, said the proposed rule would have eliminated an inexpensive source of livestock feed and would have forced farmers to pay more for other feed, such as hay or corn.\n\n“It’s a huge issue,” Justice said Thursday night. “And it’s not just Maine that would have been affected. This would have affected farmers across the country. We’ve been doing this since man started brewing beer.”\n\nDan Kleban, who owns the Maine Beer Co. on Route 1 in Freeport, said his company donates about five tons of spent grain to a farmer in Brunswick each week. He applauded the FDA for listening to farmers, small craft brewers and legislators who opposed the rule change.\n\n“It’s free and it’s nutrient-rich,” Kleban said. “We’d have to landfill the grain if we couldn’t give it to the farmer, and that would increase our costs.”\n\nSean Sullivan, executive director of the Maine Brewers’ Guild, said, “If that rule were to have gone into effect, it would have been horrible for our industry.”\n\nDennis Hoey can be contacted at 791-6365 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.', 'Additional Photos Farmer Norman Justice displays spent grain that he feeds his cattle along with their regular feed at his farm in Gorham.\nThe spent grain comes from Allagash Brewing Co. in Portland.\nThe proposed rule change was part of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, which gave the FDA sweeping authority to overhaul federal food safety regulations.\nMany breweries in Maine donate their spent grain to farms, a tradition that saves farmers money on livestock feed.\nHe applauded the FDA for listening to farmers, small craft brewers and legislators who opposed the rule change.']"

Brewers say $50m\u200b\n\nThe politician insists that the FDA’s new federal rule – the 120-day consultation period ended earlier this year would be a “double whammy\u200b” for his New York constituency that would hurt craft brewers and farmers alike.\n\n“This proposed FDA rule would drive up costs for both farmers and brewers with no clear health and safety benefit,”\u200b Schumer said, adding that the rule change could cost brewers $50m/year.\n\n“So I’m urging the FDA to do an about-face on this misguided rule, which would stymie a mutually beneficial relationship between two of upstate New York’s most important industries,”\u200b he added.\n\nSenator Schumer argues that many brewers would find it cheaper to simply throw the grain away rather than comply with the new regulation, and warns it could drive up the cost of beer for consumers by making brewers’ production processes less efficient.\n\n“The brewing industry estimates that compliance with the proposed rule could cost over $50m a year and could be a significant burden on small brewers who produce fewer than 1,000 barrels of beer annually,”\u200b Schumer writes, in his letter to Hamburg.\n\n“I hope you will…revise the proposed rule to uphold strong and meaningful safety standards without placing unnecessary burdens on both brewers and farmers,”\u200b he adds.', '“Through a comprehensive review of the animal food safety system in the US, the agency has identified gaps in the regulation of non-medicated animal food,”\u200b the FDA insists, in its background to the proposed rule.\n“An improved animal food safety system can reduce the number of recalls, reduce the risk of serious illness and death to animals…reducing the risk of adverse health events to humans handling contaminated animal food,”\u200b the FDA states.\nBrewers say $50m\u200bThe politician insists that the FDA’s new federal rule – the 120-day consultation period ended earlier this year would be a “double whammy\u200b” for his New York constituency that would hurt craft brewers and farmers alike.\n“This proposed FDA rule would drive up costs for both farmers and brewers with no clear health and safety benefit,”\u200b Schumer said, adding that the rule change could cost brewers $50m/year.\n“I hope you will…revise the proposed rule to uphold strong and meaningful safety standards without placing unnecessary burdens on both brewers and farmers,”\u200b he adds.']"

By that time, she had already given birth to my sister Laura and me. We each had a 25% chance of being born HIV+, but we were extremely fortunate (today, the risk of a mother passing HIV to her baby is 2% or less if she is taking medication). Thanks to advanced medicine and healthcare available here in the U.S., my mom has lived despite her odds.\n\nTo honor the thirty years my mom has been a survivor, our family is raising funds to build health centers worldwide that will stand strong for at least thirty years. We\'re calling it the 30/30 Project.\n\nWe are partnering with Construction for Change, a Seattle-based nonprofit, to carry out construction. And we have local partners on the ground, such as Partners in Health, to run and operate the health facilities long-term. We want to give hope to women and families in other parts of the world who lack access to quality, affordable healthcare.\n\n2014 Grammy Red Carpet: Best and Worst Dressed\n\nWith this amazing past year I\'ve had, I am honored to be the first donor for the 30/30 Project, jumpstarting the construction of the first health center in Malawi. I am asking you to join my family and see how far we can take this...\n\nPHOTOS: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and more big Grammys winners\n\nThe initial goal of the nonprofit is to raise $100,000 in order to build a health care center in Neno District, Malawi, with hopes of later opening clinics in areas such as Kangundo, Kenya; Mbita, Kenya and Ugenya, Kenya.\n\nDonors will receive gifts based on their monetary donation (the signed Macklemore and Ryan Lewis set list is already sold out) and they are encouraged to spread the word via social media.\n\nThe dynamic duo--who won four Grammys, including Best New Artist--made headlines at the 56th Annual Award show during their performance of ""Same Love"" during which Queen Latifah officiated the marriages of 34 couples.\n\nVIDEO: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis on ""Chelsea Lately""\n\nThe New York Times described the featured couples as ""gay, straight, old, young, of many races and many colors.""

Neither of the parents have diabetes.\n\nFifteen pounds is big, but Carisa Rusack, is far from being one of the biggest. A mother birthed a 19-pound baby in Indonesia in 2009 and a Russian baby was born in 2007 weighing a hefty 17 pounds. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the heaviest was a boy weighing 22.5 pounds, born in Aversa, Italy, in September 1955. (All I can say is ouch!)\n\nLast year, all over the world, there were lots of big babies tipping the scales—a 13.5-pound baby girl in Germany; a 13-pound, 11 ounce baby in Spain; and a 15-pound, 7-ounce baby named George King in Britain. At birth George was wearing 6-month-old clothing.\n\nNewborns are usually about 7 pounds and double their weight within 5 or 6 months.\n\nAre babies getting bigger? “Overall, there’s been a 15 percent to 25 percent increase in babies weighing 8 pounds, 13 ounces or more (or 4,000 grams, the weight where a baby is considered oversized) in the past two to three decades in developed countries, according to a February report in the medical journal The Lancet,” ABC News reports.\n\nWhat’s more, a Danish study released in the Journal of Pediatrics in 2002 found that the number of babies weighing over 8.8 pounds at birth increased in Denmark in the 1990s to about 20 percent of newborns from 16 percent. Why the increase? Researchers found the reasons are both good and bad.\n\nGood: In the review of 24,000 deliveries, researchers discovered that declines in smoking, alcohol consumption and caffeine use during pregnancy could be playing a role in the increase.\n\nBad: Big women deliver big babies and obesity is on the rise across the developed world.\n\nNeutral: Women who had two or more previous children and women with higher levels of education were more likely to have big babies. Boys were about twice as likely as girls to be extra large.\n\n“Among the risk factors identified in our study, high maternal pre-pregnancy weight seems to be the most obvious to try to modify,” the study concluded. A 2002 study conducted in Canada, where newborn weights are increasing, found similar results.\n\nIs there anything wrong with a big babe?

At least 40 patients died while waiting, and many of them were on the the secret list.Altogether, up to 1,600 veterans were forced to wait for months, and an official ""sham"" roster showed them seeing doctors on a timely basis, while the secret list showed how long the vets really had been waiting.In Spokane, while Helman was in charge, at least 22 veterans in that VA service areacommitted suicide between July 2007 and July 2008. However, the agency reported there were only nine suicides and 34 attempted suicides.Shortly after the news about the suicide data broke, Helman was transferred to the VA hospital in Hines, Ill., even though she had been in Spokane only two years. After that, she moved on to Phoenix, becoming the VA system director in February 2012.Helman told The Arizona Republic earlier this week that she did not know of any patients that died while waiting for care, and she does not know anything about patient access being manipulated.VA spokeswoman Jean Schaefer told Fox the agency is seeking an independent review about the situation in Arizona.However, Pete Hegseth, chief executive officer for Concerned Veterans for America, pointed out the Phoenix scandal is not the first time Helman has been accused of manipulating patients\' data.""She fudged the number of veterans\' suicides at a previous job — and was never fired.

A former physician with the Phoenix Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care system provided documents and emails showing how local VA leaders covered up lengthy wait times for veterans and in so doing contributed to at least 40 deaths, CNN reported on Wednesday. Meanwhile the American Legion released fiscal 2014's second quarter figures showing how some regional offices of the VA averaged more than 300 days when deciding disability claims for veterans.\n\nFor the past six months, CNN has been reporting on delays in health care appointments veterans endure across the country. The so-called secret list instituted by VA administrators in Phoenix has been found to be particularly heinous. Dr. Sam Foote, a recently retired VA doctor, as well as other sources told the news bureau that anywhere from 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans have been forced to wait months to see their doctors as their conditions worsened and, in the worst cases, died. Foote, who worked for 24 years within the VA system in Phoenix, told CNN that the VA office maintained two lists for patient appointments. The list shared with Washington showed veterans receiving timely appointments; the real list, though, showed true wait times for appointments lasting more than a year.\n\nPrompted by requests from Arizona Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Bernie Sanders has voiced congressional concerns regarding the inspector general investigation, which is currently underway. “We, as a nation, have a commitment to provide timely, quality health care to veterans, and I am determined to assist VA in meeting this responsibility,” Sanders, I-Vermont, told Marine Corp Times.\n\nOutrage has also been expressed by American Legion National Commander Daniel M. Dellinger, who has decided to send a team from his organization’s System Worth Saving Task Force to Phoenix next month to give local veterans a chance to discuss the quality of their VA health care experience. The team is expected to interview administrators, medical staff, and patients.\n\nMeanwhile, the Legion released figures assembled by the VA for fiscal 2014's second quarter that show an increase in the number and quality of fully developed claims (FDCs) being submitted nationwide. Schools conducted twice a year by the Legion have recently focused their training on FDCs. Because they include more up-front documentation than traditional disability claims, FDCs move through the VA adjudication system much more swiftly. While traditional claims can take more than 300 days to be developed and decided, FDCs handled by the Legion take an average of 136 days.\n\nZachary Hearn, the Legion’s deputy director of benefits, said that the worst VA regional offices (VAROs) — Seattle, Wash.; Baltimore, Md.; Reno, Nev.; Detroit, Mich.; and Oakland, Calif. — took, on average, between 226 and 245 days to develop and decide benefits on a fully developed claim or FDC; and between 312 and 335 days to decide on a traditional disability claim. He also noted the best VAROs averaged less than 90 days. These offices are located in White River Junction, Vt.; Milwaukee, Wis.; Manila, Philippines; Fort Harrison, Mont.; and St. Paul, Minn.\n\nRegarding the Phoenix debacle, the inspector general’s office has not yet said when its official review of allegations might be concluded. According to preliminary results of an internal review, VA officials acknowledged that delays in cancer treatment consultations may have played a role in the deaths of 23 veterans and compromised the health of 53 others, Marine Corp Times reported."", 'The plight of American military veterans trying to access their health care benefits has raised temperatures nationwide.\nA former physician with the Phoenix Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care system provided documents and emails showing how local VA leaders covered up lengthy wait times for veterans and in so doing contributed to at least 40 deaths, CNN reported on Wednesday.\nFor the past six months, CNN has been reporting on delays in health care appointments veterans endure across the country.\nFoote, who worked for 24 years within the VA system in Phoenix, told CNN that the VA office maintained two lists for patient appointments.\nBecause they include more up-front documentation than traditional disability claims, FDCs move through the VA adjudication system much more swiftly.']"

How about the director of the VA hospital in Phoenix getting a $9,000 bonus after at least forty military vets died waiting for treatment at her facility… a horror kept secret by deleting their names out of the hospital database?\n\nNews of the bonus comes from the Washington Free Beacon: “Last year, Sharon Helman, the director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System, got a $9,345 bonus, in addition to her annual base salary of $169,900. Overall, leadership at the hospital was paid more than $700,000 in taxpayer money, according to publicly available salary data.”\n\nNews of the secret waiting list for treatment comes from CNN:\n\nAt least 40 U.S. veterans died waiting for appointments at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system, many of whom were placed on a secret waiting list. The secret list was part of an elaborate scheme designed by Veterans Affairs managers in Phoenix who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources. […] Dr. Sam Foote just retired after spending 24 years with the VA system in Phoenix. The veteran doctor told CNN in an exclusive interview that the Phoenix VA works off two lists for patient appointments: There’s an “official” list that’s shared with officials in Washington and shows the VA has been providing timely appointments, which Foote calls a sham list. And then there’s the real list that’s hidden from outsiders, where wait times can last more than a year. “The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VA’s own internal rules,” said Foote in Phoenix. “They developed the secret waiting list,” said Foote, a respected local physician. The VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days, Foote said. According to Foote, the elaborate scheme in Phoenix involved shredding evidence to hide the long list of veterans waiting for appointments and care. Officials at the VA, Foote says, instructed their staff to not actually make doctor’s appointments for veterans within the computer system. Instead, Foote says, when a veteran comes in seeking an appointment, “they enter information into the computer and do a screen capture hard copy printout. They then do not save what was put into the computer so there’s no record that you were ever here,” he said.\n\nFoote, whose account was confirmed from multiple sources by CNN, says everyone at the Phoneix VA was upset by this little scheme… but they all went along with it.\n\n“I feel very sorry for the people who work at the Phoenix VA,” said Foote. “They’re all frustrated. They’re all upset. They all wish they could leave ’cause they know what they’re doing is wrong. “But they have families, they have mortgages and if they speak out or say anything to anybody about it, they will be fired and they know that.”\n\nUntil now, administrations at the Phoneix medical center have “flat-out denied” that the waiting lists were tampered with. Congress is ramping up investigations. CNN reports that the undersecretary of health for the VA told House Committee on Veterans Affairs chairman Rep. Jeff Miller (R-FL) that he was unaware of the secret waiting list in Phoneix, while Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) is calling for emergency hearings, and Senator John McCain (R-AZ) fired off a letter to Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki demanding answers. American Legion National Commander Daniel H. Dellinger called the secret waiting list “one of the most abhorrent acts ever committed in VA history.”\n\nBy all means, let’s trust bureaucrats implicitly, reward them with huge bonuses, and give them even more control over our lives. I’m sure there’s absolutely no chance this sort of thing will happen when the unelected, unaccountable IPAB “death panels” of ObamaCare start rationing out health care.', '[…] Dr. Sam Foote just retired after spending 24 years with the VA system in Phoenix.\n“They developed the secret waiting list,” said Foote, a respected local physician.\nThe VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days, Foote said.\nOfficials at the VA, Foote says, instructed their staff to not actually make doctor’s appointments for veterans within the computer system.\n“I feel very sorry for the people who work at the Phoenix VA,” said Foote.']"

CNN also interviewed an ex-VA doctor and the family of a dead Navy vet who languished on the list while awaiting treatment for stage 4 bladder cancer:\n\nThe secret list was part of an elaborate scheme designed by Veterans Affairs managers in Phoenix who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources.\n\nVA rules generally require that vets be taken into care within two to four weeks of their first contact with the department. But Dr. Sam Foote, a 24-year veteran of Phoenix\'s VA system, says there was an easy way to get around that requirement and stick vets with longer wait times:\n\nThere\'s an ""official"" list that\'s shared with officials in Washington and shows the VA has been providing timely appointments, which Foote calls a sham list.

Two months later, he was dead of bladder cancer, never having gotten his appointment to se the specialist.

Instead, doctors were told to screenshot appointment information on the computer, print out the screenshot and erase the data, removing any electronic record of a scheduled visit. The hospital placed the printout information on the ""secret"" electronic list and destroyed the hard copy, he told the news outlet.\n\n""So the only record that you have ever been there requesting care was on that secret list,"" Foote said to CNN. ""And they wouldn\'t take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times, when in fact they were not.""\n\nJuly 2013 emails obtained by CNN show hospital management, including Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman, knew of the problem.\n\nThe VA hospital conducted internal reviews since the allegations surfaced, and the Office of the Inspector General\'s office also conducted a review, VA spokesman Scott McRoberts wrote in an email statement to CNN. ""We acknowledge Phoenix VA Health Care System has had longstanding issues with Veterans accessing care and have taken numerous actions to meet demand, while we continue to serve more Veterans and enhance our services. To ensure new Veterans waiting for appointments are managed appropriately, we maintain an Electronic Wait List (EWL) in accordance with the national VHA Scheduling Directive,"" the statement read.\n\nThe allegations come after months of reports from across the country regarding VA patients who died as a result of delayed care and long waits for treatment. A previous CNN investigation revealed at least six veterans at Williams Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, S.C., waited months for routine gastrointestinal procedures, such as colonoscopies or endoscopies, and died of cancer before clinicians could detect it, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nA Government Accountability Office inspection report on four unnamed VA hospitals released in December showed the facilities do not have adequate protection from doctors with a history of subpar treatment, according to a previous FierceHealthcare report. None of the four fully complied with all required procedures for peer review of patient care, which led to adverse outcomes, and failed to pursue several cases that potentially required disciplinary action.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here\'s CNN\'s report\n\n- read the VA\'s statement', 'The hospital placed the printout information on the ""secret"" electronic list and destroyed the hard copy, he told the news outlet.\n""So the only record that you have ever been there requesting care was on that secret list,"" Foote said to CNN.\nJuly 2013 emails obtained by CNN show hospital management, including Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman, knew of the problem.\nTo ensure new Veterans waiting for appointments are managed appropriately, we maintain an Electronic Wait List (EWL) in accordance with the national VHA Scheduling Directive,"" the statement read.\nNone of the four fully complied with all required procedures for peer review of patient care, which led to adverse outcomes, and failed to pursue several cases that potentially required disciplinary action.']"

Dr. Sam Foote just retired after spending 24 years with the VA system in Phoenix. The veteran doctor told CNN in an exclusive interview that the Phoenix VA works off two lists for patient appointments: There\'s an ""official"" list that\'s shared with officials in Washington and shows the VA has been providing timely appointments, which Foote calls a sham list. And then there\'s the real list that\'s hidden from outsiders, where wait times can last more than a year. ""The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VA\'s own internal rules,"" said Foote in Phoenix. ""They developed the secret waiting list,"" said Foote, a respected local physician. The VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days, Foote said. ...Foote estimates right now the number of veterans waiting on the ""secret list"" to see a primary care physician is somewhere between 1,400 and 1,600.\n\nCornyn called the reports ""both heartbreaking and infuriating.""\n\n""Congress should conduct emergency hearings to get the information necessary to fully root out these problems and President Obama should immediately designate an official responsible for implementing rapid changes.

This raises concern that officials have been misusing the Electronic Waiting List system employed by all VA Health Centers and keeping a non-official list outside of standard VA procedures,"" McCain and Flake wrote to the Senate committee.\n\n""In fact, it has been suggested that PVAHCS staff may have used this non-official electronic list to queue veterans until an appointment became available within their 24-25 days waiting period, at which point veterans were transferred to the official waiting list despite the fact that the appointment request was made much earlier. One major consequence of the supposed two-list system is that veterans’ actual wait times could have been significantly longer than what is reported by Phoenix VA officials.""\n\nThey added that ""regardless of whether these deaths were caused by mismanagement by PVAHCS officials or intentional manipulation, the allegations appear indicative of broader trends that we have observed regarding the VA’s apparent failure to provide quality healthcare to our veterans.""\n\n""As you undoubtedly appreciate, VA must use its resources to address veterans’ concerns in an effective, efficient, and timely manner. American veterans deserve to have an agency that respects their sacrifice to this country by putting their needs first.""\n\nMcCain sent another letter to Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki asking for numerous answers to questions about the report.

162390,http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_25635115/fda-eases-into-e-cigarette-oversight,health,"['WASHINGTON — The federal government’s move to regulate e-cigarettes is a leap into the unknown.\n\nMost everyone agrees a ban on selling them to kids would be a step forward. But health and public policy experts can’t say for certain whether the electronic devices are a good thing or a bad thing overall, whether they help smokers kick the habit or are a gateway to ordinary paper-and-tobacco cigarettes.\n\nThe proposed rules, issued Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration, tread fairly lightly. They would ban sales to anyone under 18, add warning labels and require FDA approval for new products.\n\nSome public health experts say a measured approach is the right one. They think that the devices, which heat a nicotine solution to produce an odorless vapor without the smoke and tar of burning tobacco, can help smokers quit.\n\n“This could be the single biggest opportunity that’s come along in a century to make the cigarette obsolete,” said David Abrams, executive director of the Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies at the American Legacy Foundation.\n\nStill, some wonder whether e-cigarettes keep smokers addicted or hook new users and encourage them to move on to tobacco. And some warn that the FDA regulations could have unintended consequences.\n\n“If the regulations are too heavy-handed, they’ll have the deadly effect of preventing smokers from quitting by switching to these dramatically less harmful alternatives,” said Jeff Stier, senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank in Washington.\n\nScientists haven’t finished much research on e-cigarettes, and the studies that have been done have been inconclusive. The government is pouring millions into research to supplement independent and company studies on the health risks of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products — as well as who uses them and why.\n\n“There are far more questions than answers,” acknowledged Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.\n\nBut he said the proposed rules “would result in significant public health benefits, including through reducing sales to youth, helping to correct consumer misperceptions, preventing misleading health claims and preventing new products from entering the market without scientific review by FDA.”\n\nThe FDA has left the door open to further regulations, such as a ban on TV advertising and fruit- or candy-flavored e-cigarettes — measures that some anti-smoking groups and members of Congress are demanding.\n\n“It is inexcusable that it has taken the FDA and the administration so long to act. This delay has had serious public health consequences as these unregulated tobacco products have been marketed using tactics and sweet flavors that appeal to kids,” the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said in a statement.\n\nThe FDA said it wants more evidence before it rushes into more regulations.\n\nAny further rules “will have to be grounded in our growing body of knowledge and understanding about the use of e-cigarettes and their potential health risks or public health benefits,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said.\n\nElectronic cigarettes are becoming a big business. The industry started on the Internet and at shopping-mall kiosks and has rocketed from thousands of users in 2006 to several million worldwide, with a choice of more than 200 brands.\n\nSales are estimated to have reached nearly $2 billion in 2013. Tobacco companies have noticed that e-smokes are eating into cigarette sales, and they have jumped into the business, too.\n\nSmokers like e-cigarettes because the nicotine-infused vapor looks like smoke but doesn’t contain the thousands of chemicals, tar or odor of regular cigarettes. Some smokers use e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking tobacco, or to cut down.\n\n“If the product as I use it now becomes illegal, I’m not sure what’ll happen. I’ll probably end up smoking again,” said 38-year-old Jason Todrick of Huntington Beach, Calif., who kicked his more than 20-year smoking habit two years ago using an e-cigarette.\n\nIn addition to mandating warning labels that say nicotine is an addictive chemical, the rules would require e-cigarette makers to disclose their products’ ingredients. They would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products.\n\nIn addition, they couldn’t give out free samples or sell e-cigarettes in vending machines unless they are in a place open only to adults, such as a bar.\n\nThe public and the industry will have 75 days to comment on the proposed rules. There is no timetable for when the FDA will issue its final rules. Many believe the process will wind up in court.\n\n“It seems to be a responsible approach … and shows the FDA’s commitment to look at particular e-cigarettes in a science-based way rather than just conjecture,” said Jason Healy, president of Blu e-cigs, which is owned by the tobacco company Lorillard Inc. and is the largest player in the market. Blu accounts for almost half of e-cigarettes sold.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the FDA proposed extending its authority to regulate cigars, hookahs, nicotine gels and pipe tobacco.\n\n——\n\nAP Business Writer Matthew Perrone contributed to this report.\n\n——\n\nMichael Felberbaum can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/MLFelberbaum.\n\nAP-WF-04-24-14 1938GMT', 'The proposed rules, issued Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration, tread fairly lightly.\nSome public health experts say a measured approach is the right one.\n“There are far more questions than answers,” acknowledged Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.\nThey would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products.\nAlso on Thursday, the FDA proposed extending its authority to regulate cigars, hookahs, nicotine gels and pipe tobacco.']"

The multibillion dollar e-cigarette industry has been expanding rapidly without oversight and amidst growing concerns about the health and safety of the products. The regulations, which require products to be registered with the FDA, ban sales to minors, restrict vending machine sales, eliminate provision of free samples, and introduce warning labels and content disclosures, are important but represent only a first step in protecting the public\'s health.\n\n\n\nDr. Neil Schluger, Chief Scientific Officer, World Lung Foundation, commented: ""The FDA has finally taken a few steps to reign in an industry that is creating a generation of nicotine addicts. It has been alarming to see the massive uptake of e-cigarettes, particularly among non-smokers and youth.\n\n\n\n""We particularly welcome restrictions on sales to minors and clear labeling of product contents. At minimum, kids should not be inhaling addictive chemicals and adults should know which and how much addictive chemicals they are inhaling. Guidelines must be developed to ensure this information is delivered clearly and effectively.\n\n\n\n""It is a mistake for the FDA to stop here, though. It should introduce restrictions on e-cigarette advertising, especially to minors, ban Internet sales and also restrict the use of flavorings that are attractive to children. In addition, child-safe packaging and guidelines for safe use should also be implemented in light of alarming reports of ingested liquid poisoning and product malfunctions.\n\n\n\n""We don\'t know whether long term e-cigarette use will harm consumers, but a recent study indicated that e-cigarette vapor causes changes at the cellular level in a similar way as traditional cigarettes. That there may be hidden harms in e-cigarette vapor combined with what we do know about nicotine are reasons enough to regulate a market of highly addictive products.\n\n\n\n""Until now, e-cigarette companies have happily lived in a gray area where they can market and sell their products as safe alternatives to tobacco without proving they are actually safe. Bringing the industry out of the shadows is not, however the same as bringing it into the light. The FDA should assert its authority to ensure public health is protected before business interests.""\n\n\n\nRisks associated with nicotine and e-cigarettes\n\nResearchers find that many e-cigarettes contain toxins, contaminants and carcinogens that conflict with the industry\'s portrayal of its products as purer, healthier alternatives. They also find considerable variations in the amount of nicotine delivered by different brands. None of this information is made available to consumers so they really don\'t know what they are ingesting, or how much.\n\n\n\nNicotine – a highly addictive drug - can have powerful negative effects on the cardiovascular system, including causing high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms. In women, nicotine reduces estrogen levels and has been linked to early menopause. Prenatal exposure has been linked in epidemiological studies to obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure in children. To date, there has been little research on the emission of fine and ultrafine inhalable liquid particles, nicotine and cancer-causing substances into indoor air, so we cannot exclude the risk of adverse health effects generated by second-hand exposure to e-cigarettes.\n\n\n\nA CDC study showed that e-cigarette experimentation and recent use doubled among US middle and high school students during 2011–2012, resulting in an estimated 1.78 million students having ever used e-cigarettes as of 2012. Public health experts are concerned that slick product design and fruity flavors is driving the uptake of e-cigarettes and related devices among young people and non-smokers. The increase in young vapers is particularly concerning; in addition to the above health risks, there is higher potential for negative impact of nicotine on adolescent brain development, as well as the risk for life-long nicotine addiction.\n\n\n\nEvidence of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid is contradictory at best. A study in the American Journal of Public Health showed that those who incorporated e-cigarettes into a quit-smoking attempt were less likely to succeed after six months. In fact, unrestricted e-cigarettes on the market may end up preventing persons from seeking proven methods of quitting – including cold turkey. Public health experts also are concerned that e-cigarettes will undo decades of progress in public health by re-normalizing smoking in public and act as a gateway to cigarette use among youth.\n\n\n\nAbout World Lung Foundation\n\n\n\nWorld Lung Foundation (WLF) was established in response to the global epidemic of lung disease, which kills 10 million people each year. The organization also works on maternal and infant mortality reduction initiatives. WLF improves global health by improving local health capacity, by supporting operational research, by developing public policy and by delivering public education.

The proposals will mean that minors under the age of 18 will not be able to purchase them.\n\nThe e-cigarette industry has come under major scrutiny in recent months after concerns have been raised regarding the health implications of the devices.\n\nTraditionally marketed as smoking cessation aids, studies have suggested that e-cigarettes may actually encourage conventional cigarette smoking, particularly in adolescents who are prime users of the devices.\n\nA study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals that e-cigarette use more than doubled among middle and high school students between 2011 and 2012, from 4.7% to 10%.\n\nIn addition, research has indicated that the vapors produced by e-cigarettes may cause damage to the lungs - an effect commonly associated with traditional cigarettes. A more recent study from the CDC reveals that the number of e-cigarette-related calls to US poison centers have soared.\n\nSuch concerns have led to calls for the devices to be regulated - a topic that was discussed in a recent spotlight feature from Medical News Today. Now, it seems that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have listened to these calls.\n\nProposed age and marketing restrictions\n\nAt present, only e-cigarettes that are marketed for therapeutic purposes are regulated by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), while the FDA Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) regulates conventional cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco.\n\nShare on Pinterest Under the new proposal, youths under the age of 18 will be banned from buying e-cigarettes.\n\nNow, the FDA plan to extend such regulations to include e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, waterpipe/hookah tobacco and dissolvables that are not already regulated.\n\nThe new proposition would mean that minimum age and identification restrictions would be applied to the purchase of these products - an individual will need to be aged 18 or over to buy them.\n\nThe products will also be required to include health warnings, and a prohibition will be placed on vending machine sales unless the machine is in a facility that does not admit persons under the age of 18.\n\nThe manufacturers of these newly deemed tobacco products will not be banned from marketing them, but they will be required to:\n\nRegister with the FDA and disclose product and ingredient listings of their products\n\nOnly market their products after they have been reviewed by the FDA\n\nOnly make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA confirms there is sufficient scientific evidence to support them and that marketing the product with benefit overall public health, and\n\nNot distribute free samples of their products.\n\nCommenting on the new proposal, FDA commissioner Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg says:\n\n""Tobacco remains the leading cause of death and disease in this country. This is an important moment for consumer protection and a significant proposal that if finalized as written would bring FDA oversight to many new tobacco products. Science-based product regulation is a powerful form of consumer protection that can help reduce the public health burden of tobacco use on the American public, including youth.""\n\nMitch Zeller, director of the CTP at the FDA, notes that tobacco-related disease and death is one of the most ""critical"" public health challenges that the FDA face.\n\n""The proposed rule would give the FDA additional tools to protect the public health in today\'s rapidly evolving tobacco marketplace, including the review of new tobacco products and their health-related claims,"" he adds.\n\nThe FDA are taking public comments for the proposed rule for 75 days. In particular, they are looking for comments as to whether all cigars should be subject to regulation, and views as to how products that do not involve burning of tobacco - such as e-cigarettes - should be regulated.\n\nBut in a statement from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), chief executive Dr. Margaret Foti says it is ""imperative"" that the FDA regulate all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes and cigars.\n\n""We do not know the nature of the long-term health consequences of these devices or what effect they will have on smoking continuation or uptake by adults and youth,"" adds chair of the AACR Tobacco and Cancer Subcommittee, Dr. Roy S.

""It could have been a lot worse.""\n\nE-cigarettes heat a nicotine solution into a wispy cloud of smokeless vapor. Supporters argue they are cleaner, cheaper and safer than the cancer-causing tar and chemicals of tobacco, the country\'s leading preventable cause of death.\n\nThe nicotine-misting machines range from cheap ""cig-a-likes"" with light-up tips to pricier, more complex ""mods,"" which users can upgrade with bigger batteries, refillable e-liquid tanks and electric control displays.\n\nUnder the proposed FDA rules, e-cig buyers would be required to show photo IDs to prove their age, though public health experts pointed to Internet sales as a potential loophole. Free samples and sales in vending machines accessible by minors would also be banned.\n\nThe proposed rules come just as Florida lawmakers pass their own bans on e-cig sales to young people, which would take effect July 1. The number of American middle and high school students who tried e-cigarettes doubled from 2011 to 2012, while cigarette smoking among that age range slowed, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show.\n\nThe FDA will take public comment for 75 days before making final changes and could propose further rules as research grows. The rules would also cover cigars, hookahs and pipe tobacco, which like e-cigs have gone for years without regulation.\n\nDisclosing the chemicals mixed alongside water and nicotine in e-liquids, manufacturers said, would help set standards for a fledgling industry where some still depend on barrels of chemicals from China and overseas. Fred Jeffery, the owner of Blue Lab Vapors, a Largo e-liquid maker, said, ""We have nothing to hide, including our ingredients.""\n\nMakers will still be allowed to sell existing types of e-cigs while awaiting FDA approval. But some worried the FDA requirements would slow their ability to bring new technology to the market. Dimitris Agrafiotis, a board member of VISTA Truth, a Florida-based e-cig advocacy group, said that would ""throw this industry back to the stone age.""\n\nThe change could also squeeze Tampa Bay\'s smaller e-cig businesses, which have less money to spend on costly data-gathering and regulatory applications. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog said the change would benefit ""entrenched players,"" like Big Tobacco giants now piloting their own e-cig lines.\n\nMany former smokers credit e-cigs with helping them quit America\'s $100 billion tobacco industry for good. But public health officials worry e-cigs\' explosive growth could addict a new generation to nicotine.\n\nBecause e-cigs have been popular for less than a decade, research into their health effects has a way to go. Experts say we still don\'t know the long-term effects of sipping nicotine vapor, whether e-cigs truly help smokers quit, or whether kids who try them are more likely to try cigarettes.\n\nUniversity of South Florida marketing department chair Anand Kumar, part of a team researching the branding of e-cigarettes, said that worries of e-cig users moving to real cigarettes have become a key concern as regulation and research continues.\n\n""There are people out there who fought the tobacco industry for so long,"" Kumar said, ""that the last thing they want is to see new people coming in.""\n\nDrew Harwell can be reached at dharwell@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8252.', 'Under the proposed FDA rules, e-cig buyers would be required to show photo IDs to prove their age, though public health experts pointed to Internet sales as a potential loophole.\nThe proposed rules come just as Florida lawmakers pass their own bans on e-cig sales to young people, which would take effect July 1.\nThe FDA will take public comment for 75 days before making final changes and could propose further rules as research grows.\nMany former smokers credit e-cigs with helping them quit America\'s $100 billion tobacco industry for good.\n""There are people out there who fought the tobacco industry for so long,"" Kumar said, ""that the last thing they want is to see new people coming in.""']"

Tobacco companies have noticed that e-smokes are eating into cigarette sales, and they have jumped into the business, too.\n\nSmokers like e-cigarettes because the nicotine-infused vapor looks like smoke but doesn\'t contain the thousands of chemicals, tar or odor of regular cigarettes. Some smokers use e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking tobacco, or to cut down.\n\n""If the product as I use it now becomes illegal, I\'m not sure what\'ll happen. I\'ll probably end up smoking again,"" said 38-year-old Jason Todrick of Huntington Beach, Calif., who kicked his more than 20-year smoking habit two years ago using an e-cigarette.\n\nIn addition to mandating warning labels that say nicotine is an addictive chemical, the rules would require e-cigarette makers to disclose their products\' ingredients. They would not be allowed to claim their products are safer than other tobacco products.\n\nIn addition, they couldn\'t give out free samples or sell e-cigarettes in vending machines unless they are in a place open only to adults, such as a bar.\n\nThe public and the industry will have 75 days to comment on the proposed rules.

All sides say the FDA figures to bring some order to a world that has largely been unregulated.\n\nQ. What changes today?\n\nA. Nothing. The FDA’s proposal isn’t going to take effect for another two years. But when it does, new and existing e-cig products will require FDA approval. This includes the devices and the liquids, which are usually (but not always) nicotine laced. A ban of e-cig sales to those under 18 is already observed in California. And the marketing of e-cigs on TV and other media will still be allowed.\n\nQ. Will regulation help us learn the health effects of e-cigs?\n\nA. The consensus is that using e-cigs is healthier than smoking a traditional cigarette, with its thousands of toxic compounds. But how much healthier, if at all, is a question that will be easier to answer with FDA regulation than without it.\n\nRight now, there’s little hard science on the use of e-cigs. There’s also not much known about the long-term effects of inhaling the other ingredients in “e-liquid,” which includes flavoring, water and propylene glycol, a chemical that helps nicotine vaporize inside the device.\n\nQ. How could the public be helped by FDA rules?\n\nA. Right now, in some states, e-cig makers operate without any government oversight. There’s no uniformity in processes to make the liquids, and although makers generally offer a limited set of concentrations (from 0 mg to 24 mg nicotine in a vial), higher dosages are available on the Internet. Some makers use child-resistant caps for liquid nicotine; others don’t, raising the specter of children getting hold of and ingesting pure nicotine, which can be toxic.\n\nIf warning labels, registration requirements for products, regular inspections and other restrictions are implemented (all details to be ironed out by the FDA in the coming months and years), the public would have a much better understanding of what’s in these products, and how they’re made.\n\nQ. Does this spell the end of the small e-cig industry?\n\nA. No. There are already a few hundred e-cig and vape shops in Orange County and there figured to be a shakeout with or without FDA regulation. If costs rise, or if e-cig products are taxed like traditional tobacco products, customers could go away.\n\nStill, some companies believe standards might weed out businesses taking advantage of lax regulations.\n\n“It’s not a big deal,” said Andy Donahue, director of sales and marketing for Mod, a Costa Mesa-based e-cigarette maker. “At the beginning, we looked at the whole industry and the possibility of what regulations may happen, and we stayed above the line on everything.”\n\nQ. Where is Big Tobacco in this?\n\nA. Everywhere. In fact, the major tobacco companies have all jumped into the e-cig market with their own products, or acquired smaller e-cig companies, and are vocal about policing the industry.\n\nQ. Is there much money at stake?\n\nA. Right now, about four years into the trend, the market for e-cigarettes is estimated at $2.2 billion. That’s a fraction of the actual tobacco industry, which rakes in $100 billion annually.\n\nQ. Will regulation make it more or less likely that e-cigs will be seen as a way to help people quit smoking?\n\nA. Proponents of e-cigs, many of them former chain smokers, say the product does work as a way to get off cigarettes. But there isn’t much science yet on the topic. A small study published last month out of UC San Francisco showed that 88 smokers who also used e-cigs weren’t more likely to quit after a year. Producers can’t legally say e-cigs are safer than regular cigarettes, nor can they officially promote them as smoking-cessation tools. It’s unclear how FDA regulation might change those rules.\n\nQ. What did the FDA do about marketing of e-cigs?\n\nA. Nothing, for now. But that could change when the FDA finalizes its guidelines. E-cigs might no longer be available on the Internet, warning labels could be added, and sellers could be restricted in where they can advertise, and what they can say in those ads. David S. Timberlake, an assistant professor of public health and epidemiology at UC Irvine who’s an expert in tobacco-control policies, says marketing of e-cigs remains “the big question” is of the FDA’s announcement.\n\nQ. I’ve seen flavors on e-liquid vials like Strawberry Shortcake and Cinnabon. Aren’t those blatant attempts to appeal to minors?\n\nA. The industry says no, but statistics suggest otherwise. A federal study found 10 percent of high school students tried e-cig products in 2012, up from 4.7 percent in 2011. But the FDA completely sidestepped this issue, declining to limit certain flavors, logos, names or designs that might be enticing to adolescents.\n\nThat doesn’t mean the subject won’t come up in the final rules, though.\n\nContact the writer: lhall@ocregister.com or jwang@ocregister.com', 'But when it does, new and existing e-cig products will require FDA approval.\nBut how much healthier, if at all, is a question that will be easier to answer with FDA regulation than without it.\nRight now, in some states, e-cig makers operate without any government oversight.\nIf costs rise, or if e-cig products are taxed like traditional tobacco products, customers could go away.\nIt’s unclear how FDA regulation might change those rules.']"

But health and public policy experts can’t say for certain whether the electronic devices are a good thing or a bad thing overall, whether they help smokers kick the habit or are a gateway to ordinary paper-and-tobacco cigarettes.\n\nE-CIGARETTE FACTS The Associated Press\n\nPipes are displayed at the Avail Vapor shop in Richmond, Va. The industry is facing regulation. THE BATTERY-POWERED devices made of plastic or metal heat a liquid nicotine solution, creating vapor that users inhale. Some models are disposable, and some are designed to be refilled with cartridges or tanks containing what enthusiasts call “e-juice.” Some e-cigarettes are made to look like a real cigarette with a tiny light on the tip that glows like the real thing. THE INGREDIENTS used in most e-cigarettes include nicotine, water, glycerol, propylene glycol and flavorings. Propylene glycol is a thick fluid sometimes used in antifreeze but also used as a food ingredient. While some e-cigarette makers are limiting offerings to tobacco and menthol flavors, others are selling candy-like flavors like cherry and strawberry. USERS SAY E-CIGARETTES address both the addictive and behavioral aspects of smoking. Smokers get their nicotine without the thousands of chemicals found in regular cigarettes. And they get to hold something shaped like a cigarette, while puffing and exhaling something that looks like smoke without the ash, odor and tar.

The FDA wants to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, and wants the devices to come with a warning label, saying there\'s a potential for addiction to nicotine. That\'s a regulation Utah Vapers doesn\'t entirely agree with.\n\n""The product has not been studied up the point of its addictive properties at this stage,"" says Aaron Frazier of Utah Vapers--which is a Salt Lake City based company that calls itself a consumer advocacy group with a focus on tobacco harm reduction through the use of electronic cigarettes.\n\nFrazier said he\'s happy the FDA is finally regulating an unregulated industry, but he\'s also protective over the criticism of e-cigs.\n\n""Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances on the planet.

There would also be a warning label about nicotine addiction, in addition to companies registering their products with the FDA to get approval.\n\nBut, for some health professionals, the big focus is on the younger generations. What you won’t find on the agency’s list of regulations are flavored products and advertisement.\n\nTwo things Dr. Glenn Vanotteren, a pulmonary critical care physician with Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids said, are aimed at kids.\n\n“One could argue that such a powerful drug, in a way that you could buy over the counter, is an invitation for a young person to get addicted to this drug and can lead to years of abuse that could be even accelerated beyond nicotine,” Vanotteren said.\n\nFor 20 years, Dr. Vanotteren has specialized in caring for cancer patients. During that time, he said he’s recommended products like e-cigarettes to help ween smokers off tobacco.\n\n“There are benefits….I’ve certainly had patients myself who’ve been able to successfully quit using the e-cigarette where they’ve had no successes with other products…so that’s great to see,” Dr. Vanotteren said.\n\nStill, it’s a device Dr. Vanotteren said should be used on a limited basis.\n\n“This can contain nicotine and it’s a very toxic drug,” he said. “It can be absorbed through the skin and you can overdose on it simply with an accidental spill.”\n\nRegulation for e-cigarettes has been talked about for years. In 2009, the FDA worked towards classifying them as “medical devices” to restrict sales. But, a federal court struck that down the following year.\n\nThat’s when the FDA switched gears, saying it could issue rules based on the authority the administration has from Congress to regulate tobacco products.\n\nEven though Dr. Vanotteren said the FDA is taking appropriate measures in making an effort to put some regulations on the product, he said there’s more that should be done about how e-cigarettes are portrayed.\n\n“When you look at how it’s marketed, it’s very appealing to young people, very colorful, they add flavors,” Dr. Vanotteren said. “There’s no question the industry has looked at this and they’re targeting, although they will say they aren’t, the younger population.”\n\nThe proposal has a 75 day comment period where the public and the industry will get to weigh in on the rules.', 'There would also be a warning label about nicotine addiction, in addition to companies registering their products with the FDA to get approval.\nFor 20 years, Dr. Vanotteren has specialized in caring for cancer patients.\n“There are benefits….I’ve certainly had patients myself who’ve been able to successfully quit using the e-cigarette where they’ve had no successes with other products…so that’s great to see,” Dr. Vanotteren said.\nStill, it’s a device Dr. Vanotteren said should be used on a limited basis.\n“When you look at how it’s marketed, it’s very appealing to young people, very colorful, they add flavors,” Dr. Vanotteren said.']"

E-cigarettes are the rechargeable devices that allow you to inhale nicotine in a propylene glycol vapor, which can be blown out with the look and feel of real smoke. Companies market them as a safer alternative to smoking, while their advocates say they can help people quit. The sales pitch seems to be working. From 2008 to 2012, sales jumped from 50,000 units to 5 million.\n\nThe new FDA regulations would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors and regulate how much nicotine the devices can contain. Analysts warned that restrictions could slow the industry’s growth, retarding innovation. But the announcement drew some expressions of relief from manufacturers, which feared more aggressive restrictions. “I like the overall tone,” Jason Healey, president of blue e-Cigs, told USA Today. Miguel Martin, president of LOGIC, the second-largest seller, said “I’m encouraged by it.”\n\nAnti-tobacco activists seemed a bit more anxious. Under the proposed regulations, e-cigarette companies could continue offering flavored versions, advertising the products on television, and selling them online. “It’s very disappointing,” said Stanton Glantz, a professor at the Center of Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. E-cigarettes raise real some safety concerns: Nicotine itself can be highly toxic in large doses and, already, several thousand poisonings from e-cig refills have been reported. But the big worry for public health advocates, including the major medical societies, is what e-cigarettes would mean for the use of regular cigarettes and other forms of smoking.\n\nRather than help people to quit, public health advocates fear, e-cigarettes might encourage more people to start.', 'Companies market them as a safer alternative to smoking, while their advocates say they can help people quit.\nThe new FDA regulations would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors and regulate how much nicotine the devices can contain.\nE-cigarettes raise real some safety concerns: Nicotine itself can be highly toxic in large doses and, already, several thousand poisonings from e-cig refills have been reported.\nBut the big worry for public health advocates, including the major medical societies, is what e-cigarettes would mean for the use of regular cigarettes and other forms of smoking.\nRather than help people to quit, public health advocates fear, e-cigarettes might encourage more people to start.']"

""We will have the authority as a science-based regulatory agency to take critical actions to promote and protect the health of the public.""\n\nE-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah tobacco and other tobacco products would join traditional cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco under the FDA’s regulatory purview, granted to it by the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, commonly referred to as the Tobacco Control Act, according to the proposed rule.\n\nThe main restrictions proposed by the FDA include banning the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, prohibiting the distribution of free samples and banning the use of vending machines to sell e-cigarettes (unless the vending machine is in a location that never allows minors), NPR reports. E-cigarettes would also be required to carry warnings that they contain nicotine, that nicotine is addictive and disclose the ingredients in the product.\n\nE-cigarettes are a battery-powered devices that heat liquid nicotine, but emit only a steam-like vapor instead of smoke. They can look like cigarettes, pens or pipes. Their sales make up about 2 percent of the overall tobacco industry, but they are a fast-growing, $2 billion niche.\n\nE-cigarette makers say that their products are harmless, and most scientists believe it is the filler products in cigarettes - not the nicotine itself - that causes cancer, CNN reports.\n\nBut the lack of carcinogens like arsenic, benzene or formaldehyde does not mean that e-cigarettes are safer, the FDA contends. “Right now, for something like e-cigarettes, there are far more questions than answers,” Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, told the Washington Post. “We’re calling this the first step... For the first time, there will be a science-based, independent regulatory agency playing a vital gate-keeping function.”\n\nPublic health officials and industry insiders were mixed in their reactions.\n\nMatthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, told the Washington Post the proposed rule does not go far enough.

162457,http://nypost.com/2014/04/24/the-deadly-war-on-e-cigarettes/,health,"['Cigarettes continue to kill a half-million Americans every year while holding 100-fold that number in addiction’s deadly grasp. Yet a perverse crusade has spread like a contagion across the nation — to ban or restrict access to electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), which have harmed no one and allowed many to quit smoking.\n\nNow that anti-science fervor has spread to the state Legislature, where three separate bills would combine to condemn desperate addicted smokers to lingering death.\n\nIt’s a bizarre “through the looking glass” situation — banning e-cigs even as cigarettes, the most lethal nicotine-delivery system, are marketed as they’ve been for decades.\n\nShortly after the Food and Drug Administration got authority over tobacco products in 2009, the agency decided that e-cigs were in fact unapproved cessation medication and moved to ban them, going so far as to intercept imports from China. Legal action by several e-cig marketers resulted in a slapdown from a federal judge, who agreed with the companies that e-cigs were not medicinals and forbade the FDA from barring their entry.\n\nSince then, official statements from all the federal “public health” agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control, have uniformly warned desperate smokers not to even try e-cigs to help them quit.\n\nThe FDA just announced rules that, while overly restrictive (e.g., they don’t let companies state the clear truth that e-cigs are much safer than regular cigarettes), won’t go far enough for the zealots. So you can expect a continued push in the Legislature for a total or partial ban — despite the facts.\n\nMost smokers want to quit, and over half try each year. They mostly fail, however: The FDA-approved cessation aids “succeed” about once in 10 tries, barely better than quitting cold turkey.\n\nMillions of ex-smokers have figured this out, despite the official warnings: E-cig sales are skyrocketing while cigarettes are in historic declines. These ex-smokers have become “vapers”: instead of smoking, they are “vaping” e-cigs.\n\nWhy do e-cigs help smokers quit when the patches, gums and drugs fail? A combination of factors: The nicotine dose is sufficient to satisfy that powerful craving, and use of the e-cig reflects the rituals of smoking — the hand-to-mouth motions, the glowing LED tip and the inhaled and exhaled plume or mist. Many also prefer flavored vapes.\n\nNone of these factors are to be found in the approved products, which are (by the way) much more expensive than e-cigs.\n\nAnother attraction for smokers is the relatively low cost of e-cigs, compared to cigarettes (and compared to the nicotine patches so beloved of the FDA and other federal agencies).\n\nBut one New York bill would institute an exorbitant tax on e-cigs, which have previously not been targeted with tobacco-like excise taxes. The tax would actually make e-cigs as expensive as the real, deadly cigarettes. This seems like the opposite of a public-health measure to me.\n\nMoreover, their anticipated revenue windfall will not materialize, as vapers will simply get their e-cigs via the Internet or from out of state.\n\nOne of the most bogus concerns is that e-cigs will be a “gateway” to nicotine addiction and smoking. The data suggest just the opposite: Teen smoking rates have fallen significantly in recent years, even as e-cig use has soared.\n\nBanning vaping as though it was smoking due to “second-hand vapor” is ridiculous on its face: Vapor is mostly water, and the chemicals in it are in such low concentrations (as confirmed in academic analysis) so as not to be a threat to anyone.\n\nThe politicians seeking to ban and tax e-cigs say “it’s in the interests of public health.” In fact, such measures are antithetical to public health, and would protect cigarette markets by reducing access to a successful quit-smoking method. If these bills become law, they’ll simply be a death sentence for smokers who just want to quit.\n\nDr. Gilbert Ross is is executive and medical director at the American Council on Science and Health.', 'Cigarettes continue to kill a half-million Americans every year while holding 100-fold that number in addiction’s deadly grasp.\nWhy do e-cigs help smokers quit when the patches, gums and drugs fail?\nBut one New York bill would institute an exorbitant tax on e-cigs, which have previously not been targeted with tobacco-like excise taxes.\nThe tax would actually make e-cigs as expensive as the real, deadly cigarettes.\nThe politicians seeking to ban and tax e-cigs say “it’s in the interests of public health.” In fact, such measures are antithetical to public health, and would protect cigarette markets by reducing access to a successful quit-smoking method.']"

The end of the vaping free-for-all is in sight.\n\nThe proposed law would restrict selling e-cigs (and pipes, hookahs and possibly cigars) to anyone under 18, and start IDing customers to make sure. It would ban merchants from giving out free samples, which is real bad news for the vape shops springing up around the country. It would require warning labels with ingredients on products, namely calling out the fact that the e-cigarette contains nicotine which is addictive.\n\nE-cig companies would have to get FDA approval for any new products, which is bound to put a plug in the nascent cyberpunk vape scene where elaborate mods can sell online for thousands of dollars apiece. Companies could also no longer market themselves as “health” products without citing specific scientific evidence to back the claims up, which will reign in the legion of startups launching e-cigs as a smoking cessation tool.\n\nNotably absent from the regulations: The agency isn’t cracking down on flavored liquids, which e-cig opponents argue make the devices more appealing to kids. It’s not touching TV ad campaigns, which opponents also worry are targeting young people and revitalizing the ""cool"" image the anti-smoking campaign has worked so hard to squash over the last half century.\n\nThe FDA said the research around electronic cigs, which vaporize liquid nicotine instead of burning tobacco, is still too preliminary to warrant rules that are too strict. So the agency is basically proposing a compromise here. It’s responding to the growing pressure to stop dilly dallying and flex its authority over the digital version of the cigarettes it already regulates, while recognizing that more research is needed to fully understand the public health implications of the new trend.\n\nUntil now, absent of any word from the federal agency, the e-cig business has been going hog wild, booming into a multibillion dollar industry operating with no oversight—though some cities have started enacting their own local bans on e-smoking. (Ironically, many e-cig advocates were actually eager for this day to come, figuring the federal regulations would be more lax than the all-out bans some places have enacted while waiting on the FDA.)\n\nThe regulations won\'t kill the booming e-cig biz. But the Wild West days of vape culture are over. Or rather, will be, once the proposed rules are approved, which could take months or even years. The proposal is open to public comment for 75 days, at which point the agency will make final changes. “If it takes more than a year to finalize this rule, the FDA isn’t doing its job,” Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids told the New York Times.\n\nThe approval process is bound to get tied up and in the heated debate over the controversial products, and bogged down by the powerful lobbies on both sides. Big tobacco is now entrenched in the vape business itself, with most of the major companies having added an e-cig product to their stable. But there are also major health groups fighting tooth-and-nail not to undo the decades of work they’ve spent fighting cancer-causing smokes, and most aren\'t convinced e-cigarettes are any less dangerous than their combustible counterparts.\n\nVapers, get your kicks while you can.', 'We knew it was coming soon, and now the Federal Drug Administration has released its long-awaited proposed regulations for e-cigarettes.\nNotably absent from the regulations: The agency isn’t cracking down on flavored liquids, which e-cig opponents argue make the devices more appealing to kids.\nUntil now, absent of any word from the federal agency, the e-cig business has been going hog wild, booming into a multibillion dollar industry operating with no oversight—though some cities have started enacting their own local bans on e-smoking.\nBut the Wild West days of vape culture are over.\nThe proposal is open to public comment for 75 days, at which point the agency will make final changes.']"

There have been few evidence-based studies about them.\n\n“The fact is, this is not just a way to deliver nicotine,” said Jonathan Bricker, psychologist and smoking cessation researcher in the Public Health Sciences division of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “The nicotine is being delivered in combination with other chemicals that cause the ‘smoke.’ And those chemicals are potentially carcinogenic.”\n\nUntil those chemicals are studied, no one can say whether they are hazardous to inhale.\n\n“We won’t know for a while,” Bricker said. “We need to do extensive laboratory research and have to observe their effects over time on the human body. Cancer doesn’t show up immediately. It takes years to develop.”\n\nNow the FDA is proposing some sweeping changes to the way it regulates tobacco products. Though it is not suggesting an outright ban the proposed rule will require the makers of these tobacco products to:\n\nRegister with the FDA and report product and ingredient listings\n\nOnly market new tobacco products after FDA review\n\nOnly make direct and implied claims of reduced risk if the FDA confirms that scientific evidence supports the claim and that marketing of the product will benefit public health as a whole; and\n\nNot distribute any free samples\n\nThe FDA would also set a minimum age for purchase of these products as well as require identification restrictions to prevent sales to underage youth.\n\n“Right now anybody can buy them,” said Donna Manders a tobacco cessation specialist at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. “This will curb sales to minors.”\n\nThe proposed regulations will also protect Americans from product variability. “When a product is unregulated, you don’t know what’s in there,” Manders said. “If, for example, there is supposed to be 4 mg of nicotine in each e-cigarette, there might in fact be 8. Right now there’s no way someone can know that what is on the label is what is in the product. And that puts the consumer in a vulnerable position. So regulation would protect consumers from variation in the product.”\n\nLike cigarettes, the newly regulated products would also be required to carry health warnings. Plus, there would also be a prohibition against selling them in vending machines unless the machine was in a facility that never admits young people.\n\nSome states didn’t wait for the FDA to get involved. New York, New Jersey, Utah and North Dakota have already banned e-cigarettes.\n\nUp until now it’s been a virtual Wild West situation with respect to e-cigarettes, which have been growing in popularity. Like most supplements, they came with no regulation or testing requirements.\n\nThough it’s a health plus that they are smokeless, e-cigarettes do contain liquid nicotine which is converted into a vapor that can be inhaled. And while nicotine doesn’t cause cancer, it is highly addictive.\n\nOne big question that hasn’t been answered is whether inhaling the vapor, which does leave a residue on drapes, carpeting and furniture, has any effect on health. Another unknown: whether e-cigarettes help people kick the habit or just make them more nicotine addicted.\n\nOne thing experts are sure of—e-cigarettes aren’t going to be banished with the stroke of a pen any time soon.\n\n“The e-cigarette business is booming,” Manders said. “The tobacco industry is heavily invested in them at this point so they’re probably not going to go away.”\n\nRelated:', 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed asserting its authority over new tobacco products, including e-cigs, on Thursday.\nElectronic cigarettes may soon be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, just as traditional smokes are.\nIt isn’t official yet but the FDA suggested Thursday that it would expand its authority over tobacco to include electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, waterpipe tobacco and dissolvables not already under the FDA’s authority.\nThe FDA currently regulates cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco.\nIt takes years to develop.”Now the FDA is proposing some sweeping changes to the way it regulates tobacco products.']"

Display cases held dozens of electronic cigarettes and a seemingly endless array of nicotine liquids, in far-flung flavors such as Mojito and Moon Pie, Swedish Fish and Scooby Snacks.\n\nOn a nearby couch, shop co-owner Erik Miller and store manager Ryan Bixby took drags off their own e-cigarettes, filling the tiny space with apple- and vanilla-scented vapors. They hardly sounded troubled by Thursday’s announcement that the Food and Drug Administration intends to start regulating the rapidly expanding e-cigarette market.\n\n“We’re excited,” said Bixby, 30. “With regulation comes standardization. The quality is going to improve.”\n\nIf approved, the FDA’s proposal would quickly put curbs on sales to minors, require health warning labels and disclosure of ingredients, and prohibit manufacturers from making unverified health-related claims — ideas that most e-cigarette producers and retailers say they embrace.\n\nWhat comes after that might prove far more delicate and divisive.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nFor now, the FDA isn’t seeking to halt online sales of e-cigarettes, forbid television advertising, or ban the dizzying array of flavorings, from mango to margarita to mocha, which tobacco control advocates say are aimed at luring young smokers and which have been banned in traditional cigarettes. Those rules eventually could come, FDA officials say, but only after there is a scientific basis for broader regulations.\n\nThe FDA’s long-awaited move to begin regulating e-cigarettes — as well as cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah tobacco and other products — drew swift and mixed reactions Thursday from public health officials, consumer advocates and manufacturers. But almost everyone agreed that the details of how the agency eventually regulates the rapidly evolving, $2 billion-a-year e-cigarette industry will shape it dramatically and could have profound effects on public health.\n\nThe public has 75 days to comment on the FDA’s proposal, and manufacturers will have two years after the current rules are finalized to submit applications to the FDA to approve their products, which can remain on the market in the meantime.\n\nMatthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called Thursday’s action an important step but said that it is “inexcusable” that the FDA had taken years to act. He said the agency must move quickly to conduct the research it will need to crack down on the flavorings and marketing aimed at minors.\n\n“They can’t move forward at the same pace that they have been moving and do their job protecting public health,” Myers said. “We can’t waste another five years; this cannot take that long. There is a moral and public health imperative for them to treat this with the urgency it deserves.”\n\nSome industry advocates worry that federal regulation will benefit only a handful of large e-cigarette companies that have the money and staffing needed to file the mountain of paperwork required to seek FDA approval for every e-cigarette product.\n\n“This is worse than I expected,” said Greg Conley, a board member of the American Vaping Association, who had hoped that the FDA would grandfather in existing products, rather than force e-cigarette makers to file lengthy applications for any product on the market dating to early 2007. “A lot of these companies, they are supporting several employees, investing any profits back into their business. . . . They can’t afford this, and it’s going to lead to a whole lot of consolidation and increased prices for consumers.”\n\nNot everyone agrees. Some of the largest players in the e-cigarette market praised the FDA for committing to a science-based decision-making process, which they hope will allow them to make a case that e-cigarettes have the potential to reduce tobacco-related harm.\n\n“What they did today was very encouraging,” said Miguel Martin, president of Logic Technology Development, one of the nation’s leading e-cigarette companies. “At least speaking for my company, this will not be the tobacco wars of the ’80s and ’90s.”\n\nThe market for e-cigarettes — battery-powered devices that heat up a liquid and deliver nicotine-laced vapor to users — still pales in comparison to the $80 billion in annual tobacco sales, but that gap is narrowing, and some analysts think e-cigarettes could eclipse conventional cigarettes in popularity within a decade.\n\nThe FDA’s move comes at a time when many questions remain about whether e-cigarettes actually help people kick the smoking habit or put more people on a path toward smoking. It comes as cities and states are putting in place public bans on e-cigarettes over the objections of advocates who say they should be embraced as a welcome replacement to toxic, burning tobacco.\n\nAs the federal government enters the fray, it faces a balancing act of setting sensible restrictions that will ensure safe products while restricting access to minors, but won’t crush an industry that has the potential to reduce the number of tobacco smokers in America. In the end, the FDA insists, the data will dictate which direction regulators take.\n\nThat’s fine by Jason Healy, founder and president of blu eCigs, which was acquired by Lorillard in 2012. “It will move from theory and conjecture and gut feelings to a science-based regulatory framework,” Healy said. “Both sides have to now be accountable for their statements. You’re going to have to put science behind it.”\n\nHowever that pans out, he said, it’s likely to be good for customers visiting the vape shop in Adams Morgan, and thousands of others like it around the country. “There’s been so much uncertainty,” Healy said. “Now, everyone will know where we stand.”', 'They hardly sounded troubled by Thursday’s announcement that the Food and Drug Administration intends to start regulating the rapidly expanding e-cigarette market.\nThose rules eventually could come, FDA officials say, but only after there is a scientific basis for broader regulations.\nThe FDA’s long-awaited move to begin regulating e-cigarettes — as well as cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah tobacco and other products — drew swift and mixed reactions Thursday from public health officials, consumer advocates and manufacturers.\n“They can’t move forward at the same pace that they have been moving and do their job protecting public health,” Myers said.\nSome of the largest players in the e-cigarette market praised the FDA for committing to a science-based decision-making process, which they hope will allow them to make a case that e-cigarettes have the potential to reduce tobacco-related harm.']"

162501,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/04/24/get-ready-for-e-cigarettes-to-light-a-fire.aspx,health,"['Probably surprising supporters and opponents alike, the Food and Drug Administration proposed measures today that will light a fire under electronic cigarette sales, catapulting them to even greater heights. Instead of the wide-ranging and restrictive rules most people anticipated, the regulatory agency came out with proposals that seem measured and reasonable and ought to have Lorillard (UNKNOWN:LO.DL) and Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) getting on board behind them.\n\nThe FDA said it will ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, the first time the $2 billion industry is being subjected to government regulation, but given that the agency won\'t also restrict flavored products, online sales, or advertising, it amounts to a huge boost to the industry. E-cig makers have already voiced support for the ban on sale of their products to those under 18, so the new rule isn\'t any great imposition on them. But those opposed to the smoking alternative\'s proliferation will likely be upset the rules won\'t be going further, because they contend that flavors, for example, are one of the things that entice minors to try the product.\n\nThe agency did issue edicts that restrict marketing of the devices, though not in a way that appears particularly burdensome. For example, e-cigarette manufacturers would be prohibited from distributing free samples, are forbidden from using vending machine sales except in adult-only venues, and would be required to warn that nicotine is addictive, although no other health warnings would be required.\n\nWhile the FDA also would prevent the companies from making any health claims in their advertising, there\'s at least circumstantial evidence that e-cigs are a healthier alternative than their combustible counterparts.\n\nBecause e-cigs heat up a liquid and don\'t burn tobacco, you\'re not inhaling smoke or ingesting tar, which is where the bulk of the health risks of cigarettes lie. Instead you\'re inhaling a vapor, which is said to contain 450 times lower levels of toxicants than cigarettes have in their smoke. With the American Lung Association saying smoking contributes to 90% of lung cancer deaths, you\'d figure health advocates would want to promote a device that could eat into those numbers.\n\nNo matter, the e-cigarette manufacturers will undoubtedly support the proposals; considering the U.K. regulates e-cigs as a medicine, meaning the rules are far more restrictive, and the EU has discussed banning them altogether, this is a very satisfactory outcome for them.\n\nIndustry leader Lorillard reported earnings earlier this year that showed sales of e-cigs jumped 38% in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $54 million and hit $230 million in revenues for the year, a 30% increase from the end of the third quarter. Reynolds American, which had its Vuse brand of e-cigs in just two states last quarter (but will be rolling them out nationally in June) has negligible sales at the moment in terms of its overall results, but found that e-cigs captured market-leading share in both states immediately upon entering the market and that the entire e-cig category expanded as a result.\n\nAltria (NYSE:MO) was late to the e-cig game and only introduced its first product in August of last year, but it\'s quickly making up for lost time, having recently purchased the Green Smoke brand and announcing its intention to roll out its NuMark division\'s brands nationally in the second quarter as well.\n\nBecause the tobacco companies have quickly come to dominate the e-cig market, many expected the proposed rules would be a lot harsher than they seem to be. New York City, after all, banned the use of e-cigs in public because they could ""renormalize"" smoking. But it seems cooler heads prevailed at the FDA, and that means we should see e-cigarettes become an even hotter commodity than they already are.', 'Probably surprising supporters and opponents alike, the Food and Drug Administration proposed measures today that will light a fire under electronic cigarette sales, catapulting them to even greater heights.\nThe agency did issue edicts that restrict marketing of the devices, though not in a way that appears particularly burdensome.\nInstead you\'re inhaling a vapor, which is said to contain 450 times lower levels of toxicants than cigarettes have in their smoke.\nNew York City, after all, banned the use of e-cigs in public because they could ""renormalize"" smoking.\nBut it seems cooler heads prevailed at the FDA, and that means we should see e-cigarettes become an even hotter commodity than they already are.']"

But one concern among e-cig advocates was that the Food and Drug Administration\'s proposal that all e-cig products first receive FDA approval before being sold would slow down the ability to introduce technological improvements in the battery-powered devices, which could in turn harm efforts to convert smokers of cancer-causing tobacco cigarettes.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThat rule could also be a significant hurdle for new companies to enter a market which to date has been wide open. Current companies would have a two-year window to submit their existing products for FDA approval. ""Any \'Johnny-come-lately\' will not just be able to throw a product out to the public without it in any way, shape or form being regulated,"" said Jeff Holman, president of the e-cig company Vapor Corp. ""I think it raises the bar."" Read MoreBuzz kill: Feds lay down laws for e-cigarettes ""I\'m very encouraged"" by the proposed rules, said Miguel Martin, president of LOGIC, the second-best-selling e-cig company in the U.S., according to recent Nielsen surveys. Martin and Holman both said that the fact that the FDA will issue regulations on e-cigs will make the public more comfortable with the products, which began selling in earnest only in 2007, and thus set the stage for potentially greater growth of sales than already seen. ""There\'s no question that the FDA\'s oversight, which we welcome, brings legitimacy to the category,"" Martin said. ""Companies that are acting responsibly, I think, will be given every opportunity to be successful from a business perspective."" Jason Healy, founder and president of e-cig market leader Blu, during an on-air appearance on CNBC, said, ""As long as the rules are universal, and they will be, then I see no detriment to the business."" Tobacco giant Lorillard bought Blu two years ago. Since then, its fellow Big Three members Altria and Reynolds American have both begun rolling out their own homegrown e-cigarette products in a bid to ride the category\'s sales wave. The FDA\'s proposed rules, which will now be subject to a 75-day public comment period, include the ban on sales to minors, a ban on free samples, a ban on vending machine sales in any venue that is open to minors and mandated disclosure of all ingredients in the product.

It could also lead to further restrictions on candy flavorings that some critics say are part of a marketing strategy aimed at youth.\n\nFDA said it is looking for additional research on the long-term effects of flavored tobacco product usage.

It’s legal for example, to sell them to minors, and they are allowed in some public places where cigarettes and cigars are banned.\n\nThe FDA proposal would ban sales of electronic cigarettes to people under 18, require health warning labels and require FDA approval for new products.\n\nBut it wouldn’t set product standards, prevent them from being advertised in mediums including television, or ban the sale of flavored e-cigs, which many critics say lure young people.\n\nElectronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices, often in the shape of a cigarette or pen, that heat liquid nicotine into a a vapor which is inhaled in a process referred to as “vaping.” The health impacts haven’t been substantially studied. But some experts believe they are safer than regular cigarettes, since they don’t produce carbon monoxide or the tar and hundreds of toxic chemicals, including some that cause cancer, that result from burning tobacco. There is also some evidence suggesting e-cigs might help people quit regular cigarettes.\n\nStill, they contain nicotine, which is addictive. As a result, public health advocates fear they offer a gateway to tobacco addiction and smoking, especially among young people who otherwise might not smoke. Moreover, little is known about second-hand impacts of vapor from e-cigs.\n\nThe medical society’s MacLeod was pleased by the proposed ban on sales to minors, which addresses the society’s top concern. He said he’s convinced manufactures offer flavors such as chocolate and honey in order to appeal to young people. On Thursday, he restated his view that the full health consequences of e-cigs are unknown, and much more study is needed. He noted that tobacco manufacturers long claimed cigarettes were safe, even as science was proving otherwise.\n\nStory, of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, said the organization regards e-cigs as an “adult product” and its members don’t want them sold to minors. “We want to target only those who are adult, current tobacco users,” he said.\n\nHe further said the only harm related to e-cigs is related to the fact they contain nicotine, which can be addictive. Beyond that, they “have zero history of harm,” he said. Therefore, his organization supports a package warning referring to nicotine and possible addiction, but will resist anything that would mimic the kind of warnings placed on cigarettes, he said.\n\nDave Norris was a long-time smoker who used e-cigs as a smoking cessation device. His positive experience prompted him to open Blue Door Vaping, a Mechanicsburg business which sells e-cigs.\n\nOn Thursday, he said he had just downloaded the 241-page FDA proposal and wanted to hold off on reacting until he had read it. However, he said he is “100 percent in favor” of the ban on sales to minors, and stressed he already cards buyers to prevent such sales. But he too had reservations about a strongly-worded warning.\n\nSome of the proposed FDA actions, including the ban on sales to minors, would take affect at the end of the 75-day comment period, while others would kick in after two years.\n\nChuck Moran, a spokesman for the medical society, said it was unclear if the FDA rule, when it becomes final, will impact efforts to make e-cigs subject to Pennsylvania’s ban on smoking in most public places. But now that the federal government plans to impose the ban on sales to minors, the medical society can focus more on its effort to have a tax imposed on e-cigs, he said.\n\nJonathan Foulds, a tobacco addiction researcher at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, pointed out the 241-page document will now undergo intense scrutiny from lawyers on all sides of the issue, and he said odds are high lawsuits will result. That means it could be years before regulations are finalized and put in place.\n\nStill, he said “It’s a good thing the FDA has taken steps … It had to happen, because it really was the Wild West out there” regarding regulation of e-cigs."", ""01/31/2014 Dan Gleiter | dgleiter@pennlive.comThe Pennsylvania Medical Society, which has campaigned against electronic cigarettes, on Thursday applauded a federal agency's plans to begin regulating the nicotine-delivering devices.\n01/31/2014 Dan Gleiter | dgleiter@pennlive.com“We applaud that the FDA has finally taken a stand and come out with a proposed rule” pertaining to electronic cigarettes, said Ray Story of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association.\nThus far, electronic cigarettes have been largely unregulated by the government.\nThe FDA proposal would ban sales of electronic cigarettes to people under 18, require health warning labels and require FDA approval for new products.\nStory, of the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, said the organization regards e-cigs as an “adult product” and its members don’t want them sold to minors.""]"

It was a role previously reserved for the Pap smear, the decades-old mainstay of women’s health.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved Roche’s cobas HPV test to detect the human Papillomavirus, or HPV, in women 25 and up. HPV causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer.\n\nDoctors already use such DNA-based tools as a follow-up to confirm Pap test results. But Thursday’s decision means Roche can now market its test as a first-choice option for cervical cancer screening, ahead of the Pap test.\n\nCurrently no major medical guidelines recommend HPV testing alone for cervical cancer screening. Dr. David Chelmow of Virginia Commonwealth University said physicians should hold off using the test until medical societies can provide guidance on some key questions, including how frequently it should be used. Chelmow spoke on behalf of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the FDA’s meeting to review the test last month.\n\nRoche supported its bid for expanded marketing with study results suggesting genetic testing is more accurate and objective at identifying cancerous growths than the Pap smear, which requires doctors to examine cervical cells under a microscope.\n\nThe FDA approval comes despite pushback from public health advocates, who warned regulators that approving the DNA test as an alternative to Pap could lead to confusion, higher costs and overtreatment. More than a dozen patient groups raised those concerns in a letter to the FDA last week. Specifically, they said HPV-only testing could lead to overtreatment of younger women who carry the virus but have little risk of developing actual cancer. Most sexually active young people contract HPV, though their bodies usually eliminate the virus within a few months. Only yearslong infections develop into cancer.\n\nFDA officials said in a statement Thursday that they approved the test because “Roche Diagnostics conducted a well-designed study that provided the FDA with a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness.” The trial included over 47,000 women who underwent cervical screening using either Pap or HPV screening. The test results were then checked for accuracy against final biopsy results that confirmed whether they actually had cancer.\n\nFor decades the Pap test was the only screening option for cervical cancer – and it’s had a remarkably successful track record. The number of cervical cancer cases reported in the U.S. has decreased more than 50 percent in the past 30 years, primarily due to increased Pap screening. Still, an estimated 12,000 cases of cervical cancer are expected to be diagnosed this year, a fact that has spurred development of HPV tests like those from Roche, Qiagen and other test makers. HPV test costs generally cost between $80 and $100, about twice as much as a $40 Pap.\n\nMedical guidelines have been evolving rapidly to try and incorporate both techniques. Under the latest guidelines from the American Cancer Society, a Pap test is recommended every three years for women 21 to 29 years old. Women 30 and older should have both a Pap test and an HPV test every five years, or a Pap test alone every three years. HPV screening is not recommended for women in their 20s because it increases the odds of more invasive testing that can leave the cervix less able to handle pregnancy later in life.\n\nIn its statement approving the test, the FDA staff suggested its decision would not change how doctors use HPV screening.\n\n“It does not change current medical practice guidelines for cervical cancer screening. These guidelines are developed, reviewed and modified by groups other than the FDA,” said Dr. Alberto Gutierrez, who oversees the FDA’s medical testing office.\n\nBut patient advocates rejected that reasoning.\n\n“They imply that the FDA approval decision isn’t that important in deciding how this test will be used,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Fund. “By claiming to pass the buck to the experts in the field, FDA is not taking responsibility for the agency’s influential decision to approve the test as a replacement of the Pap smear for women over 25.”', 'Doctors already use such DNA-based tools as a follow-up to confirm Pap test results.\nBut Thursday’s decision means Roche can now market its test as a first-choice option for cervical cancer screening, ahead of the Pap test.\nFor decades the Pap test was the only screening option for cervical cancer – and it’s had a remarkably successful track record.\nWomen 30 and older should have both a Pap test and an HPV test every five years, or a Pap test alone every three years.\nIn its statement approving the test, the FDA staff suggested its decision would not change how doctors use HPV screening.']"

The approval follows the March 12 unanimous recommendation from the Microbiology Devices Panel of the FDA\'s Medical Devices Advisory Committee, making the cobas® HPV Test the first and only HPV test in the United States approved for first-line primary screening.\n\n""We are very pleased that the FDA has approved this test for first-line use in cervical cancer screening. It is a recognition for the value the cobas® HPV Test provides to physicians and women to make more informed decisions that can ultimately prevent cervical cancer development,"" said Roland Diggelmann, COO Division Roche Diagnostics. ""This is an outstanding example of how innovation in diagnostics is shifting the disease management paradigm to improve patient care and people\'s health. We are committed to working with the medical community and professional organizations to put the necessary clinical practice guidelines in place to encourage providers to incorporate this new screening strategy alternative in their patient protocols.""\n\nPrior to the approval of this additional claim, HPV tests had been used as a follow-up test for Pap (Papanicolaou) results and as an adjunct to Pap in women 30 years and older.\n\n""Today\'s action by the FDA has given women a better alternative method to reassure themselves they do not have this deadly yet preventable disease,"" said Mark H.

The FDA\'s decision to approve the expanded use for the cobas® HPV Test was based on results from the landmark ATHENA trial, which enrolled more than 47,000 women. The study demonstrated that one in four women who are HPV 16 positive will have cervical disease within three years and that nearly 1 in 7 women with normal Pap cytology who were HPV 16 positive actually had high-grade cervical disease that was missed by cytology.\n\nIn addition, results from the ATHENA trial included a comparison of a cobas® HPV Test screening strategy to alternative strategies using Pap cytology and HPV testing. The comparison showed that a strategy leveraging the ability of the cobas® HPV Test to identify women testing positive for HPV 16 or 18, and using cervical cytology (Pap) as a triage, follow-up test, would allow clinicians to detect more disease without referring a significant number of women to unnecessary follow-up.', 'Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the cobas® HPV (Human Papillomavirus) Test for use as a first-line primary screening test for cervical cancer in women 25 and older.\nThe approval follows the March 12 unanimous recommendation from the Microbiology Devices Panel of the FDA\'s Medical Devices Advisory Committee, making the cobas® HPV Test the first and only HPV test in the United States approved for first-line primary screening.\n""We are very pleased that the FDA has approved this test for first-line use in cervical cancer screening.\nThe cobas® HPV Test provides both pooled high-risk HPV DNA results and individual detection of HPV 16 and HPV 18, the two types responsible for about 70 percent of cervical cancer.\nIn addition, results from the ATHENA trial included a comparison of a cobas® HPV Test screening strategy to alternative strategies using Pap cytology and HPV testing.']"

A vaginal swab is required for both the Pap test and the HPV DNA test, so you won’t notice a difference at the doctor’s office.\n\n“The potential benefit of (the HPV test) is that everybody that has a precancerous change or cervical cancer will have a positive test,” said Dr. Kevin Ault, professor at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. “You’re not going to miss anybody.”\n\nThere are other HPV tests out there, but this one can detect the most problematic strains — HPV 16 and 18. The test can also detect DNA from 12 other types of HPV that are associated with an increased cancer risk. HPV causes more than 99% of all cervical cancers.\n\nThe problem with any HPV test is that a lot of women — between 2% and 10% — will test positive for the virus, Ault said. And most women who get HPV don’t develop cervical cancer.\n\nHPV is so common that at least 70% of people who are sexually active will get a genital HPV infection at some point in their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\n“Most people who get HPV only have it for a few months or a year and then it goes away,” Ault said. “It’s really the people it persists in that are going to the problem.”\n\nBut how do we know who with HPV will likely develop cervical cancer? Positive results on the HPV test will necessitate further screening, he said. Patients who test positive may have to have a Pap smear as well, and potentially biopsies and other procedures.\n\n“The disadvantage is a lot of people are going to be scared,” he said.\n\nIf this new test is adopted as the primary screening method, Ault said, doctors can focus their Pap examinations on women who are already known to have HPV.\n\nIn most cases, patients who don’t have HPV are less likely to need a Pap, which is why the advisory committee felt it best to recommend the Roche test be administered as the first form of detection, women’s health experts say.\n\nIf both the Pap smear and the HPV test are negative, that would mean the patient essentially has almost no chance of developing cervical cancer in the next five years, Ault said.\n\n“Every year, 12,000 women are diagnosed in the U.S. with cervical cancer. This is especially tragic because cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease, and it is well established that HPV is the cause of almost all cervical cancers worldwide. Women need better access to screening tools that include primary HPV screening in order to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer,” said Dr. Thomas Wright Jr., an expert in gynecology and pathology at Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nMany gynecologists are used to doing routine Pap tests, so the HPV test may take a little while to replace the traditional pap smear, Ault said.\n\nBut Thursday’s approval of the test does not change current practice guidelines.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines are usually proposed through organizations such as the American Cancer Society or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The FDA’s role is in approval of the test itself.', '(CNN) — The FDA announced approval Thursday of the human papillomavirus DNA test as a primary screening method for cervical cancer.\nDeveloped by Roche Molecular Systems Inc., the cobas HPV Test can be used to see if a woman needs additional screening for cervical cancer and to gather information about her future risk.\nThe Pap test — the standard for 60 years — is designed to look for abnormal squamous cells that could indicate cervical cancer, while the HPV test looks for DNA from the virus.\nA vaginal swab is required for both the Pap test and the HPV DNA test, so you won’t notice a difference at the doctor’s office.\nCervical cancer screening guidelines are usually proposed through organizations such as the American Cancer Society or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.']"

The test also can provide information about the patient’s risk for developing cervical cancer in the future.\n\nUsing a sample of cervical cells, the cobas HPV Test detects DNA from 14 high-risk HPV types. The test specifically identifies HPV 16 and HPV 18, while concurrently detecting 12 other types of high-risk HPVs.\n\nBased on results of the cobas HPV Test, women who test positive for HPV 16 or HPV 18 should have a colposcopy, an exam using a device that illuminates and magnifies the cervix so a physician can directly observe the cervical cells. Women testing positive for one or more of the 12 other high-risk HPV types should have a Pap test to determine the need for a colposcopy. Health care professionals should use the cobas HPV Test results together with other information, such as the patient screening history and risk factors, and current professional guidelines.\n\n“Today’s approval offers women and physicians a new option for cervical cancer screening,” said Alberto Gutierrez, Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Roche Diagnostics conducted a well-designed study that provided the FDA with a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness when used as a primary screening tool for cervical cancer.”\n\nThe FDA first approved the test, called the cobas HPV Test, in 2011 for use in conjunction with or as a follow-up to a Pap test (cell cytology), which examines cervical cells for changes that might become cervical cancer.\n\nToday’s approval expands the use of the test to include use as either a co-test or as a primary cervical cancer screening test, however; it does not change current medical practice guidelines for cervical cancer screening.

Approximately 14 “high-risk” HPV types are associated with cervical cancer.\n\nIn most cases, a high-risk HPV infection goes away on its own and does not cause any health problems. However, about 10 percent of women infected with high-risk HPV develop a persistent infection which may put them at risk of cancer. Virtually all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, with just two types, HPV 16 and HPV 18, responsible for approximately 70 percent of cervical cancers.\n\nData supporting the use of the cobas HPV Test as a primary screening test for cervical cancer included a study of more than 40,000 women 25 years and older undergoing routine cervical exams.

It was a role previously reserved for the Pap smear, the decades-old mainstay of women\'s health.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved Roche\'s cobas HPV test to detect the human Papillomavirus, or HPV, in women 25 and up. HPV causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer.\n\nDoctors already use such DNA-based tools as a follow-up to confirm Pap test results. But Thursday\'s decision means Roche can now market its test as a first-choice option for cervical cancer screening, ahead of the Pap test.\n\nCurrently no major medical guidelines recommend HPV testing alone for cervical cancer screening. Dr. David Chelmow of Virginia Commonwealth University said physicians should hold off on using the test until medical societies can provide guidance on some key questions, including how frequently it should be used. Chelmow spoke on behalf of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the FDA\'s meeting to review the test last month.\n\nRoche supported its bid for expanded marketing with study results suggesting genetic testing is more accurate and objective at identifying cancerous growths than the Pap smear, which requires doctors to examine cervical cells under a microscope for signs of cancer. The test detects 14 high-risk forms of HPV that can lead to cervical cancer.\n\nThe FDA approval comes despite pushback from public health advocates, who warned regulators that approving the DNA test as an alternative to Pap could lead to confusion, higher costs and overtreatment. More than a dozen patient groups raised those concerns in a letter to the FDA last week. Specifically, they said HPV-only testing could lead to overtreatment of younger women who carry the virus but have little risk of developing actual cancer. Most sexually active young people contract HPV, though their bodies usually eliminate the virus within a few months. Only yearslong infections develop into cancer.\n\nFDA officials said in a statement Thursday that they approved the test because ""Roche Diagnostics conducted a well-designed study that provided the FDA with a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness."" The trial included over 47,000 women who underwent cervical screening using either Pap or HPV screening. The test results were then checked for accuracy against final biopsy results that confirmed whether they actually had cancer.\n\nFor decades the Pap test was the only screening option for cervical cancer -- and it\'s had a remarkably successful track record. The number of cervical cancer cases reported in the U.S. has decreased more than 50 per cent in the past 30 years, primarily due to increased Pap screening. Still, an estimated 12,000 cases of cervical cancer are expected to be diagnosed this year, a fact that has spurred development of HPV tests like those from Roche, Qiagen and other test makers. HPV test costs generally cost between $80 and $100, about twice as much as a $40 Pap.\n\nMedical guidelines have been evolving rapidly to try and incorporate both techniques. Under the latest guidelines from the American Cancer Society, a Pap test is recommended every three years for women 21 to 29 years old. Women 30 and older should have both a Pap test and an HPV test every five years, or a Pap test alone every three years.

A vaginal swab is required for both the Pap test and the HPV DNA test, so you won’t notice a difference at the doctor’s office.\n\n“The potential benefit of (the HPV test) is that everybody that has a precancerous change or cervical cancer will have a positive test,” said Dr. Kevin Ault, professor at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. “You’re not going to miss anybody.”\n\nThere are other HPV tests out there, but this one can detect the most problematic strains — HPV 16 and 18. The test can also detect DNA from 12 other types of HPV that are associated with an increased cancer risk. HPV causes more than 99% of all cervical cancers.\n\nThe problem with any HPV test is that a lot of women — between 2% and 10% — will test positive for the virus, Ault said. And most women who get HPV don’t develop cervical cancer.\n\nHPV is so common that at least 70% of people who are sexually active will get a genital HPV infection at some point in their lives, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\n“Most people who get HPV only have it for a few months or a year and then it goes away,” Ault said. “It’s really the people it persists in that are going to the problem.”\n\nBut how do we know who with HPV will likely develop cervical cancer? Positive results on the HPV test will necessitate further screening, he said. Patients who test positive may have to have a Pap smear as well, and potentially biopsies and other procedures.\n\n“The disadvantage is a lot of people are going to be scared,” he said.\n\nIf this new test is adopted as the primary screening method, Ault said, doctors can focus their Pap examinations on women who are already known to have HPV.\n\nIn most cases, patients who don’t have HPV are less likely to need a Pap, which is why the advisory committee felt it best to recommend the Roche test be administered as the first form of detection, women’s health experts say.\n\nIf both the Pap smear and the HPV test are negative, that would mean the patient essentially has almost no chance of developing cervical cancer in the next five years, Ault said.\n\n“Every year, 12,000 women are diagnosed in the U.S. with cervical cancer. This is especially tragic because cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease, and it is well established that HPV is the cause of almost all cervical cancers worldwide. Women need better access to screening tools that include primary HPV screening in order to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer,” said Dr. Thomas Wright Jr., an expert in gynecology and pathology at Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nMany gynecologists are used to doing routine Pap tests, so the HPV test may take a little while to replace the traditional pap smear, Ault said.\n\nBut Thursday’s approval of the test does not change current practice guidelines.\n\nCervical cancer screening guidelines are usually proposed through organizations such as the American Cancer Society or the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

As the largest organization of doctors specializing in the treatment of women’s cancers, including cervical cancer, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) welcomes new options for detecting and preventing this terrible disease. We also are aware that the approval has raised a number of questions about how HPV testing will be used and whether the Pap test will continue to play a role in cervical cancer screening. Primary HPV testing does not replace the Pap test, and it is extremely unlikely that doctors will stop using the Pap any time soon. FDA approval of primary HPV testing means the HPV test can be used first when screening a woman for cervical cancer. The two tests screen for cervical cancer in different ways. The HPV test detects the presence of the HPV types responsible for most cervical cancer, and can help identify women at high risk for developing cervical cancer. The Pap test finds pre-cancer and cancer. Having more options for using each of these tests gives doctors more flexibility in choosing the best screening strategy for each individual patient.\n\nSGO and other organizations are developing an interim guidance document to help health care professionals determine how to best incorporate primary HPV testing into cervical cancer screening. In the meantime, current guidelines for when to use the HPV test remain in effect – when Pap test results are inconclusive and in women age 30 and older in combination with a Pap test.\n\nWomen should discuss with their doctors the best cervical cancer screening option for them. We also urge parents to have their daughters and sons vaccinated against the HPV virus. The vaccine is safe and effective and perhaps the best tool yet in preventing cervical cancer.\n\n###\n\nThe Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) is the premier medical specialty society for health care professionals trained in the comprehensive management of gynecologic cancers.

Now a self-portrait he drew months before his death has become a viral sensation bearing his family nickname\n\n\n\nHigh praise: Calder's colorfully scribbled face has touched so many so deeply that it adorned the facade of American Airlines Arena in his hometown of Miami\n\nThe heartwarming tribute to a vibrant, constantly smiling little boy was hatched when Jim Cahill, a friend of Calder's father Chris Sloan, printed a copy of Calder's drawing and posted it to Facebook.\n\nCahill urged his friends on the social network to do the same.\n\nBefore anyone realized, Calder's drawing, along with its new Mr. Awesome title, which comes from the boy's family nickname, had become a viral sensation.\n\nNow the little boy is traveling the world and inspiring some seriously famous folks to pay tribute to him, much to the surprise and joy of his still devastated family.\n\nThe sentiment is huge and almost enough to match the sheer horror of the freak accident that took his Calder's life.\n\n\n\nCalder was racing his nanny's adult son across the backyard pool in Miami, Florida when the man felt a shock in the water, leaped out and yelled for the boy to get out too.\n\n\n\nBut Calder, who was underwater and couldn't hear him, suddenly received a massive jolt that threw him out of the water.\n\nSeeing America: A Sloan family friend posted the drawing on Facebook and urged his friends to print it off, take a picture and do the same.

As I was performing CPR on the boy I was getting zapped.'\n\nThe boy's parents, who were visiting friends, received a call and Calder's father, Christopher Sloan, said he heard his wife scream, 'Is Calder dead?' as she ran outside.\n\nThe couple raced to Jackson North Medical Center, but their son had already passed.\n\nHeartbroken: Chris Sloan spoke to reporters about his son as he stood in front of the family pool that killed him\n\nScene: It appears that he was shocked through a light fixture at the back of the pool that was improperly installed\n\nBeautiful family: Calder smiles alongside his parents Chris and Carla and younger brother Caleb\n\nRemembered: Calder, a sports lover and energetic young boy, was called 'Mr Awesome' by his family\n\nSloan said that about nine months ago, he noticed that the pool light was broken so they hired a contractor to fix it. Among the family's grief and the chaos of organizing the funeral, they have not yet tracked down the name of the contractor.\n\nCalder's dip into the pool on Sunday was the first time anyone had been in in months.\n\n\n\nNorth Miami requires permits and inspections on pool electrical work, city spokeswoman Pam Solomon said, but city building department records don't indicate any permits at the Sloan home.\n\nElectricians told family members earlier this week that the light switch to the pool wasn't grounded properly, so power that should have been diverted from the pool was instead going directly into it.\n\n'Somebody did not do their job,' Chris Sloan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"", ""Awesome at famous landmarksA Miami boy who as electrocuted to death just days after his seventh birthday lives on as celebrities pose with a self portrait he drew month before his death.\nPaying tribute to Mr Awesome: Calder Sloan, 7, was killed when faulty wiring in his family's swimming pool electrocuted him in early April.\nSeeing America: A Sloan family friend posted the drawing on Facebook and urged his friends to print it off, take a picture and do the same.\nMr Awesome has seen the desert of the Southwest and the characters of the Walk of FameFamous faces: Well-known folks like U.S.\n'Somebody did not do their job,' Chris Sloan said.""]"

162602,http://news.yahoo.com/measles-off-fast-start-cases-trend-171616909.html,health,"['NEW YORK (AP) — Health officials are worried about recent U.S. measles outbreaks that so far have caused more illnesses than at the same point of any year since 1996.\n\nAuthorities say 129 cases in 13 states were reported by mid-April, the bulk of them in California and New York City. Most were triggered by travelers who caught the virus abroad and spread it in the United States among unvaccinated people. Many of the travelers had been to the Philippines, where a recent measles epidemic has caused at least 20,000 illnesses.\n\nThe U.S. numbers remain relatively tiny, but officials are worried to see case counts growing.\n\nSince 2000, the highly contagious disease has been considered eliminated in the United States, aside from occasional small outbreaks sparked by overseas travelers. For most of the last decade, the nation was seeing only about 60 cases a year.\n\nBut since 2010, the average has been nearly 160.\n\n""This increase in cases may be a \'new normal,\' unfortunately,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nContributing to the problem: Decades of measles vaccination campaigns have been so successful that many doctors have never seen a case, don\'t realize how contagious it is, and may not take necessary steps to stop it from spreading.\n\nAmong the 58 cases reported from California, at least 11 were infected in doctor\'s offices, hospitals or other health-care settings, according to a report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New York City health officials say two of their 26 cases were infected in medical facilities.\n\n""It\'s a shock to younger physicians that their own waiting room or emergency room is where people can get measles,"" said the CDC\'s Dr. Anne Schuchat.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a medical journal — the Annals of Internal Medicine — released a commentary warning doctors to prevent that kind of situation.\n\n""We must ensure that our facilities do not become centers for secondary measles transmission,"" wrote Dr. Julia Shaklee Sammons, an infectious disease specialist at the Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nShe urged doctors who suspect a measles case to place the patient in an isolation room with special ventilation that keeps the air from circulating around the building. Doctors and nurses should also wear surgical masks or respirators to protect themselves from getting infected, and to ask the infected patient to wear a surgical mask too.\n\nThe measles virus spreads easily through the air, and in closed rooms. Infected droplets can linger for up to two hours after the sick person leaves.\n\nIt causes a fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. In rare cases, measles can be deadly, and is particularly dangerous for children. Infection can also cause pregnant women to have a miscarriage or premature birth.\n\nBefore a vaccine became available about 50 years ago, nearly all children got measles by their 15th birthday. In those days, nearly 500 Americans died from measles each year.\n\nA bad resurgence of measles hit the nation in 1989 to 1991, when 55,000 cases were reported. That flood of cases was blamed on a widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children.\n\nIn reaction, the federal government started a program in 1994 to pay for vaccines for kids who are uninsured, in the Medicaid program, or meet other criteria.\n\nIn a report released Thursday, CDC officials estimated that the program and other childhood vaccination efforts will prevent 322 million illnesses and 732,000 premature deaths over the course of the lifetimes of children born in the years 1994 through 2013.\n\nWrapped into that estimate are 71 million measles cases, nearly 9 million measles hospitalizations and 57,000 measles deaths.\n\nThere has been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003. ""But the way we\'re going, we feel it (another) is inevitable,"" Schuchat said.\n\nToday, the measles vaccination rate is above 95 percent for children of kindergarten age. But there has been a small but growing trend of parents seeking exemptions for their children from school-entry vaccination requirements for religious or philosophical reasons. Other parents have tried to space out, or delay, measles vaccinations because of fears that the shot will trigger autism or other problems.', 'In rare cases, measles can be deadly, and is particularly dangerous for children.\nBefore a vaccine became available about 50 years ago, nearly all children got measles by their 15th birthday.\nA bad resurgence of measles hit the nation in 1989 to 1991, when 55,000 cases were reported.\nWrapped into that estimate are 71 million measles cases, nearly 9 million measles hospitalizations and 57,000 measles deaths.\nToday, the measles vaccination rate is above 95 percent for children of kindergarten age.']"

The Philippines has been the site of an explosive outbreak of measles that has affected more than 20,000 people and caused at least 50 deaths, according to McFadden.\n\nCurrently, there have been at least 16 symptomatic adults residing in the Danville area, according to McFadden, who notes at least two of the sick individuals have sought medical treatment in Holmes County, and test results to confirm a measles diagnosis are pending.\n\n""Because (family) ties mean travel patterns, shopping patterns and family outings that lead to Holmes County, for all practical purposes, while they don\'t live in Holmes County, we need to consider them part of the larger Holmes County community, which means it\'s here,"" according to McFadden, who said the local cases have spread into a third wave of infected individuals.\n\nAccording to the CDC, measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. Measles causes fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body.\n\n""More than 90 percent of unvaccinated people will get sick if they\'re exposed,"" said McFadden.\n\nSymptoms usually appear seven-18 days after exposure.

Despite the U.S. immunization program’s success, according to CDC officials, 129 people in the U.S. have been reported to have measles this year in 13 outbreaks, as of April 18.\n\nIn 1994, the Vaccines for Children program (VFC) was launched in direct response to a measles resurgence in the United States that caused tens of thousands of cases and over a hundred deaths, despite the availability of a measles vaccine since 1963. The VFC program provides vaccines to children whose parents or caregivers might otherwise be unable to afford them.\n\nThis year’s 20th anniversary of the VFC program’s implementation is occurring during an increase in measles cases in the U.S. In 2013, 189 Americans had measles. In 2011, 220 people in the U.S. were reported as having measles–the highest number of annual cases since 1996.\n\n“Thanks to the VFC program, children in our country are no longer at significant risk from diseases that once killed thousands each year,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “Current outbreaks of measles in the U.S. serve as a reminder that these diseases are only a plane ride away. Borders can’t stop measles, but vaccination can.”\n\nThe CDC reports 34 people, among the 129 cases this year, brought measles into the U.S. after being infected in other countries. Though not direct imports, most of the remaining cases are known to be linked to importations. Most people who reported having measles in 2014 were not vaccinated or did not know their vaccination status.\n\nBecause measles is a highly contagious disease, it can spread quickly among unvaccinated people. The CDC recommends people of all ages keep up to date with their vaccinations. CDC recommends two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine for everyone starting at age 12 months. Infants 6 through 11 months old should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine before international travel.\n\nFor children born during the VFC era, the U.S. immunization program continues to pay enormous benefits. According to analysis by the CDC, hospitalizations avoided and lives saved through vaccination will save nearly $295 billion in direct costs and $1.38 trillion in total societal costs. Parents can learn more about the VFC program at http://www.cdc.gov/features/vfcprogram/.\n\nApril 26th is the start of National Infant Immunization Week, which will bring together communities across the country in raising awareness about the importance immunization. For more information, go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines.\n\nHowever, not all diseases that threaten U.S. borders can be prevented today by vaccines and require different strategies to protect Americans. “The health security of the United States is only as strong as the health security of all nations around the world. We are all connected by the food we eat, the water we drink, and air we breathe,” said Dr. Frieden. “Stopping outbreaks where they start is the most effective and least costly way to prevent disease and save lives at home and abroad – and it’s the right thing to do.”\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as the health care law, was created to expand access to coverage, control health care costs, and improve health care quality and coordination. Under ACA, more Americans than ever will qualify to get health care coverage that fits their needs and budget, including important preventive services such as vaccine coverage available at no cost for eligible children through the Vaccines for Children Program.

Those who had not been vaccinated included patients who opted out of vaccinations because of personal beliefs.\n\n""Because measles can be spread so easily, unvaccinated people become very vulnerable once a disease is introduced,"" Anne Schuchat, U.S. assistant surgeon at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters.\n\nMeasles from abroad can also infect children who are too young to be vaccinated, she added.\n\nThe CDC recommends that starting at age 12 months, infants receive two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine.\n\nInfants aged 6 through 11 months old should receive one dose of MMR vaccine before international travel.\n\n(Editing by Kevin Gray and Dan Grebler)', 'Most of the U.S. measles cases are linked to unvaccinated travelers from abroad, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\nThe first four months of this year have brought more measles cases than any similar period since 1996, in part because of serious outbreaks in countries such as the Philippines, the agency said.\nThere have been no deaths from the disease reported in the United States this year, the CDC said.\nThe importation of measles from overseas makes vaccination even more important for children in the United States, the CDC said.\nThe Vaccines for Children program will be expanded under the Affordable Care Act, the CDC said.']"

They warned clinicians, parents and others to watch for the potentially deadly virus.\n\nThirty-four of the cases were imported via travel to other countries, including 17 from the Philippines, where a huge outbreak has affected 20,000 people and caused 69 deaths, said Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nThe United States has had no measles deaths reported from the outbreak, and none since 2003. But Schuchat acknowledged that “it’s probably just a numbers game, probably just a matter of time until we have more.” One or two of every 1,000 cases of measles are fatal, according to the CDC.\n\nCalifornia, with 58 cases, has been hit hardest by one of the 13 separate outbreaks of measles in the United States. New York has seen 24 infections, and Washington state has had 13.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that generally affects young children, causing fever, a runny nose, a cough and a distinctive rash all over the body. About one in 10 children also gets an ear infection and one in 20 comes down with pneumonia. A person with measles is contagious as long as four days before the symptoms are apparent, Schuchat said. Parents and even physicians who haven’t seen measles in years may be unaware of the early warning signs, she said.\n\nIn the past 20 years, a concerted public health campaign, especially among lower-income families, has made measles outbreaks rare. The disease has been considered eradicated since 2000. But today, the number of unvaccinated children has begun to become a problem, Schuchat said. Some people are choosing not to have their children immunized for personal reasons and others are unaware of, or unable to get, vaccinations, before they arrive in the United States. She said the CDC is also seeing growth in the disease pertussis, also known as whooping cough.\n\nBefore vaccinations were available, about 500,000 people were infected with measles annually in the United States, a number that fell to about 60 after the disease was all but eliminated in 2000. Since 2010, it has increased to an average of 155 cases per year.\n\nStill, she said, fewer than 1 percent of the toddlers in the United States have received no vaccines at all. “Vaccinating your children is still a social norm in this country,” she said.\n\nIn a telephone news conference Thursday, CDC Director Thomas Frieden lauded the Vaccines for Children program started in 1994, after a measles outbreak from 1989-1991 resulted in 55,000 cases, primarily because poor and uninsured children had not been immunized. Among children born in the following two decades, the CDC estimated, vaccinations prevented an estimated 322 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths, saving about $295 billion. The program provides free vaccinations for measles and 13 other diseases.\n\nBut “we can’t let our successes result in complacency,” Frieden said. “In fact measles, is very common in some parts of the word… . And it travels fast.” He said 20 million people across the globe get the disease annually, and 122,000 of them die.\n\nThe CDC said that 54 of this year’s 58 California cases were in some way associated with importation of the virus from abroad. Twenty-five of the people infected were not immunized — 19 of them because of philosophical objections — and 18 more had no documentation of vaccinations. Three were too young for routine vaccination and three others were not vaccinated for unknown reasons.\n\nEleven had received two or more doses of vaccine that did not protect them. The vaccine is about 97 percent effective, said CDC official Gregory Wallace, so about three in 100 people who are vaccinated and exposed to the infection will contract it.', 'The United States has had no measles deaths reported from the outbreak, and none since 2003.\nCalifornia, with 58 cases, has been hit hardest by one of the 13 separate outbreaks of measles in the United States.\nA person with measles is contagious as long as four days before the symptoms are apparent, Schuchat said.\nParents and even physicians who haven’t seen measles in years may be unaware of the early warning signs, she said.\nStill, she said, fewer than 1 percent of the toddlers in the United States have received no vaccines at all.']"

And why isn’t immunization really mandatory for kids in school?\n\nHundreds of children in at least three provinces have contracted measles this spring. Some had to be hospitalized. This is in a country that was supposed to have eradicated the illness more than a decade ago. It’s indefensible.\n\nHow did it happen? Kids who weren’t immunized travelled to countries where people weren’t immunized, returned home and spread it to more kids who weren’t immunized.\n\nNow, the Ontario government has announced that three new vaccines will be “required” for schoolchildren – chickenpox, whooping cough and meningococcal disease. Students are already “required” to be immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, polio and diphtheria. Except they aren’t, really. Parents can opt out for religious or philosophical reasons.\n\nThink this is only measles? Just a rash? In severe cases, it can cause blindness, deafness, pneumonia, inflammation and swelling in the brain, brain damage and death. It still kills 122,000 people a year, mostly children, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThink vaccination is a personal choice? Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known. A person with the virus can spread it to 12 to 18 others who aren’t vaccinated. And some kids can’t be fully vaccinated because they’re too young, or their immune systems are compromised because, for example, they’re undergoing chemotherapy. But they will be protected if the rest of us are. A study of a measles outbreak in the Netherlands found that a person who is not vaccinated but lives in a community where most people are is better protected than someone who is vaccinated but lives in a community where many people aren’t. Individual rights don’t top the common good here. This is a social responsibility.\n\nBefore the measles vaccine was approved in Canada in 1963, almost every child got measles. About 5,000 ended up in a hospital; 50 to 75 died. Measles, whooping cough, diphtheria, Hib meningitis, polio – all have been dramatically reduced or almost disappeared because of vaccines. The WHO declared India, where there was an intense campaign to immunize against polio, free of the disease last month after three years with no new cases. But people in neighbouring Pakistan, where there is still suspicion of the vaccine, still die of polio. Smallpox once killed hundreds of millions of people; there have been no cases since 1977. Because of vaccines.\n\nIf there was a vaccine for cancer, would you get it?\n\nParents in some countries can only pray their kids will have access to immunization against some of these illnesses. In some poor or war-torn countries, parents move heaven and earth to get their kids inoculated.\n\nHere, some people still believe actress Jenny McCarthy, who says vaccines cause autism, over science.\n\nThe immunization rate for youth age 17 in Canada in 2011 was below 90 per cent for all but one (polio) of eight diseases. A rate of 95 percent is needed for herd immunity. In a report on the well being of children in rich countries by UNICEF in 2013, Canada ranked 17th of 29 countries, in part because of its immunization rates. It was one of three of the richest countries in the OECD whose vaccination rates were below 90 percent. Can we do better? The rate in Greece and Hungary was 99 percent.\n\nThe study noted the myth about vaccines and autism. But it continued: “This would not really be an ‘excuse’ for low coverage rates, as running a first class immunization (sic) programme means making sure that the public is well informed and that false information is not allowed to put children at risk.”\n\nHow to convince people?

Most were triggered by travelers who caught the virus abroad and spread it in the United States among unvaccinated people. Many of the travelers had been to the Philippines, where a recent measles epidemic has caused at least 20,000 illnesses.\n\nThe U.S. numbers remain relatively tiny, but officials are worried to see case counts growing.\n\nSince 2000, the highly contagious disease has been considered eliminated in the United States, aside from occasional small outbreaks sparked by overseas travelers. For most of the last decade, the nation was seeing only about 60 cases a year.\n\nBut since 2010, the average has been nearly 160.\n\n“This increase in cases may be a ‘new normal,’ unfortunately,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nContributing to the problem: Decades of measles vaccination campaigns have been so successful that many doctors have never seen a case, don’t realize how contagious it is, and may not take necessary steps to stop it from spreading.\n\nAmong the 58 cases reported from California, at least 11 were infected in doctor’s offices, hospitals or other health-care settings, according to a report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New York City health officials say two of their 26 cases were infected in medical facilities.\n\n“It’s a shock to younger physicians that their own waiting room or emergency room is where people can get measles,” said the CDC’s Dr. Anne Schuchat.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a medical journal — the Annals of Internal Medicine — released a commentary warning doctors to prevent that kind of situation.\n\n“We must ensure that our facilities do not become centers for secondary measles transmission,” wrote Dr. Julia Shaklee Sammons, an infectious disease specialist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nShe urged doctors who suspect a measles case to place the patient in an isolation room with special ventilation that keeps the air from circulating around the building. Doctors and nurses should also wear surgical masks or respirators to protect themselves from getting infected, and to ask the infected patient to wear a surgical mask too.\n\nThe measles virus spreads easily through the air, and in closed rooms. Infected droplets can linger for up to two hours after the sick person leaves.\n\nIt causes a fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. In rare cases, measles can be deadly, and is particularly dangerous for children. Infection can also cause pregnant women to have a miscarriage or premature birth.\n\nBefore a vaccine became available about 50 years ago, nearly all children got measles by their 15th birthday. In those days, nearly 500 Americans died from measles each year.\n\nA bad resurgence of measles hit the nation in 1989 to 1991, when 55,000 cases were reported. That flood of cases was blamed on a widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children.\n\nIn reaction, the federal government started a program in 1994 to pay for vaccines for kids who are uninsured, in the Medicaid program, or meet other criteria.\n\nIn a report released Thursday, CDC officials estimated that the program and other childhood vaccination efforts will prevent 322 million illnesses and 732,000 premature deaths over the course of the lifetimes of children born in the years 1994 through 2013.\n\nWrapped into that estimate are 71 million measles cases, nearly 9 million measles hospitalizations and 57,000 measles deaths.\n\nThere has been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003. “But the way we’re going, we feel it (another) is inevitable,” Schuchat said.\n\nToday, the measles vaccination rate is above 95 percent for children of kindergarten age. But there has been a small but growing trend of parents seeking exemptions for their children from school-entry vaccination requirements for religious or philosophical reasons. Other parents have tried to space out, or delay, measles vaccinations because of fears that the shot will trigger autism or other problems.\n\nMeasles outbreaks are more common in communities where such beliefs are more common, experts say. “It’s often concentrated there. Folks who think similarly tend to live in the same neighborhood or attend the same religious organization,” Schaffner said.\n\nThe CDC national tally may already be outdated. Also on Thursday, Ohio officials announced a new cluster of 13 suspected cases in rural Knox County. At least three traveled to the Philippines last month on a religious humanitarian mission.\n\nAbout 17 percent of U.S. cases this year were vaccinated.

162628,http://motherboard.vice.com/read/these-are-the-huge-societal-benefits-of-childhood-vaccination,health,"['Image: Shutterstock\n\nIn 1994, the United States, fresh off a measles epidemic, instituted the Vaccines for Children program to ensure that all children, regardless of income, could get vaccinated. The payoff? 731,700 lives over the past two decades.\n\nLet that sink in for a moment. In a report released today, the Centers for Disease Control says that the program, which is funded through Medicare and Medicaid, has had a staggering effect. You can see it in the vaccination rate alone: In the late 1980s, roughly 70 percent of children were vaccinated for common childhood illnesses—after the program was started, that number jumped well over 90 percent. Take a look:\n\nImage: CDC\n\nThe vaccines will prevent, according to the CDC,\n\n322 million illnesses\n\n21 million hospitalizations\n\n731,700 deaths\n\nThose reductions will save roughly $295 billion in direct hospitalization and other costs associated with disease and will save $1.38 trillion in total society costs, the organization says.\n\n“Economic analysis for 2009 alone found that each dollar invested in vaccines and administration, on average, resulted in $3 in direct benefits and $10 in benefits when societal costs are included,” the report concluded.\n\nNot to spike the football, or anything, but the report goes on to say that the limitations of the report mean that, if anything, these numbers are an underestimation: “First, the benefits of hepatitis A vaccine, annual childhood influenza vaccine, and adolescent vaccines were not included. Second, the model did not account for all indirect vaccine effects on disease burden; for some vaccines, reduced transmission to unvaccinated populations has been a powerful driver of cost-effectiveness.”\n\nTo be completely fair, the report notes that improved living conditions and other factors may have resulted in a reduction in total diphtheria cases.\n\nAnyways, if the numbers are to be believed, the United States’ vaccine program has been an immense success. The only thing threatening it has been a resurgence in the anti-vaccine crowd who are still clinging to the notion that vaccines could cause autism, a claim that has been wholly thrown out by science.\n\nOther anti-vaxxers believe that there’s a greater risk that one-in-a-million side effects will kill their children, rather than the disease itself. Unfortunately, that side has gained enough traction to cause some real harm—last year, there were 189 cases of measles in the United States, the second highest in the last 13 years and more than three times the average of 60 cases that the CDC says has been normal since measles was “eliminated” in 2000.\n\nIn any case, the goal of any vaccine campaign is to confer ""herd immunity"" to a community—that is, once enough people get vaccinated, enough people become immune to the disease to keep it completely out of any given population. Not vaccinating your kids directly impedes the achievement of that goal, and perhaps screws with your neighbor\'s kid who happened to not get a vaccination because of some extenuating circumstance.\n\nFinding out the true impact of the anti-vaccination movement is a bit tricky, because these things tend to take a while to show up in the numbers, but the anti-anti-vaxxing crowd (the pro-vaxxers?) says that 2007 is when people like Jenny McCarthy and other celebrities began speaking out against vaccines. These charts over here show some of the small increases in preventable diseases since then.\n\nUsing Google Trends to measure the popularity of anything is also a bit problematic, but it looks like people are searching for ""anti-vaccine"" with more regularity than ever.\n\nExpect the vaccination debate to continue, despite the clear benefits of widespread vaccination programs.', 'Image: ShutterstockIn 1994, the United States, fresh off a measles epidemic, instituted the Vaccines for Children program to ensure that all children, regardless of income, could get vaccinated.\nYou can see it in the vaccination rate alone: In the late 1980s, roughly 70 percent of children were vaccinated for common childhood illnesses—after the program was started, that number jumped well over 90 percent.\n“Economic analysis for 2009 alone found that each dollar invested in vaccines and administration, on average, resulted in $3 in direct benefits and $10 in benefits when societal costs are included,” the report concluded.\nAnyways, if the numbers are to be believed, the United States’ vaccine program has been an immense success.\nExpect the vaccination debate to continue, despite the clear benefits of widespread vaccination programs.']"

Visitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the U.S., potentially infecting those who cannot be vaccinated against the measles because they are too young, for example, or who have intentionally remained unvaccinated.\n\nAnother problem that may be contributing to the increase in cases is a lack of awareness among doctors.\n\n“Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features,” Dr. Julia Sammons writes in a commentary published Thursday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nMeasles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Symptoms usually include fever, cough and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal.\n\nThe last time there was a reported death from measles in the U.S. was in 2005, says Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Schuchat credits the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program with contributing to high immunization rates and the dramatic decrease of measles in the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., half of all children under 19 are eligible for the program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or caregivers can’t afford them.\n\nAccording to the CDC, vaccinations have proved to be very successful in the U.S., preventing an estimated 323 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths.

Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel.\n\nSchuchat says it’s absolutely crucial for measles vaccinations to be up to date.\n\nTo further reduce the spread of measles, the CDC also recommends that all U.S. residents born after 1956 ensure that they are still immune to measles or receive a new MMR vaccination, particularly if they expect to travel outside North or South America.', ': Measles cases at highest level in 20 years(CNN) — More people have been infected with measles in the United States during the first four months of this year than have been infected in the first four months of the past 18 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nIn the past 13 years, the average number of measles cases was nine per year.\nIn rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal.\nAccording to the CDC, vaccinations have proved to be very successful in the U.S., preventing an estimated 323 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths.\nSchuchat says it’s absolutely crucial for measles vaccinations to be up to date.']"

A total of 84% of these cases were a result of the patient not being vaccinated (or not knowing if they were vaccinated because the MMR vaccine is administered twice before the age of six).\n\nThe case for vaccines is strong. Between 1989 and 1991 there were 55,000 measles cases reported, mainly because uninsured children could not receive the MMR vaccine. Since then, measles has essentially been eliminated (barring the recent outbreaks) as described in this CDC documentation of measles report from 2012. In just a ten-year span, from 2001-2011, only a total of 904 measles cases were reported.\n\nNot only do vaccinations prevent deaths (see polio and meningitis), they also prevent hospital trips and help save an excessive amount of money that would otherwise be spent on unnecessary health care costs. The CDC weekly report found that from 1994-2013, immunization programs helped prevent 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations, and helped save over $1.38 trillion in ""societal"" costs, which incorporates $295 billion in medical costs.\n\nDuring the CDC\'s study period from 1993-2013, approximately 79 million children were born and all of them were saved from an average of four infectious diseases because of vaccinations.

The Lancet, which originally published his findings, retracted the article and apologized profusely for furthering his flawed “science.”\n\nThat hasn’t stopped Jenny McCarthy, who believes the MMR vaccine caused her son’s autism, from crusading against inoculations.\n\nThe high-school educated celebrity, best-known as a Playboy Playmate of the Year and co-host of the View, has also said chelation therapy cured her son of autism.\n\nHealth Minister Deb Matthews mentioned McCarthy by name and called it “outrageously irresponsible” for personalities like her to use their fame to advise against immunizing their kids.\n\nIt’s not likely the two sides — the scientific community versus the emotional opponents — will reach a consensus on this issue. But it doesn’t matter.\n\nIt only matters that Ontario, like so many other jurisdictions, understands how important it is to immunize our kids, and it’s doing the right thing by making the new vaccines mandatory.\n\nIt’s easy to forget how deadly childhood diseases can be, since they were virtually eradicated in North America decades ago. But every year more than 120,000 people around the globe die from measles. In B.C. alone, there are currently 320 cases; something that was unheard of when all responsible adults vaccinated their young charges.\n\nWith people travelling more and more, importing diseases into First World countries gets easier and easier.\n\nOntario is being proactive when it comes to protecting our kids, and we applaud the decision to increase the numbers of life-saving vaccinations they’ll receive.\n\n[pn_facebook_like /]', 'Indeed, the most accomplished physicians and researchers in the world have discounted a 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, who said the MMR vaccine — measles, mumps, rubella — caused autism.\nThe high-school educated celebrity, best-known as a Playboy Playmate of the Year and co-host of the View, has also said chelation therapy cured her son of autism.\nIt’s not likely the two sides — the scientific community versus the emotional opponents — will reach a consensus on this issue.\nIt’s easy to forget how deadly childhood diseases can be, since they were virtually eradicated in North America decades ago.\nOntario is being proactive when it comes to protecting our kids, and we applaud the decision to increase the numbers of life-saving vaccinations they’ll receive.']"

This has been the most documented cases in the United States since 1996.\n\nAlthough the spread of measles has been a global problem recently, perhaps a bigger concern is that a majority of those who were diagnosed in the U.S. were either not vaccinated or did not know if they were vaccinated. Sometimes a test is needed to see if someone needs revaccination. To be exact, the CDC says 84% of those infected fell under this category.\n\nSome parents refuse to get their children vaccinated, since celebrities in the news such as Jenny McCarthy and Kristin Cavallari stated that they are wary of vaccinations link to autism spectrum disorder. ASD in the United States has dramatically increased from 1 in 88 children to 1 in 68 children over the course of four years, which has led many to be concerned over whether vaccinations can be attributed to that.\n\nDespite that claim, previous studies have shown no such link, and medical experts and doctors urge parents to vaccinate their children. When a disease outbreak occurs in an urban area, the spread could be dangerously unprecedented because of the clusters of people in the city. California reported the most measles cases with 58 and many were in San Francisco, and New York reported 24 with all occurring in New York City.\n\nMany diseases such as measles are resurfacing due to the lack of vaccinations across the United States.

Health officials say 13 outbreaks and 129 cases have been recorded this year, according to the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nCalifornia is reporting the highest numbers, with 58 cases from January 1 to April 14. That’s the most cases of measles in the state since 1995. In the past 13 years, the average number of measles cases was nine per year.\n\nThe CDC says many of the California cases are a result of people visiting the Philippines, which is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20,000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation.\n\nVisitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the U.S., potentially infecting those who cannot be vaccinated against the measles because they are too young, for example, or who have intentionally remained unvaccinated.\n\nAnother problem that may be contributing to the increase in cases is a lack of awareness among doctors.\n\n“Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features,” Dr. Julia Sammons writes in a commentary published Thursday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nMeasles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Symptoms usually include fever, cough and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal.\n\nThe last time there was a reported death from measles in the U.S. was in 2005, says Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nSchuchat credits the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program with contributing to high immunization rates and the dramatic decrease of measles in the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., half of all children under 19 are eligible for the program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or caregivers can’t afford them.\n\nAccording to the CDC, vaccinations have proved to be very successful in the U.S., preventing an estimated 323 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths. Schuchat says it’s impossible to predict what the coming months will bring, but she thinks more people could die from measles.\n\n“Unfortunately, it’s probably just a matter a time.”\n\nThe CDC recommends that children get two doses of the measles vaccine beginning at 12 months, with the second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel.\n\nSchuchat says it’s absolutely crucial for measles vaccinations to be up to date.\n\nTo further reduce the spread of measles, the CDC also recommends that all U.S. residents born after 1956 ensure that they are still immune to measles or receive a new MMR vaccination, particularly if they expect to travel outside North or South America.', 'In the past 13 years, the average number of measles cases was nine per year.\n“Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features,” Dr. Julia Sammons writes in a commentary published Thursday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\nIn rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal.\nAccording to the CDC, vaccinations have proved to be very successful in the U.S., preventing an estimated 323 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths.\nSchuchat says it’s absolutely crucial for measles vaccinations to be up to date.']"

Most of the people sickened were not vaccinated, the CDC says.\n\nAlthough these outbreaks start outside the country, measles infection spreads rapidly among unvaccinated people, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said during an early afternoon press briefing.\n\n""Measles is still far too common in many parts of the world,"" he said. ""Globally, an estimated 20 million people get measles and 122,000 die from the disease each year.""\n\nTwenty years ago, the Vaccines for Children program was launched, providing free vaccines for families who can\'t afford to pay for them.\n\nThe program was a direct response to a measles outbreak that sickened more than 50,000 people and killed more than 100. This happened despite the availability of a measles vaccine since 1963, Frieden said.\n\n""This was a wake-up call and it impressed upon me how infectious measles is, because a single undiagnosed case in a hospital could result in dozens of secondary cases,"" he explained.\n\nThe program also saves money, Frieden said. Fewer hospitalizations and more lives saved will cut nearly $295 billion in direct costs and $1.38 trillion in total societal costs, estimates indicate.\n\nThe report was published in the April 25 issue of the CDC\'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\n\nDr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who also spoke at the news conference, said, ""Measles has gotten off to an early and active start this year.""\n\nThe 129 measles cases reported so far ""are the most measles cases reported in the first four months of the year since 1996,"" she said.\n\nIn 2013, there were 189 measles cases. In 2011, 220 people had measles -- the most since 1996, according to the CDC.\n\n""Today\'s measles outbreaks are too often the result of people opting out. Most of the people, 84 percent of those who were reported to have measles thus far, were not vaccinated or didn\'t know their vaccination status. Of the unvaccinated U.S. residents, 68 percent had personal belief exemptions,"" Schuchat said.\n\nAreas with the highest number of cases include California with 58, New York City with 24 and Washington state with 13, Schuchat said. Thirty-four of all the cases were imported, involving U.S. residents who traveled overseas and foreign visitors. Half of those importations were from the Philippines, where there were about 20,000 cases and 69 deaths as of February, she said.\n\nSchuchat noted that over the last 20 years, for measles alone, vaccination had prevented about 71 million cases and almost 9 million hospitalizations. ""It\'s extraordinary what we are able to achieve with vaccinating, compared with not vaccinating, she said.\n\nOne expert not involved with the report said that people forget how bad measles was before there was a vaccine.\n\n""Measles caused about 3 million cases a year in the United States before there was a vaccine in 1963,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n""It would cause 48,000 hospitalizations and about 500 deaths,"" Offit said. ""Nobody had to be convinced to get a measles vaccine.""\n\nNow measles is reappearing because people are making a choice not to get vaccinated, Offit said. ""They are choosing not to get it because they don\'t fear the disease,"" he said.\n\nOffit thinks this may be a natural outcome of a vaccine program. The disease is conquered, the disease is forgotten, people don\'t get vaccinated, and the disease comes back. ""This is just going to be the pattern until the sun burns out,"" he said.\n\nIt will take more measles hospitalizations and maybe a death or two to convince people not to opt out of vaccinating their children, Offit said. ""It has to get to a level of consciousness that you realize that not getting vaccinated means it might be you or your child who gets hospitalized or dies,"" he said.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the side effects of the vaccine are minor -- including pain and redness at the injection site, headache, fatigue or a vague feeling of discomfort -- all of which go away quickly.\n\nBecause measles is so contagious, the CDC recommends people of all ages keep up to date with their vaccinations. The agency recommends two doses of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine for everyone, starting at age 12 months. In addition, infants aged 6 through 11 months should receive one dose of MMR vaccine before traveling out of the country, the agency says.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about measles, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSOURCES: April 24, 2014, press briefing with Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H., director, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Anne Schuchat, M.D., director, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Paul Offit, M.D., chief, division of infectious diseases, Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia; April 25, 2014, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\n\nReader comments on this article are listed below.

The program helps make sure that kids don\'t miss recommended vaccines due to an inability to pay. It was created after an outbreak of 55,000 cases of measles between 1989 and 1991 that was attributed to ""widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children,"" according to the report.\n\nWhen VFC began, the program covered immunizations for nine diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (also known as whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b disease and hepatitis B. The program has since expanded to include vaccines for varicella (chickenpox), hepatitis A, flu, rotavirus and pneumococcal disease.\n\nTo quantify the benefits of the vaccination effort, researchers from the CDC\'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases compared vaccination rates in the 1994-2013 period (as measured by the National Health Interview Survey, or NHIS) with data from 1967-1985 (from the U.S. Immunization Survey) and from 1991-1993 (from NHIS).\n\nOver the entire lifetimes of the 78.6 million U.S. babies born in the first two decades of VFC, routine childhood vaccines will prevent an estimated 731,700 premature deaths, 21 million hospitalizations and 322 million illnesses, the researchers calculated. That works out to an average of 4.1 fewer illnesses per child and 0.27 fewer hospitalizations per child.

About half of all American children under age 18 qualify for the free vaccinations, according to Frieden, who called the program one of the nation’s most effective public-health interventions.\n\nUsing a model based on the 78.6 million children born between the program’s launch in 1994 and 2013, the CDC estimated the benefits of vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, haemophilus influenzae type b, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, hepatitis B, varicella, pneumococcal-related diseases and rotavirus.\n\nVaccine-preventable diseases, however, have not been eliminated in the U.S. Public health officials remain on alert in the wake of new reports of measles, mumps and pertussis outbreaks, and the small but continued presence of diseases such as chicken pox and rotavirus.\n\nIn fact, another CDC report published Thursday found that, as of April 18, 129 people from 13 states have been reported to have measles. Health officials say the outbreaks include 58 cases in California, 24 in New York, and 13 in Washington State.\n\n“This is the highest number of cases reported within the first four months of the year since 1996,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a news conference.\n\nPhysicians and other clinicians should be aware of measles symptoms and act swiftly to isolate infected patients, she said, because the disease can spread quickly in healthcare settings, especially to infants—children are typically vaccinated for measles at age 1.\n\nInternational travel is linked to many of the new measles cases. Thirty-four of the 129 measles cases reported in the U.S. involved Americans who traveled abroad or visitors from other countries. Many cases were related to travel to the Philippines, where there is currently a large measles outbreak.\n\nIndividuals who oppose receiving vaccinations are also increasingly problematic. Most of the measles cases reported this year involved patients who were not vaccinated, or did not know their vaccination status. Of those who were not vaccinated, 67% opted out due to personal beliefs.\n\n“Borders can\'t stop measles, but vaccinations can,"" Frieden said.\n\nEvery state requires children to be immunized by the time they enter school, but 18 states currently allow exemptions based on philosophical, personal or other beliefs, according to the National Vaccine Information Center, which provides an interactive map illustrating the laws in each state. Except for California, Mississippi and West Virginia, all other states allow religious exemptions. The number of parents choosing not to have their children vaccinated remains low, however, with less than 1% of toddlers receiving no vaccines at all, according to Schuchat.\n\nThe infrequency of vaccine-preventable diseases in the U.S. can be attributed to high-immunization rates and the rapid response of state health departments, she said, and she encouraged physicians not to let success lead to complacency.\n\nDespite celebrity and other anti-vaccine campaigns, “the most important influence on a parents’ decision is their clinician,” Schuchat said.\n\nFollow Sabriya Rice on Twitter: @MHSRice', '“This is an enormous impact,” said CDC Director, Dr. Tom Frieden, regarding the federal Vaccines for Children program, which has provided free vaccines to uninsured and underinsured U.S. children for the past 20 years.\nIn fact, another CDC report published Thursday found that, as of April 18, 129 people from 13 states have been reported to have measles.\nThirty-four of the 129 measles cases reported in the U.S. involved Americans who traveled abroad or visitors from other countries.\nMost of the measles cases reported this year involved patients who were not vaccinated, or did not know their vaccination status.\nThe number of parents choosing not to have their children vaccinated remains low, however, with less than 1% of toddlers receiving no vaccines at all, according to Schuchat.']"

Most were triggered by\n\nand spread it in the United States among unvaccinated people.

New York City health officials say two of their 26 cases were infected in medical facilities.\n\n""It\'s a shock to younger physicians that their own waiting room or emergency room is where people can get measles,"" said the CDC\'s Dr. Anne Schuchat.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a medical journal — the Annals of Internal Medicine — released a commentary warning doctors to prevent that kind of situation.\n\n""We must ensure that our facilities do not become centers for secondary measles transmission,"" wrote Dr. Julia Shaklee Sammons, an infectious disease specialist at the Children\'s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nShe urged doctors who suspect a measles case to place the patient in an isolation room with special ventilation that keeps the air from circulating around the building. Doctors and nurses should also wear surgical masks or respirators to protect themselves from getting infected, and to ask the infected patient to wear a surgical mask too.\n\nThe measles virus spreads easily through the air, and in closed rooms. Infected droplets can linger for up to two hours after the sick person leaves.\n\nIt causes a fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. In rare cases, measles can be deadly, and is particularly dangerous for children. Infection can also cause pregnant women to have a miscarriage or premature birth.\n\nBefore a vaccine became available about 50 years ago, nearly all children got measles by their 15th birthday. In those days, nearly 500 Americans died from measles each year.\n\nA bad resurgence of measles hit the nation in 1989 to 1991, when 55,000 cases were reported. That flood of cases was blamed on a widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children.\n\nIn reaction, the federal government started a program in 1994 to pay for vaccines for kids who are uninsured, in the Medicaid program, or meet other criteria.\n\nIn a\n\nreleased Thursday, CDC officials estimated that the program and other childhood vaccination efforts will prevent 322 million illnesses and 732,000 premature deaths over the course of the lifetimes of children born in the years 1994 through 2013.\n\nWrapped into that estimate are 71 million measles cases, nearly 9 million measles hospitalizations and 57,000 measles deaths.\n\nThere has been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003.

However, there has been a small but growing trend of parents seeking exemptions for their children from school-entry vaccination requirements for religious or philosophical reasons. Other parents have tried to space out, or delay, measles vaccinations because of fears that the shot will trigger autism or other problems.\n\nMeasles outbreaks are more common in communities where such beliefs are more common, experts say.

Despite the U.S. immunization program’s success, according to CDC officials, 129 people in the U.S. have been reported to have measles this year in 13 outbreaks, as of April 18.\n\nIn 1994, the Vaccines for Children program (VFC) was launched in direct response to a measles resurgence in the United States that caused tens of thousands of cases and over a hundred deaths, despite the availability of a measles vaccine since 1963. The VFC program provides vaccines to children whose parents or caregivers might otherwise be unable to afford them.\n\nThis year’s 20th anniversary of the VFC program’s implementation is occurring during an increase in measles cases in the U.S. In 2013, 189 Americans had measles. In 2011, 220 people in the U.S. were reported as having measles–the highest number of annual cases since 1996.\n\n“Thanks to the VFC program, children in our country are no longer at significant risk from diseases that once killed thousands each year,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “Current outbreaks of measles in the U.S. serve as a reminder that these diseases are only a plane ride away. Borders can’t stop measles, but vaccination can.”\n\nThe CDC reports 34 people, among the 129 cases this year, brought measles into the U.S. after being infected in other countries. Though not direct imports, most of the remaining cases are known to be linked to importations. Most people who reported having measles in 2014 were not vaccinated or did not know their vaccination status.\n\nBecause measles is a highly contagious disease, it can spread quickly among unvaccinated people. The CDC recommends people of all ages keep up to date with their vaccinations. CDC recommends two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine for everyone starting at age 12 months. Infants 6 through 11 months old should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine before international travel.\n\nFor children born during the VFC era, the U.S. immunization program continues to pay enormous benefits. According to analysis by the CDC, hospitalizations avoided and lives saved through vaccination will save nearly $295 billion in direct costs and $1.38 trillion in total societal costs. Parents can learn more about the VFC program at http://www.cdc.gov/features/vfcprogram/.\n\nApril 26th is the start of National Infant Immunization Week, which will bring together communities across the country in raising awareness about the importance immunization.

But Schuchat acknowledged that ""it\'s probably just a numbers game, probably just a matter of time until we have more."" One or two of every 1,000 cases of measles are fatal, according to the CDC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCalifornia, with 58 cases, has been hit hardest by one of the 13 separate outbreaks of measles in the United States. New York has seen 24 infections and Washington state has had 13.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that generally affects young children, causing fever, a runny nose, a cough and a distinctive rash all over the body. About one in 10 children also gets an ear infection and one in 20 comes down with pneumonia. A person with measles is contagious as long as four days before the symptoms are apparent, Schuchat said. Parents and even physicians who haven\'t seen measles in years may be unaware of the early warning signs, she said.\n\nIn the past 20 years, a concerted public health campaign, especially among lower-income families, has made measles outbreaks rare. The disease has been considered eradicated since 2000. But today, the number of unvaccinated children has begun to become a problem, Schuchat said. Some people are choosing not to have their children immunized for personal reasons and others are unaware of, or unable to get, vaccinations, before they arrive in the U.S. She said the CDC is also seeing growth in the disease pertussis, also known as whooping cough.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore vaccinations were available, about 500,000 people were infected with measles annually in the U.S., a number that fell to about 60 after the disease was all but eliminated in 2000. Since 2010, it has increased to an average of 155 cases per year.\n\nStill, she said, fewer than one percent of the toddlers in the United States have received no vaccines at all. ""Vaccinating your children is still a social norm in this country,"" she said.\n\nIn a telephone news conference Thursday, CDC Director Thomas Frieden lauded the Vaccines For Children program started in 1994, after a measles outbreak from 1989-1991 resulted in 55,000 cases, primarily because poor and uninsured children had not been immunized. Among children born in the following two decades, the CDC estimated, vaccinations prevented an estimated 322 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths, saving about $295 billion. The program provides free vaccinations for measles and 13 other diseases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut ""we can’t let our successes result in complacency,"" Frieden said. ""In fact measles, is very common in some parts of the world...An it travels fast."" He said 20 million people across the globe get the disease annually, and 122,000 of them die.\n\nIn a separate commentary Thursday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, epidemiologist Julia Shaklee Sammons warned that ""as more parents decline to vaccinate their children, measles incidence is increasing—a fact that alarms me both as a hospital epidemiologist and as a parent of a vulnerable infant too young to receive the measles vaccine."" When infected patients seek medical care, she noted, ""hospitals and clinics may inadvertently fuel transmission if those with measles are not rapidly triaged and isolated.""\n\nThe proportion of vaccinated children varies by state, depending on the toughness of their immunization laws, Sammons said. Nationally the measles, mumps, rubella vaccination rate is over 90 percent, but in 15 states it is below that standard, she wrote. New York magazine reported last month on schools in California and New York with low immunization rates among students, in part because parents are choosing not to vaccinate them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe CDC said that 54 of this year\'s 58 California cases were in some way associated with importation of the virus from abroad. Twenty-five of the people infected were not immunized--19 of them because of philosophical objections--and 18 more had no documentation of vaccinations.

Most were triggered by travelers who caught the virus abroad and spread it in the United States among unvaccinated people. Many of the travelers had been to the Philippines, where a recent measles epidemic has caused at least 20,000 illnesses.\n\nThe U.S. numbers remain relatively tiny, but officials are worried to see case counts growing.\n\nSince 2000, the highly contagious disease has been considered eliminated in the United States, aside from occasional small outbreaks sparked by overseas travelers. For most of the last decade, the nation was seeing only about 60 cases a year.\n\nBut since 2010, the average has been nearly 160.\n\n“This increase in cases may be a ‘new normal,’ unfortunately,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.\n\nContributing to the problem: Decades of measles vaccination campaigns have been so successful that many doctors have never seen a case, don’t realize how contagious it is, and may not take necessary steps to stop it from spreading.\n\nAmong the 58 cases reported from California, at least 11 were infected in doctor’s offices, hospitals or other health-care settings, according to a report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New York City health officials say two of their 26 cases were infected in medical facilities.\n\n“It’s a shock to younger physicians that their own waiting room or emergency room is where people can get measles,” said the CDC’s Dr. Anne Schuchat.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a medical journal — the Annals of Internal Medicine — released a commentary warning doctors to prevent that kind of situation.\n\n“We must ensure that our facilities do not become centers for secondary measles transmission,” wrote Dr. Julia Shaklee Sammons, an infectious disease specialist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nShe urged doctors who suspect a measles case to place the patient in an isolation room with special ventilation that keeps the air from circulating around the building. Doctors and nurses should also wear surgical masks or respirators to protect themselves from getting infected, and to ask the infected patient to wear a surgical mask too.\n\nThe measles virus spreads easily through the air, and in closed rooms. Infected droplets can linger for up to two hours after the sick person leaves.\n\nIt causes a fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. In rare cases, measles can be deadly, and is particularly dangerous for children. Infection can also cause pregnant women to have a miscarriage or premature birth.\n\nBefore a vaccine became available about 50 years ago, nearly all children got measles by their 15th birthday. In those days, nearly 500 Americans died from measles each year.\n\nA bad resurgence of measles hit the nation in 1989 to 1991, when 55,000 cases were reported. That flood of cases was blamed on a widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children.\n\nIn reaction, the federal government started a program in 1994 to pay for vaccines for kids who are uninsured, in the Medicaid program, or meet other criteria.\n\nIn a report released Thursday, CDC officials estimated that the program and other childhood vaccination efforts will prevent 322 million illnesses and 732,000 premature deaths over the course of the lifetimes of children born in the years 1994 through 2013.\n\nWrapped into that estimate are 71 million measles cases, nearly 9 million measles hospitalizations and 57,000 measles deaths.\n\nThere has been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003. “But the way we’re going, we feel it (another) is inevitable,” Schuchat said.\n\nToday, the measles vaccination rate is above 95 percent for children of kindergarten age. But there has been a small but growing trend of parents seeking exemptions for their children from school-entry vaccination requirements for religious or philosophical reasons. Other parents have tried to space out, or delay, measles vaccinations because of fears that the shot will trigger autism or other problems.\n\nMeasles outbreaks are more common in communities where such beliefs are more common, experts say. “It’s often concentrated there. Folks who think similarly tend to live in the same neighborhood or attend the same religious organization,” Schaffner said.\n\nThe CDC national tally may already be outdated. Also on Thursday, Ohio officials announced a new cluster of 13 suspected cases in rural Knox County.

Congress funded the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provided free vaccinations to kids on Medicaid and those without insurance.\n\nIn the twenty years since the VFC’s 1994 implementation, The CDC estimates in a report released Thursday that for the 78.6 million children born since 1994, the country’s immunization program has prevented 322 million illnesses (roughly four per child) and 21 million hospitalizations, and saved 732,000 lives. Vaccinations, the agency reports, have also saved the U.S. $295 billion in direct costs and $1.38 trillion in total societal costs. The vaccine program stopped 70 million cases of measles alone.\n\nThe findings should be a reminder of the ongoing threat of disease and should serve as a wake up call for parents for the importance of childhood vaccinations, CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a call with reporters.\n\nTo come up with their estimate of coverage and impact in the post-VFC era, researchers used data on children aged 19 to 35 months from several nationwide surveys that relied on both parental recollection of vaccines and provider reports.\n\nIn addition to the success of the original program, the CDC report notes that the five new vaccines that were added to the routine infant schedule since 1995—varicella, hepatitis A, pneumococcal disease, influenza, and rotavirus—have increased the number of diseases prevented to 14.\n\nVaccination coverage has remained near or above 90% for most vaccines, but measles has gotten off to an early and active start this year; 129 cases have been reported from 13 states—the most reported in the first four months since 1996. California (58), New York City (24), and Washington state (13) have seen the majority of outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases.\n\nThe 90s outbreak was a result of poor people missing out on vaccines. Today’s outbreaks “are the result of opting out,” Assistant Surgeon General, Dr. Anne Schuchat said on the call. She noted 84 percent of the recent cases were not vaccinated or didn’t know their status. Of the unvaccinated, 68 percent had personal belief exemptions or opted out.\n\nThe most at risk from measles, she noted, are infants too young to be vaccinated. “We need clinicians and parents to do their part,” she said.\n\nSchuchat also commented on celebrities like Jenny McCarthy and Kristin Cavallari who have been vocal in their vaccine skepticism.\n\n“Celebrities do get a lot of attention, but the most important influence are their clinicians,” she said. With less than one percent of toddlers receiving no immunizations, she said, “vaccinating your children is still a social norm in this country and we think that’s a good thing.”', 'Congress funded the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, which provided free vaccinations to kids on Medicaid and those without insurance.\nIn the twenty years since the VFC’s 1994 implementation, The CDC estimates in a report released Thursday that for the 78.6 million children born since 1994, the country’s immunization program has prevented 322 million illnesses (roughly four per child) and 21 million hospitalizations, and saved 732,000 lives.\nVaccinations, the agency reports, have also saved the U.S. $295 billion in direct costs and $1.38 trillion in total societal costs.\nThe vaccine program stopped 70 million cases of measles alone.\nSchuchat also commented on celebrities like Jenny McCarthy and Kristin Cavallari who have been vocal in their vaccine skepticism.']"

The Philippines reported its first case of the MERS virus in the past two weeks. Credit:AP Neighbouring countries, as well as those whose nationals make up Saudi Arabia’s large foreign workforce, are growing increasingly worried about the kingdom’s apparent slow response to the virus. Malaysia, Greece, Yemen and the Philippines all reported their first cases of the virus in the past two weeks - all the sufferers had been working or travelling in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health reported 14 new cases on Wednesday and Thursday alone, as well as four deaths among previously notified patients. This brings the Saudi total to 299 cases and 87 deaths since the virus was first recognised in 2012, the ministry said on its website on Thursday. Internationally, about one-third of those affected have died. The total number of confirmed infections worldwide is 345, with 107 deaths, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Sweden reported on Thursday. The bulk of these infections are in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nA significant outbreak of the virus occurred in Saudi Arabia\'s business hub of Jeddah in the past week. Credit:AFP “Approximately 75 per cent of the recently reported cases ... have acquired the infection from another case through human-to-human transmission,” World Health Organisation regional director for the Eastern Mediterranean Ala Alwan said in Cairo. “The majority of these secondary cases have been infected within the healthcare setting and are mainly healthcare workers, although several patients are also considered to have been infected with MERS-CoV while in hospital for other reasons.” Saudi Arabia has fired Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabiah. Credit:Reuters It took more than two years to reach the first 100 cases of MERS, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\n“Now, in just the past two weeks, we’ve had 100 cases … There’s a major change occurring that cannot just be attributed to better case detection,"" he said. “When humans readily transmit to humans, that’s what will cause a worldwide outbreak. We are very concerned that … with what we’ve seen over the past two weeks … we may be at that point now.” Saudi Arabia is expected to receive a surge of Muslim pilgrims in July during the annual fasting month of Ramadan, followed by millions more in early October for the Haj. But instead of openly stepping up its infection-control procedures and announcing other public health measures, Saudi Arabia has fired its Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabiah. Adel Fakieh, the Minister of Labour who is now acting Health Minister, this week promised ""transparency and to promptly provide the media and society with the information needed"" on the virus after visiting the Jeddah hospital where the latest cluster of cases occurred. MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that includes both the common cold and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) that killed more than 800 people in a global outbreak in 2003. Its symptoms can include fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure, experts say. A lack of “basic epidemiological detective work” meant the biology of the virus, how it is transmitted and whether there is a seasonal element to its spread, had yet to be confirmed, warned Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA recent study said the virus has been ""extraordinarily common"" in camels for at least 20 years, indicating it may have been passed from camels to humans, but even this hypothesis left many unanswered questions, Ms Garrett said. “You have to be able to explain why all those people in the camel racing business and the camel auctioning and breeding business are not infected. “Camel milk is a staple in Saudi Arabia - millions of people drink the milk throughout the Emirates and the Persian Gulf - and yet we do not see MERS in the kind of numbers you’d expect from that kind of exposure.” Given the “dramatic surge in infections in the past six days”, it is time for Saudi Arabia to do more than just sack its health minister, she said, and start taking the steps that really do save lives, starting with much more aggressive infection control procedures in its hospitals.', 'The Philippines reported its first case of the MERS virus in the past two weeks.\nMalaysia, Greece, Yemen and the Philippines all reported their first cases of the virus in the past two weeks - all the sufferers had been working or travelling in Saudi Arabia.\nThe Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health reported 14 new cases on Wednesday and Thursday alone, as well as four deaths among previously notified patients.\nThe bulk of these infections are in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\nBut instead of openly stepping up its infection-control procedures and announcing other public health measures, Saudi Arabia has fired its Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabiah.']"

MERS-CoV is an infectious disease with no known cure and is considered more deadly than SARS--which killed some 800 people during a 2002-2003 outbreak that first started in China. Since 2012, 83 people have died and 285 people have contracted the virus in the Kingdom alone. It has spread to the neighboring United Arab Emirates.

The minister said he didn’t know why the case count had spiked but maybe it was seasonal. He said he didn’t think it necessary to change preventive measures and insisted that authorities were taking all due precautions.\n\nOn Monday, he was fired by King Abdullah. This was a rare public acknowledgment that all is not well. In recent days, the number of people infected has continued to rise. The number of cases in the first third of this year is the same as in all of 2012 and 2013 combined, according to virologist Ian M. Mackay at the University of Queensland in Australia. Most of the cases, but not all, have been in Saudi Arabia. No antiviral or vaccine is known to be effective against the virus, which has killed about one-third of those who have become infected.\n\nThe new, acting Saudi health minister, Adel Faqih, immediately struck a different tone. He visited a hospital in Jiddah that has been the epicenter of an outbreak this month and pledged to adhere to “the principles of transparency and disclosure.” For Saudi Arabia, this could be a turning point — none too soon — or it could be another rhetorical flourish. For the sake of global public health, let’s hope that Mr. Faqih means what he says.\n\nSaudi Arabia has a largely closed society, one that won’t be easy to change. Reports about infections have lacked details, and the kingdom does not encourage a free press to poke around. Major uncertainties about the MERS virus persist, including how it spreads, whether it has efficiently begun human-to-human transmission and whether its genetic makeup has evolved. The Saudis must throw open their doors to international scientific inquiry. They are reportedly consulting experts from Germany, Great Britain, the United States and France. We recommend to Saudi leaders the experience of China, which learned painfully in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic a decade ago about the high costs of secrecy to human health and welfare.\n\nThe World Health Organization reaffirmed Wednesday that “critical information gaps remain” about transmission of the MERS virus and the route of infection. In the recent surge, the WHO estimated that 75 percent of the cases are secondary, meaning that the person was infected by contact with another human, mostly health-care workers and people already in the hospital. That 75 percent estimate is extremely worrisome because it suggests that the virus may be gaining traction in moving from person to person, a prerequisite for a pandemic.\n\nThe Saudi king is custodian of the holy sites at Mecca and Medina. Now he also is custodian of a major health crisis. During Ramadan in July and the hajj in October, millions of people will make pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia from around the world. For everyone’s safety and well-being, there must be a move to clarity, cooperation and transparency. Even if MERS does not reach pandemic scale, it must be confronted as if it could.', 'The new, acting Saudi health minister, Adel Faqih, immediately struck a different tone.\nSaudi Arabia has a largely closed society, one that won’t be easy to change.\nMajor uncertainties about the MERS virus persist, including how it spreads, whether it has efficiently begun human-to-human transmission and whether its genetic makeup has evolved.\nThe World Health Organization reaffirmed Wednesday that “critical information gaps remain” about transmission of the MERS virus and the route of infection.\nDuring Ramadan in July and the hajj in October, millions of people will make pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia from around the world.']"

In just shy of a month since then, the official number of cases that WHO is reporting (as of April 24) has jumped to 254, with a total of 93 deaths.\n\nHowever, since WHO depends on nations supplying them with official numbers, their totals often lag behind what\'s actually happening. This is especially true in this case, as Saudi Arabia — where the first cases of MERS showed up and the most cases have been reported — has shown a persistent reluctance to cooperate with requests for reports.\n\nAs of Tuesday, April 22, The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has reported a total of 333 cases, with 107 deaths, but this very likely doesn\'t include the latest WHO additions to their numbers from Wednesday and Thursday. Adding up all reports from all affected countries apparently puts the totals at 360 cases, including 109 deaths.\n\n[ Related: WHO concerned by sharp rise in MERS cases; 75 per of recent cases human spread ]\n\nIt\'s this recent surge in numbers that\'s causing the concern. Over 160 cases in just one month, compared to 200 or so cases in the 23 months before that, implies that something\'s going on. According to Science magazine, it\'s possible that there\'s a problem with contaminated samples, so that cases are being over-reported. WHO is stating that it could be due to inadequate prevention and control measures in health care centres (where most of the new cases are popping up). Other possibilities they mention are that mild cases have been missed up until now, but are being caught in further screening, and perhaps more ominously, there\'s also a chance that the virus has mutated into a form that\'s easier to transmit, similar to its \'cousin\' SARS — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.\n\nHowever, Ziad Memish, the deputy minister of Saudi Arabia\'s Health Ministry said that it\'s simply because more people are requesting to be tested.\n\n""In the last 2 years we tested 20,000 people,"" he said, according to Science. ""Just in the last weeks, we tested 5,000 people.""\n\nA press release from WHO is urging nations to be vigilant about potential cases, as 75 per cent of those recently reported are from human-to-human transmission, which is a bit more than usual. The majority of cases have been in health care workers and those visiting health care facilities, most of which show little or no symptoms. It\'s still not known exactly how it\'s being transmitted between people.\n\nAlthough MERS is certainly a more lethal relative of SARS — killing 30 per cent of those infected so far, compared to the 10 per cent of infected that SARS killed in 2003-2004 — there\'s at least one key difference between the two that will limit the ability of MERS to become a pandemic.\n\n[ More Geekquinox: Iceberg six times the size of Manhattan breaks off from Antarctica ]\n\nJason Tetro, over at Popular Science, has an excellent article explaining this, but basically, SARS spread so easily in 2003-2004 because it has two stages of infection. Early in the first stage, which can last for several days, the infected person shows no symptoms at all while the virus incubates inside their body. As stage one progresses, they start to show symptoms, but they can still move about and interact with others, they just feel like they have a bad cold or the flu. They\'re most certainly contagious at this point, although they may be before that as well, and any cough or sneeze can spread the virus, which can live for up to six hours outside the body. It\'s only when stage two of the infection sets in that the person needs to be hospitalized. So, that gives a lot of time for the infected person to come into contact with many other people.\n\nMERS, on the other hand, has only one stage of infection. When a person becomes infected, they need immediate medical attention, so there\'s far less opportunity for the virus to be transmitted.\n\nStory continues', ""[ Related: WHO concerned by sharp rise in MERS cases; 75 per of recent cases human spread ]It's this recent surge in numbers that's causing the concern.\nOver 160 cases in just one month, compared to 200 or so cases in the 23 months before that, implies that something's going on.\nAccording to Science magazine, it's possible that there's a problem with contaminated samples, so that cases are being over-reported.\nSo, that gives a lot of time for the infected person to come into contact with many other people.\nWhen a person becomes infected, they need immediate medical attention, so there's far less opportunity for the virus to be transmitted.""]"

The country dismissed their health minister Abdullah al-Rabiah earlier this week and now Labour Minister Adel Fakieh has taken over the position.\n\nAfter the mishaps this week, Fakieh promised ""transparency and to promptly provide the media and society with the information needed"" on MERS because international health officials complained that al-Rabiah was not releasing any information regarding the virus and its potential mutation based on the recent cases, Time Magazine reports.\n\nHealth officials are concerned over the timeliness of the outbreak because later this year millions of Muslims will be traveling to Mecca for Hajj, the annual Islamic pilgrimage that is the largest gathering of Muslim people in the world. And the symptoms of MERS aren\'t very serious: fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These common symptoms would most likely not prevent someone from participating in the largest annual Muslim gathering, which could further spread the disease in an unprecedented manner.\n\nThere are already more confirmed cases this year in Saudi Arabia than in all of 2013. Researchers and medical experts believe that the virus could be mutating, which would explain the spike in cases.

The recent spike in cases is alarming.\n\nThe first confirmed cases of MERS in humans - scientists believe it jumped from camels - were reported in 2012. In 2013, and it seems again this year, cases of the disease peaked in March/April. But this year\'s outbreak seems more severe.\n\n""It took two years since those first cases for the global tally to hit the 200 mark. That happened in late March [2014],"" Helen Branswell explains. ""Now the combined total announced by the WHO and affected countries is over 360 cases."" There have been 80 new cases in Saudi Arabia in the last week alone, Branswell reports.\n\n2. We don\'t know exactly how many people are infected.\n\nBranswell came to the 360 number by adding up all officially reported cases, but the number of cases confirmed by the World Health Organization is still just 254, with 50 in the last week. There is some lag in the WHO\'s numbers given their process to confirm diagnoses that have been reported by individual countries. Saudi Arabia, for example, reports 297 cases in their country alone.\n\nFurthermore, these are just the severe cases - some people may be asymptomatic, and some symptoms may be so mild that they are not reported. Still, even the most conservative estimates show a significant jump in the number of cases in the past month and the past week.\n\n3. MERS is considered a more deadly but less contagious cousin of SARS.\n\nLike SARS, MERS is caused by a coronavirus - a class of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses of varying severity and, under a microscope, look like they have spiky crowns . SARS killed less than 10% of the estimated 8,000 people infected ; MERS has killed about 30% of those with confirmed infections, although those whose health is already compromised seem more likely to be infected.\n\nMERS starts out a bit like a cold, but can escalate into pneumonia, organ failure, and death. The onset of MERS is faster than SARS and generally requires closer contact to be transmitted. In the past, MERS has appeared to be easier than SARS to contain and fight off (for healthy people).\n\n""While MERS is a bad actor, it is no SARS and most likely will not cause a pandemic,"" writes microbiologist Jason Tetro at Popular Science.\n\n4. MERS might be more contagious now than in previous years.\n\nScientists suspect (but don\'t yet know for sure) that MERS cases in humans tend to come from contact with camels. But the WHO reports that as many as 75% of the recent cases have been transmitted from human-to-human, generally in hospital settings.\n\n""There\'s a major change occurring that cannot just be attributed to better case detection,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told NPR. ""Something\'s happening.""\n\nThis could be because the virus has changed into something more contagious, or because methods of infection control have been inadequate.\n\nFortunately, it seems that while infected person A can spread MERS to person B, person B is highly unlikely to then be contagious enough to spread it further, say to person C. There have only been two such cases of this so-called ""tertiary"" transmission so far.\n\nStill, because the virus seems to be spreading between humans more than it did in the past, the WHO is on alert: ""Urgent investigations are required to better understand the transmission pattern of this virus.""\n\n5. MERS will continue to spread beyond the Middle East.\n\nThe recent spike in cases is primarily in Saudi Arabia (especially in Jeddah) and the UAE, but - as with other recent outbreaks - it is expected to spread beyond those countries. ""The spike in cases, especially among health care workers, could be a signal that the virus has reached a tipping point and could be ready to spread out of the region,"" NPR reports\n\nSince 2012, MERS has been confirmed in Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the United Kingdom, Tunisia, Malaysia and the Philippines.\n\nCases that have been ""exported"" from the current outbreak centered in Saudi Arabia have not spread beyond the infected travelers, but MERS will probably crop up in more far-flung places soon.\n\n""It is very likely that cases will continue to be exported to other countries,"" WHO predicts. ""Whether these cases will [spread further] will depend of the capacity of the receiving country to rapidly detect, diagnose and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures.""', ""The first confirmed cases of MERS in humans - scientists believe it jumped from camels - were reported in 2012.\nThere have been 80 new cases in Saudi Arabia in the last week alone, Branswell reports.\nSaudi Arabia, for example, reports 297 cases in their country alone.\nLike SARS, MERS is caused by a coronavirus - a class of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses of varying severity and, under a microscope, look like they have spiky crowns .\nScientists suspect (but don't yet know for sure) that MERS cases in humans tend to come from contact with camels.""]"

162732,http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/04/soaring-mers-cases-cause-pandemic-jitters-causes-are-unclear,health,"['A sharp increase in infections with a deadly new virus in the Middle East is alarming public health officials around the world. The rising numbers have raised fresh fears that the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus has adapted and is becoming more easily transmissible between humans, which could result in global spread. But preliminary research has not shown any evidence of genetic changes, and the government of Saudi Arabia, where most of the new cases occur, says the sudden upswing is mostly the result of more widespread testing.\n\nThe MERS virus is related to the SARS virus, which spread around the world in 2003 and killed almost 800 people. Since MERS was discovered in 2012, there has been a steady trickle of cases, the vast majority of them in Saudi Arabia. By late March, the World Health Organization (WHO) had counted 199 cases worldwide, including 84 deaths.\n\nBut in the past few weeks, the numbers have shot up. Saudi Arabia is announcing new cases almost every day, most of them in Jeddah, a city in the western part of the country. Yesterday alone, the kingdom reported 24 new cases; another 12 were reported today. (WHO is waiting for official reporting of the cases, but the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control now says the total is 333 cases, including 107 deaths.) Amid increasing worries in the public and intensifying media coverage, Saudi Arabia\'s minister of health was replaced on Monday. WHO issued a press release yesterday saying it was ""concerned about the rising number of cases."" ""WHO urges all Member States to remain vigilant and enhance surveillance to detect any early sign that the virus has changed and has attained the possibilities of causing sustained person-to-person transmission,"" the statement read.\n\n""It is really important to understand now what is going on in Jeddah,"" says Marion Koopmans of Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. One possible explanation, she says, is that the lab doing the tests has a contamination problem, leading to false positives.\n\nSaudi Deputy Minister of Health Ziad Memish, an infectious disease specialist, says the explanation is quite simple. Until recently, in accordance with WHO recommendations, only patients with pneumonia who needed intensive care were tested for the MERS virus, he says. But as anxiety about MERS increased, patients with milder symptoms like fever or a cough started demanding to be tested, he says, and doctors in Jeddah have complied. ""In the last 2 years we tested 20,000 people,"" Memish says. ""Just in the last weeks, we tested 5000 people."" As a result, more mild cases are being picked up, he says, but that does not mean MERS is about to go global.\n\nNonetheless, studies are under way to test whether the virus has undergone genetic changes. On Friday, virologist Christian Drosten of the University of Bonn in Germany, who is collaborating with Memish, received 31 fresh samples from patients in Jeddah. The scientists isolated MERS virus RNA from all but one of the samples they received, suggesting that contamination isn\'t the problem.\n\nDrosten has sequenced part of the gene for the so-called spike protein, which sits on the viral surface, from all 30 viruses. They appear to be identical to each other and to several older MERS viruses that have been sequenced. ""There seems to be nothing special about this virus, at least in this region of the genome,"" he says. The researchers are now sequencing the whole genome for some of the viruses and they may still find significant changes, although Drosten doubts that they will.\n\nThe variety found between the 30 genomes may also give clues about what is going on. If the viral genomes from different patients are more or less identical, that suggests a new, more successful strain is breaking out; if the genomes are more diverse, the increase is more likely to be an artifact due to more testing. The fragment sequenced so far does not give a clear answer, because a number of different MERS strains are identical in that part of the genome. ""But hopefully we will know in a few days,"" Drosten says.\n\nMeanwhile, Drosten says a seasonal effect may also explain part of the current rise in cases. In breeding facilities across the Middle East, camels, an important reservoir for MERS, have given birth the past 2 months; scientists believe their young may become infected very early on, causing virus levels to explode and increasing the risk for humans to become exposed.\n\nMemish agrees that there seems to be some seasonality in how MERS strikes humans: The first known human cases were from a cluster in Jordan in April 2012, he says, last year in April an outbreak struck four hospitals in the Al Hasa area in Saudi Arabia, and now there is a cluster of cases in Jeddah. ""It certainly seems that April and May are bad months for MERS.""', ""The rising numbers have raised fresh fears that the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus has adapted and is becoming more easily transmissible between humans, which could result in global spread.\nThe MERS virus is related to the SARS virus, which spread around the world in 2003 and killed almost 800 people.\nSince MERS was discovered in 2012, there has been a steady trickle of cases, the vast majority of them in Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia is announcing new cases almost every day, most of them in Jeddah, a city in the western part of the country.\nThe scientists isolated MERS virus RNA from all but one of the samples they received, suggesting that contamination isn't the problem.""]"

The illnesses involved 132 people in 31 states, and most were children aged five and younger. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services first reported the outbreak last Jan. 22. The Wisconsin cluster dated back to 2012, and exposure to pet reptiles was common to a high proportion of those cases. Bearded dragons are pet lizards native to Australia that come in a variety of colors. The break came when Emilio DeBess, an Oregon epidemiologist, visited the home of a sick baby and took samples from a pair of bearded dragons and their surrounding environment. All but one turned up positive for the rare Cotham strain involved in the outbreak. Health officials from other states quickly made the same match. No deaths are associated with the outbreak, but CDC reports that 42 percent of those ill with Salmonella Cotham have required hospitalization. Cases where the illness onset was on or before April 21, 2014, are included in the count. Some of the cases are resistant to ceftriaxone, an antibiotic often used to treat Salmonella infections. State and federal health officials say anyone dealing with reptiles should wash their hands frequently, and small children, whose immune systems are not fully developed, should not handle them. The 132 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Cotham have been reported from 31 states since Feb. 21, 2012. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows (listed in alphabetical order): Arizona (4), California (21), Colorado (2), Florida (3), Georgia (1), Idaho (3), Illinois (6), Kansas (6), Kentucky (4), Maryland (3), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (5), Minnesota (3), Missouri (7), Nebraska (1), Nevada (3), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (3), New York (10), North Carolina (2), Ohio (1), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania (5), South Carolina (1), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (5), Texas (6), Utah (3), Virginia (3), Washington (4) and Wisconsin (12).

The lizards are popular pets that come in different colors.\n\nInvestigators are using PulseNet, a national subtyping network designed to detect infections that may be part of an outbreak, to identify additional illnesses. Most of the affected states are reporting just a few cases so far (see CDC map below), with three states reporting double-digit numbers: California (21), New York (10), and Wisconsin (12).\n\nThe CDC said the strain is a rare serotype that has accounted for only 0.01% of human isolates in the United States since 1963. Prior to the outbreak, less than 25 Salmonella Cotham isolates are reported to PulseNet each year.\n\nThough patient ages range from younger than 1 year to 79, children younger than age 5 make up 58% of those sickened in the outbreak. Among 67 patients with available information, 42% were hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported. The latest illness-onset date was Apr 1.\n\nEpidemiologic investigation\n\nAfter Wisconsin health officials reported the state's cluster to federal health officials and infections emerged in other states through PulseNet, the CDC sent a questionnaire to states to learn more about contact sick patients had with reptiles and food they may have eaten the week before they became ill.\n\nOf 31 surveys the CDC received back, 27 people (87%) reported contact with reptiles or their environments, a dramatically higher percentage than the 5.6% of American households that own reptiles.

Nearly 60 percent have been children, and over 40 percent have been hospitalized.\n\nOregon scientists cracked the case after a baby in Marion County got sick. Emilio DeBess, a Public Health Division epidemiologist, decided to investigate. Taking time on his lunch hour in early April, he visited the home and collected nine samples, swabbing two bearded dragons and the surrounding environment. Eight samples turned up positive for the rare strain involved in the outbreak.\n\nDeBess said the baby, who is less than 1 years old, had no contact with the reptiles, which are kept by the parents. The baby was not even allowed in the same room.\n\nThe case illustrates the importance of thorough hand washing after handling the animals and sanitizing surfaces that children might touch, he said.\n\nOnce DeBess had nailed the case, other health officials investigated and discovered a similar link between patients, bearded dragons and the salmonella strain. DeBess, the state public health veterinarian with a long experience with harmful pathogens related to reptiles and rodents, suspected bearded dragons might be the cause following a case in Oregon in July in which a 20-year-old came down with the same strain after he handled the creatures at a friend\'s house.

DeBess said that\'s alarming.\n\n""When people are hospitalized (in this case), they have to be treated with antibiotics,"" DeBess said. ""But with a drug resistance, it will limit the success of hospital treatment and that\'s very concerning.""\n\nBearded dragons come in a variety of colors and are popular with children. But like all reptiles, they often carry salmonella. Though the contaminated creatures were purchased at different stores across the country, there are a few suppliers in the U.S., DeBess said. The CDC is doing a traceback investigation to pinpoint the exact source. The bearded dragons in Marion County were purchased at a Salem area pet store.\n\nChildren, which have developing immune systems, should be kept away from reptiles, DeBess said.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.\n\nOn January 22, 2014, CDC was notified by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services of a cluster of Salmonella Cotham infections with a high proportion of ill persons reporting exposure to pet reptiles. Since 2012, there have been 12 ill persons infected with Salmonella Cotham in Wisconsin, and 10 (83%) of 12 persons reported contact with pet bearded dragons. Wisconsin receives funding under the CDC FoodCORE (Foodborne Diseases Centers for Outbreak Response Enhancement) program. These centers work together to develop new and better methods to detect, investigate, respond to, and control multistate outbreaks of foodborne diseases.\n\nSalmonella Cotham is a rare serotype. Searching historical Salmonella databases, CDC determined that Salmonella Cotham represents only 0.01% of all human isolates in the United States since 1963. Before this outbreak, typically less than 25 Salmonella Cotham infections were reported to PulseNet annually. Given the rarity of the Cotham serotype and the information gathered by Wisconsin, CDC conducted a search of PulseNet for all Salmonella Cotham infections reported since 2012.\n\nAs of April 21, 2014, a total of 132 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Cotham have been reported from 31 states since February 21, 2012.

Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 79 years, with a median age of 2 years. Fifty-eight percent of ill persons are children 5 years of age or younger. Fifty-one percent of ill persons are female. Among 67 ill persons with available information, 28 (42%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.\n\nOn March 25, 2014, CDC sent a questionnaire to the states involved in the investigation to obtain more detailed information from ill persons about recent contact with reptiles. In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. To date, CDC has received a total of 31 completed questionnaires. Twenty-seven (87%) of 31 persons interviewed reported contact with reptiles or their environments before becoming ill. When asked about the type of reptile, 25 (81%) of 31 persons reported contact with lizards; of these 25 persons, 21 (84%) specifically reported contact with bearded dragons, a type of lizard.

He said marijuana could provide relief for his nausea without the side effects of other medications, yet it can still only be purchased illegally in Massachusetts 17 months after voters overwhelmingly approved its sale for medical purposes.\n\nPatients with cancer, multiple sclerosis, and other debilitating conditions complained Thursday that they are suffering because of the state’s delayed review of medical marijuana dispensaries and urged Governor Deval Patrick to accelerate the licensing process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“So why isn’t it available?” said Weiner, who gathered with the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance and more than a dozen other patients, many in wheelchairs. “Have victims of illness fallen prey to political wrangling?”\n\nThe group delivered a letter to the governor, urging him to intervene in the dispensary licensing process. Concerns about the accuracy of claims made by some of the applicants has delayed the awarding of preliminary licenses, raising questions about whether state health officials can meet their goal of getting facilities open this summer.\n\nVoters approved a November 2012 ballot initiative legalizing marijuana for medical treatment, allowing the state to approve 35 medical marijuana dispensaries. On Jan. 31, the Department of Public Health announced that it had approved 20 applications for preliminary licenses.\n\nSince then, several problems have surfaced about misrepresentations and conflicts of interest involving several of the companies selected, and state officials acknowledged they did not check the veracity of the companies’ statements in their applications. A handful of losing applicants have filed lawsuits against the state in a bid to block the awarding of licenses, which have yet to be issued.\n\nLast month, state health officials notified the 20 successful applicants that they will be required to undergo extensive additional background checks. It is unclear whether the new round of scrutiny will delay the opening of the dispensaries, which must be licensed and inspected by state and local officials before operators can begin cultivating marijuana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn response to patients’ complaints Thursday, David Kibbe, a spokesman for the Department of Public Health, released a statement, saying: “DPH’s focus is on striking the appropriate balance between ensuring patient access and public safety. To that end, we are engaged in a process of fully verifying all information and operational plans submitted by dispensary applicants. That process takes time.”\n\nA timeline on the agency’s website indicates the first dispensaries could open this summer.\n\nBut Lesley Rich, an attorney and president of Apex Compassion & Wellness Center, which unsuccessfully applied for a dispensary license in New Bedford and is suing the state, said it would be impossible for any dispensaries to open this summer.\n\nThe companies cannot even begin to grow marijuana until they are licensed and their facilities are inspected by the state, he said.\n\nThe Patient Advocacy Alliance is also urging Patrick to revise state regulations so that caregivers can cultivate marijuana for up to five patients, instead of only one.\n\nLisa Cole of Leicester said she is frustrated with the licensing process because her 5-year-old daughter suffers from up to 30 seizures a day and cannot get medical marijuana that has been used effectively in other states to treat children like her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“All I want is a chance to give my daughter a better life,” said Cole, as her daughter sat beside her. “I’m not willing to go down a back alley [to buy drugs]. . . . It’s disappointing, because the focus has been taken off patients.”\n\nRich said during a telephone interview that he sympathizes with the patients, but state health officials failed to adequately vet applicants before granting preliminary approval.\n\n“Even though people have lied and cheated, they still haven’t disqualified anybody,” Rich said. “The blame lies with the DPH and those that really designed the process. The process was flawed.”\n\nMatthew Allen, executive director of the Massachusetts Patient Advocacy Alliance, said the group is not looking to cast blame and wants the focus to shift to opening marijuana dispensaries as swiftly as possible.\n\nIn the letter to Patrick, signed by Allen, he wrote, “Due to delays with the process, most patients still have no safe access to a proven treatment recommended by their doctors. Patients and their family members are now suffering unnecessarily.”\n\nShelley Murphy can be reached at Shelley.Murphy@globe.com.', 'Patients with cancer, multiple sclerosis, and other debilitating conditions complained Thursday that they are suffering because of the state’s delayed review of medical marijuana dispensaries and urged Governor Deval Patrick to accelerate the licensing process.\nVoters approved a November 2012 ballot initiative legalizing marijuana for medical treatment, allowing the state to approve 35 medical marijuana dispensaries.\nLast month, state health officials notified the 20 successful applicants that they will be required to undergo extensive additional background checks.\nThat process takes time.”A timeline on the agency’s website indicates the first dispensaries could open this summer.\nThe Patient Advocacy Alliance is also urging Patrick to revise state regulations so that caregivers can cultivate marijuana for up to five patients, instead of only one.']"

The results echo previous research in Alzheimer\'s dementia suggesting that more years of education, believed to lead to more effective brain use and greater cognitive reserve, slows progression of symptoms.\n\n""I\'m not sure we can quite say you should stay in school based on this study alone. But if one looks at the dementia literature, maintaining the health of your brain by being actively involved in your life is important,"" said study author Eric Schneider, an epidemiologist and assistant professor of surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n""And in the unlikely event of injury to your brain, it may help,"" he added.\n\nThe study is published online April 23 in the journal Neurology.\n\nAbout 2.5 million traumatic brain injuries occur each year in the United States and such injuries are among the leading causes of death and disability in children and young adults, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Not all bumps to the head result in a traumatic brain injury, but all of these injuries are caused by a blow, jolt or penetrating injury that upsets normal brain function, the CDC notes.\n\nFor the new study, Schneider and his colleagues analyzed 769 patients who had been hospitalized with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury -- most from motor vehicle accidents or falls -- and later admitted to a rehabilitation facility.\n\nParticipants, who were at least 23 years old, were tracked for a minimum of one year after their injury. Grouped by education level, 24 percent had not finished high school; 51 percent had finished high school and some college education; and 25 percent had obtained at least an undergraduate degree, totaling 16 or more years of education.\n\nResearchers found that one year post-injury, participants with some college education were nearly five times more likely to fully recover than those without a high school diploma. Only 10 percent of those who hadn\'t graduated from high school were free of disability, compared with 31 percent of those with some college education and 39 percent of those with a college degree.\n\nAll participants had access to similar-quality health care and rehabilitation after their traumatic brain injury, Schneider said, so results were not compromised by variations in treatment based on education levels.\n\nHe acknowledged that it\'s difficult to prove the cognitive reserve theory or its role in recovery from brain injury and disease, but ""it\'s a fairly well-validated tool.""\n\n""We had thought there might be a similar finding in [traumatic brain injury] to what has been demonstrated in other areas where the brain is injured across time.

""Cognitive reserve might be one factor, but there are other issues that are ongoing that are equally persuasive as to why those people might do better.""\n\nStudy author Schneider said future research should focus on the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive reserve and how these processes are associated with education and learning.\n\n""Understanding the biology could help us find ways to encourage brain recovery across the board,"" he said.', 'Concussions linked to Alzheimer\'s disease plaquesThe research focused on how ""cognitive reserve"" -- the brain\'s ability to maintain function despite damage -- affects recovery from traumatic brain injury.\nNot all bumps to the head result in a traumatic brain injury, but all of these injuries are caused by a blow, jolt or penetrating injury that upsets normal brain function, the CDC notes.\nGrouped by education level, 24 percent had not finished high school; 51 percent had finished high school and some college education; and 25 percent had obtained at least an undergraduate degree, totaling 16 or more years of education.\n""We had thought there might be a similar finding in [traumatic brain injury] to what has been demonstrated in other areas where the brain is injured across time.\nAnother expert noted that the new study didn\'t show a cause-and-effect relationship between a person\'s education level and ability to recover from a traumatic brain injury.']"

Now, new research suggests that the more years of education a person has, the better they will recover from such an injury.\n\nThe research team, including Eric B. Schneider, PhD, of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, MD, says past research has shown that individuals with Alzheimer\'s disease who have more education tend to have fewer symptoms of the disease, compared with individuals who have less education - even when they have the same amount of damage to the brain.\n\nSuch findings have been attributed to the ""cognitive reserve theory"" - the hypothesis that people with more education have a larger cognitive reserve. In other words, their brain can function properly regardless of the damage it may have suffered.\n\nBut the Johns Hopkins team says that until now, this theory had not been tested in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) - a blow or jolt to the head that can interfere with normal brain function.\n\nFor their study, the researchers assessed 769 people aged at least 23 years old who had experienced a TBI.

Participants with some college education were almost five times more likely to fully recover than those who did not have enough education to gain a high school diploma.\n\nSchneider says that after a TBI, many individuals are disabled for life and are never able to resume work, while others with the same injuries make a full recovery. He says these latest findings may lead to a better understanding of such differences in recovery.\n\nHe adds:\n\n""We need to learn more about how education helps to protect the brain and how it affects injury and resilience.

Is it TV that has generally warped behavior, showing us too many characters who trade either brutality or platitudes when simple truth is needed? According to Brian Flemming, 32, sympathy was not what he needed when he had sunk to his lowest level. Instead, it was “truth” talk (some might say tough talk) from an online friend that transformed his attitude and then his life.\n\nFlemming, now a business relations representative and part-time music teacher in Canton, Mich., wrote on his blog that he was randomly paired with Jackie Eastham one day two years ago while playing Draw Something, an online Pictionary-like game. Living in England and 20 years older than Brian, Eastham was quick to trade jokes between rounds. A simple friendship was formed, and they kept in touch through the game.\n\nCourtesy of Brian\'s 3245\'s Blog\n\nAlways overweight, Flemming had been told by his eighth-grade gym teacher he needed to walk every day and stop drinking soda, but he had avoided the advice. As an adult, his bad health habits continued. His diet consisted of fast food and plenty of sugar. As with most people, Flemming’s obesity went hand in hand with avoidance and seclusion; each night in front of the TV, Flemming drank a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda.\n\nBy the time he met Eastham online, Flemming had last weighed in at 625 lbs., while also being pre-diabetic. Unseen and living alone, never once had he mentioned his drinking problem to anyone. Knowing Eastham was “safe” — she lived a thousand miles away, she was older, and they had traded barbs often enough — he decided to describe his true self to her: the massive amount of weight, booze-soaked nights, the maudlin self-pity, a pessimistic view of the future. How did she react?\n\n""She was angry with me. She told me that I was wasting my life and that I should be ashamed that I was throwing it away when there are so many people out there who are fighting to stay alive,"" Flemming wrote in his blog.\n\nEastham spoke from the heart, she spoke from where she herself lived. Up against real odds and facing something more than self-created misfortune, she herself had been diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy, which causes progressive muscle weakness and affects various organ systems. Speaking with Flemming, she had not yet experienced more than mild symptoms from this an inherited form of muscular dystrophy, however she understood that someday soon she might and for that reason, health could never be taken for granted.\n\n""I just thought bloody hell, you\'re a guy who\'s 30 ... and you\'re wasting your life,"" Eastham told CNN. ""My future is a lot gloomier. I\'m trying to make the brightest future I can, and ... you\'re dragging yourself down.""\n\nSo began Flemming’s transformation. He gave up the alcohol cold-turkey, cut out the fast food and sugar, and began to exercise, beginning his routine far from laughing eyes: walking in a basement. Over the course of two years, Flemming, who is 6-foot-2, lost 380 lbs., shrinking his 60-inch waist to a mere 38 inches. No miracle occurred, he simply stuck to his new diet, while remaining in touch with an encouraging Eastham.

Brian Flemming found the will to change his life in a drawing game.\n\nFlemming was addicted to alcohol, severely morbidly obese and full of self-pity when he met Jackie Eastham through a random match on Draw Something, the Pictionary-like mobile game. It was the spring of 2012. Most nights Flemming drank around a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda while he zoned out in front of the TV.\n\nThe last time he had been weighed, on a special scale at the hospital, he was 625 pounds.\n\nEastham lived in England and was 20 years Flemming’s senior. At first, the players shared casual banter between rounds. Their friendship eventually moved to Facebook, where they began to confide in each other.\n\nFlemming was at a low point. Besides being an alcoholic and morbidly obese, he was pre-diabetic and had a recurring cellulitis infection.\n\nEastham was the first person he was totally honest with — no one in his life knew about the drinking. He expected sympathy.\n\nBut she wasn’t having it.\n\n“She said there were people struggling for their lives and then there’s you — you have all these opportunities and you’re throwing it all away,” said Flemming, 32, now a business relations representative and part-time music teacher in Canton, Michigan.\n\nIt was personal for Eastham, who lives with myotonic dystrophy, an inherited type of muscular dystrophy that causes progressive muscle weakness and can affect various systems and organs. Her symptoms have been relatively mild so far, but she never takes her health for granted.\n\n“I just thought bloody hell, you’re a guy who’s 30 … and you’re wasting your life,” she said, remembering how she felt as the recipient of his drunken, maudlin messages. “My future is a lot gloomier. I’m trying to make the brightest future I can, and … you’re dragging yourself down.”\n\nIt was the wake-up call Flemming needed. He’d show her he could change. That day — October 13, 2012 — he vowed to quit drinking cold turkey.\n\nThat was the first step toward what would become a remarkable transformation. Less than two years later, Flemming has lost more than 380 pounds from his 6 foot 2 frame. He went from a size 60 waist to a size 38.\n\nThe days after he gave up alcohol were grueling, he said. He had cold sweats, shaky hands and couldn’t sleep. He kept busy to distract himself and found comfort in daily chats with Eastham.\n\nThey progressed from Facebook to Skype video chats, where Eastham said she was initially shocked by his size.\n\nThe weight began to fall off. Without the extra calories from alcohol, Flemming lost 100 pounds in a couple months. That was motivation enough to make other changes. He had been consuming upwards of 7,000 calories a day, according to an app he used to record his meals. He stopped eating fast food and cut out sugar and red meat.\n\nNow, a typical day for Flemming starts with a few ounces of low or no-sodium turkey breast, a serving of dry cereal, a bowl of non-fat Greek yogurt with artificial sweetener and a glass of low-sodium vegetable juice.\n\nFor lunch and dinner, he often eats chicken and vegetables with rice. And every Friday night, he treats himself to a scoop of ice cream. Now that he’s doing more exercise, he’s not as strict about his diet.\n\nAdding in physical activity was a gradual process. Flemming says he began by walking in place in his parents’ basement for five minutes a day every morning, adding minutes as he felt ready. When he was finally comfortable to exercise outside, he only went when it was dark and the neighbors couldn’t see him. Eastham kept him company on Skype sometimes while he walked.\n\n“She was a huge motivation. She’d try to push me to walk a little further each time,” he said.\n\nIn July 2013, he walked his first half-marathon. Shortly after that he took up cycling, and then running, completing his third 5-kilometer run on his birthday a few weeks ago. He used running and calorie tracker apps to stay accountable and started seeing a psychotherapist to manage his depression and make sure he was approaching his weight loss in a healthy way.\n\nEastham said she encouraged it, not wanting him to be dependent on their friendship to stay sober and motivated.\n\nFlemming is now down to 234 pounds, with about 30 pounds of excess skin around his waist. He’s trying to save the money for surgery to have it removed.\n\nThis past December, he went to Europe and finally met Eastham in person, where he was able to climb the Eiffel Tower after barely being able to walk up a flight of stairs less than two years earlier. They continue to talk every day — and are still playing Draw Something.\n\nFlemming now hopes to go back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety.\n\n“Jackie is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.

169712,http://fox8.com/2014/04/28/unlikely-inspiration-helped-this-man-lose-nearly-400-pounds/,health,"['(CNN) — Inspiration can come from unlikely places. Brian Flemming found the will to change his life in a drawing game.\n\nFlemming was addicted to alcohol, severely morbidly obese and full of self-pity when he met Jackie Eastham through a random match on Draw Something, the Pictionary-like mobile game. It was the spring of 2012. Most nights Flemming drank around a fifth vodka mixed with a liter of soda while he zoned out in front of the TV.\n\nThe last time he had been weighed, on a special scale at the hospital, he was 625 pounds.\n\n*Share Your Weight Loss Before-And-After Photos*\n\nEastham lived in England and was 20 years Flemming’s senior. At first, the players shared casual banter between rounds. Their friendship eventually moved to Facebook, where they began to confide in each other.\n\nFlemming was at a low point. Besides being an alcoholic and morbidly obese, he was pre-diabetic and had a recurring cellulitis infection.\n\nEastham was the first person he was totally honest with — no one in his life knew about the drinking. He expected sympathy.\n\nBut she wasn’t having it.\n\n“She said there were people struggling for their lives and then there’s you — you have all these opportunities and you’re throwing it all away,” said Flemming, 32, now a business relations representative and part-time music teacher in Canton, Michigan.\n\nIt was personal for Eastham, who lives with myotonic dystrophy, an inherited type of muscular dystrophy that causes progressive muscle weakness and can affect various systems and organs. Her symptoms have been relatively mild so far, but she never takes her health for granted.\n\n“I just thought bloody hell, you’re a guy who’s 30 … and you’re wasting your life,” she said, remembering how she felt as the recipient of his drunken, maudlin messages. “My future is a lot gloomier. I’m trying to make the brightest future I can, and … you’re dragging yourself down.”\n\nIt was the wake-up call Flemming needed. He’d show her he could change. That day — October 13, 2012 — he vowed to quit drinking cold turkey.\n\nThat was the first step toward what would become a remarkable transformation. Less than two years later, Flemming has lost more than 380 pounds from his 6 foot 2 frame. He went from a size 60 waist to a size 38.\n\nThe days after he gave up alcohol were grueling, he said. He had cold sweats, shaky hands and couldn’t sleep. He kept busy to distract himself and found comfort in daily chats with Eastham.\n\nThey progressed from Facebook to Skype video chats, where Eastham said she was initially shocked by his size.\n\nThe weight began to fall off. Without the extra calories from alcohol, Flemming lost 100 pounds in a couple months. That was motivation enough to make other changes. He had been consuming upwards of 7,000 calories a day, according to an app he used to record his meals. He stopped eating fast food and cut out sugar and red meat.\n\nNow, a typical day for Flemming starts with a few ounces of low or no-sodium turkey breast, a serving of dry cereal, a bowl of non-fat Greek yogurt with artificial sweetener and a glass of low-sodium vegetable juice.\n\nFor lunch and dinner, he often eats chicken and vegetables with rice. And every Friday night, he treats himself to a scoop of ice cream. Now that he’s doing more exercise, he’s not as strict about his diet.\n\nAdding in physical activity was a gradual process. Flemming says he began by walking in place in his parents’ basement for five minutes a day every morning, adding minutes as he felt ready. When he was finally comfortable to exercise outside, he only went when it was dark and the neighbors couldn’t see him. Eastham kept him company on Skype sometimes while he walked.\n\n“She was a huge motivation. She’d try to push me to walk a little further each time,” he said.\n\nIn July 2013, he walked his first half-marathon. Shortly after that he took up cycling, and then running, completing his third 5-kilometer run on his birthday a few weeks ago. He used running and calorie tracker apps to stay accountable and started seeing a psychotherapist to manage his depression and make sure he was approaching his weight loss in a healthy way.\n\nEastham said she encouraged it, not wanting him to be dependent on their friendship to stay sober and motivated.\n\nFlemming is now down to 234 pounds, with about 30 pounds of excess skin around his waist. He’s trying to save the money for surgery to have it removed.\n\nThis past December, he went to Europe and finally met Eastham in person, where he was able to climb the Eiffel Tower after barely being able to walk up a flight of stairs less than two years earlier. They continue to talk every day — and are still playing Draw Something.\n\nFlemming now hopes to go back to school to become a therapist specializing in weight loss, depression and anxiety.\n\n“Jackie is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I feel that she saved my life, even though she would never take credit,” Flemming wrote in a blog post.\n\n“Brian is so inspiring,” Eastham said. “I hope he gets what he wants out of life.”\n\nVisit Brian Flemming’s Facebook group to follow his journey.

Some are even calling this spring’s allergy season the “pollen vortex,” since the winter weather may make all the pollen arrive at once.\n\nColorado wasn’t hit especially hard by the weather system this year, but our regular temperature changes, combined with our pollen scores and number of allergy medications and specialists, qualifies the Denver area as one of the nation’s “allergy capitals.”\n\nBoulder, specifically, did not make the list.\n\nThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recently released its ranking of the 100 most allergy-prone cities for this spring. Taking the lead: Louisville, Ky. Denver didn’t make the list until No. 98, down from No. 91 last year, but simply landing in the top 100 means it’s considered an allergy hotspot.\n\nAn increasing number of Americans are suffering from allergies — especially food allergies; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says food allergies among kids surged 50 percent between 1997 and 2011. And there’s no indisputable reason why, says the Food Allergy Research and Education nonprofit.\n\nBut there are steps you can take to reduce the impact of allergies this spring, and in the long term.\n\nShoban Dave’, a board-certified allergist at the Flatiron Allergy and Asthma Center in Broomfield, says there are three evidence-based ways to treat allergies: avoiding the allergen, taking allergy medication or getting shots, which are designed to help change the immune system to be less reactive to the allergens.\n\nThe FDA recently improved two new grass allergy tablets that people can take under the tongue — designed to have the same effect as the shots, which are often administered weekly for a period of time, although they’re not yet available, he says.\n\nHis facility also offers advanced breathing tests and patch testing for fragrance and chemical allergies.\n\nOther steps you can take to help minimize your allergic reactions this spring:\n\nAvoid being outside on windy, dry days, when the pollen will be circulating. Peak pollen times are typically from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Asthma and Allergy Foundation says.\n\nKeep your house clean and free of dust. This includes bedding and carpet. Wear a mask while cleaning, if the dust while cleaning sparks allergies.\n\nTry over-the-counter eye drops to help with red, burning eyes, or ask your doctor about prescription drops with antihistamines to ease the itching, says the Asthma and Allergy Foundation.\n\nTry nasal sprays to clear out your nose, or corticosteroid sprays to help with inflammation, says the foundation.\n\nSee an allergist to get professional, personalized advice.\n\nSome people choose alternative medicine treatments, such as acupuncture. However, Dave’, who is Mayo Clinic fellowship-trained and was named one of the top allergist-immunologists by US News and Report Magazine, says he practices evidence-based medicine, so he he cannot comment on alternative treatments, such as NAET.\n\n“Alternative methods haven’t been studied with rigor, so it’s difficult for us to say one way or another the benefits or the risks,” Dave’ says.\n\nAlthough one natural treatment that’s proven to reduce sinus inflammation is saline irrigation with a neti pot, Dave’ says.\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Aimee Heckel at 303-473-1359 or heckela@dailycamera.com or Twitter.com/Aimeemay.', 'Some are even calling this spring’s allergy season the “pollen vortex,” since the winter weather may make all the pollen arrive at once.\nThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recently released its ranking of the 100 most allergy-prone cities for this spring.\nAn increasing number of Americans are suffering from allergies — especially food allergies; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says food allergies among kids surged 50 percent between 1997 and 2011.\nAnd there’s no indisputable reason why, says the Food Allergy Research and Education nonprofit.\nPeak pollen times are typically from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Asthma and Allergy Foundation says.']"

The “pollen vortex” is tormenting many of us already — and more sniffling, sneezing and itching misery is on the way.\n\nThe allergy season this spring is expected to occur about 14 days earlier and last up to 30 days longer. And it’s prevalent throughout the U.S., with an estimated 12-14 percent of the population in every state affected by nasal allergies.\n\nDr. Clifford Bassett, allergist and medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York, provides tips on how to tell the difference between allergies and colds, preventing and controlling the symptoms, and knowing when you should seek a doctor for treatment.\n\nFirst off, how do you know if you have allergies or a cold?\n\nIt's an allergy if:\n\nYou have a family history of allergies (whether seasonal or year-round, food or skin, or asthma)\n\nYour symptoms last more than two weeks\n\nYou feel worse during high-pollen time periods\n\nYou experience that annoying itch in your eyes, nose and throat\n\nIt's a cold if:\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\n\nThe symptoms come on suddenly with no clear link to allergy season\n\nThere is thickening of the nasal mucus and a color change, which could mean infection\n\nYou have a headache, sore throat or cough and feel fatigue and loss of appetite\n\nYou may catch up to seven colds a year — family history doesn’t help here.\n\nIf it's an allergy, these survival tips may ease symptoms:\n\nStart treating allergies early. Many medications work better if you start before you experience symptoms.\n\nTry a chili/cayenne pepper-based natural nasal spray. This can provide some short-term relief of pesky allergy symptoms.\n\nPractice good eyelid hygiene. Gently irrigate your eyelids (eyes closed) with a mild, tear-free baby shampoo to remove allergens and pollutants. Your doctor may also recommend anti-allergy or moisturizing eye drops.\n\nExercise indoors on high-pollen days. Pollen levels are often highest in the early morning and on warm, dry and windy days.\n\nWear shades and a hat. This will help block airborne pollens and molds and prevent red, teary eyes. Also, avoid hair gels, as they can act as a pollen magnet.\n\nShower every night. Rinse the pollens that have collected on your skin and hair throughout the day, and change your clothing before entering your bedroom. Also, don’t line dry clothing outside.\n\nConsider allergy shots. They are the only immune-based therapy we have that reduces and slows down “allergic disease” progression. They provide long-term relief in more than 85 percent of patients.\n\nGarden carefully. Avoid allergy-producing plants such as sunflower, baby's breath, gardenia, jasmine, lavender, lilac and hydrangea. Try instead gladiola, Iris, orchid, peony, freesia, rose, tulip and violet.\n\nAnd if none of that helps, you should consult a doctor if:"", ""The “pollen vortex” is tormenting many of us already — and more sniffling, sneezing and itching misery is on the way.\nThe allergy season this spring is expected to occur about 14 days earlier and last up to 30 days longer.\nAnd it’s prevalent throughout the U.S., with an estimated 12-14 percent of the population in every state affected by nasal allergies.\nIf it's an allergy, these survival tips may ease symptoms:Start treating allergies early.\nThis can provide some short-term relief of pesky allergy symptoms.""]"

Meanwhile, rather than ""growing out"" of their allergies, adults are now developing hay fever in their 30s, 40s and 50s.\n\nFor along with daffodils and longer daylight hours, the new season promises record levels of hay fever affecting more people over an extended season.\n\nBritain has barely dried off after a long, wet winter, and the nation is choking in a warm, smoggy spring.\n\n1 Hay fever often co-exists with asthma and can lead to asthma so it is important to treat your nasal symptoms properly.\n\n2 Only taking medications on the worst days is much less effective - you should start using the preventative / treatment nasal sprays two weeks before your symptoms usually begin and continue until your symptoms have totally gone.\n\n3 If your medication is not working, see your pharmacist or GP, or contact Allergy UK’s Helpline on 01322 619 898.\n\n4 When using a treatment nasal spray, tip your head forward (not back) look down, insert the nozzle and spray towards the outside of the nose.\n\n5 Use a seawater nasal spray to wash away allergens and mucus from the nose provides temporary relief from symptoms and better prepares the nose for treatment.\n\n6 In the UK, people with allergic rhinitis typically treat themselves with antihistamines. However, over one in 10 (12 per cent) of hay fever sufferers are using sedating antihistamines, which cause drowsiness and affect concentration. A once daily antihistamine will not affect driving, work, social life or concentration.\n\n7 If the first antihistamine you try is not helping, switch to another after discussing with your GP or pharmacist.\n\n8 For moderate to severe symptoms, a spray that contains steroid plus antihistamine can now be prescribed by your GP, as can stronger eye drops. Additional drugs are available on prescription for the many people who suffer seasonal asthma as well as hay fever symptoms.\n\n9 Decongestant nasal sprays may be useful for additional relief of congestion for an exam or special occasion but should not be used regularly because, after a few days use, they cause rebound congestion, making symptoms worse.\n\n10 Monitor pollen forecasts daily and stay indoors wherever possible when the count is high (generally on warmer, dry days). Rain washes pollen from the air so counts should be lower on cooler, wet days.\n\n11 Avoid trips to rural areas on high pollen days. Sea breezes blow pollen inland, so escape to the sea instead.\n\n12 Apply a pollen barrier around the edge of each nostril to trap or block pollens. Pollen Barriers are available as balms or gel nasal sprays and some people find petroleum jelly can help.\n\n13 Shower and wash your hair on returning home and change your clothing before entering the living room or bedroom.\n\n14 Keep windows closed in the early mornings, when pollen is being released and in the evening when the air cools and pollens in the air fall to ground level again.\n\n15 If you suffer symptoms indoors, a good air filter should help. Choose one that is proven to trap even small particles.\n\n16 Avoid mowing lawns or raking leaves. If you must perform these tasks, use a filtration face mask.\n\n17 Wear wraparound sunglasses when outdoors to keep pollen allergens out of your eyes.\n\n18 Avoid drying washing on a clothes-line outside when pollen counts are high.\n\n19 Pollen counts tend to be high along roads with grass verges (dual-carriageways, motorways). Keep car windows closed and the air intake on ""re-circulate"" when driving. Choose a car that is fitted with an effective pollen filter, or get an in-car air filter.\n\n20 Don\'t let pets get close to your face as they can carry pollen in their fur. Wipe pets’ coats with a damp microfibre cloth to remove pollens when they have been out for a walk.\n\n21 Use goggles when swimming, whether in the sea or in a pool.\n\nFor more advice on hay fever contact Allergy UK on 01322 619 898 or visit allergyuk.org', 'Meanwhile, rather than ""growing out"" of their allergies, adults are now developing hay fever in their 30s, 40s and 50s.\nFor along with daffodils and longer daylight hours, the new season promises record levels of hay fever affecting more people over an extended season.\n1 Hay fever often co-exists with asthma and can lead to asthma so it is important to treat your nasal symptoms properly.\nAdditional drugs are available on prescription for the many people who suffer seasonal asthma as well as hay fever symptoms.\nFor more advice on hay fever contact Allergy UK on 01322 619 898 or visit allergyuk.org']"

There\'s a hefty cache of plant powder coming, and it\'s going to cause a world of pain.\n\n""The good news is that it\'s a late spring and everything\'s blooming at once, so it will not be as long an allergy season as it sometimes is,"" said David Carpenter, director of the Institute for Health and the Environment at the University at Albany. ""The bad news is it will be more severe.""\n\nTrees usually blossom in a staggered way. But this year, maple, ash, oak and pine are all blooming at the same time, and right on the cusp of grass pollen season. Most people with allergies are affected by multiple causes, or allergens; those with tree allergies are affected by multiple trees, said Dr. M. Asghar Pasha of the Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Center of Albany Medical Center.\n\nGetting pelted by all that pollen simultaneously is likely to be brutal, doctors said, worsening symptoms that range from a runny nose to debilitating headaches and asthma.\n\nDefend yourself, they advise: Start taking medication now, even if you don\'t have symptoms yet.\n\nThat kind of advice would be wrong for lots of other drugs. But the most commonly recommended allergy medicines, antihistamines, work differently than most. They don\'t lessen symptoms after they occur, but prevent the body\'s immune system from overreacting to microorganisms in the first place.\n\nIn an allergic reaction, the body releases histamines because it mistakenly perceives pollen to be a dangerous invading organism. It\'s the histamine that causes the miserable symptoms.\n\nAntihistamines like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec block the production of histamine.\n\n""Pre-emptive use of antihistamines will reduce the amount of symptoms that patients will have,"" said Dr. Nora Perkins of Albany ENT & Allergy Services. ""They won\'t have to play catch-up once they\'re already having severe symptoms and histamine is being released.""\n\nThe full benefit of nasal steroid sprays — Flonase and Nasonex are common prescription drugs — is also not felt for several days or weeks. So doctors recommend starting them early, too. They are typically taken to treat symptoms when antihistamines are not 100 percent effective.\n\nSome early sufferers are already starting to fill allergists\' offices. They come in with the symptoms typical for tree pollen: itchy and watery eyes, nose congestion, sneezing, postnasal drip and asthma, Pasha said.\n\n""This year seems much worse than last year,"" said Jacqueline Lane of Stuyvesant, Columbia County.\n\nAllisa Cronin, a nurse at Albany Med, is already seeing the effects of allergy season at her Loudonville home. She and her three children are sneezing and see blood in their tissues when they blow their noses.\n\nBut so far, nothing worse. Cronin started giving her kids antihistamine and nasal spray three weeks ago, and the symptoms are much better than last year, she said. In spring 2013, her youngest child, 6-year-old Jack, couldn\'t stay outside for more than five minutes without developing swollen eyelids — he would scratch his itchy nose and then rub his eyes with pollen-covered hands.\n\n""As a parent, I didn\'t want to medicate my children, so I waited almost too late last season,"" said Cronin. ""Then it\'s harder to get it under control. Now I know.""\n\nMore Information Allergen avoidance Stay indoors with the windows closed. Go outdoors in the morning, when pollen counts are lowest. Irrigate, or wash, your sinuses with saline, as with a neti pot. Remove your clothes outside your bedroom. Wash your hair each night before getting into bed. Sources: Aerobiologist Larry Syzdek and area doctors\n\nCommon allergy medications, many of them over-the-counter, come with a few minor side effects, doctors said. Antihistamines can cause excessive dryness, which can be a problem for people who have trouble urinating, Perkins said. The nasal sprays can cause nosebleeds.\n\nAnother prescription option to reduce allergic reactions is immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots. These are injections of microscopic amounts of the very substance that makes a person sick — be it tree pollen or dog dander. The shots work over an extended period by decreasing the immune system\'s sensitivity to the allergen.\n\nIt generally takes at least six months before allergy shots have effect, said Dr. David Shulan of Certified Allergy and Asthma Associates. So it\'s too late to start them now for this season.\n\nFor the first time, immunotherapy has been approved in an oral prescription — but just for grasses, Shulan said. Grass pollen season generally takes off in May, so it\'s too late for that to work this season, either. And Shulan said it\'s not yet certain how insurance companies will treat this new option.\n\nThe shots are still considered more effective than oral immunotherapy, Pasha said, but the new treatment may be an option for people who can\'t tolerate shots. Those patients will likely still need to use other methods to address their other allergies.\n\n""It\'s not at all common that someone will be allergic to grass pollen and nothing else,"" he said.\n\nchughes@timesunion.com • 518-454-5417 • @hughesclaire', '(Cindy Schultz / Times ... more Photo: Albany Times Union Photo: Albany Times Union Image 1 of / 69 Caption Close Advice to the allergic: Medicate now 1 / 69 Back to GalleryAllergy sufferers, arm yourselves.\nBut this year, maple, ash, oak and pine are all blooming at the same time, and right on the cusp of grass pollen season.\n""As a parent, I didn\'t want to medicate my children, so I waited almost too late last season,"" said Cronin.\nAnother prescription option to reduce allergic reactions is immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots.\nThese are injections of microscopic amounts of the very substance that makes a person sick — be it tree pollen or dog dander.']"

It\'s the histamine that causes the miserable symptoms.\n\nAntihistamines like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec block the production of histamine.\n\n""Pre-emptive use of antihistamines will reduce the amount of symptoms that patients will have,"" said Dr. Nora Perkins of Albany ENT & Allergy Services. ""They won\'t have to play catch-up once they\'re already having severe symptoms and histamine is being released.""\n\nThe full benefit of nasal steroid sprays — Flonase and Nasonex are common prescription drugs — is also not felt for several days or weeks. So doctors recommend starting them early, too. They are typically taken to treat symptoms when antihistamines are not 100 percent effective.\n\nSome early sufferers are already starting to fill allergists\' offices. They come in with the symptoms typical for tree pollen: itchy and watery eyes, nose congestion, sneezing, postnasal drip and asthma, Pasha said.\n\n""This year seems much worse than last year,"" said Jacqueline Lane of Stuyvesant, Columbia County.\n\nAllisa Cronin, a nurse at Albany Med, is already seeing the effects of allergy season at her Loudonville home. She and her three children are sneezing and see blood in their tissues when they blow their noses.\n\nBut so far, nothing worse. Cronin started giving her kids antihistamine and nasal spray three weeks ago, and the symptoms are much better than last year, she said. In spring 2013, her youngest child, 6-year-old Jack, couldn\'t stay outside for more than five minutes without developing swollen eyelids — he would scratch his itchy nose and then rub his eyes with pollen-covered hands.\n\n""As a parent, I didn\'t want to medicate my children, so I waited almost too late last season,"" said Cronin. ""Then it\'s harder to get it under control. Now I know.""\n\nMore Information Allergen avoidance Stay indoors with the windows closed. Go outdoors in the morning, when pollen counts are lowest. Irrigate, or wash, your sinuses with saline, as with a neti pot. Remove your clothes outside your bedroom. Wash your hair each night before getting into bed.

Antihistamines can cause excessive dryness, which can be a problem for people who have trouble urinating, Perkins said. The nasal sprays can cause nosebleeds.\n\nAnother prescription option to reduce allergic reactions is immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots. These are injections of microscopic amounts of the very substance that makes a person sick — be it tree pollen or dog dander. The shots work over an extended period by decreasing the immune system\'s sensitivity to the allergen.\n\nIt generally takes at least six months before allergy shots have effect, said Dr. David Shulan of Certified Allergy and Asthma Associates. So it\'s too late to start them now for this season.\n\nFor the first time, immunotherapy has been approved in an oral prescription — but just for grasses, Shulan said. Grass pollen season generally takes off in May, so it\'s too late for that to work this season, either. And Shulan said it\'s not yet certain how insurance companies will treat this new option.\n\nThe shots are still considered more effective than oral immunotherapy, Pasha said, but the new treatment may be an option for people who can\'t tolerate shots. Those patients will likely still need to use other methods to address their other allergies.\n\n""It\'s not at all common that someone will be allergic to grass pollen and nothing else,"" he said.\n\nchughes@timesunion.com • 518-454-5417 • @hughesclaire', '(Cindy Schultz / Times ... more Photo: Albany Times Union Photo: Albany Times Union Image 1 of / 69 Caption Close Advice to the allergic: Medicate now 1 / 69 Back to GalleryAllergy sufferers, arm yourselves.\nBut this year, maple, ash, oak and pine are all blooming at the same time, and right on the cusp of grass pollen season.\n""As a parent, I didn\'t want to medicate my children, so I waited almost too late last season,"" said Cronin.\nAnother prescription option to reduce allergic reactions is immunotherapy, commonly known as allergy shots.\nThese are injections of microscopic amounts of the very substance that makes a person sick — be it tree pollen or dog dander.']"
