""I watched with other law students, and they were cheering and clapping when I got a question right.""\n\nAnd because several ""Jeopardy!"" episodes are taped in a single day in Culver City, California, Peloquin got to see Chu play in matches leading up to her own.\n\n""I was really interested in his playing style,"" said Peloquin. ""I wanted to engage with that. … And I had lots of time to study.""\n\nOf course, Chu has become a much-discussed hero/villain of ""Jeopardy!"", thanks to his brusque manner and his game theory-inspired strategy of knocking down the high value squares first, in rapid succession.\n\nThe controversy that arose when Chu\'s episodes aired was something Peloquin didn\'t see coming.\n\n""I was really surprised,"" she said. ""I actually really admired his playing style while watching his games, so I was surprised that there was such a backlash to it.""\n\nHere\'s how Peloquin earned her big win: After finding the first round\'s Daily Double, and thus doubling her $1,400, she ended up leading the pack at the halfway point with $6,200. Julie Hornick, a librarian from Summerville, South Carolina, was in second with $5,400, while Arthur trailed with $4,800.\n\nIn the Double Jeopardy round, Peloquin scored again with a Daily Double (and Chu lost everything on the second one), and by the end, she led with $12,100, while Hornick had $7,800 and Chu had $4,800. The Final Jeopardy category was British Royalty, and the clue was: ""He was the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.""\n\nThe correct response was ""Who was George VI?"" and Peloquin was the only contestant to get it right, leaving her with $15,700.\n\nAnd while you might think Peloquin winced when watching herself occasionally make an error - like identifying Sally from the Peanuts comic strip as Lucy - she said, ""It’s funny. I saw that moment, and I didn’t remember it happening. I was really invested in playing the game. Not even winning, but just playing the game. So seeing some of those questions come up was a surprise to me.""\n\nWatch Peloquin on Thursday\'s episode of ""Jeopardy!"" to see if she can win again.\n\nJenn McKee is an entertainment reporter for The Ann Arbor News.

Previously, the majority of its Facebook and Twitter posts were simple hints to Jeopardy questions or promotion of contests. Now, the show has realized that Chu was the star, the draw, the main reason people want to watch. Not the trivia, and not just Trebek. ""We know that ratings go up when a contestant goes on a streak, so by the same logic social engagement goes up when people see a contestant on the run,"" Shapiro said. Jeopardy\'s social media job, then, is to promote that contestant more actively and let everyone know a streak is in progress.\n\nThe show previously would promote contestants only once they reached a streak of five consecutive wins, a relatively high bar. That\'s now down to three in a row, Shapiro told The Wire. ""People started talking about [Chu] after his third win, too,"" she said. ""It\'s certainly given me ... the idea that maybe we should be doing more with people who have won three games.""\n\nOne reason Chu has gained such notoriety is his tweeting about the show and shaming his haters as his episodes appear on TV. (The episodes were filmed back in November.) He jumped from a follower count of a few hundred to just over 11,000 during his run. “Chu is the first contestant we know of that reached this many people through social media,” Shapiro told The New Yorker. That attention was great for Chu, who said in that same article that he\'d like to create a career as a motivational speaker.\n\nTwitter\'s help in pushing Chu to nightly news star was not lost on Jeopardy. ""Yes, we definitely saw a spike in social engagement for the weeks he was on,"" Shapiro confirmed to The Wire in an email. To keep that momentum going, the show is enlisting Arthur\'s help, and his Twitter handle.\n\n(No, he would not hang on.) Indeed, the live-tweeting of episodes among contestants has taken on a life of its own, and was especially noticeable during the College Tournament. Those 18-to-22-year-old contestants happily tweeted about their clothes, about Trebek, and about their grievances with the questions without spoiling the end. That could be the norm for contestants soon enough.\n\nThe goal to increase Jeopardy\'s social media presence and appeal to young people could create some issues should future contestants knowingly play into that villainous role that Chu created. What happens when new contestants get on the show only to cheekily launch a viral campaign for themselves? Could we see intentional sniping between contestants? Perhaps a funky bowtie or a Terd Ferguson-like hat? Getting attention from Trebek rapping or weighing in on the pronunciation of GIF is one thing. How will the show react when a contestant shows up in clown makeup?\n\nKeith Williams, for one, thinks the show\'s contestants trend too geeky to ever be as salacious as other reality shows. However, he notes their opportunity. ""In a lot of cases [it\'s] the only chance they\'ll ever have to be on national television and be seen by 15 million people."" Those 15-minutes of fame can be appealing to everyone. Just ask Arthur. “Basically, I like attention,"" he told The New Yorker. It seems Jeopardy does, too.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.', ""That may seem like a blah social media post to get people to watch, but it's a significant strategy change for Jeopardy.\nNow, the show has realized that Chu was the star, the draw, the main reason people want to watch.\nJeopardy's social media job, then, is to promote that contestant more actively and let everyone know a streak is in progress.\nThat's now down to three in a row, Shapiro told The Wire.\n“Chu is the first contestant we know of that reached this many people through social media,” Shapiro told The New Yorker.""]"

At this writing, he\'s won $261,000 across nine episodes of the show, which is celebrating its 30th season in its current incarnation with Alex Trebek as the host. He returns Monday, March 10, for his tenth outing.\n\nArthur and I recorded this podcast on March 5 about his run on the show, and focused especially on his game strategy. (See the notes below for links to several things we talked about.) While the program is syndicated and almost impossible to view most episodes outside of broadcast TV, someone has uploaded all of Arthur\'s episodes to YouTube, where (as long as Sony Pictures seemingly ignores it) you can watch his run to date.\n\nArthur has been a surprising lightning rod for criticism. While other contestants have won games across two weeks, few have experienced the level of public criticism that he has. People on discussion forums and social networks accuse him of ruining the game by playing an effective strategy: he doesn\'t pick clues from top to bottom in each category. Rather, he hunts for the Daily Doubles: one square in the first round and two in the second which allow one to wager either up to one\'s entire current cash balance or the highest amount in the round, whichever is more. (That\'s $1,000 in the first round and $2,000 in Double Jeopardy.)\n\nThe Daily Doubles aren\'t randomly placed, but occur most frequently in certain columns and at certain values. By finding these squares, which do not contain clues harder than what would ordinarily be in that spot, a contestant can take control of the game long before the Final Jeopardy question in which all participants can answer.\n\nBy winning without ""playing the game right,"" combined with a style of mashing the signaling device (it\'s not a buzzer!) and a seeming lack of enjoyment while he plays, he\'s apparently angered people who claim he is ruining Jeopardy! and that he should just give up and lose. The 30-year-old married man is certainly low-key on screen; his Twitter handle is @arthur_affect, which gives you a sense of his self-awareness and dry wit, too. He\'s been live tweeting the games Eastern Time (he lives in Ohio), and is generally a pretty hilarious fellow. (He\'s also a skilled voice-over artist.)\n\nBut there\'s more than a tinge of racism and neurotypical shaming to it, too: he\'s an Asian-American nerd, and somehow the combination of geek concentration (a slack face, which we all know too well from our own reflection) and his genetic origin seem to have cast him in the role of a villain in many people\'s eyes. You can easily find tweets that use racial epithets and stereotypes to mock him, although there\'s a lot of dislike for him being a nerd, too.\n\nI don\'t think Arthur is ruining the game or playing it ""wrong""—nor does Ken Jennings. I won two games of Jeopardy! in 2012, and wrote about it here at Boing Boing. Ken won 74 games and 2,520,700 in 2004, and wrote the book Brainiac, a combination of memoir of his time on the show and detailed research and reporting on trivia in history and the present day. (He\'s since written four more books.) He did a lovely interview with Arthur at Slate that covered a lot of the issues around becoming a lightning rod for people\'s attention.\n\nArthur plays the game masterfully, and dedicated a lot of his preparation time to determining a game strategy: which clues to go after, how to bet, and how to even slightly unnerve the competition by mixing things up. He\'s playing his own game, although he points out that two other high-dollar winners in the past, Dave Madden and Roger Craig, both played in equally idiosyncratic ways and didn\'t seem to affect most subsequent players.\n\nBut Arthur has dominated Twitter this time around as well as Jeopardy!, and received more press coverage online and in print than anyone since Ken. This extensive discussion about his new method of playing could bring in a new style, just as Moneyball\'s coverage of the effective use of statistics to find underpriced gems among players changed baseball forever.\n\nThings we discussed in the podcast:\n\nI wrote a few items for the Economist about my Jeopardy! run, and one of them involved an academic paper by one of the IBM teams that worked on Watson, the natural-language processing and answering system that beat Ken and Brad Rutter. (Brad won the most on the show when including tournaments.) The paper discussed Watson\'s wagering strategy, which closely conforms to how Arthur prepared.\n\nWe mentioned several other Jeopardy! winners, including Dave Madden, still in the No. 2 all-time regular season cash spot at this writing from his 2005 run of 19 days with $430,400; Tom Nissley ($235,405 in 2010) and Roger Craig ($230,200 that same year), both of whom Arthur bumped down as he took the No. 3 position at this writing. (Roger appeared on Ask Me Another, an NPR quiz show, and was taken down quickly!)\n\nLet us never forget Sean Connery as played by Darrel Hammond on Saturday Night Live.\n\nBob Harris wrote a strategy book about his many appearances on the show that hides a wonderful memoir: Prisoner of Trebekistan. A somewhat older but still useful book, now out of print but available used, is Secrets of the Jeopardy Champions by Chuck Forrest and Mark Lowenthal.\n\nThe invaluable J-Archive, which contains every clue and answer and wager for nearly every episode, also has a glossary of the specialized terms people have come up with for strategies over the years.

Fey didn’t say anything about a possible reunion of those stars on the tenth anniversary of Mean Girls, coming up on April 30.\n\nLohan first brought up the rumors, telling Jimmy Fallon, “I saw Tina and she mentioned doing a reunion. She said she was talking to Lorne [Michaels] about it. She’s talking to the big boss.”\n\nMore importantly, Lohan made a plea to Fey, suggesting she would be on board if a new movie were in the works.\n\n“Tina, this is important,” she said while looking directly at the camera. “This needs to happen.”\n\nFor fans searching for more of Fey’s brilliance, Muppets Most Wanted will be in theaters March 21.', 'Tina Fey weighs in on the future of the film.\nTina Fey was out promoting her new film, Muppets Most Wanted, and opened up about the future of a little film that brought huge success.\n“It’s the tenth anniversary of the movie,” Fey told E!\nAnd the movie’s stars — Tina Fey, Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, Tim Meadows and others — may very well be signing on to appear in the stage version of the story.\nFey didn’t say anything about a possible reunion of those stars on the tenth anniversary of Mean Girls, coming up on April 30.']"

Chances are that project will never happen.\n\nGet ready to feel incredibly old: The aforementioned comedy was originally released almost a decade ago. Considering how frequently people reference the flick, you’d think it hit the big screen only a few years ago. Not surprisingly, some folks are still hoping that Paramount Pictures and Tina Fey will put together some sort of sequel in the near future.\n\nYes, this writer is painfully aware of director Melanie Mayron’s 2011 abomination Mean Girls 2. It’s obvious from the first ten minutes that Fey had absolutely nothing to do with this goofy made-for-TV sequel. In fact, let’s all pretend that this thing doesn’t exist. The less said about the flick, the better.\n\nSo will we ever get a proper follow-up to the original movie? According to Tina Fey, that’s extremely doubtful. The former 30 Rock star recently squashed rumors about a possible sequel during a recent chat with Extra TV.\n\n“We’re coming up next month on the 10-year anniversary of the original movie. I can’t believe it either. We’re going to see if there’s any way to get everyone together, but not a movie, sadly. We’re all past high school age,” Tina explained to the outlet.\n\nThis less-than-fetch response definitely isn’t the sort of info fans were hoping to receive. However, the idea of a reunion is certainly good news. Could we possibly get a special edition Blu-ray at some point down the road, one with a lively and entertaining cast comedy? Cross your fingers and say your prayers.\n\nTina Fey isn’t the only Mean Girls alum who recently teased the possibility of a reunion. Lindsay Lohan appeared on The Tonight Show last week to promote her OWN series, a chat that soon turned to the 2004 comedy. Lohan told host Jimmy Fallon that the cast could get back together at some point down the road.\n\n“This is important. This needs to happen,” the actress said. In short: She’s down for a reunion should someone decide to put this thing together.\n\nWhile you’re waiting for that to come together, keep your eyes peeled for the proposed comedy Mean Moms. The flick is reportedly based on a book from author Rosalind Wiseman, whose work inspired Tina Fey’s screenplay for Mean Girls. Beth McCarthy-Miller could direct, while Jennifer Aniston is reportedly in talks to star. Unfortunately, Fey isn’t involved with this project.\n\nAre you disappointed that Tina Fey shut down rumors about a possible Mean Girls sequel? Would you settle for a reunion?', 'Tina Fey doesn’t want Mean Girls fans to get their hopes up about a sequel.\nNot surprisingly, some folks are still hoping that Paramount Pictures and Tina Fey will put together some sort of sequel in the near future.\nYes, this writer is painfully aware of director Melanie Mayron’s 2011 abomination Mean Girls 2.\nTina Fey isn’t the only Mean Girls alum who recently teased the possibility of a reunion.\nAre you disappointed that Tina Fey shut down rumors about a possible Mean Girls sequel?']"

And anyone did. The slip ended up in the grip of celeb-stalking tabloid InTouch Weekly which, naturally, printed it.\n\nAt least, that’s the story told by InTouch. No one else has independently authenticated the story, in which the troubled party-girl actress supposedly was giggling with friends back in January of 2013 about various sexual partners, and to one-up them all, Lindsay wrote down a list of 36 famous Hollywood names she has bedded.\n\n“It was her personal conquest list,” said an InTouch “source,” who claimed to have witnessed Lohan, whose best known actual work is still the Tina Fey-written 2004 high school comedy Mean Girls. “She was trying to impress her friends with the list and then tossed it aside.”\n\nOkay, sure, We buy it.\n\nSo, the real question is, who’s on the list? Not all 36 names are visible on the scrap of paper — which appears to be a Scattergories answer sheet — presumably for legal reasons and that the redacted names are those of men who were married at the time they had sex with Lindsay Lohan.\n\nBut the visible list contains some interesting names. Justin Timberlake in on there, as is Zac Efron, Her star Joaquin Phoenix, and the late Heath Ledger, as well Irish actor Colin Farrell.\n\nThe Voice judge Adam Levine is on the list, and last year he was named People Magazine‘s “Sexiest Man Alive.” So that would be a pretty good notch in Lindsay Lohan’s belt — if it’s true.\n\nSome of the names of dudes that Lindsay Lohan is supposed to have had sexual intercourse with are a bit lesser-known, such as Friday Night Lights actor Garrett Hedlund, Coldplay bass player Guy Berryman and Los Angeles gallery owner PC Valmorbida.\n\nOh yeah, don’t forget actor/director/writer/grad student James Franco. He makes the Lindsay Lohan sex list, too.\n\nWell, that was fun. Disappointingly, however, when the Gossip Cop site, which makes it its business to throw cold water on all of these great celebrity stories, checked out the Lindsay Lohan sex list list it concluded that in fact, “it is 100 percent FAKE.”\n\nGossip Cop quotes Lindsay Lohan’s father saying, “it’s not even her handwriting.”\n\nBummer.\n\nSo what do you believe?

I think it\'s pretty safe to assume that if you\'ve got a celeb crush, he\'s on Lindsay\'s list. Lucky gal ...\n\nThe story goes, Lindsay was at the Beverly Hills Hotel with friends when she decided to make a game of listing of all the stars she\'s had sex with. ""It was her personal conquest list,” a source told In Style. “She was trying to impress her friends with the list and then tossed it aside."" ORLLY?!? You don\'t just toss aside a set of names like that. Especially if you\'re planning to pen a memoir, as Lindsay is rumored to be.\n\nNow people are going to call Lindsay a slut. People were doing that anyway before, but now even more people are going to. And you know what? I think that\'s so hypocritical. I mean, imagine if someone like Jamie Dornan claimed to have slept with 36 Hollywood ingenues. (Oh, he\'s on Lindsay\'s list, by the way.) Would anyone be surprised -- or even scandalized?\n\nMaybe we\'d call him a player. But if you\'re a woman who\'s had many, many paramours, you\'re a slut. Right? Well screw that! Not literally -- you know what I mean. I say good for Lindsay. I hope she used protection, and I hope it was all fun. I don\'t think I\'d want to have sex with 36 people myself, but I\'d take a couple (or four, or more ...). I mean, almost everyone on the list is hot. Basically Lindsay took advantage of one of the great perks of being famous. Many a rock star has done much worse.\n\nBlah blah blah -- you want to know who else is on this list, right? Okay, fine. Here\'s a few of Lindsay\'s luvuhhs.\n\nAdam Levine\n\nZac Efron\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nColin Farrell\n\nEvan Peters\n\nJames Franco\n\nHeath Ledger\n\nMax George\n\nGarrett Hedlund\n\nCalum Best (okay, not all of these guys are A-listers)\n\nOh yeah, and some married guys, which does pose an awful problem for them. I\'m sure they won\'t be thrilled to have been exposed like this, nor will their wives. Should we expect a rash of Hollywood breakup stories in the wake of this tell-all? That\'s the only thing I\'m worried about. But then, if you care about your marriage, don\'t sleep with Lindsay Lohan. Know what I mean?\n\nDo you think this would be a big deal at all if a male actor had leaked a similar list of women he\'d slept with?\n\nImage via Pacific Coast News', ""A list of 36 A-list celebs Lindsay Lohan has slept with (supposedly) has been leaked to the press.\nI think it's pretty safe to assume that if you've got a celeb crush, he's on Lindsay's list.\nI think that's so hypocritical.\n(Oh, he's on Lindsay's list, by the way.)\nI don't think I'd want to have sex with 36 people myself, but I'd take a couple (or four, or more ...).""]"

11202,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/12/marry-screw-kill-lindsay-lohan-sex-list-scandal-addition.html,entertainment,"['Of course Lindsay Lohan has allegedly had sex with a bunch of A-listers. Of course she and her friends giggle and gossip about these alleged conquests in extremely public venues, and even go so far as to pen a definitive list on what appears to be a Scattergories answer sheet. (Again, this is all ALLEGED, people.) None of these aspects of the leaked Lindsay Lohan sex list are particularly surprising. What\'s truly shocking is the range in quality of celebs Lindsay\'s “had sex with.”\n\nThese men run the gamut from un-talented D-listers to superstars; we\'re surprised that Lindsay even knows who Ryan Rottman is, let alone that she took time out of her busy schedule to sleep with him. If this list is true, Lohan doesn’t discriminate based on age, length of hair, or even attractiveness. She does, however, seem to discriminate a little based on race. Hey, no one\'s perfect.\n\nGiven the shocking disparities between Lohan’s alleged conquests, we figured that this random group of celebs would be a perfect sample for a classic game of “Marry, Screw, Kill: Lindsay Lohan sex list scandal edition.” It\'s no Scattergories, but hell if it isn\'t a good time.\n\nPC Valmorbida, James Franco, Jamie Dornan\n\nMarry: James Franco. Franco and Lohan are such a perfect love connection, we’re surprised they haven\'t eloped and started popping out oddly named babies already (Lavo Yale Apatow Franco-Lohan, anyone?). They were both beloved, beautiful child stars that have matured into cult figures. They\'ve both experimented with drugs, indie films, and insanity. The blessed Franco-Lohan union is practically destined for domestic bliss. Can\'t you just see it now: Lohan whipping up her famous “full glass of vodka” at dinner time, Franco showing baby Lavo his first gay porno, and the happy couple spending hours together cuddling in the warm glow of their MacBook, writing lengthy essays on why The Canyons and Your Highness were the most underrated films in cinematic history.\n\nScrew: Jamie Dornan. Because the hands-down coolest thing about being Lindsay Lohan is that you get to casually have sex with the guy from Fifty Shades of Grey, aka the guy who millions of women are about to fork over tons of cash to watch have sex. “Christian Grey? Eh, been there, done that.”\n\nKill: PC Valmorbida. We started you off with an easy one—this guy isn\'t even famous! Sure, the LA-based gallery owner has a stable career, and knows a lot about art. But James Franco also “knows a lot about art,” plus he has thousands of followers on Instagram. When it comes to a Lohan-centric game of marry, screw, kill, you have to choose the A-listers over the randos—that\'s just, like, the rules of feminism!\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Zac Efron, Wilmer Valderrama\n\nMarry: Joaquin Phoenix. Much like Lohan and Franco, Lohan and Joaquin have a definite love connection. Lohan, Phoenix, and Franco are all former child stars that are varying degrees of unhinged (sensing some serious throuple potential here). Plus, Joaquin spent the entirety of his last film falling in love with a flighty blonde who\'s tied to an technological device. Sure, Her is about an artificially intelligent operating system, not a celeb that\'s bound to her electronic ankle monitor, but the point still stands.\n\nScrew: Zac Efron. Efron might be young, but he\'s not in high school any more. Plus, everyone thought Lindsay Lohan was all baby-faced and innocent too before she started writing sex lists in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel!\n\nKill: Wilmer Valderrama. Yo, Wilmer Valderrama’s so D-list, he\'s practically irrelevant. If you don\'t understand that reference, don\'t feel bad: it\'s just proving our point.\n\nAdam Levine, Guy Berryman, Justin Timberlake\n\nMarry: Adam Levine. In this battle between sexy musicians, Levine easily takes the cake. The Maroon 5 front man has those smoking pelvic muscles that make the ladies swoon, combined with a Semitic face your mom and rabbi can get behind. It\'s like combining the raw sensuality of a gorgeous global pop star with the comforting familiarity of a guy you could\'ve gone to Jewish sleep away camp with. And who doesn\'t love The Voice.\n\nScrew: Guy Berryman. We\'ve probably never said it before, but we\'ll say it again: bassists are sexy. A bassist\'s main job is to keep the rest of the band on track. That means they’re responsible, aware of their surroundings, and punctual, all amazing qualities in a lover. A bassist would never ask you to rendezvous at a nice hotel room, only to show up 40 minutes late with Seth Rogen and a copy of his latest dissertation (looking at you, Franco). Plus, Guy Berryman isn\'t just a bassist; he\'s Coldplay\'s bassist. And you know what that means—a really sensual love making playlist, plus unlimited Gwyneth Paltrow-approved, strength replenishing bowls of fancy quinoa.\n\nKill: Justin Timberlake. Yes, Justin Timberlake is talented, sexy, and famous. But he\'s also totally married to the equally talented and sexy Jessica Biel. While we don\'t know when Timberlake and Lohan allegedly got together, one thing\'s for sure: infidelity is almost as bad a look as matching denim. Unlike his falsetto and his ""cool dad"" penchant for fedoras, this rumored affair is just so not cute.', ""Of course Lindsay Lohan has allegedly had sex with a bunch of A-listers.\nNone of these aspects of the leaked Lindsay Lohan sex list are particularly surprising.\nGiven the shocking disparities between Lohan’s alleged conquests, we figured that this random group of celebs would be a perfect sample for a classic game of “Marry, Screw, Kill: Lindsay Lohan sex list scandal edition.” It's no Scattergories, but hell if it isn't a good time.\nMuch like Lohan and Franco, Lohan and Joaquin have a definite love connection.\nPlus, everyone thought Lindsay Lohan was all baby-faced and innocent too before she started writing sex lists in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel!""]"

This is just sad and desperate now, watching her cling to her past and refusing to let go.

But then, we have Joaquin Phoenix, who I feel like would rather eat dung than spend time with Lindsay Lohan. Justin Timberlake – maybe? Zac Efron still hadn’t had his Disney breakout when she was at the peak of her popularity, but knowing his propensity towards drugs, I can imagine they had a bender or two together.\n\nBut even still, there’s a much bigger chance of Lindsay making all this up to brag to her friends than any of it actually being true.\n\nAnyway, in other news, Teresa Giudice is apparently convinced that prison will make her more famous, which – delusional much? There’s also a story on how Selena Gomez recently became wasted, despite her rehab stint.

And it\'s a list, naturally. A list of all the male celebrities Lindsay Lohan has slept with, allegedly written by Lindsay herself back in January 2013. The magazine explains she ""was trying to impress her friends"" with the revelations while they all laughed and gossiped about celebrity peen sizes, as you would. But then she casually ""tossed [the list] away afterwards,"" which seems like a risky thing to do, particularly in retrospect given this whole tabloid magazine cover story and because you can also be fined for littering these days. Hey, what\'s risky for Lilo is great for the rest of us.\n\nIn Touch is only running half of the celebs\' names. The other half are blurred for legal reasons, apparently, because ""they\'re not all single guys."" That said, not all the men they have named are either. (Presumably this means the named guys were single when they hooked up with Lilo, while maybe the blurred out folk weren\'t.) And here\'s the ~**DEFINITIVE RANKING**~ of her conquests:\n\n18. ALLEGEDLY Max George, from that British boy band The Wanted.\n\nBecause if you\'re hooking up with a member of The Wanted and it\'s not Siva, you\'re doing it wrong. All wrong.\n\n17.

Abrams’ upcoming installment of the “Star Wars” films. The role is expected to be a Jedi apprentice, according to Variety — and one of the actors in contention is already a familiar quantity where the “Star Wars” rumor mill is concerned.\n\nUp first, Jesse Plemons. The “Breaking Bad” and “Friday Night Lights” veteran was mentioned as a “Star Wars” contender as far back as January, with rumors suggesting he could play Luke Skywalker’s son, or at least his trainee. Whatever the case, it appears he remains in the mix.\n\nNext, John Boyega. He’s best known for his starring role in “Attack the Block,” written and directed by Joe Cornish, once rumored to take over the “Star Trek” director reins from Abrams. That strange bit of symmetry aside, Boyega was an absolute all-star in “Attack the Block,” breaking out as a fully-realized action star dealing with self-doubting insecurity. He’s an excellent, left-of-center pick for “Star Wars,” should Abrams and Disney pick him for the film’s lead.\n\nThe other three actors are less exposed than Plemons and Boyega: “Downton Abbey” actor Ed Speleers, and stage actors Matthew James Thomas and Ray Fisher. These five actors are supposedly at “the top of the list” for the “Star Wars” lead, but it’s also possible that the search is ongoing. For now, as with all things “Star Wars,” nothing is final until further notice.\n\nWhich of these five actors could you see at the “Star Wars” hero?', 'With “Girls” actor Adam Driver allegedly set to play the villain of “Star Wars: Episode VII,” attention has turned to the series’ new hero.\nHe’s an excellent, left-of-center pick for “Star Wars,” should Abrams and Disney pick him for the film’s lead.\nThese five actors are supposedly at “the top of the list” for the “Star Wars” lead, but it’s also possible that the search is ongoing.\nFor now, as with all things “Star Wars,” nothing is final until further notice.\nWhich of these five actors could you see at the “Star Wars” hero?']"

Abrams would helm the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII, the Bad Robot switchboard must have been immediately clogged with the names of ambitious young actors and actresses, desperate to travel to a galaxy far, far away. In terms of prestigious film roles, they don’t come with a higher profile than those in a Star Wars movie. While official and verified casting announcements have been few and far between for this top secret project, Variety is now reporting that the net is closing on a young male lead, with a possible shortlist being considered.\n\nIn terms of screen actors, first of all, there’s Ed Speelers – the charismatic young star who has been entertaining Downton Abbey fans with his performance as footman Jimmy Kent since 2012. Then, there’s John Boyega – the talented lead of 2011’s Attack The Block, who has been steadily showing up on the lists of casting agents for increasingly impressive projects. Finally, there’s Jesse Plemons – the Friday Night Lights regular who came into his own as the morally questionable, easily led Todd in Breaking Bad.\n\nTwo actors who have worked predominantly in the theatre are also, reportedly, under consideration. Matthew James Thomas was briefly a cast member of the troubled Broadway show Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark, before joining the more successful Broadway production, Pippin. Ray Fisher made a splash in the New York theatre scene with his portrayal of Muhammad Ali in the off-Broadway production Fetch Clay, Make Man.\n\nThe role that is up for grabs is apparently that of a Jedi apprentice, since Lawrence Kasdan and JJ Abrams’ recent re-writes of Michael Arndt’s first draft have shifted the focus away from the children of Han Solo and Princess Leia. This move of emphasis may also be in response to the stated desire of Abrams to have a more diverse main cast this time around.\n\nSo, what do we actually know about Star Wars: Episode VII, beyond the identity of the writers and director? Well, we know that production begins in May 2014, with the finished product set for release on December 18 2015. We know that it is a continuation of George Lucas’ legendary saga, and we know that – crucially – Girls star Adam Driver is being sought for the role of the villain. Carrie Fisher has repeatedly confirmed her involvement, and that she’ll be shooting for six months, with strong rumours indicating a similar situation for Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. The combination of the original cast members alongside the new names goes some way to support the suggestion that this film is very much a ‘passing of the torch’ – handing the Star Wars franchise over to a new generation.\n\nWhich of these eligible young men will fit best into that picture? The name of Jesse Plemons has been in the mix for several months now, showing up repeatedly where other names have fallen by the wayside. Both Matthew James Thomas and Ray Fisher, on the other hand, would fit Abrams’ alleged vision of a more unknown actor surrounded by recognizable faces (the original cast), and have proven themselves in more action-oriented roles, albeit on stage. Ed Speelers would easily fill the charisma vacuum that dominated Episodes I, II and III, and is perhaps, so far, little known to anyone that doesn’t watch Downton Abbey.\n\nBut, it is John Boyega that should lead the field here. He has proven himself to be a charismatic, intense and powerful performer, deftly handling drama while ably serving the humorous aspects of a script. He has the gravitas to face-off against any menace brought forth – potentially – by Adam Driver, the physical prowess to handle action, and the onscreen magnetism needed to hold his own against the intimidating likes of Fisher, Hamill and Ford.\n\nWhile Abrams and his team work their way through their Star Wars: Episode VII casting list, it will hopefully be John Boyega’s name that rises to the top. In a field of strong contenders, the force is strong with this one.', 'One can imagine that, when it was announced J.J.

It is also unclear what relation this character would have with the original cast, though screenwriter Michael Arndt’s reported original draft focused on Han and Leia’s children (an approach that may have been discarded).

Sadly, there still has been no announcement on companion C-3PO.\n\nToday, Variety is reporting that writer/director J.J. Abrams has a shortlist for whoever will take on the lead role in the film.

Just one day shy of a year later, that film became a reality at Wednesday night’s Hollywood premiere of Veronica Mars at the TCL Chinese Theatre.\n\nWhile the path from cult TV show to Kickstarter-backed film might have seemed far-fetched, Bell never had any doubt that the movie, in theaters Friday, would be made. “I felt in my bones that there would be some incarnation of her,” Bell said on the red carpet of her teenage private eye. “I certainly didn’t know that it would be like this, [that it] would go as smoothly as it has, that was certainly a surprise. But I’ve learned: Don’t ever underestimate a Veronica Mars fan. It’s not in your best interest.”\n\nOne of the things Marshmallows (the über-generous and gooey-sweet fans of Veronica Mars) have always loved about the franchise is the blurred line between where Kristen ends and Veronica begins. “This is the most effortless character I’ve ever played,” Bell said. “I’m 100 percent present when I play Veronica, and sometimes [in other roles] I’m 5 percent actor, understandably. But Veronica is very similar to who I am. I’m not as outwardly snarky, but I’m often thinking it.”\n\nBut Veronica is just one of the series’ beloved characters, so we asked the cast (and creator Rob Thomas) to name their favorite character outside of their own. (Spoiler: Dick is a cast favorite.)\n\nKristen Bell (Veronica Mars): “It’s a tossup between Keith Mars, who I love so much and I want in my real life, and Vinnie Van Lowe [Ken Marino], who I just find endlessly entertaining.”\n\nJason Dohring (Logan Echolls): “Dick is always great, but I think they’re all different in their own way. Veronica is just the best, you know what I mean? And her relationship with her dad is its own thing, and in the movie especially, it’s just so strong and really wonderful.”\n\nRob Thomas (creator): “You could poll all the writers, but I think Dick Casablancas lets us get our inner-id out. The things we’re not allowed to say in real life, Dick Casablancas lets us say.”\n\nEnrico Colantoni (Keith Mars): “Dick is my favorite character. Because he is the alter ego, isn’t he? He’s the exact opposite of Keith Mars. He’s just funny. Maybe it’s because I have such a soft spot for Ryan Hansen. But I have a soft spot for all of them. He’s just, he’s unapologetic, and I love that very much.”\n\nRyan Hansen (Dick Casablancas): “Uh, besides Dick, and besides Veronica, Keith. Or Logan? I’m gonna say Logan. He’s such a dream. What a dreamboat. He’s dangerous, he’s handsome, he’s rich. Ugh! He’s my number one.”\n\nChris Lowell (Stosh “Piz” Piznarski): “I love Rico. I really love Rico. I mean, I love Rico as a human being, and I love Keith Mars. And I love Logan. That’s such a badass character. I know, it’s so self-deprecating for me to say that, but it’s true. I remember going back and watching the show before this whole campaign started, and I never really watched prior to when I started working on it, and I just remember being like, ‘This is the greatest fricking character ever.’ He just gets all the coolest sh–. It’s insane. I should be so lucky. Of course she wants to be with him, who wouldn’t?”\n\nFrancis Capra (Eli “Weevil” Navarro): “I gotta see who’s around first. [Laughs.] You know, I’ve always been a big fan of Wallace Fennel. I’ve always been a big fan of Percy Daggs’ work, what he’s done with the character. I think as you watch the shows again, there’s a lot of layers to my man’s acting, and he’s doing a lot of things for a lot of people on that character. I can’t wait to see what he’s doing these days. He and I both have grown up a lot. I can’t wait to see what Wallace is doing now. He’s my favorite right now.”\n\nTina Majorino (Cindy “Mac” Mackenzie): “I love Dick. [We suggest that maybe we should just run that quote without context.] Please don’t! [Laughs.] He always makes me laugh, because he makes me laugh in real life too.”\n\nPercy Daggs III (Wallace Fennel): “I wouldn’t have minded riding a motorcycle and putting on some nice leathers; I don’t know how good I look on camera in leather. So probably Weevil. But you know, I’m a dad now, so I think my favorite character outside of myself is Keith Mars.”\n\nJerry O’Connell (Sherriff Dan Lamb): “I’m a Veronica fan. She sort of broke the mold of detectives a little bit. Look, everybody obviously did their part, but I think a big reason why we’re here is because of her. Bell is great — a good mom too. She brought her baby to set.”\n\nAmanda Noret (Madison Sinclair): “Well, Veronica. She’s awesome, she’s rad, she’s brilliant, she’s quick-witted. And I think a lot of girls look up to her. I think that that matters a lot, for people to have that hero to look up to.”\n\nLet’s not let the cast have all the fun: Who’s your favorite Veronica Mars character?', 'Just one day shy of a year later, that film became a reality at Wednesday night’s Hollywood premiere of Veronica Mars at the TCL Chinese Theatre.\nBut I’ve learned: Don’t ever underestimate a Veronica Mars fan.\nIt’s not in your best interest.”One of the things Marshmallows (the über-generous and gooey-sweet fans of Veronica Mars) have always loved about the franchise is the blurred line between where Kristen ends and Veronica begins.\nThe things we’re not allowed to say in real life, Dick Casablancas lets us say.”Enrico Colantoni (Keith Mars): “Dick is my favorite character.\nI think that that matters a lot, for people to have that hero to look up to.”Let’s not let the cast have all the fun: Who’s your favorite Veronica Mars character?']"

Whether I watched the movie was entirely up to me.\n\nThat movie, you may have guessed, is Veronica Mars, the Kickstarter-funded revival of the UPN/CW series that is released in theaters and for digital download on Friday. I saw a critics’ screening of the movie last week, and my column in the print TIME this week (subscription required) looks at what it means to be a TV fan in the age where nothing really dies for sure–when cult hits can come back in the movies, on another cable channel, on Netflix:\n\nYou can buy a sequel, but you can’t buy back time. Years have passed; a movie is not the same as a TV season. The Arrested Development revival was a fascinating narrative experiment, but different–darker, stranger, sadder–from the series that fans had come to love. Would giving the fans the power of resurrection become like the horror story “The Monkey’s Paw,” reanimating zombie shows that we should have let go, remembering them at their best?\n\nWith Veronica Mars, I felt my money was well spent: the series deliberately ended without real closure, and the movie does a smart job of working the can-you-go-home-again theme into its story. On the other hand, if this had been an option when, say, Freaks and Geeks went off the air, I’d have gladly paid–and might well have regretted it in the end. Judd Apatow and Paul Feig created such a lovely ending to the single season of their show that I’m not sure it would be worth messing with for the sake of two more hours.\n\nFor that same reason, though I loved HBO’s Enlightened, I don’t agree with the calls I’ve been hearing for it to be saved by Netflix, Amazon, cable, or the movies. Mike White had wanted to continue the series, but he also created such a luminous ending for Amy Jellicoe’s story, one that felt like a series ending, that it’s best for us to move on and the talent connected to do other great work.\n\nI’m not going to do a full advance review of Veronica Mars; it works well for fans of the series–who most likely are going to see it anyway–and I wouldn’t in good conscience recommend it to someone who never watched. (The script makes the story perfectly accessible, but it really relies on having known the characters for three seasons to have any emotional pull. If you’re interested, watch the series first.) But I may do a follow-up post after the movie’s been out for a while, to discuss some points that would be spoilers in a review.\n\nIn the meantime, though: What other shows would you like to Kickstart back into life? And what ones do you feel it would be better to leave alone–dead too young, but leaving behind beautiful reruns?\n\nTo read the full column, subscribe to TIME.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.', 'That movie, you may have guessed, is Veronica Mars, the Kickstarter-funded revival of the UPN/CW series that is released in theaters and for digital download on Friday.\nThe Arrested Development revival was a fascinating narrative experiment, but different–darker, stranger, sadder–from the series that fans had come to love.\nWith Veronica Mars, I felt my money was well spent: the series deliberately ended without real closure, and the movie does a smart job of working the can-you-go-home-again theme into its story.\nI’m not going to do a full advance review of Veronica Mars; it works well for fans of the series–who most likely are going to see it anyway–and I wouldn’t in good conscience recommend it to someone who never watched.\nAnd what ones do you feel it would be better to leave alone–dead too young, but leaving behind beautiful reruns?']"

But during its run, Neptunes proved to be far less divided, which not only made Neptune seem less like a distant fantasy town, but also allowed for more interesting subplots and nuanced character development.\n\nVeronica and her best friend Wallace, for example, are clearly (and later call themselves) middle-class: Veronica assists with her dad’s caseload as an after-school job, but not because she’s ordered to support the family—the job gives her access to Lilly’s murder files and helps her save up for Stanford (an ambition that’s sometimes threatened by her quest for justice). Wallace’s mom works for Kane Software, but she also relies on the income from her no-good tenant while Wallace counts on a basketball scholarship to be able to afford and attend his college of choice. Computer-whiz Mac is the Q to Veronica’s 007, but while Mac buys a fancy car and keeps up with the latest gadgets and souped-up laptops, it’s because she finds clever ways to use her tech know-how to earn cash, not because her parents dote on her with a checkbook. The show’s careful attention to the material details of class also help contextualize Veronica herself: An ex-cheerleader, she distances herself from her old pals with a new haircut and new clothes, but preppy pink items from her past still show up in the first season, so viewers can tell she’s not the girl who would (or could) prioritize buying an entirely new wardrobe.\n\nRace and class are often intertwined in Neptune, but Veronica Mars often served as a good reminder that they’re not to be conflated. One of the series’ recurring conflicts is between the PCH Bike Club, a largely Latino motorcycle gang, and the obnoxious 09ers, rich kids from Neptune’s über-wealthy 90909 zip code, but the show never suggests only white kids can be rich kids and only minorities can be poor. Jackie Cook, a second-season addition played by Tessa Thompson, was both black and one of the richest girls in school. In one episode, while investigating a series of muggings, a classmate tips Veronica off that the culprit might be targeting the “coconuts”—Latino and Latina students criticized for being “brown on the outside, white on the side.” The PCH gang does engage in criminal activity, but their crimes are repeatedly contrasted against the transgressions of the rich, which are often worse. And in Season Two, it’s a rival gang made up of mostly working-class Irish-Catholics that’s dealing the hard drugs (to the parents of 09ers) and making people “disappear.” Veronica Mars didn’t entirely subvert stereotypes, but it usually tried to at least complicate and challenge them.', 'In the pilot, Veronica introduces her high school as a battle between the haves and the have-nots, claiming Neptune is a town without a middle class.\n“If you go here, your parents are either millionaires, or your parents work for millionaires,” she says.\nRace and class are often intertwined in Neptune, but Veronica Mars often served as a good reminder that they’re not to be conflated.\nOne of the series’ recurring conflicts is between the PCH Bike Club, a largely Latino motorcycle gang, and the obnoxious 09ers, rich kids from Neptune’s über-wealthy 90909 zip code, but the show never suggests only white kids can be rich kids and only minorities can be poor.\nJackie Cook, a second-season addition played by Tessa Thompson, was both black and one of the richest girls in school.']"

If you love something so much that you\'d ""pay to see that,"" you can now turn that dream project into a big-screen reality by ponying up a piece of the production financing yourself.\n\nFrom a fan\'s standpoint, that\'s kind of cool. This movie caters to them.\n\nBut as another in the rich tradition of private detective thrillers, the big-screen Veronica isn\'t just for fans only. Almost, though.\n\nA generic murder mystery with the private eye narrating the investigation in voice-over, this class-reunion dramedy chugs along on the good will the cast built up over the show\'s 2004-2007 run. Cowriter/director Rob Thomas tailored this to run on the familiar setup/joke rhythms of a TV sitcom, custom fit for the vulnerable, hesitant sass of Kristen Bell, his star.\n\nIt\'s self-conscious to a fault. It plays as melodramatic, and a little dated. And when it comes to laughs, it tries too hard, like a 30-year-old straining to get her senior-year skinny jeans to fit.\n\nAs Veronica, fresh out of law school, living in New York and about to marry Piz (Chris Lowell), says, ""Old habits die hard.""\n\nSo when her one-time nemesis-turned-lover Logan (Jason Dohring), now in the Navy, is accused of killing his pop-star girlfriend, Veronica answers the call.

Can you feel it?\n\n""LoVe,"" of course, stands for Logan and Veronica, the star-crossed lovers in the cult classic about the titular teenage private eye played by Kristen Bell. Fans paid a cool $5.7 million for a resolution to the story, which ended on a cliffhanger when the show was unexpectedly canceled after three seasons.\n\n""(Logan) is a good guy underneath it all,"" actor Jason Dohring says, in a ""Veronica Mars"" scene with actress Kristen Bell. Today\n\nThere are a vocal minority who side with Team Piz — Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski (Chris Lowell), who is still Veronica\'s steady boyfriend at the start of the movie.\n\nBut let\'s be honest: Most fans contributed to the record-setting Kickstarter campaign in the hopes of seeing Veronica and Logan finally get back together. It\'s their destiny!\n\nLogan wasn\'t exactly the ideal boyfriend, so why does he deserve to win Veronica back nearly a decade later? TODAY asked his alter ego, actor Jason Dohring, to make a case for Team Logan.\n\n""I will hold Chris Lowell away from this conversation and start by saying: One, (Logan is) honestly a good guy,"" Dohring said. ""He probably doesn\'t even understand his emotions — like when he goes insane and freaks out, he can\'t help himself, man. But afterward he can feel that he (messed) up ... he is a good guy underneath it all.""\n\nMost important, though: ""Logan loves Veronica,"" Dohring told TODAY. ""He understands her. They\'ve both been through tremendous family struggles. And I think they both even without speaking understand each other. I think that that (is what) the audience connects to, when they just look at each other, It\'s just like, \'I get you.\' That\'s what\'s so beautiful about that relationship.""\n\nAs for the flawed bad boy, ""He\'s the best psychotic jack--- in the world,"" he said. ""He\'s charming, he\'s witty, he\'s romantic, (but at the same time) he\'s a good fighter. You want a guy in your corner who can really throw a punch, if needed — but will also deliver a kiss that will make you fall over with joy.""\n\nFinally, the actor added with a laugh, ""He\'s a little taller than Chris Lowell.""\n\nHeight aside, Dohring himself acknowledged that on paper, Piz might be the better choice.\n\n""I get it, man. I think Veronica and Logan maybe match up a little bit better from where they come from emotionally and in their lives. And they\'ve had so much history together. ... But there is a predictable side that\'s very wonderful about just having a good solid guy there who\'s never going to involve her in any situation where she\'d feel less, or betrayed, or anything like that. So I think that for that reason I can sympathize with those Team Piz fans. And I\'ve worn the shirt to prove it.""\n\nBut can Piz beat Logan in the bedroom? Everyone in Neptune has seen his moves, thanks to the sex tape secretly filmed by one of Veronica\'s many enemies.\n\n""Piz is so amateur,"" Dohring scoffed, noting that Logan would ""have a couple pointers"" for his rival. But he quickly added, ""No, I\'m just kidding!"" Logan was and always will be much more concerned about ""murder(ing) whoever is responsible"" for the tape. ""It gives me a reason to fight, which is good enough reason for me.""\n\nSpoiler alert: That tape makes another appearance in the movie — which leads to another fight.\n\n""It just wouldn\'t be the same (without one), right?"" Dohring laughed. ""These Kickstarters paid their money, they deserve a little fisticuffs!""\n\n""It was just beautiful, man,"" Dohring said about reprising his ""dream role"" in the film.\n\n""You get to play the bad boy and also have the love story"" — which Dohring believed ""wasn\'t even in the cards"" when he joined the series. ""You\'re never ever gonna be with the title girl,"" he thought — until the producers revealed ""six or eight episodes in"" that Logan and Veronica hooked up.\n\nDohring and Bell ""both absolutely flipped out"" when they heard the news.\n\n""We\'re like, \'Are you crazy? There\'s no way!\' (But the producers said), \'You guys better start warming up, because you are gonna be kissing in three episodes.\'""\n\nAnd what Dohring calls their ""beautiful love story"" was born — and sparks fly when they reunite years later in the movie.\n\nAlthough Logan\'s ""bad boy character (is) pushed even further in the movie,"" Dohring said, ""At the same time I still get love stuff and I still get caring scenes with Veronica.""\n\nDoes Logan win the girl in the end this time? We\'ll have to wait until Friday to find out. But make sure to stay in your seat when the film\'s credits roll.\n\n""Don\'t leave before all the eggs have hatched, if you know what I\'m saying,"" Dohring teased. ""There\'s always an Easter egg around the corner, so just stay for the end.""', '""(Logan) is a good guy underneath it all,"" actor Jason Dohring says, in a ""Veronica Mars"" scene with actress Kristen Bell.\nTodayThere are a vocal minority who side with Team Piz — Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski (Chris Lowell), who is still Veronica\'s steady boyfriend at the start of the movie.\n""I will hold Chris Lowell away from this conversation and start by saying: One, (Logan is) honestly a good guy,"" Dohring said.\nMost important, though: ""Logan loves Veronica,"" Dohring told TODAY.\nI think Veronica and Logan maybe match up a little bit better from where they come from emotionally and in their lives.']"

Dir: Rob Thomas stars: Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, Krysten Ritter, Enrico Colantoni, Jerry O’Connell\n\nVeronica Mars was an offbeat, noirish, sassy crime series which ran on American television for three seasons, from 2004 to 2007, and helped to establish Kristen Bell as a star. Clamouring for more, the show’s fans have been able to put their money where their mouths are – this feature-length spin-off was facilitated through the currently all-the-rage method of Kickstarter crowd-funding. It gives the writers a chance to wrap up some loose ends, but trying to satisfy everyone – newbies included - is an awkward agenda from the start.\n\nTo be fair, they succeed more often than not.

11318,http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20140313/entlife/140319358/,entertainment,"['TV sleuth back in fine form in film version of \'Mars\'\n\nCanceled by the CW in 2007, the cult-fave mystery series ""Veronica Mars"" completed its third season with an open-ended episode. Revived for the big screen, the gumshoe drama finds its title character, nine years later, insisting that she\'s in a mellower frame of mind, no longer the angry, crime-solving teen who thrills to danger. As if.\n\nAfter a murder hits close to home, the law-school grad tosses aside her sleek job-interview threads and is soon sleuthing it up among the rich, famous, corrupt and depraved who populate her SoCal hometown. Kristen Bell is in fine form as the sharp-witted and stiletto-tongued Veronica, whose high polish on the art of sarcasm has endeared her to fans as a supremely self-possessed outsider.\n\nAs with the TV show, the connect-the-dots mystery solving is less interesting than the character dynamics; crimes unravel with a directness that feels aimed at younger audiences. The dark doings are leavened, and sometimes undercut, by comedy, and by angst that\'s not far removed from adolescence. Thomas\' sex, drugs and rock \'n\' roll neo-noir has a young-adult heart that still beats strong, even with Veronica and her friends well into their twenties. The 10-year reunion of Neptune High just happens to be impending when Veronica returns home to help solve a murder, and teen allegiances, animosities and romances loom large in the film, which features many actors reprising their small-screen roles.\n\nCreator Rob Thomas and co-scripter Diane Ruggiero provide a concise recap of the series\' trajectory, in the form of a stylized montage with voiceover narration, that will bring even newbies up to speed on the central character. Cut to Manhattan, where the sight of Veronica in the glass-walled conference room of a prestigious Manhattan law firm, interviewing for a job, is bound to disappoint aficionados, who are used to seeing her speak truth to power, not cozy up to it.\n\nThe crime that brings her back to her fictitious beach town of Neptune, Calif., is the apparent murder of pop star Bonnie DeVille (Andrea Estella), a high school classmate and girlfriend of Veronica\'s former flame Logan (Jason Dohring), himself a demi-celebrity because he\'s the son of an actor. He\'s suspect No. 1, and Veronica doesn\'t hesitate to drop everything to help him, leaving behind a potential new job in New York and supportive boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell). The Piz-Logan dilemma -- good guy vs. bad boy, straightforward vs. complicated -- is a fundamental element of the movie, in a way that starts out YA and turns believably grown-up messy.\n\nAs she digs into the case, Veronica reconnects with close friends Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III), trades barbs with surfer jerk Dick (Ryan Hansen) and circumvents the dishonest, obstructionist sheriff (Jerry O\'Connell). In the process she crosses paths with a wacko fan of the dead pop singer (Gaby Hoffmann) and uncovers a very cold 9-year-old case that involves a collective silence among her former classmates.\n\nThe screenplay doesn\'t avoid bouts of where-are-they-now exposition as it draws connective lines between high school and adulthood. But at its strongest, as in Veronica\'s relationship with her sheriff-turned-private-investigator father (Enrico Colantoni), there\'s no need to spell things out. Colantoni is understated and terrific as a man who has weathered serious challenges and reversals. The father-daughter chemistry between him and Bell is an essential component of the movie, as of the series -- loaded with emotion but never lapsing into sentimentality.\n\nA dark thread runs through the movie that has no direct bearing on the crimes Veronica is trying to solve. She makes repeated references to her absent alcoholic mother and, most jarringly, to addiction in general. It\'s a thread that doesn\'t feel fully integrated into the film, but suggests material that Thomas might explore if he decides to make a second Veronica Mars feature.', 'TV sleuth back in fine form in film version of \'Mars\'Canceled by the CW in 2007, the cult-fave mystery series ""Veronica Mars"" completed its third season with an open-ended episode.\nKristen Bell is in fine form as the sharp-witted and stiletto-tongued Veronica, whose high polish on the art of sarcasm has endeared her to fans as a supremely self-possessed outsider.\n1, and Veronica doesn\'t hesitate to drop everything to help him, leaving behind a potential new job in New York and supportive boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell).\nA dark thread runs through the movie that has no direct bearing on the crimes Veronica is trying to solve.\nIt\'s a thread that doesn\'t feel fully integrated into the film, but suggests material that Thomas might explore if he decides to make a second Veronica Mars feature.']"

A lot more. But what would it take to bring back the actors? Including Kristen bell? Well, here\'s the math. One passion project on kick starter, one willing cast, 91,000 fans, and $5 million. What does it all add up to? Veronica Mars the movie. Chris Connelly has been followed Kristen bell and company for the past year. I don\'t really do that anymore. A feature financed by fans via social media. It\'s unprecedented in Hollywood history. Mars. It\'s been a year in the making. ""Nightline"" has been there every step of the way. A girl, a teenager and a private detective. A triple threat. Seven years after its small screen debut, Veronica Mars and its sleuth at center with enjoy an unlikely resurrection. Kristen bell is now the voice of Anna in ""Frozen"" and the original Veronica Mars cast. I wanted to make the movie since the day our production shut down. Our cast has been stayed very close. We knew everyone was in. Did anyone on your team say it\'s crazy. You have a flourishing career. You don\'t have to do this. I do not let them talk to me like that. Second of all, I do not have a flourishing film career. Reporter: Veronica Mars was a perfect fit for the skills of Kristen bell. So much of me is in Veronica. I present a lot sweeter of an exterior than I maybe am thinking all the time. I think a lot of snarky stuff. I just don\'t always say it because I know better. Reporter: The shows fans known as marshmallows. These old ladies at the mall are like I hate your character. But then I saw the last episode and now I don\'t know. Reporter: But in may 2007, this seemed like America\'s last look at Veronica Mars, the final curtain of a show that ran for 64 episodes over three seasons. Oh, my god, Veronica Mars. Just to exist, this new movie needed cutting-edge technology and more than 91,000 fans who paid for the production like this flight attendant. It was something I wanted for so long. I was just excited at the opportunity. Now at the cinematic social media success. One we began following last spring. With Veronica Mars writer, producer and now director. Today is may 29. Where are you right now in terms of production? We\'re three weeks out from shooting. And nervous. 93 fans are going to be used as extras in the movies. We\'re trying to coordinate when they\'re coming in for which scenes. That\'s something Normal movies don\'t have to worry about. Normal movies don\'t do what this leading lady have done. Post videos on the crowd funding website kick starter. Soliciting donations towards the making of course a Veronica Mars movie. Thank you, guys, so much for supporting the kickstarter. Thank you so very, very much. We didn\'t steal from anyone. We said would you guys want to buy your tickets, like, way in advance? Like maybe two years in advance before we even make the movie? And thankfully they said yes. Each donation level has perks attached. Signed copies of the eventual script, posters, DVD\'s, even walk-on parts in the movieth E. -- Movie itself. We\'re happy to do it. One month later, 91,585 donors had given over $5 million. By June, the cast was shooting a 10th year high school reyao union scene. In the background can be found multiple kick starter investors. I would have paid so much more for the experience that I got. It was fabulous. Yet as other famous faces try to crowd fund their pet projects, some say it\'s wrong for those with industry hook-ups to be taking kickstarter coins. I think this bring answer element of democracy to, you know what we get to see in the movies. Veronica Mars was unique. An established franchise, owned by a company reluctant to green light a film. And a creative team willing to work cheap. Rob said you would have been willing to change your clothes behind trees to make that happen. Yeah, I did. Knowing that if I have to change over for a different scene I would have to drive back to base camp, change my clothesing come back, that\'s 17 minutes. Versus I go behind a tree and just avert your eyes, pervs, I\'m out in 2 1/2. I mean, does logic not speak for itself? Go behind the tree. I had to convince Warner brothers that there was an enthusiasm for it, that there was a fan interest. That enthusiasm was evident at comicon in San Diego. It\'s surreal that you love their show and then you get to meethem. I\'m so excited. I\'m shaking. It\'s crazy. Reporter: The rveronica Mars movie won\'t be considered a hit unless it attracts a wider audience. But pleasing the marshmallows the most is what everyone wants. The Veronica Mars fans pleasure zone, I\'m trying to cater to that. We invested in in each other. It was kind of, Reich, you know, passing a note, do you want to go steady and responding yes and then freaking out. This is important to me. This isn\'t just another job that I took. I really care about this. I\'m Chris Connelly for ""Nightline"" in Los Angeles.

The shout-out is appropriate: Without the emotional and financial support of the diehards, this crowd-funded revival—a big-screen extension of a canceled small-screen gem—would never have made it into multiplexes. Thankfully, the Veronica Mars movie wastes only a fraction of its precious running time on such winks and nudges. (There’s also an acoustic rendition of the Dandy Warhols anthem that kicked off each episode.) But for better and worse, series creator Rob Thomas has crafted a feature-length exercise in fan service—a game if slightly futile attempt to condense a whole season’s worth of detective work, SoCal melodrama, and whip-smart banter into one load-bearing film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe strain shows, though not fatally. After an opening montage of footage from the series, assembled as a courtesy to the uninitiated, Veronica Mars gets down to throat-clearing business, bridging the gap between the inconclusive finale of season three and the status quo of this seven-years-later continuation. Veronica (Kristen Bell, back in the role of a lifetime) now lives in Manhattan, having abandoned the investigator business for a more lucrative career in lawyering. She’s also committed to Piz (Chris Lowell), that drippy nice guy she met in college, whose appeal always seemed strictly limited to his habit of not punching people in the face. Speaking of which: It’s bad boy ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring), accused of the murder of his pop-star squeeze, who draws Veronica back to the seedy, sunny stomping grounds of Neptune, California. Here, she reluctantly takes the case, falling back into old habits and into the company of old allies and foes. (That theme song, about being friends a long time ago, suddenly has added resonance.)\n\nVeronica Mars smartly frames its story as one of compulsive backsliding: Just as fans could never quite quit this indelible character, Veronica finds it difficult to cold turkey the Philip Marlowe lifestyle, to say nothing of the addictive allure of her trouble-prone former flame. Swirling its crime-fiction intrigue around a high school reunion, the film plays like a reunion itself, deftly reintroducing the various figures caught in Veronica’s orbit—her aging private-eye father (Enrico Colantoni), comic cretin foil Dick (Ryan Hansen), the heroine’s assorted sidekicks and nemeses. Every cameo appearances feels organic. No callback feels forced. As a nostalgia trip, and a valentine to the virtues of its terrific source material, Veronica Mars gets the job done.\n\nAs a whodunit, however, it leaves a bit to be desired. Forget murderous celebrities, venomous rich kids, and the heavy hand of the local law: This time, the biggest obstacle Veronica faces is an abbreviated timeframe. On television, Bell’s brainy snoop had season-long arcs in which to work her magic—and so, too, did Thomas, who could plant clues and red herrings across hours of plot, the episodic format allowing him to create a sprawling ensemble of suspects. Working here with the running-time equivalent of about two episodes, Thomas constructs a much less compelling mystery, cutting corners to conform his serialized storytelling style to the demands of a one-and-done feature. He’s no master stylist either; hopes that Veronica Mars would finally gain a noir aesthetic to complement its neo-noir subject matter are dashed by the televisual visuals. (Though, to be fair, the series always strove to juxtapose the darkness of its themes with the brightness of its environment.)\n\nOf course, many fell in love with Veronica Mars not for its detective-yarn plotting, but for its sharp characterizations and soapy romantic entanglements. Even in that regard, however, the movie falls a little short: Piz remains an obvious Baxter, an embodiment of the “normal” life Veronica thinks she wants, so the love triangle feels a bit perfunctory. And Logan, once a volatile presence, has softened with age into a mellower heartthrob, not so different from the dull nerd he’s competing against for his ex’s affection. At its best, the series made one wonder if this wealthy hothead was right for Veronica; by catering to Team Logan, Thomas extinguishes that tension. For the most part, Veronica Mars plays like a very solid episode of the series, the kind unlikely to rank among fan favorites. It could, however, serve as fine fuel for a sequel, one that wouldn’t find Veronica resisting—for half of her time on screen—the urge to do what she does best. Keep your hearts (and wallets) open, marshmallows.\n\n', 'Movie Review Movie Review Veronica Mars B B Veronica Mars Director Rob Thomas Runtime 107 minutes Cast Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, Enrico Colantoni“People say I’m a marshmallow,” quips the titular, once-teenage gumshoe of Veronica Mars, in an early tip of the hat to all the self-described marshmallows in the audience.\nThankfully, the Veronica Mars movie wastes only a fraction of its precious running time on such winks and nudges.\nAs a nostalgia trip, and a valentine to the virtues of its terrific source material, Veronica Mars gets the job done.\nOf course, many fell in love with Veronica Mars not for its detective-yarn plotting, but for its sharp characterizations and soapy romantic entanglements.\nFor the most part, Veronica Mars plays like a very solid episode of the series, the kind unlikely to rank among fan favorites.']"

By funding a historic $5.7 million Kickstarter campaign, they’ve given the show a miraculous big-screen resurrection, seven years after it was killed off.\n\nTheir investment has been rewarded with a brisk and sweetly satisfying, if predictable, film that gets the band back together again and pretty much hits all the beats you expect it to hit.\n\nIt opens with an introductory recap montage that works to bring everyone, including newbies, up to speed. Veronica, a champion of high school misfits, details how she began her sleuthing ways as a 15-year-old trying to learn who murdered her best friend, Lilly Kane. It was a way of coping with her personal pain while growing up in Neptune, a seaside town rife with class wars.\n\nCut to New York City, where Veronica, now a hotshot Stanford grad, is poised to take a job with a high-powered law firm. She’s also joined at the hip with her nerdy college sweetheart, Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski (Chris Lowell). Neptune? It’s but a speck in her rearview mirror and not even an impending 10-year high school reunion is enough of a pull. She wants no reminders of the old ""angry, vengeful me.""\n\nBut like the show’s obsessive devotees, Veronica can’t really move on. She gets a call from Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), her former hot-tempered nemesis, and onetime flame, who has been accused of killing his rock-star girlfriend. So off to Neptune she goes with a promise to be back soon. Yeah, right.\n\nThe crime and the reunion are convenient excuses for creator Rob Thomas and writing partner Diane Ruggiero to send out the call to members of their talented cast. And it truly does feel like we’re connecting with old BFFs as Veronica catches up with Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Mac (Tina Majorino), Weevil (Francis Capra) and several others. Good vibes abound.\n\nBut the reunion to savor the most is between Veronica and her sheriff-turned-private-eye dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni). Their seemingly effortless on-screen chemistry produced one of TV’s most endearing father-daughter relationships and it’s a joy to see them back together, exchanging warm glances and sarcastic barbs, while also butting heads. Together, they provide some of the film’s best moments.\n\nAs for the central mystery, it’s not exactly mind-blowing in its complexity. But whodunit cases have never been the main point with ""Veronica Mars,"" which is more interested in examining social injustice, and class division through the eyes of a strong, self-confident young woman. Fortunately, Bell, as charming and witty as ever, smoothly steps back into the role she was made to play.\n\nEven with the Kickstarter cash, Thomas had to pinch pennies, so ""Veronica Mars"" isn’t artificially amped up with special effects or exotic locales like many TV-to-big-screen projects. Instead Thomas goes out of his way to please the show’s fandom in other ways, cramming the story with in-jokes, slick visuals and lots of really fun cameos that we won’t spoil here.\n\nOn occasion, it feels like pandering, especially when the film awkwardly addresses the lingering feelings between Veronica and Logan, a plot line that the so-called ""shippers"" were always hung up on.\n\nThen again, why not give the fans what they want — and paid for? Along those lines, the film winds up in a place that seems to suggest we could see more of ""Veronica Mars"" at the cineplex in the future.\n\nApparently, there’s just no melting these Marshmallows.', 'In the case of ""Veronica Mars,"" an offbeat gem of a series starring Kristen Bell as a whip-smart teen detective, the fans — or ""Marshmallows"" as they are known — put their money where their mouth is.\nBut the reunion to savor the most is between Veronica and her sheriff-turned-private-eye dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni).\nBut whodunit cases have never been the main point with ""Veronica Mars,"" which is more interested in examining social injustice, and class division through the eyes of a strong, self-confident young woman.\nEven with the Kickstarter cash, Thomas had to pinch pennies, so ""Veronica Mars"" isn’t artificially amped up with special effects or exotic locales like many TV-to-big-screen projects.\nAlong those lines, the film winds up in a place that seems to suggest we could see more of ""Veronica Mars"" at the cineplex in the future.']"

11350,http://whtc.com/news/articles/2014/mar/13/review-veronica-mars-is-a-fantastic-for-fans-resur/,entertainment,"[""By Jordan Smith, Hollywood Staff\n\nIt's remarkable how much Veronica Mars feels like coming home again. Ms. Mars has had nearly a decade off from her detective duties, but the character and the series at large saunters right back into form with such a confident swagger, it feels like she never really left at all.\n\nThe product of a now infamous Kickstarter campaign, Veronica Mars is the film sequel to the much beloved but scarcely watched CW series that followed the adventures of a teenage private eye. Mars solved mysteries surrounding the seedy denizens of the fictional Neptune California, a beach town where the rich socialites and working class heroes clash quite frequently and often violently. The series was a terrific mix of Nancy Drew and Raymond Chandler, give or take a Buffy, airing for three seasons before being canceled. But thanks to creator Rob Thomas' audacious Kickstarter and a brewing cult of fans, Veronica Mars has been given a second chance at life, a chance that precious few shows receive.\n\nThe film picks up with Veronica (Kristen Bell) knocking on 30's door and enjoying a comfortable life in New York City with her long time boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell). Her youthful gumshoe years are well behind her, but her old life comes back into swing when former flame Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is charged with murdering his starlet girlfriend. Veronica tells herself that she only wants to consult a friend, but Neptune's magnetic pull becomes too hard to resist.\n\nThe film is a ton of fun. It's still as whip smart as the series ever was, and the quips whiz by effortlessly and constantly... often right over the heads of those who aren't already baptized by the gospel of Veronica. The show quickly falls back into familiar rhythms, and the nine years away haven't dulled the character's verbal barbs. Prepare to be bathed in waves of wit. Even outside of the near-relentless banter, the show maintains a nice and heavy sense of tension when the mystery sets in, and things get serious. While the actual mystery itself is far from brilliant, it's still engaging enough to entertain. In any case, the main course here is the characters, and they are as stellar as ever. Keith Mars (the fantastic Enrico Colantoni) is still the easy frontrunner for dad of the millennium.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about the film is how much it feels like the Veronica Mars of old, and that's the best compliment we can pay it. The returning cast members slip into their old roles with so much ease, and the film never feels like it's straining to regain that old Neptune spark. It turns out that watching a near 30 Veronica is just as much fun as watching the sleuth in her teenage years. And the fact that the show's general formula doesn't feel out of place now that we're following a load of late 20-somethings instead of high schoolers probably says something about how smartly and strongly crafted the original show was in the first place.\n\nRob Thomas clearly isn't trying to broaden his formula to catch new fans, and it doesn't make sense that he'd do so anyway. This is clearly a film built from the ground up for Veronica Mars fans, as it should be. A hefty intro montage at the beginning tries its best to get newcomers caught up on the three seasons of the television show, but if you didn't spend at least a couple hours cruising along the seedy streets of Neptune all those years ago, some of the film's charm might be lost on you.\n\nThe Veronica Mars film, at its core, is basically a damned good two hour episode of the original series. Now, that's not exactly ambitious, but the fans that put down their hard earned money to fund the film weren't necessarily paying for ambition. What we have here is unquestionably and purely Veronica Mars. So self-assured and comfortable in it's own celluloid skin, it's a film that dutifully embraces everything that made that series so brilliant and fun in the first place. Welcome home, Veronica, it's been a while."", ""By Jordan Smith, Hollywood StaffIt's remarkable how much Veronica Mars feels like coming home again.\nBut thanks to creator Rob Thomas' audacious Kickstarter and a brewing cult of fans, Veronica Mars has been given a second chance at life, a chance that precious few shows receive.\nThis is clearly a film built from the ground up for Veronica Mars fans, as it should be.\nThe Veronica Mars film, at its core, is basically a damned good two hour episode of the original series.\nWhat we have here is unquestionably and purely Veronica Mars.""]"

Directed by Rob Thomas. Rated PG-13. Opens Friday; also available on VOD.\n\nFirst things first: Is there any point to seeing Veronica Mars if you weren’t a devoted fan of the TV show? In a word, no. Series creator Rob Thomas, who co-wrote the movie with Diane Ruggiero and directed it himself, appealed directly to the converted to get it financed, engineering the first truly high-profile Kickstarter campaign; more than $5 million poured in, and Thomas understandably opted to please those folks first and foremost. Apart from a quick prologue that functions like a TV episode’s “Previously On” segment, Veronica Mars doesn’t bother trying to bring newcomers up to speed, assuming not just passing familiarity with the characters and their relationships but also a devotion encompassing multiple viewings of multiple seasons. Everyone else will be vaguely aware that lots of references are sailing over their heads.\n\nThat said—and speaking from the perspective of someone who gave up on the show after its first eight episodes, mostly because I’m allergic to its case-of-the-week structure—the movie version does look like it’s more or less exactly what the faithful wished for when they pulled out their debit cards (which, of course, they’ll have to pull out again). Now a law-school graduate seeking employment in New York City, former teen gumshoe Veronica (Kristen Bell) reluctantly returns to her hometown of Neptune, California, when she learns that a former classmate who’d become a rock star was murdered, and that her ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring) is the prime suspect. Her usual voiceover-inflected investigation sees her check in with all of the series regulars, especially her private-eye father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), who’s dismayed to see Veronica risking her big-time dreams by getting sucked back into Neptune’s corruption.\n\nThis particular mystery isn’t terribly compelling, which is what prevents Veronica Mars from functioning as an effective stand-alone movie for neophytes (though it’s a damn sight more accessible than the first X-Files movie was). Fans will get what they desire, though—a reunion with Veronica, Keith, Logan, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Weevil (Francis Capra), etc.—and the film replicates the show’s distinctive flavor so well that it’s likely to eventually send some casual home viewers scurrying to find the series box sets. In short, you already know whether or not you want to see it. Act accordingly.', 'Veronica Mars Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, Enrico Colantoni.\nDirected by Rob Thomas.\nFirst things first: Is there any point to seeing Veronica Mars if you weren’t a devoted fan of the TV show?\nThis particular mystery isn’t terribly compelling, which is what prevents Veronica Mars from functioning as an effective stand-alone movie for neophytes (though it’s a damn sight more accessible than the first X-Files movie was).\nIn short, you already know whether or not you want to see it.']"
11361,http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2014-03-13/film/veronica-mars-review/,entertainment,"['According to lore, Liberace used to greet the tourists who\'d come by bus to gawk at his bejeweled home with the line, ""I hope you like it. After all, you paid for it!"" Not everyone has to like Rob Thomas\' Veronica Mars, the feature-length incarnation of his much-loved television series, which ran from 2004 to 2007. But the fans who helped finance the movie, via a ferociously successful 2013 Kickstarter campaign, have every reason to like it: It\'s been crafted affectionately for them, bringing back nearly every original cast member — chief among them Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni — and, instead of lifting the characters out of amber and trying to jolt their stories back to life, treating them like actual human beings who have gone on living while we weren\'t looking. For people who loved the show, as I did, it\'s like fan fiction without the delusional megalomania. We don\'t have to keep writing these characters\' stories for ourselves; Thomas has done it for us — and, trust me, he\'s better at it.\n\nWhen we last saw Bell\'s Veronica Mars, she was still a teenage detective in the small, moneyed Southern California town of Neptune. Now she\'s a bona fide adult just out of law school and eager to start a new career in New York. Ten years out of high school, she has no intention of going back for the planned reunion, even though it would give her a chance to visit her father, Keith Mars (Colantoni). Keith, a onetime Neptune sheriff, raised Veronica largely by himself: Her mother, a troubled woman with a drinking problem, skipped out on the family after Keith was run off the job for being principled. At that point, Veronica, who used to be part of the town\'s in crowd, was demoted to loser status, but that demotion also led her to develop surprisingly sophisticated investigative skills — on the series, she put those to use in solving the murder of her best friend, making her father proud.\n\nVeronica wants nothing to do with Neptune now. She\'s living with the sweet-natured but (still) clearly not-right-for-her Stosh ""Piz"" Piznowski (Chris Lowell), who has been in love with her since the two were teenagers. And she\'s seemingly forgotten her volatile and complex on-again, off-again ex-boyfriend, Logan (Jason Dohring). The key word is ""seemingly"": When Veronica learns that Logan is a suspect in the death of his rock-star girlfriend (she\'s been electrocuted in the bathtub), she senses something isn\'t right and books a plane ticket home.\n\nInfo Veronica Mars Gets Kickstarted Into Adulthood\n\nThe elaborate plotting isn\'t the film\'s strongest feature. I suspect that anyone unfamiliar with the show might get tangled up in the threads that Thomas and his co-writer, Diane Ruggiero, spin out. But as with all great TV shows, on Veronica Mars, the really interesting things were all happening in the margins, and here, Thomas, Ruggiero, and the cast make the most of every available corner. Logan is now in the military, a pretty wild choice for a spoiled rich kid. But, thank God, Thomas understands the distinction between what\'s believable and what\'s realistic. In movie terms, Logan\'s choice is wholly believable, especially when we see him in uniform. He meets Veronica at the airport in his dress whites, and though she can\'t resist making an Officer and a Gentleman wisecrack (who could?), he\'s so tall and solemn and quietly lovestruck that we can see her going weak at the knees. She blurts out what we\'re thinking: ""You should only ever wear that, like, ever.""\n\nOn the show, Logan was the sort of character who was hateful at the beginning and irresistibly beguiling by the end. Dohring still has that boyish, vaguely bratty look, though now it\'s laced with gravity. But it\'s the reunion between Colantoni and Bell that proves the movie\'s most gratifying element. The Keith-Veronica dynamic was one of the great father-daughter relationships of modern storytelling, a sturdy meshwork of mutual protectiveness, respect, and affection. Bell and Colantoni easily pick up where they left off in 2007. Bell has always been a sly, sparkling presence, though she hasn\'t had the movie career she deserves, at least until recently. (She\'s the voice of Anna in the Disney hit Frozen.)\n\nSeven years after the demise of the show, Bell is more grown-up and definitely curvier — she\'s like a real person, only better looking — and her timing is more playful and precise than ever. Colantoni, who may be best remembered by movie audiences as Thermian leader Mathesar in the superb sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest, is an extraordinarily subtle actor, which may be why he made such a good TV dad for Veronica. His bald pate gave his eyebrows lots of room to roam, and they needed it, considering the trouble she kept getting herself into. But he was always as amused by his daughter as he was frustrated by her sometimes misguided independence, and he was never overbearing or sentimental in his love for her. The nuances of their relationship carry over into this new iteration of Veronica Mars. If you\'ve never seen the show, it\'s a great excuse for binge-watching. And if you loved the show, the movie is a welcome homecoming. It has the feeling of a story that has been, against all odds, loved into existence. Probably because that\'s exactly what it is.\n\nDirected by Rob Thomas. Written by Rob Thomas and Diane Ruggiero. Starring Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, Krysten Ritter, Ryan Hansen, Francis Capra, Percy Daggs III, Gaby Hoffmann, Chris Lowell, and Enrico Colantoni.

But as someone who did watch—and love—the show, my recommendation to those of you who have not is: Go watch the series, all of it, then wait seven years. Then watch the film. Does that sound insane? The surge of delayed gratification that will wash over you upon being reunited with Veronica Mars, the surliest of blonds, and her snap-crackling fictional universe, will make it worthwhile. For those reasonable people unwilling to undergo this exercise in both binge-watching and self-denial, be aware that the film plays like an extended, excellent episode of the show, a distinction I do not mean as an insult, but a compliment: The Veronica Mars movie is exactly what the people paid for, and what they paid for is more TV.\n\nMore than most films, which arrive in theaters with both artistic and financial expectations the audience is aware of, the Veronica Mars movie comes to us as both a piece of entertainment and a new sort of commercial product. A year ago, the show’s creator, Rob Thomas, launched a Kickstarter campaign for the movie that raised twice as much money as needed in a record amount of time and immediately suggested a whole new semi-crowd-sourced way to fund certain projects. (Warner Bros. kicked in funds as well.) The movie is being released in theaters and on VOD simultaneously this Friday, and how it performs economically and artistically will have bearing on what happens next: Is this just the first film of this kind, or will it also be one of the last?\n\nI don’t know how much money Veronica Mars will make, or how much money it has to make to be deemed a success, but as means of fan-satisfaction it is a needle to a major vein. Unlike the new, structurally complex Arrested Development, Veronica Mars’ only ambition seems to be to deliver a product of the same quality as the incisive, quippy show—not at all a low bar. By unapologetically being an extended TV-episode in movie form, Veronica Mars keeps on keeping on with its major theme: taking things that are assumed to be adorable and unserious and safe and complicating the hell out of them.\n\nThe show told the story of a teenage PI, a blonde resident of Neptune, Calif., who starts solving crimes for her classmates. This description conjures to mind something cute and fluffy, but Veronica Mars is about as cute and fluffy as a mangy, underfed hyena. Kristen Bell, who plays Mars, may look like a cutie patootie, but she projects an icy hauteur and impatient intelligence. If the show sounds like a light-teen drama, week in and week out it was a surprisingly witty detective caper about class warfare, starring a newly unpopular heroine whose best friend had died and whose mother had left, who channeled her sadness and rage into a relentless, OCD hunt for various truths in a beach town as seedy as it was posh.\n\nThe movie picks up 10 years after the show ended (basically so Veronica can attend her high-school reunion) and immediately begins grappling once again with deceptive appearances. Veronica has spent a decade becoming an upstanding and mentally healthy citizen, a “marshmallow” in the show’s parlance. She transferred to Stanford, got a law degree, is up for a big job at a fancy firm (she’s interviewed by Jamie Lee Curtis, one of the celebrities to make a cameo), and is in a relationship with nice guy Piz (Chris Lowell), and has not worked a case in years. She is finally the normal woman everyone always assumed her to be.\n\nBut then Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), Veronica’s very troubled, totally true love gets arrested for murder. (The chemistry between Veronica and Logan is another one of the show’s mysteries; ice princess meets sporadically fey bad boy does not sound like a recipe for a destabilizing-ly hubba-hubba relationship, but this is just another way Veronica Mars teaches us not to judge couples by their cover.) Veronica gets pulled in for one last case, a bad decision she makes both helplessly and knowingly, even as her beloved father looks on disapprovingly.\n\nThe recurring theme in her voice-over is one of addiction: Veronica knows she is making unhealthy choices, but she can’t stop herself, partly because she loves the drama (and Logan), and also, because she is bored out of her mind. The movie is a kind of superhero story, but a little perverse; the hero has to be reborn, but she can only do so by giving into her own not-particularly-healthy flaws and accepting that she thrives in a not-particularly-healthy place.\n\nThere are thing about this film that will aggravate people who have never seen the show: the aforementioned voice-over, the endless parade of characters they are clearly supposed to know but don’t. Even for fans, the mystery itself is not particularly thrilling. (This actually mirrors long-ago complaints about the series, which after its first season-long mystery never could gin up another with the same emotional heft.) But mostly the Veronica Mars movie is an object lesson in what TV can do that movies can’t: give its audience 60-plus hours of intimate knowledge of a huge cast of characters and their various interpersonal relationships. If you put in the time with the show, watching all of those dynamics pay-off in the movie is a high-order treat. And from the looks of things, there’s no reason it has to be the last: Veronica Mars is now poised to become as many movies as TV watchers are willing to pay for.', 'Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars may look like a cutie patootie, but she projects an icy hauteur and impatient intelligence.\nI cannot speak to the experience of watching the new Kickstarter-funded Veronica Mars movie without ever having seen Veronica Mars, the teen-detective TV series that ran for three seasons on UPN and then the CW from 2004 to 2007.\nThe surge of delayed gratification that will wash over you upon being reunited with Veronica Mars, the surliest of blonds, and her snap-crackling fictional universe, will make it worthwhile.\nMore than most films, which arrive in theaters with both artistic and financial expectations the audience is aware of, the Veronica Mars movie comes to us as both a piece of entertainment and a new sort of commercial product.\nThis description conjures to mind something cute and fluffy, but Veronica Mars is about as cute and fluffy as a mangy, underfed hyena.']"

Veronica and Piz versus Veronica and Logan. But why must we make Veronica, or really any heroine, choose?\n\nIt\'s no news that the love triangle is a trope, especially when it comes to TV focused on teens or young adults. Don\'t get me wrong, I love a good romance, a good love triangle even. But triangles can also breed something a little more sinister. Take a highly competent female character and suddenly define her by her choice of Man A or Man B. It\'s disappointingly reductive, particularly when often the best answer is none of the above. Then there\'s the characterization of these triangles, in which romantic options tend to fall into a familiar binary: there\'s the safe choice or the dangerous one.\n\nLook at Veronica\'s choices. On one hand we have sweet, safe, somewhat sexless Piz. On the other we have brooding, smoldering Logan. Logan whose actions before the start of the series contributed in part to Veronica\'s rape. Logan who loves Veronica deeply but has the power to be unbearably cruel to her. You see this pattern reflected in all sorts of shows, to some degree. Felicity\'s title character was stuck between enigmatic (but magnetic) Ben and sweet (but annoyingly passive) Noel. The triangle was such a defining part of the show that when it got picked up for an unexpected five episodes in its final season, the writers injected a time-travel plot to explore what would have happened if Felicity had picked Noel instead of Ben. In the latter years of the WB, Gilmore Girls\' Rory is forced to choose between her first love Dean or the new-in-town, street smart, fight-starting Jess.\n\nBut perhaps the best example of a Veronica Mars predecessor is Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the show to which Veronica Mars owes the most, wherein Buffy is either paired off with vampire-with-a-soul Angel or lovesick baddie Spike.\n\nBuffy is never faced with the direct choice, but Spike versus Angel is a topic that still inspires debate. When Sarah Michelle Gellar said in a Reddit AMA a few weeks ago that she would choose Angel over Spike, BuzzFeed published a story with the headline: ""Sarah Michelle Gellar Just Picked Angel Over Spike And Nothing Will Ever Be The Same."" Ignoring the hyperbole inherent in freaking out over the non-binding opinion of an actress about the show she was on almost fifteen years ago, let\'s consider Buffy\'s options for a second. In the Buffy narrative, Angel is a vampire with a soul who can\'t have sex with Buffy or he\'ll achieve one moment of true happiness, have his soul taken away, and become truly evil. Meanwhile, Spike is a reformed villain once intent on killing Buffy, who Buffy is drawn to in the midst of her deep season six depression.

But it was a smart, well-written series with an attractive female lead who flashes movie star potential. Kristen Bell has gotten several chances to establish herself on the big screen, finally living up to her potential in ""Frozen,"" even if that was just her voice.\n\nBell now returns to the role she was born to play in ""Veronica Mars,"" a show with a loyal enough fan base to build a successful Kickstarter campaign last year that will likely translate into a solid box office.\n\nObviously, not all recent TV show have the potential to be a movie. Look at ""Sex and the City,"" whose film adaptations never quite hit the mark.\n\nHowever, there are some currently on TV that, like ""Veronica Mars,"" would make the transition to the big screen seem relatively easy. Here are seven that make sense:\n\n""How I Met Your Mother""\n\nFirst, there\'s the cast. Alyson Hannigan, Josh Radnor and, especially, Jason Segel have all had solid success in the movie world. Second, if there\'s one main criticism of ""How I Met Your Mother,"" it\'s that the show has dragged on too long. Still, the concept is brilliant and would certainly work in a rom-com film format. I imagine it would look something like Radnor\'s previous film projects (""Happythankyoumoreplease;"" ""Liberal Arts""), which had some very endearing moments. Surround him with the cast of ""HIMYM"" and it\'s a winning formula.\n\n""The Walking Dead""\n\n""The Walking Dead\'s"" pacing has been a bit slow as of late, but a commenter recently suggested the current season reminds him of the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy\'s ""The Road."" I enjoyed that film (minus those annoying flashbacks with Charlize Theron\'s character). Of course, Frank Darabont would have to direct.\n\n""Scandal""\n\nIt\'s such an over-the-top thrill ride. I can\'t help but think fans would flock to theaters to see a film version. I\'m not saying it would win any Academy Awards, but ""Scandal"" would benefit from the same kind of audience that enjoys Tyler Perry\'s work. Only, Shonda Rhimes characters seem slightly more realistic... slightly.\n\n""House of Cards""\n\nNetflix\'s hit original series does have a cinematic vibe to it. It doesn\'t hurt that lead actor Kevin Spacey is a two-time Academy Award winter who can handle just about any type of storyline.\n\n""Vikings""\n\nThe success of the History channel\'s ""Vikings"" has been a big surprise. The show\'s style and vibe would certainly fit in with recent films that have hit theaters recently like ""Pompeii"" and ""300: Rise of an Empire."" ""Vikings"" already has the proper lead in Travis Fimmel, who will star in 2016\'s ""Warcraft.""\n\n""Sons of Anarchy""\n\nThe biker tale that draws influence from Shakespeare\'s ""Hamlet"" is a great TV show and maybe the only one on this list that might work even better as a movie. It would have been quite easy to see Jax (Charlie Hunnam) riding into town to seize control of his late father\'s crew now run by the uncle-like figure that ultimately murdered Jax\'s papa. When ""SOA"" wraps its television run after next season, I wouldn\'t mind seeing a movie sequel, prequel or spinoff in the works.\n\n""True Detective""\n\nWell, this one is pretty obvious. The show\'s first season, which just wrapped, starred two of Hollywood\'s best film actors in Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Watching ""True Detective"" each week was invigorating. Still, I don\'t think anyone would argue against a film version.', 'Veronica MarsKristen Bell in a scene from ""Veronica Mars.""\n(Warner Bros.)CLEVELAND, Ohio – There are reasons ""Veronica Mars"" works as a television show and a movie, but it has nothing to do with mainstream popularity.\n""Veronica Mars"" was not a ratings success.\nHowever, there are some currently on TV that, like ""Veronica Mars,"" would make the transition to the big screen seem relatively easy.\nThe show\'s first season, which just wrapped, starred two of Hollywood\'s best film actors in Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.']"

Forced to return to her hometown just as Neptune High is about to hold her class’ 10th Anniversary reunion, Veronica is caught up in another mystery from the past which may lead to answers that will get Logan off the suspect list.\n\nLast week, Veronica Mars herself, Kristen Bell, creator/writer/director Rob Thomas and some of the primary cast were brought down to Dallas, Texas where ComingSoon.net got to sit down with them to talk about the movie. Also on hand were Jason Dohring and Chris Lowell, who play Veronica’s love interests, Ryan Hansen as the popular comic relief Dick Casablanca, and Krysten Ritter who returns as Veronica’s classmate Gia Goodman.\n\nIn the video player below, you can watch Kristen talk about how she never lost hope about Veronica Mars coming back and how the fans (and even journalists’ questions about the show) kept her hope alive.

Now the show about a teenage girl detective is back in the news again: After star Kristen Bell and creator Rob Thomas launched one of the first celebrity Kickstarter campaigns two years ago, the “Veronica Mars” movie is a real thing — and is opening this Friday. (Here in the Seattle area, it’ll be at the Alderwood, Kent Station, Oak Tree, Pacific Place, Southcenter and Woodinville AMC theaters.) Here’s a New York Times story about the making of the film: astonishingly, more than 91,000 donors raised about $5.7 million. None of those people will share in any profits the film might make, but many were rewarded with cameo roles in the film, autographed posters and other gifts. Warner Bros., which owned the rights to “Veronica Mars,” initially was reluctant to fund the movie — thus paving the way for Kickstarter — but is now releasing it, with a cautious start of only about 270 theaters nationwide.

With just a few days to go, there’s quite a bit of preparation that needs to be done before actually seeing the movie.\n\nWe don’t know about you, but even though we’ve had almost a year to process the fact that we are, in fact, getting a Veronica Mars movie, it still doesn’t seem real. At all. So, we realized that before going to see the movie or before streaming it in our living rooms, we first need to prepare our mental states as well as our general excitement levels.\n\n“What’s the best way to prepare for Veronica Mars?” you may ask. Well, here are eight of the most important/best ways that you can make sure that you’re ready for the epicness that is Veronica Mars.\n\nWatch the trailer on repeat.\n\nThough you’ve probably seen the amazingly fantastic Veronica Mars movie trailer a billion and a half times by now, you can never really watch it too many times. After all, we always see new things that we’ve never seen before with every pass through. It took us quite a few times to spot Dax Shepard and even more times to try to figure out whose body was in the photo towards the end (note: we still haven’t been able to figure that one out). Mostly though, it’s just a wonderfully made trailer that deserves to be watched over and over again. It’s perfectly polished, timed, and edited. Watching it at least once a day between now and the premiere is the least you should do to prepare for the movie.\n\nInvest in the soundtrack(s).\n\nOne of the best things about the Veronica Mars series (in addition to its amazing cast and witty dialogue) is its fantastic soundtrack and score. The show always featured such fresh, interesting music and had a pretty emotional score. Lucky for all of us, not only does the show have an official soundtrack, but the movie has an official soundtrack album AND score for us to purchase as well! While the score won’t be released until Friday when the movie comes out (in order to avoid spoilers), the soundtrack is now on sale on iTunes and Amazon. You can also stream the Veronica Mars soundtrack to decide whether or not you want to buy it (although we highly suggest it because it’s pretty good).\n\n(Re)Watch the series.\n\nThanks to the technological advances/improvements that have happened over the last seven years, there are quite a few ways for you to either watch or rewatch the series, depending on if you’re a newbie or a super fan.\n\nDon’t have time to rewatch the entire series? Then at least watch all of the important or best episodes, or your all-time favorites. We have a list of our favorite LoVe moments, if that helps. Still can’t decide which ones to watch? We’ve got an article about that! Also, not-so-shameless plug: Download and listen to our ReWatchable podcast and hear the theories and opinions of other newbies (and superfans). You may even learn a few things about the series as a whole that you didn’t pick up on at first.\n\nBONUS: Play a drinking game while watching the show! Come up with your own rules and see how many episodes you can get through. Or, wait until our official Veronica Mars drinking game comes out on Thursday and use that for both your rewatch and your first time watching the movie (if you’re watching at home or are in a theater that allows/serves drinks).\n\nRefresh yourself on the characters that you’ll see in the movie.\n\nLucky for you, we’ve already compiled a list of stars and characters that will be gracing the big screen in Veronica Mars. In fact, we not only added names to the list as Rob Thomas had announced them but also mentioned what was going on with them the last time we saw them, therefore saving you the hassle of researching all of the people who have been announced as cast members. You can find the entire list of characters and actors in our article, “The Veronica Mars Movie characters: Do you remember them?”\n\nKeep reading to check out our most entertaining suggestions!', 'This Friday, Veronica Mars will be hitting AMC movie theater screens and personal TV screens all around the world.\n“What’s the best way to prepare for Veronica Mars?” you may ask.\nWell, here are eight of the most important/best ways that you can make sure that you’re ready for the epicness that is Veronica Mars.\nThough you’ve probably seen the amazingly fantastic Veronica Mars movie trailer a billion and a half times by now, you can never really watch it too many times.\nYou can find the entire list of characters and actors in our article, “The Veronica Mars Movie characters: Do you remember them?”Keep reading to check out our most entertaining suggestions!']"

After all, you paid for it!” Not everyone has to like Rob Thomas’s Veronica Mars, the feature-length incarnation of his much-loved television series, which ran from 2004 to 2007. But the fans who helped finance the movie, via a ferociously successful 2013 Kickstarter campaign, have every reason to like it: It’s been crafted affectionately for them, bringing back nearly every original cast member ― chief among them Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni ― and, instead of lifting the characters out of amber and trying to jolt their stories back to life, treating them like actual human beings who have gone on living while we weren’t looking. For people who loved the show, as I did, it’s like fan fiction without the delusional megalomania. We don’t have to keep writing these characters’ stories for ourselves; Thomas has done it for us ― and, trust me, he’s better at it.\n\nWhen we last saw Bell’s Veronica Mars, she was still a teenage detective in the small, moneyed Southern California town of Neptune. Now she’s a bona fide adult just out of law school and eager to start a new career in New York. Ten years out of high school, she has no intention of going back for the planned reunion, even though it would give her a chance to visit her father, Keith Mars (Colantoni). Keith, a onetime Neptune sheriff, raised Veronica largely by himself: Her mother, a troubled woman with a drinking problem, skipped out on the family after Keith was run off the job for being principled. At that point, Veronica, who used to be part of the town’s in crowd, was demoted to loser status, but that demotion also led her to develop surprisingly sophisticated investigative skills ― on the series, she put those to use in solving the murder of her best friend, making her father proud.\n\nVeronica wants nothing to do with Neptune now. She’s living with the sweet-natured but (still) clearly not-right-for-her Stosh “Piz” Piznowski (Chris Lowell), who has been in love with her since the two were teenagers. And she’s seemingly forgotten her volatile and complex on-again, off-again ex-boyfriend, Logan (Jason Dohring). The key word is “seemingly”: When Veronica learns that Logan is a suspect in the death of his rock-star girlfriend (she’s been electrocuted in the bathtub), she senses something isn’t right and books a plane ticket home.\n\nInfo Directed by Rob Thomas. Written by Rob Thomas and Diane Ruggiero. Starring Kristen Bell, Jason Dohring, Krysten Ritter, Ryan Hansen, Francis Capra, Percy Daggs III, Gaby Hoffmann, Chris Lowell and Enrico Colantoni.\n\nThe elaborate plotting isn’t the film’s strongest feature. I suspect that anyone unfamiliar with the show might get tangled up in the threads that Thomas and his co-writer, Diane Ruggiero, spin out. But as with all great TV shows, on Veronica Mars, the really interesting things were all happening in the margins, and here, Thomas, Ruggiero, and the cast make the most of every available corner. Logan is now in the military, a pretty wild choice for a spoiled rich kid. But, thank God, Thomas understands the distinction between what’s believable and what’s realistic. In movie terms, Logan’s choice is wholly believable, especially when we see him in uniform. He meets Veronica at the airport in his dress whites, and though she can’t resist making an Officer and a Gentleman wisecrack (who could?), he’s so tall and solemn and quietly lovestruck that we can see her going weak at the knees. She blurts out what we’re thinking: “You should only ever wear that, like, ever.”\n\nOn the show, Logan was the sort of character who was hateful at the beginning and irresistibly beguiling by the end. Dohring still has that boyish, vaguely bratty look, though now it’s laced with gravity. But it’s the reunion between Colantoni and Bell that proves the movie’s most gratifying element. The KeithÐVeronica dynamic was one of the great father-daughter relationships of modern storytelling, a sturdy meshwork of mutual protectiveness, respect, and affection. Bell and Colantoni easily pick up where they left off in 2007. Bell has always been a sly, sparkling presence, though she hasn’t had the movie career she deserves, at least until recently. (She’s the voice of Anna in the Disney hit Frozen.)\n\nSeven years after the demise of the show, Bell is more grown up and definitely curvier ― she’s like a real person, only better looking ― and her timing is more playful and precise than ever. Colantoni, who may be best remembered by movie audiences as Thermian leader Mathesar in the superb sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest, is an extraordinarily subtle actor, which may be why he made such a good TV dad for Veronica. His bald pate gave his eyebrows lots of room to roam, and they needed it, considering the trouble she kept getting herself into. But he was always as amused by his daughter as he was frustrated by her sometimes misguided independence, and he was never overbearing or sentimental in his love for her. The nuances of their relationship carry over into this new iteration of Veronica Mars. If you’ve never seen the show, it’s a great excuse for binge-watching. And if you loved the show, the movie is a welcome homecoming. It has the feeling of a story that has been, against all odds, loved into existence. Probably because that’s exactly what it is.', 'After all, you paid for it!” Not everyone has to like Rob Thomas’s Veronica Mars, the feature-length incarnation of his much-loved television series, which ran from 2004 to 2007.\nWhen we last saw Bell’s Veronica Mars, she was still a teenage detective in the small, moneyed Southern California town of Neptune.\nTen years out of high school, she has no intention of going back for the planned reunion, even though it would give her a chance to visit her father, Keith Mars (Colantoni).\nBut as with all great TV shows, on Veronica Mars, the really interesting things were all happening in the margins, and here, Thomas, Ruggiero, and the cast make the most of every available corner.\nThe nuances of their relationship carry over into this new iteration of Veronica Mars.']"

11405,http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2014/0312/Veronica-Mars-Is-the-movie-worth-checking-out-Here-s-the-review,entertainment,"['Canceled by the CW in 2007, the cult-fave mystery series ""Veronica Mars"" completed its third season. Revived for the big screen, the gumshoe drama finds its title character, nine years later, insisting that she\'s in a mellower frame of mind, no longer the angry, crime-solving young woman who thrills to danger. As if.\n\nAfter a murder hits close to home, the law-school grad tosses aside her sleek job-interview threads and is soon sleuthing it up among the rich, famous, corrupt and depraved who populate her SoCal hometown. Kristen Bell is in fine form as the sharp-witted and stiletto-tongued Veronica, whose high polish on the art of sarcasm has endeared her to fans as a supremely self-possessed outsider.\n\nAs with the TV show, the connect-the-dots mystery solving is less interesting than the character dynamics; crimes unravel with a directness that feels aimed at younger audiences. The dark doings are leavened, and sometimes undercut, by comedy, and by angst that\'s not far removed from adolescence. Thomas\' sex, drugs and rock \'n\' roll neo-noir has a young-adult heart that still beats strong, even with Veronica and her friends well into their twenties. The 10-year reunion of Neptune High just happens to be impending when Veronica returns home to help solve a murder, and teen allegiances, animosities and romances loom large in the film, which features many actors reprising their small-screen roles.\n\nCreator Rob Thomas and co-scripter Diane Ruggiero provide a concise recap of the series\' trajectory, in the form of a stylized montage with voiceover narration, that will bring even newbies up to speed on the central character. Cut to Manhattan, where the sight of Veronica in the glass-walled conference room of a prestigious Manhattan law firm, interviewing for a job, is bound to disappoint aficionados, who are used to seeing her speak truth to power, not cozy up to it.\n\nThe crime that brings her back to her fictitious beach town of Neptune, Calif., is the apparent murder of pop star Bonnie DeVille (Andrea Estella), a high school classmate and girlfriend of Veronica\'s former flame Logan (Jason Dohring), himself a demi-celebrity because he\'s the son of an actor. He\'s suspect No. 1, and Veronica doesn\'t hesitate to drop everything to help him, leaving behind a potential new job in New York and supportive boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell). The Piz-Logan dilemma — good guy vs. bad boy, straightforward vs. complicated — is a fundamental element of the movie, in a way that starts out YA and turns believably grown-up messy.\n\nAs she digs into the case, Veronica reconnects with close friends Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III), trades barbs with surfer jerk Dick (Ryan Hansen), and circumvents the dishonest, obstructionist sheriff (Jerry O\'Connell). In the process she crosses paths with a fan of the dead pop singer (Gaby Hoffmann) and uncovers a very cold 9-year-old case that involves a collective silence among her former classmates.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nThe screenplay doesn\'t avoid bouts of where-are-they-now exposition as it draws connective lines between high school and adulthood. But at its strongest, as in Veronica\'s relationship with her sheriff-turned-private-investigator father (Enrico Colantoni), there\'s no need to spell things out. Colantoni is understated and terrific as a man who has weathered serious challenges and reversals. The father-daughter chemistry between him and Bell is an essential component of the movie, as of the series – loaded with emotion but never lapsing into sentimentality.\n\nA dark thread runs through the movie that has no direct bearing on the crimes Veronica is trying to solve. She makes repeated references to her absent alcoholic mother and, most jarringly, to addiction in general. It\'s a thread that doesn\'t feel fully integrated into the film, but suggests material that Thomas might explore if he decides to make a second Veronica Mars feature.', 'Canceled by the CW in 2007, the cult-fave mystery series ""Veronica Mars"" completed its third season.\nKristen Bell is in fine form as the sharp-witted and stiletto-tongued Veronica, whose high polish on the art of sarcasm has endeared her to fans as a supremely self-possessed outsider.\n1, and Veronica doesn\'t hesitate to drop everything to help him, leaving behind a potential new job in New York and supportive boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell).\nA dark thread runs through the movie that has no direct bearing on the crimes Veronica is trying to solve.\nIt\'s a thread that doesn\'t feel fully integrated into the film, but suggests material that Thomas might explore if he decides to make a second Veronica Mars feature.']"

With backing from 91,585 fans, the film received more contributions than any other project in the crowdfunding platform\'s history.\n\nThe initial goal was $2 million, which would allow creator Rob Thomas to turn the TV series into a low-budget movie. Fans hit that mark in less than 12 hours, donating anything from $1 (which earned ""eternal gratitude"" from the makers) to $10,000 (which got one lucky backer a speaking role in the movie).

11410,http://www.thekansan.com/article/20140311/ENTERTAINMENTLIFE/140319806/0/sports,entertainment,"['This week, teen detective Veronica Mars heads to the big screen, making a surprise comeback after a Kickstarter campaign helped to resurrect the character. ""Veronica Mars"" is a cult favorite TV series that continued to have a fan base following its cancellation in 2007 after just three seasons. A Kickstarter campaign raised a surprising $5.7 million from fans for a film featuring the title character, played by Kristen Bell.\n\nWhile I\'ve never watched the original ""Veronica Mars"" TV show, I\'m excited for fans of the series, and I hope the film will be satisfying. Early reviews on Rotten Tomatoes are mostly positive, and I\'m curious to see how the film performs at the box office. If the film is a hit, it may offer hope to fans of other well-loved TV shows canceled before their time.\n\nThere isn\'t always justice in the world of television, and sometimes really good shows slip under the radar or aren\'t given enough time to grow before studios give them the axe. If fans are lucky, show runners are given a head\'s up about the impending cancellation, and they can at least try to give fans some closure. Other times, a show is canceled mid-season, and we\'re left to ponder what might have been.\n\nHowever, whether a canceled show can be revived and whether it should be revived are two different questions. Sometimes it\'s not easy to recapture the magic a cult hit had during its first run. For example, reviews were mixed when the comedy ""Arrested Development"" returned to Netflix for a 15 episode season last year.\n\nSo, why are successful TV revivals challenging, even if most of the original cast and crew return? It may depend, in part, on how much time has passed between the cancelation and the revival. In between those times, all the actors, writers and directors have (presumably) participated in different projects, and they\'ve changed as people and evolved as performers. It\'s tough to capture the exact same feeling as the show\'s original run. Also, fan expectations increase the longer viewers have to wait for a revival, and it is perhaps inevitable that when the revival does happen, the content — no matter how good it is — often feels like a little bit of a letdown. That\'s why I\'m hesitant to see some of my favorite canceled TV shows revived, especially if it has been several years (or more) since they were canceled.\n\nPerhaps no other canceled-before-its-time show is more beloved than Joss Whedon\'s sci-fi Western ""Firefly."" The show may have lasted a mere 14 episodes, but it\'s one of my all-time favorite TV series. It has (at least in my opinion) :) one of the best ensemble casts ever put together for a TV show; every single one of the characters is a complex, multi-layered person who challenges stereotypes. And yet, as much as it breaks my heart to say it, I don\'t know if I want a ""Firefly"" revival.\n\nYes, it was canceled far too soon, and despite a 2005 movie, ""Serenity,"" that tied up some loose ends, fans will always have to wonder about unexplored possibilities. Would hired gun Jayne Cobb have ever reached a point where the money was good enough for him to actually betray Captain Malcolm Reynolds and the rest of the crew? Was Shepherd Book really a traveling preacher, and what secrets remain hidden in his past? Why did licensed companion Inara really decide to join up with a gang of smugglers and criminals — was she running from something, or looking for something?\n\nAlthough ""Firefly"" fans would like to know the answers to these questions, it has now been more than a decade since ""Firefly"" went off the air. I guess I\'d rather have the show ride off into the sunset, leaving us satisfied but wanting more, than come back and have the revival not quite live up to the hopes we had for it. The ""Serenity"" movie also complicates matters because it limits what show runners could do plot-wise in a series revival. If they set the revival after the movie, the show would be missing several key characters, who died in the film. Would the show still be a success without these characters?\n\nThere are other shows I loved but ended too soon: quirky crime drama ""The Unusuals"" and Edgar Wright\'s hilarious but too brief British sitcom, ""Spaced,"" which lasted just 14 episodes. However, like ""Firefly,"" sometimes it\'s hard to go back to what happened before.\n\nSo, what do you think? Are there canceled TV shows you\'d like to see revived? Or do you think a revival is too risky? What are some of your favorite canceled shows?', ""If the film is a hit, it may offer hope to fans of other well-loved TV shows canceled before their time.\nThat's why I'm hesitant to see some of my favorite canceled TV shows revived, especially if it has been several years (or more) since they were canceled.\nThe show may have lasted a mere 14 episodes, but it's one of my all-time favorite TV series.\nAre there canceled TV shows you'd like to see revived?\nWhat are some of your favorite canceled shows?""]"

Or does it have something to do with a long-ago tragedy involving rich bitch Gia (Krysten Ritter) and moronic surfer Dick (Ryan Hansen)?\n\nAnd is the corrupt new sheriff (Jerry O’Connell) trying to cover something up?\n\nVeronica’s visit coincides with her 10-year high school reunion, which facilitates cameo appearances and ups the number of potential red herrings, but doesn’t really do much for suspense.\n\nBell gives her all to a paper-thin script, but can’t generate much chemistry with either of her love interests.\n\nThe best parts of this awkwardly paced film are Bell’s scenes with Enrico Colantoni, who returns as her private investigator dad, concerned she’s throwing away a bright future by getting sucked back into her old life.\n\nThe worst part is cameos by James Franco and TMZ’s Harvey Levin, featured in a subplot about surreptitious celebrity surveillance that’s a lot less fresh and shocking than the filmmakers seem to think it is.\n\nFans can certainly feel free to add a star to my rating of “Veronica Mars.’’ Hopefully, the next crowd-sourced major studio film will be a little more ambitious.', 'Basically TV writ large, “Veronica Mars’’ is far less interesting (except, probably, to its fans) to me as movie than as a potential model for financing the kind of smaller films that major Hollywood studios aren’t much interested in making anymore.\n“Veronica Mars” is also making history as the first major studio film that’s simultaneously being released on the big screen — Warner Bros. is opening it in 270 theaters nationally — and via video-on-demand.\nIs the actual culprit a fan (a very funny Gaby Hoffman) of the dead woman with a thing for Logan?\nBell gives her all to a paper-thin script, but can’t generate much chemistry with either of her love interests.\nFans can certainly feel free to add a star to my rating of “Veronica Mars.’’ Hopefully, the next crowd-sourced major studio film will be a little more ambitious.']"
11424,http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/12/veronica-mars-review,entertainment,"['For fans of the 2004-2007 adolescent gumshoe series, the Veronica Mars\n\nThe Top 10 Veronica Mars Episodes\n\nLoading\n\nLoading\n\nIt’s a rare thing for a character to be as vividly realized as Veronica was. Thomas’ rapid-fire dialogue found a perfect vehicle for delivery in his lead actress, as Bell and young Veronica were a heavenly marriage of actor and role. Like its contemporaries Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Alias, the series had a large element of wish fulfillment. This was a 16-year-old girl who easily traversed the horrors of the mean girls and boys of high-school with a with a sharply hilarious comeback to every insult at the ready. Veronica stood at five-foot-nothing, but the 95-pound spitfire was as likely to incapacitate a criminal with Mr. Sparky - her trusty stun gun - as she was to solve a crime with “a few deft keystrokes.” Yet, Veronica was as defined by her vulnerabilities, her flaws, as she was by her strengths.When we first met her, Veronica was ruled by an inability to fully trust and a rage born of trauma and betrayal. She was relatable in that, like most of us, her strengths were also her weaknesses. Her determination became a stubborn, unforgiving, and often self-defeating rigidity. She would compromise nothing of herself for the sake of fitting in, smoothing things over, or having an easier life. Which is why it was interesting that Rob Thomas opened his film with a – seemingly – changed Veronica.It’s been nine years since lovely the Ms. Mars fled Hearst College and her troubled life in Neptune, CA. Now a law school graduate living in New York, we find the former sarcastic sleuth in a solid relationship with her college beau, Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski, and ready to embark on a high-powered corporate career. In the opening sequence, Veronica assures the audience that she is no longer the thrill-seeking trouble magnet that she once was. Enter Logan Echolls. Logan, Veronica’s one time nemesis-turned-lover, then embittered ex, calls her back home when he is accused of murder, and return to the siren call of mayhem she does. She\'s unable to deny her drive to play rescuer to Logan and/or threaten the truth out of people, but she also goes home in order to reconcile herself to her past and the girl she once was. Thomas does an admirable job of placing the viewer, essentially, right back where they left off.Sure, it’s a bit convenient that Veronica’s impromptu trip home coincides with a high-school reunion; and it’s hard to imagine that Piz and Veronica have reunited and built a new life in New York only to have their relationship tested by the same previous entanglement – in the form of Logan – as nine years prior. However, fans will let that go as some necessary set-up for what we’ve come to see…the conclusion of the open-ended series finale.As for the uninitiated, the base premise isn’t actually that far off from any given rom-com. That is to say, it\'s accessible. To be clear, Veronica Mars is not a romantic comedy, it is what it\'s always been, an odd mix of a screwball comedy, a noir thriller, and a coming-of-age tale. The film centers on a case that likely would have played out over a season if the show was still on the air: the death of Logan’s pop-star girlfriend (their former classmate, Carrie Bishop). Thomas takes all of the key elements that defined the series and heightens them: Logan and Veronica’s epic, ""lives-destroying"" love story; the economic tensions that often erupt in the town of Neptune, as those struggling for sustainability must confront blatant excess and corruption on a daily basis, little mini-cases in the midst of the larger mystery. Finally, and most importantly, the film, like the show, is about Veronica embracing all of who she is.It’s interesting, because at the end of the day, Logan is far more changed than Veronica, and really, we wouldn’t want it any other way. This isn\'t about Mars becoming a respectable adult, it\'s about her returning to the best of who she was as a teen. Veronica likens the allure of the dark side to an addiction, but in truth, any other path would be an abuse of her nature. This is not a woman who walks the straight and narrow; she is a warrior who spits in the face of convention. Veronica is simply incapable of playing it safe. The wish fulfillment is still present in that Veronica and her misfit childhood friends return to their reunion triumphant in their success and have the pleasure of facing their adolescent enemies in one final battle. The true adult-brand fantasy here, though, is the idea of relinquishing the shackles of corporate America, or any ill-fitting career, in favor of living a life as the bad-ass, idealistic, rebel you once were – and always thought you would be.', ""For fans of the 2004-2007 adolescent gumshoe series, the Veronica MarsThe Top 10 Veronica Mars EpisodesLoadingLoadingIt’s a rare thing for a character to be as vividly realized as Veronica was.\nIn the opening sequence, Veronica assures the audience that she is no longer the thrill-seeking trouble magnet that she once was.\nLogan, Veronica’s one time nemesis-turned-lover, then embittered ex, calls her back home when he is accused of murder, and return to the siren call of mayhem she does.\nTo be clear, Veronica Mars is not a romantic comedy, it is what it's always been, an odd mix of a screwball comedy, a noir thriller, and a coming-of-age tale.\nThis isn't about Mars becoming a respectable adult, it's about her returning to the best of who she was as a teen.""]"

Kristen and her fans would probably actually claim the series actually only really got two and a half, considering the third season, Bell’s character’s freshman year in college was shortened.\n\nNow the movie version of Veronica Mars is about to go live six years after the series was canceled and its welcoming back almost every recognizable character from that the television show. It wasn’t a particularly easy road from the small screen to the big. Kristen Bell and other members of the team that put the show had to be convinced there was a need for a movie version.\n\nCrowdsourcing the funding for Kristen’s latest big screen project was one way to convince not only those involved in production, but audiences nation wide there was still a demand. Producer Rob Thomas set out to raise $2 million through the crowdfunding site, Kickstarter. Not only did Kristen’s movie hit that goal inside of the first 24 hours, it nearly tripled it taking in around $5.7 million one day after the Kickstarter went online.\n\nThat incredible push to get Veronica Mars and all of her cohorts onto the movie screen genuinely moved Kristen Bell. Appearing on ABC’s Good Morning America, Bell said she was blown away by the support the effort to get the movie funded received.\n\nVeronica Mars takes place in the fictional California town of Neptune, where the very rich and the very poor cross paths only by accident or as employer and employees.

""We had made our $2 million in 24 hours and it had never been done before. People kept donating until we hit $5.7 million, which we wound up with. And then we were able to shoot in LA. We had a much higher production value than what was originally thought.""\n\nIt also meant the ""Veronica Mars"" cast members signed roughly 5,500 posters for their dedicated backers -- a lot more than they had originally planned, too. But Dohring isn\'t complaining. ""We\'re 100 percent here doing this because of our fan base and nothing else,"" he said.\n\n""Veronica Mars had been a long time coming. The TV series, which launched on The CW in 2004, saw its final episode air in 2007, much to the disappointment of its avid viewers. But Dohring says series creator Rob Thomas has been wanting to do a film ever since the show was canceled.\n\n""I think he was trying to make it through a bunch of different avenues,"" Dohring said. ""Kickstarter was sort of a last sort of possibility of making it.""\n\nIn the end, the Kickstarter campaign was probably the best thing that ever happened to the ""Veronica Mars"" movie, which also stars Kristen Bell, Krysten Ritter, Ryan Hansen, Francis Capra, Percy Daggs III, Percy Daggs III, Tina Majorino, Enrico Colantoni, Sam Huntington, Ken Marino, Max Greenfield and Jerry O\'Connell.\n\n""I was so nervous getting to the set the first day,"" Dohring recalled. ""You have all these big white trucks around. You\'re like, \'It\'s really happening.\' I had my first scene with Kristen. It was a low-key scene. Rob was right there. Having him at the helm was very settling -- he knew what he wanted because when he writes he can see the movie.""\n\nEveryone was ""awesome"" during filming, Dohring said, adding, ""It was sort of like getting the band back together...We have that tight family. We grew up together in San Diego just being on the show for three years right out of high school. We were with each other, shooting this tiny little show that we thought nobody was watching but, yet we were giving it our all to make it something very special.""\n\nApparently people were watching.\n\nOn Friday, when the film hits select theaters and becomes available on iTunes, fans will find out the fate of Bell\'s titular character, who had been a high school student and skilled private detective when the show aired. Fast forward several years, and that\'s where the movie picks up.\n\n""Veronica hasn\'t taken a case in seven years. She\'s gone to law school -- kind of gotten on the straight and narrow,"" said Dohring. ""She gets a call out of the blue from my character, whose pop-star girlfriend is murdered and he\'s the No. 1 suspect. And he needs her help to clear his name. She\'s not in that business anymore, she doesn\'t want to be back in that business. But it\'s an old friend and an old flame...she just needs to help him. And that\'s where we start out story.""\n\nAs for his Logan Echolls character, he\'s been trying to pick up the pieces. ""My character lost both his parents at different times. People break up with him. He\'s devastated constantly throughout the series, but it\'s balanced with good points. And he\'s in an emotional place...But he\'s putting himself back together. There are those little comments that people like so much,"" he said.\n\nWhen asked about the on-screen chemistry between Logan and Veronica, Dohring revealed, ""You\'ll see more of that as it were...All the relationships that people love are all in the movie.""\n\n""The movie is so good. I just saw it two weeks ago,"" Dohring added about the film, which premiered last week at SXSW. ""It\'s about an 8.95 [out of 10]. I\'m serious, it\'s that good.""\n\nDohring admits there\'s some added pressure now that the hype is building for the film. But he promises fans will be happy. Several of them already received a glimpse of what to expect as some Kickstarter contributors visited the set last year.\n\n""It\'s their movie...It was done somewhat outside the studio for the people,"" he said.

11436,http://www.hypable.com/2014/03/11/veronica-mars-movie-tv-references/,entertainment,"['The Veronica Mars movie looks like it’s going to be everything we wanted and more, but we’ve still got a few demands when it comes to making references to the show.\n\nThe Veronica Mars television series came and went too quickly, but we’re lucky enough to now have a film to fill the marshmallow-shaped void in our hearts.\n\nBut the TV show will always be our first love, and there are a few shoutouts we just have to have in the film. Here are our top eight. Make sure you let us know what you’d like to see in the movie in the comments below!\n\n1. Voice Over Veronica\n\nVeronica’s voice overs are one of the most iconic parts about the television show. Whether it was to get us inside V’s head or just deliver a particularly quippy line, we always enjoyed hearing Veronica tell us exactly what she thought of the other residents of Neptune.\n\nThere’s plenty of room to do this in the film, whether it’s to explain the backstory to new fans, or Veronica grumbling to herself about returning to Neptune in order to help Logan Echolls, of all people.\n\n2. The Argyle Shirt\n\nYou just can’t have a Veronica Mars reunion movie without seeing that argyle polo shirt one last time. For those of you who might not remember, the shirt was once Duncan’s and got passed onto Logan when he needed something to wear. Then once Duncan made for Australia, he left it behind and Veronica offered it to Piz when he was in a clothing drought of his own.\n\nNeedless to say, it’s been passed around a bit. Who could wear it next? Dick? Wallace? Weevil? Maybe even Veronica? Even if she just pulls it out of an old box before tossing it to the side, it’ll be a great little shoutout to the Marshmallows that have been around for a while.\n\n3. ‘You’re a marshmallow, Veronica Mars.’\n\nSpeaking of marshmallows, we really need Wallace to call Veronica a marshmallow one more time. Not only was this the beginning of their friendship — he said it to V in the pilot episode — but fans have taken to calling themselves Marshmallows as a result.\n\nIn the movie, we’d absolutely love it if V’s best friend called her a marshmallow one last time. After all, we all know Veronica is a softy on the inside. Why else would she go back to Neptune?\n\n4. Her other BFF\n\nWallace may be her number one (platonic) man, but Veronica has another best friend: her taser. That thing has been her go-to weapon for a long time, and we don’t think a trip down memory lane would be complete without her taking it out for a spin one last time.\n\nShe is back in Neptune, after all, and there are certainly plenty of shady characters to choose from. Maybe Vinny will show up and Veronica will finally be able to get even with him after everything he did to her father at the end of season 3.\n\n5. Betty\n\nDoes anyone else miss Betty, Veronica’s super perky, pink-clad alter ego? What about Gamegirl? Or Goldilocks? Veronica has a whole stash of identities and accents that she can whip out at any time, depending on what the situation calls for.\n\nWe’d love to see Betty rear her pretty head again, but what about her Inga impersonation? It was so spot on, and we’d like to see the real-life Inga show up in the movie, if only to give Kristen Bell a reason to use her German accent.\n\n6. Logan Echolls’ Inspirational Message of the Day\n\nDo you remember when Logan was sullen and had that me-against-the-world thing going on? It never really went away, but it definitely got pushed to the back burner. One of the best parts about season 1 Logan was his affinity for having inspirational messages as his voicemail message. One of them in particular seems a good fit for the movie: “Life’s tragedy is that we get old too soon and wise too late.”\n\nEven after all these years, wouldn’t it be great if Logan was still doing this? Veronica heads back to Neptune in order to help him out, so she’s bound to give him a ring or two in order to relay information. Even if it’s brief, we really want to hear what wisdom Logan is still sharing with everyone who calls him.\n\n7. Backup\n\nBackup is possibly one of the most underutilized characters on Veronica Mars. He was the Mars family’s trusty sidekick through all three seasons of the show, and his loyalty and obedience were only ever overshadowed by his love of Veronica and Keith.\n\nWhile it may be too much to ask that Backup is still alive once the reunion rolls around, wouldn’t it be poignant and beautiful if there was a mini Backup waiting at home when Veronica arrived? Who doesn’t love puppies!? Besides, if Keith is still in the private detective field, he’s going to need another four-legged buddy by his side.\n\n8. ‘Rob Thomas is a whore!’\n\nThis is one of the best lines of season 3, and maybe even the series. The penultimate episode of Veronica Mars is filled with not-so-subtle product placements and quips about the creator, and we think this mentality could easily carry over into the film.\n\nVeronica Mars did get cancelled after all. But V and her friends are far from dead. The Kickstarter for the film raised $2 million in under 10 hours. Not only that, but fans went on to raise a total of $5 million dollars for the project. That might be a pretty great “Eff you!” to the network that cancelled the show, but we wouldn’t be against seeing one or two more sly quips during the course of the film.\n\nIt’s all Veronica all the time here on Hypable right now. Be sure to stick around for more original articles detailing our love for the show, as well our reviews and opinions about the movie!', 'The Veronica Mars movie looks like it’s going to be everything we wanted and more, but we’ve still got a few demands when it comes to making references to the show.\nThe Veronica Mars television series came and went too quickly, but we’re lucky enough to now have a film to fill the marshmallow-shaped void in our hearts.\nThe Argyle ShirtYou just can’t have a Veronica Mars reunion movie without seeing that argyle polo shirt one last time.\nBackupBackup is possibly one of the most underutilized characters on Veronica Mars.\nVeronica Mars did get cancelled after all.']"

Not only were audiences enthusiastic about the idea of a film to follow the TV series\' they demanded it -- to the tune of $5.7 million raised in a Kickstarter campaign last year.\n\nThe story of a woman navigating young adulthood while moonlighting as a private investigator was interrupted in 2007 by the series\' much-mourned cancellation. But Mars\' resonance persisted, owing in large part to Kristen Bell\'s cerebral performance of the strong-willed heroine, for whom writers spared none of the darkness or dimension typically reserved for ass-kicking dudes.\n\nHuffPost Women caught up with Bell at the film\'s New York premiere. While it\'s easy to view Mars as an exceptional female portrait, Bell thinks the character resonates because of her womanhood, rather than in spite of it. “The hunger is definitely there for this female character because she’s this interesting paradox of vulnerable and confident. And I think a lot of women are,"" Bell told us. ""For me as a viewer, it’s inherently more interesting to watch a female because of the layers she possesses. I’m just glad that other audience members feel the same.”\n\nWe also asked Bell what she would like to see change for women in Hollywood. “I would like to see roles written with a lot more depth,"" Bell said. ""I would like to see roles continued to be written with the depth that Veronica Mars is. Not just the girlfriend -- but someone who is a dynamic, multi-dimensional character, just like the guy.”\n\nWhile too many female characters stand idly by as the male protagonist handles the action, Veronica Mars\' ""main weapon is her wit,"" Bell told HuffPost Live\'s Ricky Camillieri in an interview on March 10, ""her honor and integrity also, but her sass is what she uses against the bad guys and I think that\'s really cool."" That sass has empowered Bell to dispose of some people-pleasing tendencies all-to-familiar to many women. ""I think I\'ve gotten a bit stronger since playing Veronica, and I\'ve been able to be myself, even if that self is pretty sassy.""\n\nWe hope ""Veronica Mars"" is a cue to filmmakers that women\'s stories are a good investment when it comes to money and social capital.

This week: To celebrate the return of Veronica Mars, we dig up some other unconventional detective stories.\n\nNancy Drew (2007)\n\nUnderage detectives got a noir makeover in the mid-aughts with the likes of Brick and Veronica Mars, so it makes sense that the decidedly less noir, but still iconic Nancy Drew character would get her own shot at a comeback. Andrew Fleming\'s Nancy Drew came to theaters about a month after the third and final season of Veronica Mars ended, and in some ways it plays like a JV-level version of that beloved TV show, featuring a teenage outsider solves mysteries in sunny California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike Veronica, this present-day Nancy (played by Emma Roberts) is smart and capable. But rather than upping her hipness or quip factor, she also remains anomalously polite and retro—a nerd with a touch of OCD. (""I just start working on something and I can\'t stop"") This makes her a front-page hero in her small hometown, but when her lawyer father (Tate Donovan) takes a temporary job in the L.A. area and encourages her to have more typical teenage experiences, she has trouble leaving behind her sleuthing (as she constantly calls it). The movie treats her relocation as a Brady Bunch Movie-style time warp; Nancy\'s penny loafers, knee socks, and Peter Pan collars suddenly look more out of place among bratty mean girls from the city.\n\nYet Nancy Drew isn\'t a spoof of its source material. Fleming, as director and cowriter, doesn\'t treat the character as a joke: ""I like old-fashioned things,"" she offers by way of explaining her wardrobe and love of vinyl records. Instead, Fleming (who also made the humorous teen-girls-at-Watergate opus Dick) takes a droll, affectionate approach to her archaic trappings, crafting oddball sight gags whenever Roberts tries to engage in what she considers normal hobbies. And the dialogue has flashes of deadpan wit: Summarizing her prized case, about the decades-earlier death of a Hollywood starlet, for her meek love interest (Max Thieriot), she offhandedly tells him the case is ""before your time.""\n\nNancy Drew starts a bit stronger than it finishes, and its culture-clash material isn\'t always well integrated with the sleuthing, which is a little rote (though shot with widescreen flair by Fleming). But the alternating comic and mystery threads generate a lot of charm and humor, and give the movie an offbeat rhythm unusual for a kid-friendly film. It\'s perfect for not-quite teenagers a few years away from enjoying Veronica Mars—or anyone who appreciates old-fashioned things.\n\nAvailability: Nancy Drew is available on DVD, which can be obtained from Netflix, and to rent or purchase through the major digital services.', ""This week: To celebrate the return of Veronica Mars, we dig up some other unconventional detective stories.\nNancy Drew (2007)Underage detectives got a noir makeover in the mid-aughts with the likes of Brick and Veronica Mars, so it makes sense that the decidedly less noir, but still iconic Nancy Drew character would get her own shot at a comeback.\nYet Nancy Drew isn't a spoof of its source material.\nIt's perfect for not-quite teenagers a few years away from enjoying Veronica Mars—or anyone who appreciates old-fashioned things.\nAvailability: Nancy Drew is available on DVD, which can be obtained from Netflix, and to rent or purchase through the major digital services.""]"
11441,http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_25319418/review-veronica-mars-worth-long-wait-fans,entertainment,"['Passionate TV fans are like puppies with a chew toy: They sink their teeth — and hearts — into their favorite shows and just refuse to let go.\n\nIn the case of “Veronica Mars,” an offbeat gem of a series starring Kristen Bell as a whip-smart teen detective, the fans — or “Marshmallows,” as they are known — put their money where their mouth is. By funding a historic $5.7 million Kickstarter campaign, they’ve given the show a miraculous big-screen resurrection, seven years after it was killed off.\n\nTheir investment has been rewarded with a brisk and sweetly satisfying, if predictable, film that gets the band back together again and pretty much hits all the beats you expect it to hit.\n\nIt opens with an introductory recap montage that works to bring everyone, including newbies, up to speed. Veronica, a champion of high school misfits, details how she began her sleuthing ways as a 15-year-old trying to figure out who murdered her best friend, Lilly Kane. It was a way of coping with her personal pain while growing up in Neptune, a seaside town rife with class wars.\n\nCut to New York City, where Veronica, now a hotshot Stanford grad, is poised to take a job with a high-powered law firm. She’s also joined at the hip with her nerdy college sweetheart, Stosh “Piz” Piznarski (Chris Lowell). Neptune? It’s but a speck in her rearview mirror, and not even an impending 10-year high school reunion is enough of a pull. She wants no reminders of the old “angry, vengeful me.”\n\nBut like the show’s obsessive devotees, Veronica can’t really move on. She gets a call from Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), her former hot-tempered nemesis and onetime flame, who has been accused of killing his rock-star girlfriend. So off to Neptune she goes with a promise to be back soon. Yeah, right.\n\nThe crime and the reunion are convenient excuses for creator Rob Thomas and writing partner Diane Ruggiero to send out the call to members of their talented cast. And it truly does feel like we’re connecting with old BFFs, as Veronica catches up with Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Mac (Tina Majorino), Weevil (Francis Capra) and several others. Good vibes abound.\n\nBut the reunion to savor the most is between Veronica and her sheriff-turned-private-eye dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni). Their seemingly effortless on-screen chemistry produced one of TV’s most endearing father-daughter relationships, and it’s a joy to see them back together, exchanging warm glances and sarcastic barbs while also butting heads. Together, they provide some of the film’s best moments.\n\nAs for the central mystery, it’s not exactly mind-blowing in its complexity. But whodunit cases have never been the main point with “Veronica Mars,” which is more interested in examining social injustice and class division through the eyes of a strong, self-confident young woman. Fortunately, Bell, as charming and witty as ever, smoothly steps back into the role she was born to play.\n\nEven with the Kickstarter cash, Thomas had to pinch pennies, so “Veronica Mars” isn’t artificially amped up with special effects or exotic locales like many TV-to-big-screen projects. Instead, Thomas goes out of his way to please the show’s fandom in other ways, cramming the story with in-jokes, slick visuals and lots of really fun cameos that we won’t spoil here.\n\nOn occasion, it feels like pandering, especially when the film awkwardly addresses lingering feelings between Veronica and Logan, a plot line the so-called “shippers” were always hung up on.\n\nThen again, why not give the fans what they want — and paid for? The film winds up in a place suggesting we could see more of “Veronica Mars” in the future.

But she\'s no longer in high school, and she\'s no longer confined to the small screen. Thanks to a Kickstarter campaign, a devoted cast, and a whole lot of obsessive fans, the TV show that went off the air in 2007 is getting a movie reboot. Yes, people, it\'s in theaters this Friday.\n\nIn case it\'s not obvious, we dug the show for its witty dialogue, whodunit storylines, and, of course, love triangles. So we spoke to the film\'s star, Kristen Bell, about the styles from the show that make her cringe and a certain genius makeup trick. Yes, Bell is just as cute and endearing in real life as she was during that whole sloth freak-out on Ellen.\n\nAllure: How has Veronica changed since the show?\n\nKristen Bell: ""When we meet her in the movie, she\'s living in New York, trying to be normal. She\'s decided that her old life was full of too much drama, so she\'s rejected it to live a quiet, normal life. But what that accomplishes is that right off the bat, the audience will want her to go back to being a P.I. again.""\n\nAllure: How did [creator] Rob Thomas adapt what was a ""teen"" show for an older, broader audience?\n\nKB: ""Lucky for us, everyone has aged since the show. Even Jason Dohring [as Logan Echolls], who may or may not be a vampire. But really, it\'s the same snappy, smart dialogue—it\'s just that the stakes have been raised. So Veronica doesn\'t take cases about dognapping or a stolen test anymore. She\'s grown up, and she\'s dealing with her high school sweetheart facing jail or the death penalty, so the stakes are real.""\n\nAllure: Is there anything you wore on the show that you look back at and cringe?\n\nKB: ""[There\'s something in] every episode. I mean, I wish everybody was still super into little corduroy jean jackets. But they\'re not. So you will forever be able to look back at the show and know when it was on because of what I\'m wearing. But that\'s OK.""\n\nAllure: Any beauty regrets from the show?\n\nKB: ""When I started filming the first season of Veronica Mars, I had just come off of a David Mamet movie called Spartan, and the character I was playing had mangled hair—""\n\n[Husband] Dax Shepard in the background: ""A tortured haircut!""\n\nKB:""Right! A tortured haircut. It was a dirty little mullet, which I was happy to do. When David Mamet asks you to trim your hair, the answer is always yes. So when I started the show I had this grown-out mullet. I was also very into foundation—regrettably so. I don\'t think the camera picked it up because the technology we were using wasn\'t that good yet. But I do believe that for the entire run of the series I was wearing way too much foundation for a high-schooler. Way too much for a grandmother. Just really way too much in general.""\n\nAllure: How has Veronica\'s look changed for the film?\n\nKB:""I made a specific decision to cut my hair to a middle length for the film. I wanted Veronica to look like she had gotten a bob but let it grow out to echo her attempt to be someone else and her wavering commitment to that new, simplified person. Can you believe that I put that much thought into it? I\'m nauseated even listening to myself talk about it! At the beginning of the film, Veronica has pin-straight New York hair, but when she returns to Neptune, she\'s back to looking more like Veronica from the show, with the old bag, a leather jacket, and tousled hair.""\n\nAllure: What\'s the best beauty tip you\'ve picked up on set?\n\nKB: ""You have to do these just-wake-up-in-the-morning scenes, where you have to look like you\'re not wearing any makeup, but you still go to hair and makeup before them. I\'ve learned that you can use a fan brush to put on mascara: Just put the mascara on the brush and sort of grind it in at the root of your lashes, and it gives your eyes a nice pop, but it\'s subtle.""\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\n• Giada De Laurentiis on Her Beauty Routine, Style Icons, and the Many Uses for Olive Oil\n\n• Zoe Kravitz on* Divergent, Dating, and More*\n\n• Chicago P.D.\'s Sophia Bush Spills Her Beauty Secrets', 'Attention, marshmallows (and if you don\'t know what that is, don\'t worry about it): Teenage private investigator and all-around badass Veronica Mars is back!\nSo we spoke to the film\'s star, Kristen Bell, about the styles from the show that make her cringe and a certain genius makeup trick.\nYes, Bell is just as cute and endearing in real life as she was during that whole sloth freak-out on Ellen.\nKristen Bell: ""When we meet her in the movie, she\'s living in New York, trying to be normal.\nBut I do believe that for the entire run of the series I was wearing way too much foundation for a high-schooler.']"
11449,http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/veronica-mars/233651/veronica-mars-review,entertainment,"[""The story behind the Veronica Mars movie is extraordinary. It should never have existed and might never be emulated again but, if the film is a success both with audiences and financially, then that story could become an amazing fairytale of fan loyalty and creative triumph. If it were to disappoint those who bankrolled the comeback via Kickstarter, however, all of that could be instantly forgotten. But that pressure aside, rarely has there been such a lovingly crafted adventure in fan service as this, with cast and crew banding together to create something purely for those loyal devotees – defying the CW’s cancellation and making international news out of a television series that barely anyone watched in the first place.\n\nBut that’s history now and, after a groundbreaking and unprecedented campaign to resurrect our favourite (once) teenage sleuth for a big screen comeback, Veronica Mars is very much in the cultural discussion. All eyes are on this movie – fans for the delayed resolution to a frustratingly unfinished story and others for its potential to alter the movie making model for the future. And here's the good news: the Veronica Mars movie comes off as a wonderful (potential) send-off for the character, a love letter to the fans and a success story for a show that could have died a long time ago. This is what we’ve longed for, with everything that worked on the small screen transferred beautifully to a slickly realised 109-minute labour of love.\n\nAfter taking a brief trip down memory lane (thanks to a heavy dose of early exposition), we learn that Veronica (Kristen Bell) is living in New York and interviewing for snazzy lawyer jobs while dating old college boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell) and steering clear of any drama. With Veronica being the addict she is, however, it’s not long before temptation arises in the form of old flame Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), who has been accused of murdering fellow 90er girlfriend Carrie Bishop (here disappointingly not played by original actress Leighton Meester, but replaced by Andrea Estella). That the case happens to coincide with the timing of a ten year high school reunion is a not-so-happy accident, and the hunt for answers leads Veronica to reconnect with some familiar faces, old friends and bitter enemies she’d rather have left in the past.\n\nWith big delays or when a story switches mediums, there’s always the fear that what we loved about the original could be lost in translation, but that definitely isn’t the case here. Veronica is back in every single way – mind, body, heart and spirit – and, for those who kept the hope alive for so many years, handing over their cash as soon as the opportunity arose, that’s the greatest gift imaginable. Not only do we get Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) back investigating the escapades of Neptune’s ever-more corrupt elite, but there's also a return for every member of the main cast along with supporting characters who played a role in establishing Neptune High as a living, breathing, Hellmouth-esque nucleus during the first two years of the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe criticisms that will meet the film will be regarding its distinct lack of cinematic aspirations. This is not a blockbuster movie designed to appeal to a mass, uninitiated audience, but a feature-length finale to a show that has no qualms about littering the script with in-jokes and references, and nothing more than a stylised ‘previously on Veronica Mars’ segment inserted at the movie’s start. New viewers will likely find themselves lost and adrift after the first ten minutes but, that said, it also serves as a lovely introduction to everything this world has to offer. Repeated or adapted themes from episodes past form the basis of the film’s mystery and various character journeys, for example, resulting in a gratifying microcosm of Veronica’s world.\n\nThe things existing fans will love about the film are just too numerous to list here. There are endless cameos that somehow never feel tiresome or unnecessary, the razor-sharp wit and humour that characterised the show is intact, and there's a sense that the place in which we find everyone is completely in keeping with the way we left them back in 2007. Keith and Logan are the most important and thus prominent returning players but, if your favourite character happens to be someone else, rest assured that absolutely everyone gets their turn in the spotlight. It’s kind of obvious when you think how long we’ve been waiting but every development, whether it’s for specific characters or their relationships, feels totally earned and completely deserved.\n\nThe film’s smallness makes it hard to imagine it as the huge financial success we’ve secretly been hoping for, and there are plenty of flaws that could be picked at, but that’s hardly the point. This is a movie that defied all the odds and owed fans a lot for their support and loyalty, and it has more than delivered on its humble promise to finish the story we all fell in love with nine years ago. This is the finale we deserved back when Veronica Mars was still on the air, but it’s also a great demonstration of what made the show special in the first place. Even if it doesn’t capture the attention of the average moviegoer, at least it will prompt newbies to go back and experience the show, and that’s just a bonus.\n\nAlways rewarding but never self-indulgent, the movie version of Veronica Mars is as much a continuation as it is a loving swan song to the original show, and enthusiasts and curious film fans alike can stop worrying. Whether this project changes anything or not, impossible movies are a cause for celebration just for their mere existence.

The series launched Kristen Bell’s career, who has since gone on to star in Forgetting Sarah Marshall alongside Mila Kunis and Jason Segal, as well as providing the voice for Anna in Disney’s smash hit animation movie Frozen.\n\n\n\nKristen Bell has starred in a string of successful projects since she played Veronica Mars\n\nCue six years of fan-led protests and the most shocking thing of all. They actually won. It’s such a rare occurrence and impressive achievement that we’re still in disbelief that they managed to pull it off! Veronica Mars fans really are dedicated to their cause.\n\nAlthough the series was never renewed, on March 14th the Veronica Mars movie will be released to the public so everybody still reeling from the 2007 cancellation will finally get their fix of the teenage detective. We’re sure that fans will be queueing to see the midnight release of the movie, but critics have been divided about whether Veronica’s return to the screen is a welcome one or not.\n\nVeronica, the daughter of a private investigator who is at odds with the police force, began her career as a teenage sleuth when she took the law in to her own hands to solve the murder of her best friend. As is the requisite for detective shows, many more mysteries followed, although in the movie we find recently graduated law student Veronica ten years older and trying to leave her crime solving days in the past. That is, until her past catches up with her...\n\nUK newspaper The Guardian has received the movie well, praising Kristen Bells performance: “Bell plays it with the sharp wit, keen intellect, and mushy empathy that gave us a reason to love Veronica in the first place”. Guardian reviewer Matt Patches even goes as far to compare Veronica's resurrection as on parr with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises, in terms of reviving a character.\n\nSadly, Variety didn’t receive the movie with such gusto, surmising “At a fairly fleet 107 minutes, the film doesn’t even attempt to match the sprawling narrative density that made the series’ first season in particular so compelling”, before concluding “Veronica is still hard as nails, yet also, in her honest self-appraisal, as soft as a marshmallow - a description that unfortunately also applies to the movie. There’s no real edge or surprise to any of it”.\n\nFilm critics are definitely split down the middle when it comes to the new Veronica Mars movie, but we think we’ll wait until we can see it to make our own minds up.\n\nWere you a fan of the original series?

The actress had a handful of screen credits by the time “Veronica Mars” first aired in 2004, but it was her first series as a regular.\n\n“It was like a high school reunion,” she said of filming the movie. “We were all very excited to see each other and supportive, and we met at such a young age.”\n\nBell credited the fans as the driving force behind the scrappy revival. “We felt South by was the perfect place to premiere there the film,” the actress said. “This project has always been about friends, family and grassroots movements, so we felt right at home.”\n\nAnother actress who got her start on television was also honored Saturday night — Mindy Kaling, the star of her namesake sitcom.\n\n“I want the rain to let up so I can go out and explore,” said Kaling at a dinner for her and Nasty Gal chief executive officer Sophia Amoruso held by Marie Claire magazine at the so-called Spotify House, a venue sponsored by the music streaming service. The two of them warded off the cold, rainy weather by wrapping themselves up in Southwestern-style blankets slung over every chair. “They’re the best,” said Kaling, who admitted to struggling with the Austin dress code. “Dressing for Austin to me is intimidating. Anyone can wear a dress or a gown, but Texas artsy is very hard to pull off, if you’re neither of those things,” she said. “Brooklyn Decker nailed it — she’s wearing like a cool leather jacket and a maxidress.” While Decker may have “nailed it,” she certainly paid the price by the end of the night, as she dashed out of the soiree to her waiting car, shivering the whole way.\n\nRosario Dawson, Olivia Munn, Lauren Bush Lauren, Randi Zuckerberg, Seth Meyers and filmmaker Jon Favreau also turned up at Spotify House and stayed warm with tequila shots.\n\nAmoruso was basking in the attention she and her various projects have gotten from some of the more famous names at the festival, like “Girls” star Lena Dunham.\n\n“I don’t think I’m as good as a writer as Lena Dunham, but I did the best I could with the time I had, and I feel like it’s a pretty good book, and [the fact that] she likes it, it’s super cool,” the e-commerce dynamo said of her first book, “#Girlboss,” about being an entrepreneur. “Rosario [Dawson] went to my talk earlier, and she and her business partner sought me out. They wanted my advice. I was like, ‘Rosario Dawson wants my advice!’ So we’re like buddies now.”', 'Once upon a time, the South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Tex., was just a launching pad for up-and-coming bands.\nDespite rainy weather throughout the weekend, Saturday saw two premieres for “Veronica Mars” and an after party at the Alamo Drafthouse Lakeline.\n“Veronica Mars” was a short-lived but beloved television series that was canceled seven years ago, but, against all odds, was revived as a film thanks to a highly successful, fan-driven Kickstarter campaign.\n“We felt South by was the perfect place to premiere there the film,” the actress said.\n“They’re the best,” said Kaling, who admitted to struggling with the Austin dress code.']"

You\'ve had years to get those DVDs, don\'t get mad at us now. You have only yourself to blame. Oh, and also, speaking of late, we need to tell you something about ""Lost.""\n\nHello there, good-looking reader. We know a few things about you, just by looking at you. You have a lot going on in your life, short on time but long on the need for pop culture savvy. When ""Veronica Mars"" was on the air almost a decade ago, you may not have found the time to watch it. After all, DVR wasn\'t really a thing then, and the show was only on for three seasons. (RIP, UPN.)\n\nNow, however, what\'s a culture addict to do when a hotly anticipated, Kickstarter-funded movie is on the horizon, and there\'s no time (or attention span) to be found to watch the entire series before the Friday release date? Watch the first eight minutes of the film with our handy annotations, of course, and then sit back and enjoy the ride come this weekend. Welcome to Marshmallow-dom, reader.\n\nYou can check out the first eight minutes of the movie now on Fandango. Here are your study notes to bone up before the final exam Friday.\n\n""I need your help, Veronica.""\n\n\n\nEveryone needs something, right? As it turns out, people need a lot from Veronica. Every week on the show, some student or another would corner her (often in the bathroom, weirdly) to enlist her services in proving tampering in student elections, finding a lost dog or destroying dirty pictures taken of them by jealous boyfriends. Oh, and sometimes she solved murders. But we\'ll get to that.\n\n""A teenaged private eye.""\n\n\n\nSome people take up knitting, but not Veronica. As we\'ve seen in the movie\'s trailer and the following footage, ol\' Ronnie got a private investigators\' license for her 18th birthday, and was doing the groundwork long before that. Harriet, she\'s not.\n\n""My best friend was murdered when I was 15. Trying to figure out who did it was how I coped.""\n\n\n\nMeet Lilly Kane. I would say remember her face, but, sadly, Amanda Seyfried doesn\'t make an appearance or even warrant a mention by name in the movie, despite being Veronica\'s BFF and the driving force throughout the first season of the show and, arguably, Veronica\'s life trajectory. NBD. Oh, and we\'ll get to Logan in a second, but a quick Google will tell you that there\'s a lot more to say about the Echolls family than we\'re told here, especially when it comes to Lilly.\n\n""Dad lost his job and I lost my friends.""\n\n\n\nSheriff Mars no more, Veronica and Keith are still weirdly close (even moreso after Veronica\'s alcoholic mom took off in part to protect her daughter from crazy stalkers but — no, wait, this one\'s too long to explain. Just watch the first season!) and go into business together. They also lost their house and most of their income. Womp.\n\n""The cruellest was Logan Echolls, my dead friend\'s boyfriend.""\n\n\n\nYes, there\'s a spoiler warning on this post, but, really. That\'s not the only connection between Logan and Lilly. Just Google it.\n\n""It\'s likely those qualities are what drew us together; they\'re absolutely what tore us apart.""\n\n\n\nTo reiterate: Veronica\'s former tormentor, her dead best friend\'s boyfriend, Veronica\'s sometimes boyfriend, best friend of her former boyfriend (oh, yeah, we didn\'t even mention longtime boyfriend Duncan Kane, who was Dead Lilly\'s brother and for a hot second Veronica thought maybe her brother too. um)...the list goes on. Suffice to say: It\'s complicated. It remains complicated.\n\n""New me? People say I\'m a marshmallow.""\n\n\n\nAnd now you\'re one too.

She’s ditched her career as a private investigator for the law, and is being courted by a high-profile legal firm.\n\nAll is going well until Veronica’s old beau Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) gets caught up in yet another catastrophe — his girlfriend, pop star Bonnie DeVille, has been killed, and he’s the main suspect.\n\nOne phone call from Logan later and Veronica’s on the next plane back to scenic Neptune, Calif., resurrecting her career as a P.I., much to the chagrin of her dad, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), who wants only for his daughter to not follow in his footsteps.\n\nBut as Veronica confesses, she’s an addict. Her vice? Solving mysteries.\n\nWhile on the prowl for Bonnie’s killer, you’ll take a reunion tour of old friends, and a few enemies, from Neptune.\n\nFans will gasp when favorite characters show up, laughing at in-jokes and enjoying an old-school “Veronica Mars” whodunit.

But one of the unofficial themes to emerge at this year’s SXSW Film Festival, which kicked off Friday, is revisiting roots. Here are four movies — and one famous actor — making the old-school new again.\n\n“Chef” undercooked? Jon Favreau’s new culinary comedy “Chef” marks a return to indie filmmaking for the writer, director and actor, who first made a name for himself with “Swingers” in 1996 but in recent years has turned out large, effects-driven Hollywood movies such as “Iron Man,” “Iron Man 2"" and “Cowboys & Aliens.”\n\n“Chef” screened Friday, and many reviewers have noted the seemingly autobiographical elements of the story, about a dissatisfied chef (Favreau) who chafes at turning out safe, predictable food at a trendy Los Angeles restaurant and is panned by a prominent online critic, prompting him to get back to basics with a new food truck.\n\nBEST MOVIES OF 2013: Turan | Sharkey | Olsen\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarly reviews have been mixed. The Guardian’s Henry Barnes writes, “‘Chef’ is made with affection, plated up with real care and presented with pride. ... By taking a step back from the catch-all requirements of blockbuster cinema he’s serving us a home-cooked meal rather than a Big Mac. You appreciate the effort.”\n\nOn the other hand, Indiewire’s Drew Taylor panned the film as “an overlong, unfunny, largely insufferable bore” and added, “If you want to see a self indulgent, hubris-driven car crash where the filmmaker uses his latest narrative as a thinly-veiled defense of his past career transgression, this is the movie for you.”\n\nBack on the case with “Veronica Mars.” Seven years after the cancellation of the cult-favorite teen TV series “Veronica Mars,” creator Rob Thomas and star Kristen Bell are back with a Kickstarter-funded feature film, which screened Saturday. According to early reviews, it should satisfy fans of the original series.\n\nVariety’s Justin Chang says the filmmakers “have effectively given us a very special reunion episode, so crammed with familiar faces that it plays less like a meaty mystery than an extended thank-you to the fans who breathed it into existence. Still, it’s smooth and engaging enough on its own compromised terms, clearly informed by Thomas’ genre-savvy storytelling and unpretentious craftsmanship, and not without a certain self-deprecating sense of humor about its own immodest origins.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPHOTOS: Box office top 10 of 2013\n\nAlan Sepinwall of HitFix agrees that writer-director Thomas and co-writer Diane Ruggiero “have found a way to make a movie that the fans will love without straight-up pandering to them.”\n\nLionsgate catches Bigfoot. Marking the first acquisition out of SXSW, Lionsgate purchased the North American distribution rights to “Exists,” a new found-footage horror movie about five friends on a camping trip in Texas who run afoul of the legendary Sasquatch.\n\nThe film is directed by Eduardo Sanchez, who scored a massive hit with “The Blair Witch Project” in 1999 and inspired a wave of found-footage followers and imitators, including the “Paranormal Activity” franchise, the sci-fi movie “Chronicle” and the party pic “Project X.” “Exists” could prove a bellwether for audiences’ appetite, or lack thereof, for more found-footage films.\n\nGood “Neighbors.” Director Nicholas Stoller’s new comedy “Neighbors,” starring Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron, pits a pair of young parents — the kind you might find in a movie like Judd Apatow’s “Knocked Up,” which also starred Rogen and had an auspicious start at SXSW — against an “Animal House""-style fraternity.\n\nPHOTOS: Greatest box office flops\n\n“Knocked Up” would seem the ideal template for “Neighbors”: When it premiered at SXSW in 2007, it drew hugely positive reviews and word of mouth, and went on to make $148 million at the domestic box office. So far, critics are similarly praising “Neighbors.”\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter’s John DeFore writes, “Very funny at the outset and escalating steadily for most of its brisk running time, the film represents a big win for neophyte screenwriters Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien, and should return Stoller to the commercial peak of his debut ‘Forgetting Sarah Marshall.’”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVariety’s Andrew Barker says, “Lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid than anything its director Nicholas Stoller and star Seth Rogen have ever been involved with before, frat comedy ‘Neighbors’ boasts an almost oppressive volume of outrageous gags, and provided that audiences don’t mind the lack of anything resembling a coherent story arc, its commercial potential ought to be enormous.”\n\n20 years of Kevin Bacon. Two decades ago, before the rise of social networking, the parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon became a cultural phenomenon by highlighting a seemingly random actor’s web of interpersonal connections. At a panel at SXSW on Saturday, Bacon revealed that he was not initially a fan of the game, which involves linking celebrities to the actor through movies they’ve worked on together.\n\nPHOTOS: Billion-dollar movie club\n\n“I was horrified by it.

Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring, who play the namesake character and her former and future lover, respectively, giggled hysterically. Especially when, on the second day on set, Thomas did the exact same thing, this time in front of Jamie Lee Curtis. The entire production crew subsequently broke out in laughter, Thomas told Variety.\n\nThe film, a revival of the CW’s Network’s detective show that was cancelled in 2007, was greenlit after 91,585 fans contributed $5.7 million to a Kickstarter campaign — $3.7 million more than the director asked for. The first $2 million was raised in roughly 11 hours and broke Kickstarter records. That fan dedication also swayed Warner Bros. into agreeing to distribute the film domestically.\n\n“Veronica Mars” premiered in at SXSW in Austin on Saturday afternoon to a packed house at the Paramount Theater. Variety caught up with the 48-year-old director Sunday morning to talk about the life-changing mouse click, why even he can’t escape the snappy interaction of planet Mars and how he’s planning on usurping Nancy Drew.\n\nVariety: Because the fans bankrolled part of this film, how beholden did you feel to them when you were making this film?\n\nRob Thomas: We really stripped down to the core of what fans like. They like Kristen playing Veronica and the snarky dialogue and those are the things we do well. And we just keep trying to play to those strengths. There are some things we wanted to do different, to make it look more filmic with big set pieces but we know what we are. I rejected a couple of ideas floating around in my head because they didn’t feel like they incorporated all the things fans wanted to see. I came up with an F.B.I. version of Veronica Mars, but I couldn’t figure out a way to weave her friends into a F.B.I. case. We wrote the story we did to give an opportunity to bring every fan favorite onto the screen.\n\nThis film is a first for a big studio, releasing day and date in theaters and on video on demand. How long have you known that was the plan?\n\nI guess maybe I’ve known for 6 weeks now. We are trying this experiment because we promised fans digital downloads when the movie came out, and the theater chains are dead set on screening with exclusive window, which put it in strange place and it’s why Warner’s is renting out AMC theaters. Necessity is the mother of invention, and I have a strong belief that VOD doesn’t cannibalize that much from theatrical release. “Mars” fans cared a lot about a show, I can’t imagine them staying at home to watch the movie. But we’re a bit of a guinea pig in the way we made the film and released it.\n\nWhat were your big moments on this film? For something that you so highly anticipated, what stays in your mind?\n\nThere were a few big moments in there, one of the hugest was the moment I got to click on the button that said “project launched,” getting to that moment was an odyssey. It was 100 phone calls, a ton of meetings with Warner’s, getting backers and a reward plan and everyone to sign off on it. Right up until the last moment, I had doubts, but once I hit the launch button I knew that nothing could stop us. I hit that button and I made the movie.\n\nAre you sick of Veronica Mars yet?\n\nI’m not in the least sick of her yet, maybe because of all I did outside of her. If I had just done “Veronica Mars” and didn’t have many other things going, it would be different. But Veronica is like putting on comfortable clothes — it feels good.\n\nYou’ve got two novels coming out set after the events of the film, are you also accounting for a sequel?\n\nI think the public will tell us when they are done with Veronica. Kristin loves doing it, and I see this as sort of a low budget James Bond franchise. In the next two to three years to send Veronica on another adventure, we’ll be completely game for doing that. Maybe we can have a Netflix R-rated version. I’m ready to take that call as well. It would make me incredibly happy. We’ve got the books coming out and then the Ryan Hansen spinoff. Nancy Drew has had a corner on the market for the last 70 years, I would love if Veronica got next 70.', 'The first day on set of the “Veronica Mars” movie, director Rob Thomas was so excited to get started that he called “action” before the cameras had even begun rolling.\nEspecially when, on the second day on set, Thomas did the exact same thing, this time in front of Jamie Lee Curtis.\n“Veronica Mars” premiered in at SXSW in Austin on Saturday afternoon to a packed house at the Paramount Theater.\nversion of Veronica Mars, but I couldn’t figure out a way to weave her friends into a F.B.I.\nIf I had just done “Veronica Mars” and didn’t have many other things going, it would be different.']"

The reality is you can’t do a show for less than a 12 month commitment, because the production has to make their nut back. There is an economic reality to doing a Broadway show and I have a kid now and husband who works in LA, so I’m not willing to be bicoastal until they’re willing to be bicoastal with me, but I would love to do a musical, and I would like to collaborate again in the future with Bobby and Kristen Lopez who wrote the music for Frozen.

The campaign not only met that goal in less than a day, but broke records with fans donating $5.7 million.\n\n“It’s the best,” Bell explained on “Good Morning America” today of how her fans rallied to make their wishes a reality. “I’ve wanted to make a movie since the day the show was cancelled. And I always felt, for some weird reason in my bones, that it would happen.\n\n“And I hate to say, ‘I told you so,’” she added, “but I did know it.”\n\nBell, 33, was “floored” by the power social media played in creating the new “Veronica Mars” film, debuting in theaters March 14.\n\n“Our fans have always been unbelievable and we knew that, but I think they proved that to the world,” she said. “I thought we could make our goal in a month, but I had no idea they would triple the goal within the month. I had no idea that the fans wanted it that badly and we’re ultimately flattered to be involved in this project that so many people want to see.”\n\nWith such a voracious social media fan following, Bell was the perfect candidate to help “GMA” officially launch our brand new social space, Social Square.\n\n“It’s pretty rad,” Bell said of the completely interactive room. “It definitely wakes you up. Lots of communication going around, which is good.”\n\nBell was the very first celebrity guest to answer a fan’s Instagram video question live on air, naming Audrey Hepburn, Malcolm Gladwell and Richard Pryor as the three people, alive or dead, she’d love to have dinner with.\n\nIn addition to the busy life Bell leads in front of the public eye, there is also a mission she and husband, Dax Shepard, are championing behind the scenes as well called the “The No Kids Policy Movement.”\n\n“After having a baby we realized how ridiculous it is that our children are roped into this paparazzi issue because they’re extremely aggressive on the street and they run red lights around schools, and they push people over to get pictures of celebrity kids,” Bell explained. “I just had had it and I wanted to start a public conversation because I think people look at pictures of children because they like children and they wouldn’t want to see those pictures if they knew how they were negatively affected.”', 'Fans have waited nearly six years, and now “Veronica Mars” is back, this time on the big screen.\nThe campaign not only met that goal in less than a day, but broke records with fans donating $5.7 million.\n“It’s the best,” Bell explained on “Good Morning America” today of how her fans rallied to make their wishes a reality.\n“And I hate to say, ‘I told you so,’” she added, “but I did know it.”Bell, 33, was “floored” by the power social media played in creating the new “Veronica Mars” film, debuting in theaters March 14.\n“Our fans have always been unbelievable and we knew that, but I think they proved that to the world,” she said.']"

When police arrive on the scene, they find Logan (Jason Dohring) with the corpse, and he becomes the prime suspect in her death. He asks for Veronica’s help in choosing a lawyer, and before you can say ""love triangle"" she’s on a flight back to California, where multiplying mysteries force her to make a choice between her old life and her new one.\n\nVeronica Mars was a passion project, and it shows. The cast worked for union rates, shooting in 35 locations over 24 days, and the seams occasionally show. (At a Q&A session following the premiere, Dohring lamented that he was often limited to a single take.) Other, better-financed series that have made the leap to the movies — The X-Files and Firefly come to mind — have made better use of the big screen, filling the frame with spectacle. Aside from some flashy introductory exposition and closing credits, Veronica Mars still looks and feels mostly like a TV show, the two-hour series finale that the show deserved but never got. What it lacks in explosions it attempts to make up for in romance: from the moment Veronica sees the once rebellious Logan in military dress, it’s not a question of if they kiss, but when.\n\nBut if elements of Veronica Mars come across as fan fiction, it retains almost all of the elements that made it so compelling during its original run. The twisty plots, sharp one-liners, and heartfelt performances of the television series all return for the movie. Bell and Colantoni in particular stand out for their portrayals of a feisty daughter and a father who worries she is throwing it all away.\n\nThat ought to be more than enough to make the film’s Kickstarter backers feel like they got their money’s worth.

Might this be the movie industry's iPod moment when the music business was turned upside-down?\n\nHere's the lowdown on Veronica Mars movie:\n\nShow creator and now movie producer/director, Rob Thomas, asked fans to contribute money via Kickstarter to produce the film, Veronica Mars.\n\nThe Kickstarter crowdfund raised over $5.7 million from over 91,000 contributors.\n\nThe tv series on which the film is based, went off the air about seven years ago.\n\nKristen Bell, star of Showtime's House of Lies, is the lead in Veronica Mars.\n\nWarner Bros.'s Time Warner (TWX)is distributing the film.\n\n(TWX)is distributing the film. Veronica Mars premiered at SXSW on March 8.\n\nWarner Bros. rented screens from AMC Entertainment (AMCX - Get Report) so they could carry out the dual release -- releasing the film in both theatres and on demand via Amazon and iTunes on the release date.\n\n(AMCX - Get Report) so they could carry out the dual release -- releasing the film in both theatres and on demand via Amazon and iTunes on the release date. In renting out the AMC screens, Warner Bros. will take in all the box office sales, replacing the usual way of theatres and studios splitting revenues from movie ticket sales.\n\nMovie theatres commonly have a 90-day or 3-month release window to stay clear of on-demand release of the same film so as not to take away from the theatre's revenues.\n\nVeronica Mars is set to release on March 14, 2014 in approximately 270 AMC theatres across the U.S. and a handful of independent theatres.\n\nIt used to be an absolute rule not releasing a movie for at-home-viewing - certainly not ever the same day --- but atleast 90 days after it showed in theatres. That has changed though, because of modern practices such as crowdfunding, social media use, Indy movie increased appreciation, and consumer demand to choose what they view, so that Veronica Mars and other movies are pushing that boundary further and further. If Veronica Mars doesn't break the dam, meaning change the way movies are distributed, some future movie likely will.\n\nWhat stocks are potential winners if Veronica Mars does really well? AMC Entertainment (AMCX - Get Report), Time Warner's (TWX) namesake studio, Amazon (AMZN), Apple's (AAPL) iTunes.\n\nWhat companies will be watching with binoculars from the sidelines to see how Veronica Mars does?\n\nNews sites are reporting that Veronica Mars fan events are selling out quickly and a movie review hot from SXSW reported that the film is well done. With Warner Bros just coming off its Lego Movie high, it seems all signs point to a great showing for Veronica Mars.\n\nOther fundamental analysis of Warner Bros. shows that Time Warner has a P/E ratio of 17.45, so it's not overvalued. Its net income has been increasing steadily for the past three years going from $2,886,000 in 2011 to $2,925,000 in 2012 to $3,691,000 in 2013.\n\nIf I were playing time Warner based on technical analysis, I would go short but only for the next three to five days, before March 14th when Veronica Mars releases. Then I'd get ready for a rise in the stock price based on the potential success and buzz of the film.\n\nI'm starting to see the formation of a triple top. With a bearish engulfing candle from last Friday's trading session, it seems like a pullback is underway. For full confirmation, I'd wait to short Time Warner until it's completely clear that it'll hit a little closer to the $70 level then bounce down & away. It's clear that $70 is a key resistance level, having touched that level twice before and having not broken through.\n\nRSI for Time Warner has just rounded the top curve and seems to be already on the way down. OBV is showing a divergence. The volume has been getting weaker but the price action doesn't seem to be weakening quite as much. Stochastics indicate that Time Warneris highly overbought, currently around the level 90.70.\n\nSince I never give stock tips and I do NOT want you to follow advice unless you do your own research, I recommend that you perform your own analysis and decide how you think Veronica Mars will do with its dual release. Based on your findings, invest or trade accordingly.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this movie does in both theatres and on Video On Demand (VOD). It will also be cool to learn the answer to the question, Will Veronica Mars change the movie industry for good?

""Veronica Mars"" is back on the big screen. Chris tkristchris -- Kristen bell here with us. What do you think of the space? It\'s pretty rad. It definitely wakes you up. And a lot of communication going around. We want you to get involved in the conversation. These are fans of yours. This is our instagram chat wall. I\'m Brenda. I want to know if cow could have dinner with three people, who would it be, alive or dead? Wow. Whoa. That\'s a very good question. Probably -- Audrey Hepburn. Malcolm Gladwell, and Richard Pryor. I think would be a good dinner partner. Could I be invited? That\'s a great party. Come into the studio, will you. Come op over here. Tell me first of all, how fantastic was it to be back with your girl, Veronica? Oh, it\'s the best. I wanted to make a movie since the day the show was canceled. I always felt for some weird reason if my bones that it would happen. I think you have, to don\'t you? I hate to say I told you so. I love the power of positive thinking and the power of social media. The kick-starter fund was unbelievable. I was floored. Our fans have been unbelievable. I think they proved that to the world. I thought we could make our goal in a month. I had no idea they would triple the goal in a month. I had no idea that the fans wanted it that bad lp. We\'re flattered to be involved in the project that so the people want to see. Kick starter raised $5.7 million. Was that enough? No, all the concessions we made were behind the scenes. Like, nobody got paid. Everyone was there because they wanted to be there. And we -- retake it very seriously that our fans funded this movie. We are not flippant about it. We desperately wanted in the best movie possible for them. We tried to work as hard as we could and deliver. It picks up about a decade, fine years after the series ended. Venn ror Ron Ka has gotten out of the private eye business, however, pulled back in by her ex. Logan is in trouble. He\'s charged with a crime. It\'s like a godfather type scenario. She wanted to leave the business. She gets sucked back in. Can we show a little clip? Yeah. Having spent nine yours figuring out exactly who you are? Hasn\'t your life been better since giving this up? Getting out of Neptune? It was an iniquitous hell hole before you left. Everything you worked for is right if front of you. All the fan favorites. Logan, mack, piz. If you\'re not a fan, there\'s a lot of fun. A cameo from a certain hubby. Yeah. In the film. We got a nice stud-muffin cameo from Dax Sheppard in there. Was it easy to get back in the skin of Veronica? I don\'t feel like I\'m acting when I play her. It\'s special to me. Would I find it, would it be as natural. About ten minutes into shooting, I was like, oh, yeah. Team Logan or team piz? I get so so much trouble when I answer this. The fans outside the windows are signs. I\'m split down the middle. I know there\'s passion with Logan. But piz treats her so well. It\'s tough. Want to move on to something serious. You and your husband, Dax, are spearheading the no kids policy movement. Share what that means. I think after having a baby rerealized how ridiculous it is that our children are roped into this sort of paparazzi issue. They\'re extremely aggressive on the street. They run red lights around schools. They push children over to get pictures of celebrity kids. I had had it. I taught I wanted to start a public conversation. I think that people that look at pictures of children do it because they like children. They would not want to see them if they saw how they were taken. If the parents want to take a picture or bring the kid to the premier or don\'t mind that the photo is taken, then post it. But I don\'t want pictures of my child on the internet. I want people to realize there should be consent around minors\' pictures. To that end, I would like to add that ""Good morning America"" and all of ABC news platforms will not be using pictures of celebrity children taken without permission. We\'re so on board. That makes me so happy. And so happy on behalf of my producer, Sabrina, who was in tears when she found out that Veronica Mars was coming back. Congrats on Lincoln. Great name.

And God it feels good to be back.\n\nNot that things are exactly how we left them. Our slick, spunky crime-solving student has graduated to the real world. Veronica’s changed – she’s a marshmallow, now, don’t you know. She’s living with Piz, the sensible, stable guy. She’s just been offered the dream job as a big shot NYC lawyer.\n\nBut then Logan – her angry, rage-filled former-flame – pops up his ugly (fine. Not ugly. He’s certainly not deteriorated with age…) head and Veronica’s heading back to where we started: Neptune, the “iniquitous hell-hole” where V grew up.\n\nLogan has been accused of the murder of his pop star ex-girlfriend, Bonnie Deville, aka Carrie Bishop (who true fans will remember was originally played by Gossip Girl star Leighton Meister) and, like a moth to a flame, Veronica can’t resist trying to solve the mystery herself. Before too long she’s digging out her investigative bag of tricks and is back to stake outs and break ins.\n\nTo delight fans, a well timed ten-year reunion at Neptune High provides a tour of all the familiar faces – Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Mac (Tina Majorino), Gia (Krysten Ritter), Dick (Ryan Hansen), Weevil (Francis Capra) and Luke (Sam Huntington), to name a few. It’s a much needed hit of nostalgia, before things get gritty.\n\nBecause this isn’t just an obligatory rose-tinted return to a much-loved TV series. It doesn’t dwell on the past or feel constrained because of it. This is V Mars at her very best, a gripping story, well made, balancing humour and the quick wit for which we love our Veronica with a captivating, heart-racing plot.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the Veronica Mars film that will thrill Veronica Mars fans. But this sequel exceeds their (enormous) expectations. It stands on its own two feet as a brilliant film in it’s own right. And after this cinema-screen debut, Veronica will likely have an even bigger band of Marshmallows behind her.\n\nMe? I’m just sad it’s all over again. After the original TV series was so unceremoniously taken off air back in 2007, fans have been pining, petitioning and praying for V Mars to make a return. And now she has. It was without doubt worth the wait. But I can’t help asking: is this it?\n\n“It’s a one time deal. A farewell tour, if you will,” said Veronica, slinging her PI bag over her leather-clad shoulder as she set off to help Logan once again.\n\n“Then again, you ever hear the one about the junkie who was satisfied with just one more taste of the good stuff? Neither have I,” she adds.\n\nSo come on guys. An army of crowd-sourcing Kickstarters were willing to pay for this jaunt, and with a film this good production companies will be kicking themselves that they didn’t believe in the sequel from the start. So, Rob, Kristen? You’d be mad to call it quits again.\n\nGo on, just one more taste of the good stuff…\n\nVeronica Mars is in selected UK cinemas and available on demand from 14 March\n\nWatch our exclusive interviews with Kristen Bell and director Rob Thomas:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1cJwD2kdXA http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8HvcSkq3Lk\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollow @RadioTimes', 'Before too long she’s digging out her investigative bag of tricks and is back to stake outs and break ins.\nBecause this isn’t just an obligatory rose-tinted return to a much-loved TV series.\nThis is V Mars at her very best, a gripping story, well made, balancing humour and the quick wit for which we love our Veronica with a captivating, heart-racing plot.\nThere is absolutely no doubt that the Veronica Mars film that will thrill Veronica Mars fans.\nAfter the original TV series was so unceremoniously taken off air back in 2007, fans have been pining, petitioning and praying for V Mars to make a return.']"
11491,http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/08/veronica-mars-movie-sxsw-review,entertainment,"['Dear Marshmallows: Veronica Mars has her own Dark Knight Rises. Swap the dusty cape for a dusty camera and Veronica Mars (the movie) represents the same momentous return from retirement.\n\nAfter a messy cancellation from The CW in 2007, six years of thunderous internet fandom and a paradigm-shattering Kickstarter, TV veteran Rob Thomas makes good on what most chalked up to wishful thinking. The Veronica Mars movie is, finally, a reality. It was worth the wait.\n\nFor Kristen Bell, slipping back into the the role that made her a millennial icon requires little torque. With a new case on her plate and emotional baggage to boot, the all-grown-up detective’s jump to the multiplex transcends a fan service-friendly adaptation to roll out as a slick, character-driven mystery that is normally condemned to television. Remember when Miss Marple starred in movies? Veronica Mars is that same kind of small-scale, popcorn-worthy entertainment, an adaptation that avoids payoffs and indulgent nostalgia and capitalizes on a procedural legacy.\n\nThat shouldn’t surprise fans. Sticking to what worked from his cult favorite show, Thomas works off blueprints, souping up the visuals with cinematic gravitas without blowing it up into a glossy, Non-Stop-esque thriller. When we pick up with Veronica, she is on the brink of nabbing a lawyer job at a top New York City firm. She’s happily dating Piz (Chris Lowell), her college boyfriend. Her sleuthing days are long behind her. And that’s when Logan (Jason Dohring), her former flame, gives her a call that turns life upside down. Known for his pent-up emotion and occasional fits of rage, Logan finds himself accused of the high-profile murder of his pop-star girlfriend Bonnie Deville, aka Carrie Bishop (Andrea Estella replacing the show’s original actress Leighton Meister). Ex or not, Veronica can’t resist the call of mystery.\n\nThomas doesn’t worry too much about where we left off. While there were lingering plot lines in the show’s third season non-finale, including the re-election of Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) to the role of sheriff, Veronica Mars blows straight past the loose ends and into the story.\n\nVeronica Mars gets the cast back together with elegance. The plot revolves around Veronica’s 10th high school reunion, a logical reason for Thomas to resurface familiar faces. In the midst of proving Logan’s innocence, Veronica’s besties Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Mac (Tina Majorino) drag her to the party, where she runs into Gia (Krysten Ritter), Dick (Ryan Hansen), Weevil (Francis Capra), Luke (Sam Huntington) and more. Turns out, they’re all suspects. As Veronica strips away the surface level framework of Bonnie’s death, it’s clear the crime is tied to events from her class’s past. Not that surprising, considering Neptune High is one of the few schools requiring an In Memoriam segment at its reunion.\n\nWatching Veronica pal around with Wallace and Mac feels glows like reuniting with actual friends. Keith and his daughter trade zingers like old times – and butt heads too. “You made it out. Don’t let this town take you down like everyone else,” Keith tells Veronica, the clash between Neptune’s 09ners and blue collar residents burning hotter than ever. Veronica’s California hometown was its own character, a sociopolitical “hellmount” (Veronica’s words) that made the constant killings digestible. It’s even more alive, dangerous, and in need of a hero in Thomas’ film translation. Veronica’s navigation of Neptune, scouting through a long-lensed SLR, has all the chemistry of the actor-actor relationships.\n\nOn top of everything that must return, Thomas finds room to add new characters that feel like no-brainers to the Veronica Mars universe. Girls actor Gaby Hoffman and Party Down vet Martin Starr appear as old Neptune High classmates; Jerry O’Connell slides into the obnoxious sheriff role as Dan Lamb, brother of Don, who died in season three; and then there are the cameos too fun to spoil. The fresh faces dilute any sense of gimmick. Even when Veronica Mars nods to the show’s history – Piz and Veronica’s sex tape plays a recurring role, while Thomas’ proposed, internal reboot of the series featuring an FBI-employed Veronica also earns a shout-out – it’s pushing Veronica forward. This isn’t a wallowing love letter, it’s brand spankin’ new Veronica Mars.\n\nBell plays it with the sharp wit, keen intellect, and mushy empathy that gave us a reason to love Veronica in the first place. Once a marshmallow, always a marshmallow. Even on the big screen.', 'Dear Marshmallows: Veronica Mars has her own Dark Knight Rises.\nSwap the dusty cape for a dusty camera and Veronica Mars (the movie) represents the same momentous return from retirement.\nThe Veronica Mars movie is, finally, a reality.\nVeronica Mars is that same kind of small-scale, popcorn-worthy entertainment, an adaptation that avoids payoffs and indulgent nostalgia and capitalizes on a procedural legacy.\nThis isn’t a wallowing love letter, it’s brand spankin’ new Veronica Mars.']"

The closest counterpart to the Veronica Mars movie, which resurrects Kristen Bell's sharp-tongued teenage sleuth from the small screen against all odds, is Joss Whedon's 2006 sci-fi Serenity, the long-awaited theatrical sequel to his short-lived space western series Firefly.\n\nBut where Whedon owed Firefly fans (aka the Browncoats) a figurative debt for their ongoing support, Mars creator Rob Thomas owes his fans (aka the Marshmallows) in a much more specific and literal sense â€“ the film is funded entirely by them via a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign. So what's most impressive about Veronica Mars is that for all this history, it plays as much more than fan service.\n\nPicking up nine years on from the show's rainy parting shot of a despondent Veronica, Thomas's script finds her settling in for a comfortable future in New York, interviewing at a prestigious law firm and getting serious with the stable, dependable Piz (Chris Lowell), having left the detective business and all its personal costs behind her.\n\n\n\nBut back in her hometown of Neptune, California, the adrenaline rush beckons: Veronica's troubled ex Logan (Jason Dohring), with whom she shared a tempestuous on-off relationship throughout the series, is suspected of murdering his girlfriend. In classic 'one last job' style, she finds herself irresistibly drawn back to her old life as the mystery gets deeper and more dangerous.\n\nThe new Veronica Mars is more muted and less quippy than its younger self, but the series was always steeped in darkness and every twist here feels in keeping. The Neptune police department has gone from incompetent to deeply corrupt, leaving the town in a state that borders on post-apocalyptic â€“ and Veronica courting a corporate gig in Manhattan feels designed to leave fans longing for her to shirk authority and expose institutional hypocrisy like the good old days.\n\nThe film plays well as a smart, dark murder mystery in its own right. Bell is engaging and charismatic as she ever was as a mellowed out but still steely Veronica, and Thomas ensures no prior knowledge is required for the newly converted. An extended high school reunion sequence features familiar faces and nods to canon aplenty but works primarily as plot development, and sees former outcast Veronica publicly humiliated in a manner that harks back to all the show's richest themes.\n\n\n\nInevitably given the spry running time, some returning characters fall more by the wayside than others: Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Mac (Tina Majorino) are reduced to pure sidekicks, while reformed biker Weevil (Francis Capra) becomes a heavy-handed plot device in the portrayal of Neptune's systemic class warfare.\n\nVeronica's world-weary father (Enrico Colantoni) and frat boy Dick (Ryan Hansen) are among the favourites who fare better, while Breaking Bad's Krysten Ritter takes on an expanded role as one of several classmates who may have played a part in the murder. The less you know in advance about James Franco's inspired cameo, the better.\n\nThe real emotional highs, the glorious moments of payoff, come only for the fans. Smouldering bad boy Logan, who in the series was never stable enough to offer Veronica more than dysfunctional passion and devastatingly sly wordplay, has matured into something closer to a conventional romantic lead, but Bell and Dohring's chemistry is as electric as it ever was. It's a remarkable thing to sense two actors' years of history in every frame, despite the dimly obligatory tone of their arc.\n\n\n\nThomas wore his film noir influences on his sleeve throughout the show, and many of the established tropes that re-emerge here â€“ notably the hardboiled narration in which Veronica mulls over her own addiction to danger and her mother's alcoholism â€“ feel tailor-made for cinema. The climactic action set piece, too, is classic Mars: our heroine getting in over her head, ending up in physical peril and, crucially, using her smarts to save herself.\n\nA cynical, dark thriller with a marshmallow centre, Veronica Mars is both a labour of love for a legion of fans, and the kind of shrewd, focused, character-driven mystery that has become an endangered species on the big screen.\n\n4\n\nVeronica Mars movie"", ""The closest counterpart to the Veronica Mars movie, which resurrects Kristen Bell's sharp-tongued teenage sleuth from the small screen against all odds, is Joss Whedon's 2006 sci-fi Serenity, the long-awaited theatrical sequel to his short-lived space western series Firefly.\nSo what's most impressive about Veronica Mars is that for all this history, it plays as much more than fan service.\nThe new Veronica Mars is more muted and less quippy than its younger self, but the series was always steeped in darkness and every twist here feels in keeping.\nBell is engaging and charismatic as she ever was as a mellowed out but still steely Veronica, and Thomas ensures no prior knowledge is required for the newly converted.\nA cynical, dark thriller with a marshmallow centre, Veronica Mars is both a labour of love for a legion of fans, and the kind of shrewd, focused, character-driven mystery that has become an endangered species on the big screen.""]"

Marshmallows who were lucky enough to be attending SXSW in Austin this week – were amongst the first to watch the premiere of the Veronica Mars movie. It has been a long time coming, but finally that day has arrived, and the movie my friends, was beyond worth the wait. It is true that the film has been peppered with fun Veronica Mars easter eggs from the original series. I mean come on! Fans of the show did make this happen. However, there is enough meat in the film to keep even newcomers engaged.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT – YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED***\n\nThe movie opens with Veronica on her way to landing a cushy position at a top notch law firm in New York City. Veronica has moved past her ‘teenage detective’ days and is now a full fledged adult in a relationship with Piz, and looking forward to a future that is pretty ordinary. Her sass and charm are still very present, but her desire for helping the helpless has taken a back seat, due to all the pain it caused to the people she loved most.\n\nJust when she thought she was going to carry on in her Veronica-bot new life, former beaux Logan re-enters the picture, in desperate need for someone to help him out of his latest predicament.

Her bad habit, being her unrequited love for Logan, and her love of solving crimes in her own badass sort of way. Why couldn’t she just be happy with the life she had created for herself over the last 9 years? Well she can’t, because that’s not what addicts do; Veronica tells the audience in voiceover. They keep going back because there is something that drives them to keep getting that high – that fix. Solving crimes just happens to be her addiction that she can’t shake.\n\nKristen Bell wears her character like an old pair of jeans. Thankfully, her roles in Forgetting Sarah Marshall or House of Lies haven’t affected her portrayal of our favorite Neptune blond. That said, some moments of the film feel a bit stilted, but overall, time has only made this ensemble cast, with Bell at the helm, even stronger. Jason Dohring’s brooding is still king and when he looks at Bell’s Veronica, the screen just melts. That kind of chemistry doesn’t come around often and even after several years apart, both characters long for each other in such a way that Piz honestly never stood a chance.\n\nLogan Echolls, the perennially bad-boy has also grown as a character, and fans of the show will probably be surprised with his career choice. But in a way, it is actually perfect and yet ironic. This is a new Logan, a better Logan. Surprisingly, Krysten Ritter’s Gia Goodman plays a pivotal role in the mystery plot. Something we didn’t expect to see but were pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe movie has it all, action, romance, humor, loving fathers, and even bad Karaoke. Really, what more could you ask for? The movie, despite its shoestring budget, never felt like you were watching the Blair Witch Project. This was a polished production that still retained its noir cinematic qualities. For fans, it seems like the show never left our TV’s all those years ago. For newcomers, you’ll be entertained with a well rounded story that has unique characters, and at its core a strong, no-holds barred, female character who happens to know her way around a Taser.', '$5.7 million dollars later; the Veronica Mars movie has premiered almost a month to the date that the record breaking Kickstarter project began.\nMarshmallows who were lucky enough to be attending SXSW in Austin this week – were amongst the first to watch the premiere of the Veronica Mars movie.\nIt is true that the film has been peppered with fun Veronica Mars easter eggs from the original series.\n***SPOILER ALERT – YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED***The movie opens with Veronica on her way to landing a cushy position at a top notch law firm in New York City.\nHer bad habit, being her unrequited love for Logan, and her love of solving crimes in her own badass sort of way.']"

11503,http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/veronica-mars-review-sxsw-2014,entertainment,"['Can you ever go back to the past after you’ve closed the book on it, and would you want to? Will you like what you find there?\n\nThese are not just the central questions in the movie “Veronica Mars,” which premiered yesterday at SXSW, but questions that filmmaker Rob Thomas, his cast, and the audience who enjoyed the three-season TV series have addressed. After seven years, can you successfully return to the setting and characters of a TV show to make a low-budget feature film?\n\nThe answer is yes. Thomas and his co-writer Diane Ruggiero have penned a self-avowed love letter to the fans of the series, but grounded it in a solid thriller with compelling characters and bright comic moments.\n\nAfter a short recap of Veronica’s (Kristen Bell) high school private investigator days, the movie leaps ahead nine years after the last episode of the TV series to show us where the title character ended up. She left the bizarrely corrupt town of Neptune, CA and has closed the door very firmly on her past, as she prepares to take the bar exam and work as a high-powered corporate New York attorney. But it’s her past that’s getting her in the door for job interviews, like it or not.\n\nREAD MORE: Jason Dohring on Stepping Back Into The Role of Bad Boy Logan Echolls For The ‘Veronica Mars’ Movie\n\nAfter her old teen flame Logan (Jason Dohring) is accused of murdering one of their fellow high-school classmates, Veronica ventures back to Neptune, trying not to get sucked into a growing mystery. She’s also hoping to avoid her 10-year high school reunion, but there’s no way this film would miss the opportunity to show us such a quantity of characters from the TV series in a single setting.\n\nSequences like the reunion are part of the many ways Thomas caters to the “Veronica Mars” fanbase that funded the film in a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign. Fortunately, the film winks at the fans without patronizing them, and without making other audiences members feel left out. Minor but beloved characters appear briefly, and the theme song pops up unexpectedly (performed by Alejandro Escovedo). Thomas might have underestimated fans’ enthusiasm, however, and doesn’t allow enough time for audience reactions to happen without stepping on the next lines. (He needed maracas, a la “Some Like It Hot.”)\n\nA well-paced, well-structured mystery keeps the film exciting for all audience members, with shades of Hitchcock and “Charade” lurking around several scenes and characters. The dark silhouettes and sinister framing in several shots provide reminders that these mysteries are grim situations Nancy Drew never had to deal with.\n\nIt’s the characters and their relationships that anchor “Veronica Mars,” working in tandem with suspenseful aspects of the movie to keep it engaging. Veronica’s relationship with her dad (Enrico Colantoni) has always been my favorite part of the series, and it’s just as sweet and funny here. The scene where Veronica returns to her father’s office for the first time to surprise him hits all the right notes… and economically shows the futility of her desire to shut out the past.\n\nVeronica is far more interesting in Neptune than in New York. She has a smart mouth on her. She’s absolutely fearless. She hates injustice and wants to get to the bottom of anything that smells fishy. This is a character I want to have a beer with (and not at a bad karaoke dive), as opposed to the corporate-lawyer-to-be in the prim suit with the boyfriend who works for “This American Life.” It’s easy to see that Veronica can’t escape what’s bred in the bone, to paraphrase Robertson Davies.\n\nThe supporting characters drawn with the broadest strokes work best in the film. Ryan Hansen as Dick Casablancas gives the film its goofiest comic moments… apart from a couple of cameos by familiar faces in a nightclub scene. Venal Sheriff Don Lamb (Jerry O’Connell), loopy groupie Ruby Jetson (Gaby Hoffman) and Krysten Ritter’s party girl Chloe — I mean Gia — are over the top but entertaining. Unfortunately, Jason Dohring as Logan is a character whose passionate personality traits are talked about more than shown — if you haven’t watched the show, he seems little more than the Wronged Woman stereotype with a gender reversal.\n\nBecause the movie Veronica Mars is set nearly a decade after the TV show, it lacks the high school stratification setting many fans believed was integral to the series. (For those of us who prefer mysteries over mean girls, this is a boon.) And at times, the voiceover narration, a stock feature of the show, feels excessive and unnecessary here — too much telling, not enough showing. On the other hand, the snappy dialogue, another carryover from the series, gives “Veronica Mars” a sassy edge, balancing suspense and smartassery quite successfully for all viewers.\n\nCriticwire Grade:\n\nRating: B\n\nPopular on IndieWire\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

For lifers, director/show creator Rob Thomas' magnum opus is chock full of Easter eggs sure to get the cult following GIF-ing and meme-ing and dissecting every other still. For new viewers, it's a sweet (and not intimidating) introduction to the crime dramedy that places them right into the action while making sure every plot question is answered.\n\nThe film continues ten years from where audiences last saw Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell). Now, she's out of Neptune, Calif. and making it big in New York, where she's living the sweet life with her boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell) and thisclose to starting a new gig a top law firm. However, a call from her past threatens to ruin her new life. Former flame Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) turns to her for help when he becomes the prime suspect in the murder of his celebrity girlfriend. What follows is Mars getting back to what she does best: sleuthing and solving mysteries.\n\nIn addition to Thomas, Bell, Dohring, and Lowell, co-stars Tina Majorino, Percy Daggs, Ryan Hansen, Enrico Colantoni, Amanda Noret, and Francis Capra were all in attendance for the premiere. Once they all hit the stage, the applause was deafening. In fact, one fan, so pumped after the long-awaited movie, rushed to the stage and dropped down a dollar, proclaiming it the first donation to Veronica Mars 2. The cast relished in the praise and toyed around with their fans, with a highlight being on-screen father and daughter Colantoni and Bell giving each other a loving hug on stage.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIf you're bummed you missed it, we've got you covered. Below are the highlights from the post-screening Q&A.\n\nWritten by Tara Aquino (@t_akino)\n\nOn the cast reuniting after so many years apart:\n\nRob Thomas: There are so many ways to shoot a six million dollar film, and this is not it. Four locations, and eight actors, and not hundreds of extras, but we bit off a huge movie. Sixty speaking roles and action pieces. The only way we could make that work was to give the actors three takes per scene, or occasionally one. We had to fall right back into it...It felt great on a personal level.\n\nThey often say that a writer's protagonist is his alter ego and I think I speak for all of us when I say that, Rob, we're so grateful that your alter ego is a teenage girl. —Kristen Bell\n\nChris Lowell: I'm just shocked that I'm even on the stage or the film. I thought I was gonna have to be the $10,000 backer to have a speaking role in the movie. [Audience laughs.]\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKristen Bell: We love each other and a lot of us have kept in touch mostly via email because of busy schedules, so to get to spend 24 straight days with these knuckleheads has been a real treat. I'd like to ask a question: Did anyone have to change their panties during the film? [Points to Jason Dohring.]\n\nOn what inspired the Veronica Mars character:\n\nThomas: I was a high school journalism advisor so I advised the newspaper and the yearbook. When you advise a yearbook class, it's mostly girls in yearbook class...They're working before school and after school and on weekends. I became like wallpaper to them. They forgot I was there. I felt like for five years I got a crash course on how teenage girls think and talk.\n\nTo me, the best thing about Veronica, the thing that made that character special, in listening to those girls—it's a time period of being self-conscious...Other girls on television like Buffy or [Alias' Sydney Bristow], they can literally kick ass. I felt like Veronica's super power should be that she just doesn't give a shit.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBell: They often say that a writer's protagonist is his alter ego and I think I speak for all of us when I say that Rob we're so grateful that your alter ego is a teenage girl.\n\nRyan Hansen [Steps up unprompted.]: For me, I felt like Dick chose me. [Audience laughs.]\n\nOn the inspiration for the movie's storyline:\n\nThomas: Over the years, I've had many versions of the movie in my head...As Kristen Bell grew older, so did they ideas in my head.\n\nBell [Cuts in.]: We get it. We get. We get it. [Audience laughs.]\n\nThomas: When it became a fan-funded movie—everyone up here has fans who love these characters on the show—I couldn't find a way to do an FBI one that rolled all these characters into the show, so I landed on the idea of Veronica going back to Neptune and putting the 10-year reunion as a set piece in the middle of it because I wanted to give the people what they wanted.\n\nOn revisiting the Veronica Mars character:\n\nBell: Veronica felt 100% present to me [during the filming the series]. It had been years since doing her and I was worried that I couldn't find her as easily...I was pleasantly surprised after the first 10 minutes of nervewrackingly working with this hunk o' hunk [Points to Jason Dohring.] and realizing that sometimes characters just exist inside your body and you can just pull them up again.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn how the father/daughter relationship between Keith and Veronica Mars has changed over the years:\n\nEnrico Colantoni: Any parent will tell you, no matter how old they get, I'll look at her like she was this big. [Lowers his hand by his hip; Bell and Colantoni hug.]\n\nOn what happened to Backup the dog:\n\nThomas: I did the math on big dogs. It wasn't pretty. I did consider having a Backup photo that Veronica would look wistfully at.

Greg Berlanti, Paul Webster, and Sarah Schechter will be producing through Berlanti’s production company. Also, as per The Wrap, Warners executive Courtney Valenti will oversee the project for the studio.\n\nAlongside Mara, a couple of well-known Hollywood stars will be with her on set. Garrett Hedlund (Inside Llewyn Davis, Unbroken) will play the coveted role of Captain Hook. However, it is role given to Hugh Jackman (The Wolverine) that comes as a surprise. He will be playing the infamous pirate, Blackbeard. How this plays into Pan is unknown for the time being, but it is possible since the movie is actually an origin story.\n\nPan tells the tale of how a young orphan boy from London is spirited away to the magical Neverland where he finds grand adventures that will shape him into the charismatic hero, known for many generations, as Peter Pan. The world will be very intentional and multi-racial, which will effectively challenge audiences’ preconceived notions of what Neverland would be.\n\nThis is a very unique direction because most movie adaptions of Peter Pan are usually true to the book. This includes the animated classic by Disney, back in 1953 and the live-action movie by Universal and Columbia Pictures, back in 2003.\n\nProbably the one movie, that expands on the original story by J.M. Barrie, is with the first movie sequel. Back in 1991, Steven Spielberg created Hook. Starring Dustin Hoffman as Captain James Hook and Robin Williams as Peter Pan, the story centers around Peter Banning, a successful corporate lawyer whose relationship with his family – especially his two children – is strained by absences. One night, his children are kidnapped by Captain Hook and it is up to him to save them. With the help of Tinker Bell, he is brought back to Neverland where he finds out he is the legendary Peter Pan…even though he doesn’t remember he is.\n\nAs of now, the role of Peter Pan has not been cast, but will be a boy between the ages of 10 and 12.

Barrie’s Peter Pan has been slowly but surely gathering its cast together. While the titular role in Pan still needs to be filled, the other parts have pretty much all been filled. We have Hugh Jackman as Blackbeard, Garrett Hedlund in the part of James Hook, and now Rooney Mara is in talks to play Tiger Lily.\n\nIn the original Barrie tale, Tiger Lily is a Native American Princess whom Peter rescues from the clutches of Captain Hook. But this is a re-imagining, with Hook at least beginning the film as basically a decent guy (the villainous role is filled by Blackbeard). So Tiger Lily need not be captured or, if Mara is cast, need she be Native American. In fact, we’re not quite certain how this character will figure into Wright’s Pan.\n\nRight now all we really know about Pan is that it promises to tell an “untold story” about a boy in London spirited away to Neverland “where he finds great adventures where he finds great adventures that shape him into the hero known to generations as Peter Pan.” That sort of a synopsis gives us very little to go on, and there’s probably little hope that we’ll hear anything more until production gets properly underway. Given that this film has plans to feature Blackbeard, I think it safe to assume that this is not quite J.M.

Despite the rumors that Juan Pablo and Nikki had broken up and were refusing to speak to each other, the Instagram picture from their date clearly states otherwise.\n\nAlthough several sources had stated that Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell were through with each other and refusing to talk, this date picture reveals that the couple is on decent enough terms. It’s possible that after what they went through, they’re giving their relationship another try? Just because Juan didn’t propose to Nikki on the show doesn’t mean that he’s not planning on proposing at all, especially since he lovingly crafted a Youtube video for her this week.\n\nNikki and Juan Pablo went out on the date on Tuesday in Miami, and Nikki even posted a caption below their date picture, writing, “On our first REAL one on one date! @budare_bistro. So good.”\n\nEither Juan and Nikki are trying their very best to combat the rumors that they’ve broken up, or they truly are giving this relationship a chance. Or perhaps they started off trying to fix their public image, and then eventually started to fall in love for real. Considering that the whole point of the show is to set up a couple for life, it would be difficult for Juan and Nikki to pretend as though they hated each other – even if the rest of the world hates Juan Pablo.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are Nikki and Juan Pablo in it for the long haul? Or are they just playing up their romance for the public?

That woman on the subway with the very big stroller blocking your way out of the train has one. So does that dude at the coffeeshop who looks like he’d definitely nurse that child strapped to his front if only given the chance. Everyone has a kid! Everyone, except you. And that’s okay. At least, according to famous women who never had kids, it’s okay, and hey, if you can’t feel validated about your life choices by examining the lives of celebrities, then what are you even doing on the internet? Exactly.\n\nMaybe other people’s children make you feel funny-bad, not funny-awesome. Maybe you tolerate your niece because she looks a little bit like you and she has nice hair and you like the fact that she makes your sister less of a lunatic. Maybe you look at other people’s children as tiny nuisances dressed in little shoes and shorter-alls, grabbing subway poles with their sticky fingers and leaving everything they touch smelling faintly of applesauce and spoiled milk. Maybe when your parents look at you meaningfully across the table at Thanksgiving and ask you when you’re going to give them a goddamn grandkid so they can manage their empty-nest syndrome effectively, you smile serenely and say, “I’m never having children. Sorry.”\n\nAre you crying “It me!” in solidarity? Are you worried about what society will think of you if your womb lies empty and you just, you know, live your life as a person without thinking about bringing and supporting another life in this world? You’re in decent company.\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nOprah Winfrey has a very successful career, a pleasant arrangement with Stedman and the best celebrity Instagram to date. She also never had kids because they would fuck with her career, which is the best reason not to have children, ever. She told The Hollywood Reporter in 2013 “If I had kids, my kids would hate me…They would have ended up on the equivalent of the Oprah show talking about me; because something [in my life] would have had to suffer and it would’ve probably been them.”\n\nSarah Silverman\n\nSarah Silverman understands the importance of having children when –and if — she’s good and goddamn ready. “I want to have kids when there’s nothing else I want more, and I can make them my world,” she told the Daily Beast in 2013. Seems right to me.\n\nMargaret Cho\n\nKim Cattrall\n\n““I enjoy kids but not for long periods. I think they’re adorable and funny and sweet, and then I have a headache,” Cattrall said in 2008. Of course kids give Samantha a headache. They are, in fact, the physical embodiment of a headache. All checks out.\n\nHelen Mirren\n\nShe has no children because she doesn’t need kids to feel fulfilled. She told British Vogue, “It was not my destiny, I kept thinking it would be, waiting for it to happen, but it never did, and I didn’t care what people thought … It was only boring old men [who would ask me]. And whenever they went, ‘What? No children? Well, you’d better get on with it, old girl,’ I’d say ‘No! F*** off!’”\n\nJennifer Westfeldt\n\nIn 2012, Westfeldt told the New York Times Magazine, “I’ve thought about this a lot lately. I never thought I’d be this age and not have kids. But my life has also gone in a million ways I never anticipated … I kept feeling like I’d wake up with absolute clarity, and I haven’t. And we have a pretty great life together. The chance that we’ll regret it doesn’t seem like a compelling enough reason to do it. I may wake up tomorrow with that lightning bolt, and I’ll have to scramble to make it happen.”\n\nStevie Nicks\n\n“It’s like, Do you want to be an artist and a writer, or a wife and a lover? With kids, your focus changes. I don’t want to go to PTA meetings.” Same, Stevie. Same.\n\nMarisa Tomei\n\nIn a statement that aligns very closely with my worldview, Marisa Tomei told Manhattan Magazine in 2009, “I’m not that big a fan of marriage as an institution, and I don’t know why women need to have children to be seen as complete human beings.”\n\nGloria Steinem\n\nYour mother’s favorite feminist doesn’t have kids. “I’m completely happy not having children. I mean, everybody does not have to live in the same way. And as somebody said, ‘Everybody with a womb doesn’t have to have a child any more than everybody with vocal cords has to be an opera singer,” she said in 2011.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nStop asking Jennifer Aniston if she’s going to have children! Stop it. Just stop. “I just find it to be energy that is unnecessary and not really fair for those who may or may not [have children],” she added. “Who knows what the reason is, why people aren’t having kids. There’s a lot of reasons that could be, and maybe it’s something that no one wants to discuss,” she told People in 2014. “It’s everyone’s personal prerogative, that’s all.”\n\nCameron Diaz\n\nPlease tattoo Cameron Diaz’s entire answer on my fucking forehead and call it a day. “I like protecting people, but I was never drawn to being a mother. I have it much easier than any of them,” she said in an interview with Esquire in 2014. “That’s just what it is. Doesn’t mean life isn’t sometimes hard. I’m just what I am. I work on what I am. Right now, I think, things are good for me. I’ve done a lot. And I don’t care anymore.”\n\nOriginal by Megan Reynolds @mega_hurt', 'Oprah WinfreyOprah Winfrey has a very successful career, a pleasant arrangement with Stedman and the best celebrity Instagram to date.\nShe also never had kids because they would fuck with her career, which is the best reason not to have children, ever.\nHelen MirrenShe has no children because she doesn’t need kids to feel fulfilled.\n“I’m completely happy not having children.\n“Who knows what the reason is, why people aren’t having kids.']"

And the whole fiasco just keeps getting crazier and crazier.\n\nWhile his relationship with the recipient of his final rose, Nikki Ferrell, may very well be sailing on smooth waters these days (at least judging from JPG\'s new declaration of love on YouTube), the tensions with Bachelor producers couldn\'t be higher. In short, it appears that the suddenly uber-private Bachelor hasn\'t just ""slapped"" the hand that fed him -- as Catherine Giudici put it -- he\'s declared war on it!\n\nWhat Chris Harrison says happened as soon as cameras stopped rolling at the After the Final Rose special on Monday night really serves to illustrate just how ugly it has gotten!\n\nHe asked -- not in a mean way -- but if they were done. And then he got up, grabbed Nikki\'s hand and they walked out of the studio by themselves. Nobody applauded, nobody booed. He just walked off like two people going to the bathroom. To me, that summed it all up. It\'s Juan Pablo\'s world against the rest of the world and everybody be dammed. But the only catch is, nobody is against him! He took a picture with Nikki on the street corner in Hollywood alone saying like, ""I\'m free."" But there\'s not a battle going on. This is a time when you\'re with a woman you love, she loves you, you should be backstage like we were with Catherine and Sean, and Des and Chris, and Emily and Jef, etc., where we\'re popping champagne and toasting to the future. Instead, they\'re on a street corner alone angrily Instagramming.\n\nHA. Well, it doesn\'t come as much of a surprise that he exited that way, considering that sources say the single dad is ""so angry with the Bachelor production team. He\'s had major tension with them since right when he got back from filming. Juan thought they gave him no privacy and wanted to know too much about his personal life and what he was doing all the time. ... [Monday] night he was so fed up with everyone on staff there. He said he wasn\'t going to do anything they said anymore.""\n\nMore from The Stir: Nikki Ferrell\'s Latest Comment Tells Us Exactly Where She & Juan Pablo Stand Now\n\nSorry, buddy, but that is what you signed up for! I completely get that he wants to live his life, have a real relationship with Nikki (supposedly) behind closed doors, and propose on his own watch. But I would imagine you could still do ALL of that and still play the game -- or at least play nice! -- for the reality TV show you willingly took part in. But no. Chris Harrison explains:\n\nHe created this battle in his mind and it manifested itself last night in a really bizarre manner, like, \'I\'ll show the world, I\'m not going to tell this beautiful woman who loves me that I care for her!\' That only hurt two people in the entire world last night: Nikki and himself. ... Everything was just so angry and defensive and almost callus. It\'s like whatever you have going on in your mind, there\'s no battle here. Everyone wants you at the end of the day to succeed.\n\nSo true. And yet, this is how JPG sees it ...\n\nWhatever. Ultimately, it\'s just a shame that a show about finding love had to end on such a combative note -- and that\'s no one\'s fault but Juan Pablo\'s.\n\nWhat do you think about Juan Pablo\'s war on the producers -- justified or not?\n\nImage via ABC', ""Love him or hate him, Juan Pablo Galavis' controversial, confusing, calamitous breakup with the Bachelor franchise is like a trainwreck we're having trouble looking away from.\nIt's Juan Pablo's world against the rest of the world and everybody be dammed.\nBut there's not a battle going on.\nThat only hurt two people in the entire world last night: Nikki and himself.\nWhat do you think about Juan Pablo's war on the producers -- justified or not?""]"

Marriage should be forever, so you need to be 100 per cent sure!\n\nBachelor fans, you may be hating on Juan Pablo Galavis for refusing to give in to what producers and viewers wanted — a proposal on the show’s finale or After the Final Rose special. That’s because many Bachelor viewers want their ultimate romantic fantasy to come true on the show — a couple to fall deeply, madly and truly in love!\n\nJuan Pablo Didn’t Propose To Nikki Ferrell On ‘The Bachelor’ — Why He Was Right\n\nThat’s what happened last season when Sean Lowe and contestant Catherine Giudici made a cosmic connection, and they are now happily married.\n\n[hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]\n\nBut let’s be honest — Sean Lowe was the exception to the Bachelor rule. Eight Bachelors have NOT proposed. Sean just raised the bar on expectations.\n\nJuan Pablo, on the other hand, may not have been the best Bachelor ever — but he certainly was the most honest. He said he wasn’t ready to say the words, “Will you marry me?” or “I love you,” to Nikki Ferrell, The best he could offer her was to say that he liked her, “a lot..\n\nHis reasons made perfect sense: He didn’t have time in the six weeks of filming The Bachelor to get to know Nikki enough; he has a four-year-old daughter, Camila, to think about; and finally, he didn’t want to disrespect Nikki by doing something he wasn’t 100 percent sure about. He had promised her father that. Think about it in non-tv terms – Juan Pablo actually makes huge sense. Marriage is a very serious commitment and should be made for a lifetime.\n\nProposing to a woman simply for drama or for ratings is cynical and dishonorable and, ultimately, hurtful. We need to respect that.\n\nHowever, Juan Pablo did make the commitment to get to know Nikki better, and the video montage that he posted on YouTube proved that he followed through with that. The four-minute clip lovingly details the time that the couple has spent together over the past four months since filming the show has ended.\n\nJuan Pablo Has Already Told Nikki Ferrell ‘I Love You’ In Their Private Life\n\nJuan Pablo has actually written a song, “Adventures In Loving You,” for Nikki — talk about a beautiful, romantic gesture! But it also shows that the pair have been learning about each other and they like what they’ve discovered.\n\nPlus, HollywoodLife.com has discovered that Juan Pablo actually has uttered those three all-important words, “I love you,” to Nikki in their private life.\n\nI’m not going to get involved in the politics of why the Bachelor refused to reveal his love on the After the Final Rose special, but that’s really unimportant in “real life.”\n\nIn “real life,” Juan Pablo did what was right for himself, for his daughter, and for Nikki by refusing to be railroaded into a proposal and possible marriage that wasn’t based on mutual love, understanding, common interests and values.\n\nThat’s what “real” proposals and marriages are based on — not a TV show!\n\nDo you agree, HollywoodLifers?

In media critic circles, that is simply unacceptable. The entire season has been on Netflix for more than a month now. What possible excuse could I have for not seeing the whole thing yet? Well, I’ve been busy. I’ve got a time consuming job, a girlfriend, a fairly active social calendar and a very needy cat. Still, in the era of the binge-watch, life is never supposed to get in the way of entertainment. Either you consume the culture that’s in front of you right now, or the rest of the world moves on without you.\n\nThat bums me out.\n\nIt’s been said that excessive choice makes people depressed. I used to think that was bullshit. I’m old enough to remember the time just before the Internet placed the entirety of human existence at our fingertips. Even those born just a few years after me can’t fathom how positively mind-blowing the notion of file sharing was when it first came into being. I spent my mid-teens through my 20s downloading every album that seemed remotely interesting, amassing a digital music collection of around 200 gigabytes. I don’t know if I’ve listened to even half of that. There are times when I stare at my iTunes or iPod completely frozen: “Do I listen to this album I’ve heard a million times, or this album I haven’t played once? Do I follow what my ears want in this moment, or do I act out of obligation?”\n\nA lot of times, I end up just sitting in silence.\n\nAs I’ve crossed over into my 30s, I’ve tried to get back to buying actual records again. Not because I’m one of those people who cherishes “the tangible object,” or that I’m any sort of audiophile, but because I want limitations again.\n\nI’m starting to feel the same way about television. Any show we could possibly want to see is attainable, one way or another, to watch at our leisure. But the problem with personal leisure is that it breeds alienation. People talk about the millennial monoculture, but when everyone is consuming at their own pace, just how connected are we, really? We’ve created a society in which casual conversation is embedded with clear and present dangers; deflecting spoilers has become an art unto itself. I don’t necessarily pine for the pre-DVR days of water-cooler chitchat, but what is a TV show — or any art, really — if it can’t be discussed? Then it becomes just a thing in a box, projected at us in isolation. That’s depressing.\n\n\n\nAnd then there’s simply the pressure. Look, I love TV almost as much as music and film, but if you’ve read this column, you’ll see there are plenty of classic shows I haven’t watched. I wish I had the time to properly catch up on everything, but there are stories I have to write and a cat to feed.

But unlike most Bachelor fans, who have taken to social media to slam Juan Pablo Galavis, Harris has a different perspective on the way things were handled.\n\n“Do I think Juan Pablo was a great bachelor? No, not really I think the role is more fit for guys who are in touch with their feelings,” the interior designer said of Galavis. “The bachelor is usually someone who is sensitive, a good listener, a people pleaser, and a hopeless romantic. The truth is, Juan really wasn’t that guy. That does not make him a BAD guy.”\n\nWhile it’s clear Harris doesn’t think Galavis is an angel, she really takes issue with The Bachelor production insiders. “I’m not making excuses for some of the things Juan Pablo did and said — I would need to be there BEHIND THE SCENES to really see how that went down,” she said. “But, what upset me more, is the way the franchise dealt with all of this.” She went on to say how disappointed she was in good friend and Bachelor host, Chris Harrison. “I was disappointed in him last night,” she said of Harrison at last night’s finale. “… I didn’t understand the strong and relentless emphasis on getting Juan to say he was in love!”\n\nHarrison himself recently admitted that he felt from the beginning Galavis wasn’t right for the show, but that didn’t stop him from pushing the issue of love while interviewing the Venezuelan soccer player after the final rose ceremony.\n\nHarris instead praised Galavis for staying true and not expressing false emotion.\n\nThe ex-Bachelorette also asked that people take it easy on Nikki Ferrell, who received Galavis’ final rose. “For everyone who called Nikki stupid, weak etc, how are you making the situation any better?”\n\nHarris expressed disdain for the social media bashing that has been launched against both Ferrell and Galavis. “Somehow LOVE + BULLYING does not add up in my head,” she preached.\n\nWe’re digging the positive take on all the Bachelor drama.

Truth be told, I didn’t watch much of this one either. But when I heard about the furor over Juan Pablo a month or so ago, I couldn’t resist tuning in. And while he struck me as self-absorbed and inauthentic, what’s shocked me the most is the outcry since the finale at his refusal to give a ring along with his final rose. When did “I like you a lot” become grounds for collective viewer rage?\n\nSo while I’m not inclined to defend Juan Pablo, I’m more interested in the controvery he’s inspired and the potential psychology surrounding it. Read on, and then feel free to disagree. The Bachelor can be an exercise in cynicism or wish fulfillment. It’s probably a good Rorschach test: Who watches to mock, who watches to root for people falling in love. How romantic are you? How jaded?\n\nIn the finale, when Juan Pablo gave a rose instead of a proposal, when he said “I like you a lot” instead of “I love you”, the audience in the studio (and on Twitter) exploded. People were incensed. It’s one thing not to give a ring, but to refuse to even say, “I’m falling in love with you”? It’s like he was robbing Nikki of her whole experience, and the viewers along with her.\n\nAnd then on “After the Rose,” we learned from Nikki that he still hadn’t said the word “love.” The host was flabbergasted. His manner seemed to suggest, “How could you put up with a cad like this?”\n\nNow, I believe that Juan Pablo may very well be a cad. But is he a cad for that particular offense? He and Nikki hadn’t seen each other in person for months. Isn’t a relationship allowed to develop? Can’t feelings blossom with time and proximity?\n\nNot in The Bachelor universe. The social contract there clearly states that love must be invoked. It’s what the viewers want. We’re supposed to be watching people fall in love. If we don’t get to see that, then did we waste our time as much as Nikki did?\n\nI guess what bothers me is how propogating that fantasy can operate to detract from true love. If we meet a guy and date him for a while, and we fall in love but he still only “likes a lot”, that becomes criminal. I know that with my husband, he waited to tell me he loved me until he knew absolutely. I, on the other hand, was comfortable saying it much sooner, with much less of a definite promise. Once my husband said it, he was saying that he was all in, for life. Isn’t that worth waiting for?\n\nI’m not equating my husband and Juan Pablo. But I am saying that deciding at what pace love should occur can mean that sometimes, it won’t. It means some people will walk away from something real and developing because they want to chase a fantasy. When viewers are so incensed to find their fantasy thwarted, when they’d rather a ring be presented even if the couple breaks up a week later, what does it really say about the nature of love and commitment?\n\nOr maybe it’s just that Juan Pablo is a tool.\n\nWatching TV image available from Shutterstock.', 'But when I heard about the furor over Juan Pablo a month or so ago, I couldn’t resist tuning in.\nSo while I’m not inclined to defend Juan Pablo, I’m more interested in the controvery he’s inspired and the potential psychology surrounding it.\nIt’s probably a good Rorschach test: Who watches to mock, who watches to root for people falling in love.\nHis manner seemed to suggest, “How could you put up with a cad like this?”Now, I believe that Juan Pablo may very well be a cad.\nOr maybe it’s just that Juan Pablo is a tool.']"

Then, responding to a fan who argued that ""not everyone is cut out for public attention,"" he wrote, ""Then don\'t be the Bachelor.""\n\nLowe also took issue with the way the Venezuelan former soccer pro interacted with Bachelor host Chris Harrison.

If you were watching “The Bachelor: After the Final Rose” last night, we could get how you would come to that sort of conclusion. Juan Pablo chided the show’s host on a number of occasions for “interrupting,” and Chris seemed particularly frustrated with the refusal of the leading man to answer almost any and all questions about his relationship.\n\nWe were almost hoping that Chris would tear into the guy in some of his post-show interviews, but he did not. Why? We assume that it has a little something to do with not wanting the show to look particularly bad at casting someone like this in the first place. With that in mind, he did tell TV Guide that his “rage” was not entirely range more than confusion:\n\n“People thought I was mad and angry, but I really wasn’t at all. I think I was just confused and a little disappointed. I kept [thinking], ‘What are you trying to accomplish?’ I didn’t know if there was some sort of act or charade going on or like a revenge thing against me or the show. He does this a lot, I’ve noticed, in life where it’s never his fault. He’s a controlling person and he was never able to let go. He created this battle in his mind and it manifested itself last night in a really bizarre manner, like I’ll show the world, I’m not going to tell this beautiful woman who loves me that I care for her. That only hurt two people in the entire world last night: Nikki and himself.”\n\nThe “revenge” argument is a good one. This is a guy who was chided in the press by ABC and producers for his comments, and he was also booted from “Dancing with the Stars” consideration after it was revealed that the majority of Americans didn’t want to see him on the show anymore. We feel like he wanted to go out there and prove something, but ironically, all he really ended up proving was that controversy brings the show big ratings.\n\nWhat do you think about Chris’ comments here, and do you really buy into a whole “revenge” argument?

And she’s been there before.\n\nFormer BacheloretteJillian Harris, the well-liked star of Season 5, has a lot to say and it’s not directed at the 32-year-old former soccer player. She’s got a mouthful for host Chris Harrison, former Bachelor Sean Lowe, his wife Catherine Giudici Lowe, and all those “bullying” this season’s star.\n\nWe’ll let her speak for herself.\n\n“Where to start?! I feel like I haven’t gotten this worked up or felt this many emotions regarding The Bachelor since MY season!” she wrote on her blog. “As you all probably know by now, I speak my mind, and tell it how I see it. I am a bit more skeptical to do so this time, but here I go anyways…\n\n“Do I think that Juan Pablo was a great Bachelor? No\n\n“Do I think Juan Pablo is a terrible person? NO\n\n“Are there a lot of things that Juan Pablo did that I am not OK with? Yes!” Jillian added.\n\n“But [Monday night], it wasn’t Juan Pablo that got me so worked up! I was taken aback and upset with the show, Chris Harrison and all the thousands of people who said endless negative things and bullied Nikki and Juan Pablo on social media.\n\n“So first of all, why Chris Harrison? Chris is such a good friend, and I couldn’t have imagined doing the whole process without him by my side. I also think we can all agree, no one could host the show better than him! But…I was disappointed last night. I felt awkward the whole time he interviewed Juan Pablo and didn’t understand the strong and relentless emphasis on getting Juan Pablo to say that he was in love!” she added.\n\n“Justin said it so well last night: ‘Just because you’re on a TV show, doesn’t mean the rules of love change.’ You go on the Bachelor or Bachelorette in hopes of finding love, but there is no guarantee!\n\nJillian Harris and former fiance Ed Swiderski, who she chose on The Bachelorette in 2009, broke up the following year. Photo: Splash\n\n“I respect Juan Pablo for not saying he loves Nikki just for the sake of the show, or to please the audience,” continued Jillian. “Who knows if Nikki and Juan Pablo will work out? But in the end, they chose each other, and they are committing to see whether they have a future together! I felt like Chris took it too far.\n\n“Juan Pablo walks to the beat of his own drum, and does seem stubborn, but the show has the ability to also portray people the way they want to. I think there is a reason why Juan Pablo had his back against the wall and that’s probably because they decided to portray him a certain way, and edit their footage accordingly.\n\n“I also wanted to touch on Sean Lowe’s comment of having no choice other than being in the public eye even once the show is done. I completely disagree!” she said. ” They have a very public life, because they have chosen to do so! After the show you can decide whether or not to keep your life public or private. A perfect example of this is [former Bachelor] Jason and Molly [Mesnick]. They dealt with a lot of controversy after the show, and they decided to keep their lives private. They focused on their relationship and building a family.\n\n“And I also disagreed with Catherine’s comment about not ‘biting the hand that feeds you,'” Jillian wrote. “People go on the show because they are hopeless romantics, because they’re looking for an adventure and because a life partner is what’s missing in their life. Everyone’s experience and outcome is going to be different, and I think the reason Juan Pablo seemed annoyed by the end is because he didn’t conform to what the show and the audience wanted him to be.”\n\n“And lastly, two wrongs do not make one right! I find it ironic that all everyone wanted to hear was Juan Pablo say he loved Nikki because in the end the show is all about finding love and being happy, yet all everyone did on social media was hate and bash. Somehow LOVE + BULLYING does not add up in my head. It seriously shocks me to see full grown adults say such horrible and mean things so publicly!” she said.\n\n“It’s not OK to bully… EVER, especially when you have never been in their shoes! For everyone who called Nikki stupid, weak, etc, how are you making the situation any better? Let her listen to her heart and figure out her relationship on her own,” added Jillian. “And I find it hard to believe, that all these people have only ever had perfect relationships. Matters of the heart are to live and learn from and cannot be judged by an outside perspective.”\n\nCheck out Juan Pablo’s video dedication to his “amor” Nikki in the video below."", 'But perhaps no Bachelor has seen more headlines than Juan Pablo Galavis.\nNo“Do I think Juan Pablo is a terrible person?\nNO“Are there a lot of things that Juan Pablo did that I am not OK with?\n“But [Monday night], it wasn’t Juan Pablo that got me so worked up!\nI felt awkward the whole time he interviewed Juan Pablo and didn’t understand the strong and relentless emphasis on getting Juan Pablo to say that he was in love!” she added.']"

However, a summary of my thoughts are as follows:\n\nI was disappointed when Clare let Juan Pablo suck her back in after their date, which gave him the opportunity to end things on his terms, but I gained a lot of respect for Clare as she parted when she demanded respect for herself. She really stuck it to the man.\n\nNext, my affection for Nikki never amounted to anything. To me, Nikki seems to lack a bit of self, but I was still hoping hear more than, “I like you . . . A lot,” for her sake, which leads me to whatever you would like to call the final moments of the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was probably the most unromantic ending of The Bachelor that I’ve ever seen. I felt no emotion, you could see the disappointment on Nikki’s face, and Juan Pablo’s stupid wink was the straw that broke the camel’s back. To add to that, his behavior at “After the Final Rose” was unbelievably off-putting. I respect his decision not to propose, or even not to mutter those three little words everyone was looking for, but he was disrespectful and cowardly.\n\nUnfortunately, I believe Juan Pablo is arrogant, ungracious, and manipulative. At some point in our lives, we’ve probably dealt with someone like this, or are bound to if we haven’t already. Thankfully, there are a few real-life lessons we can take from this television spectacle.\n\n1. Trust your gut.\n\nThis season has been a great example of a really useful thing called intuition. Sharleen acted on the questions that clouded her mind about her relationship with Juan and has said that she doesn’t regret her decision to leave. Andi woke up from the fantasy suite not feeling it anymore, and now she’s The Bachelorette! In Clare’s situation, Juan Pablo’s inappropriate comment raised some red flags, but she chose the sweet talk over her first inclination. I’m not saying that you should let fear consume you, or even that your intuition will only tell you when something is wrong, because it can lead you to wonderful things as well, I’m just saying that your soul is wiser than you think. It will most likely have the right answer every time you tap into it.\n\n2. Respect yourself.\n\nWhether you are plagued by a disrespectful comment or being manipulated by your partner, make a point to respect yourself. No one deserves to be degraded, and according to Clare, she was. At least she took initiative to bring it up, but Juan Pablo seemed to weasle his way out of the fault once again. This is what shady people do. They redirect their wrongdoing onto the accuser and in turn make the accuser feel guilty and back down. When we’re in this situation, it’s sometimes hard to comprehend this trickery, but as we look back we can see things more clearly. We’ve now all witnessed it on The Bachelor, so be weary in your reality!\n\n3. Don’t settle.\n\nNikki had sparkling eyes walking up to Juan Pablo, only to be dulled by his “I like you . . . A lot” ordeal. On “After the Final Rose,” the couple claimed to be very happy. If that’s true, all the power and happiness to them. However, that’s not exactly how I picture my fairytale romance working out. Everyone should have that person who is madly in love with them. A person who craves their company, who is completely vulnerable and honest with them, who makes them laugh until they cry, who goes out of their way to show their affection, who finds their idiosyncracies absolutely obnoxious but cute at the same time, who notices every freckle on their face, and ultimately, who is a piece of themselves. Nikki and Juan Pablo may have that behind closed doors (I mean, we’ll never really know because they are so over being in the public eye, right?), but I think it’s something that everyone should strive for.\n\nIt’s safe to say that we’re all glad this season is over. Here’s to hoping for less confrontation and a lot more love on Andi’s season this summer!', 'Unfortunately, I believe Juan Pablo is arrogant, ungracious, and manipulative.\nThankfully, there are a few real-life lessons we can take from this television spectacle.\nAt least she took initiative to bring it up, but Juan Pablo seemed to weasle his way out of the fault once again.\nNikki had sparkling eyes walking up to Juan Pablo, only to be dulled by his “I like you .\nNikki and Juan Pablo may have that behind closed doors (I mean, we’ll never really know because they are so over being in the public eye, right?']"

But as his social media presence and a sickeningly sweet YouTube video posted Wednesday prove, he really, really does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the finale aired, Harrison said in an interview with ABC News (the premiere source of Bachelor content) that he thinks Juan Pablo really does love Nikki and has told her that but didn\'t want to say it during the finale. Other rumors indicate that Juan Pablo\'s ""surprise"" during the ""After the Final Rose"" special was that he was going to propose to Nikki during the episode – or at least, that\'s what he told producers. Clearly he didn\'t go through that plan as a way to prove to them that they don\'t control him.\n\nHarrison also said he didn\'t mean to talk so much about whether Juan Pablo and Nikki were in love or not, but that he just wanted to get to the bottom of their weird relationship dynamic. He said he felt sorry for Nikki during that interview:\n\nI wasn\'t harping on him so much to make him say ""I love you,"" that\'s kind of irrelevant to me. It was just, things weren\'t adding up and it was just bizarre. Their body language was telling me one thing and his words were telling me another. It was him. She wasn\'t allowed or able to speak her mind. I almost felt sorry for her. She was uncomfortable. He was making her uncomfortable, and I assume, I\'m hoping at least, it was just an orchestrated event by him to somehow and in some way, get back at me or the show, I don\'t know what his motivation was for what he pulled last night. That was the most puzzling thing.\n\n""I\'m not sure what the endgame or goal was in not speaking about his feelings,"" Harrison wrote in his EW blog on the episode. ""I know it\'s something Nikki was very uncomfortable with, but I think she really felt like she needed to support her man. I\'m not sure when or where along the way Juan Pablo decided to fight this whole process, but he certainly did.""\n\n""He had trouble embracing being the Bachelor,"" Harrison repeated to ABC News. ""He had trouble getting into the process."" But Juan Pablo didn\'t have trouble embracing being the Bachelor; he had trouble embracing the fact that people didn\'t like him and that the show didn\'t support him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the finale, Juan Pablo also posted this Instagram picture with the caption ""We are FREE.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNikki has taken to Twitter as well to share her displeasure with the negative response to her new relationship. Other than that, she\'s not being quite as political about the whole thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuan Pablo claimed on Twitter that his People magazine blog, which usually goes up the day after the show airs, hasn\'t been posted yet because they\'re ""waiting for PRODUCTION to allow People Mag to POST it."" He and Ferrell appear on the cover of People this week but said they won\'t be doing any other press. At least, they won\'t be doing press that isn\'t Juan\'s own personal video message for his ""love"" Nikki: Juan Pablo had musician Obie Bermudez take his words and make them into a song called ""Adventures In Loving You."" The video is a slideshow of pictures of the two of them together on the show and screenshots of Facetime sessions they probably participated in during their four month separation.

However, Nikki is completely fine without a ring, she revealed in a new interview!\n\nNikki Ferrell doesn’t need Juan Pablo Galavis to put a ring on it to prove that he cares about her! The Bachelor winner is completely fine with just being JuanPab’s girlfriend . . . and she understands why he didn’t pop the question!\n\nNikki Ferrell: No Ring, No Problem\n\n“I absolutely would have said yes [if he proposed],” Nikki told People magazine in a new interview. “Those feelings that I had on the show were vey real, and they’re still very real. I want him to propose when he’s ready. But I also realize, looking back, that to just meet somebody and all of a sudden you’re getting engaged? That’s kind of crazy.”[hl_ndn videoid=”25702266″][hl_ndn videoid=”5661214”]\n\nJuan Pablo chimed in, agreeing.\n\n“You go on the show thinking if there’s the connection, you propose and get married,” the bachelor said. “But I don’t feel the need to propose to somebody if I don’t feel it 100 percent. I didn’t know Nikki [well enough]. I don’t know if she holds silverware well! I want to know more. A lot more.”\n\nSo, it sounds like Nikki is completely OK with just being his girlfriend for the time being and not the fiancée — at least until he learns how she holds a fork and knife.\n\nNikki: If We Break Up, Then My First Engagement Would Be Ruined\n\n“If Juan Pablo had proposed and I was sitting here with a ring on my finger, that wouldn’t stop us from breaking up if we weren’t right for each other,” Nikki pointed out. “All it would do is take being engaged for the first time away from me and away from him.”\n\nWell, that’s true — however, during the After the Final Rose interview, he still wouldn’t tell her he loved her. While HollywoodLife.com learned that he actually has already said those three words in private, it’s strange he won’t say it for others to hear. However, if she’s ok with it, we are too.\n\nWhat do you think HollywoodLifers? Are you surprised that Nikki doesn’t care about the ring? Do you think he’ll propose (eventually)?

11655,http://o.canada.com/entertainment/bachelor-reality/,entertainment,"['In 18 seasons of The Bachelor, nobody has worked harder to compel a declaration of love than did Chris Harrison with Juan Pablo Galavis during Monday’s After the Final Rose episode. And when the reality host failed, 11 million people watched all five stages of grief play out across his face.\n\nThis is why, days later, tongues are still clucking over the hit show’s controversial conclusion: Not because ABC’s prince turned out to be a toad but rather because that toad publicly, petulantly refused to jump at producers’ command – and pulled back the curtain on one of TV’s longest running games of make-believe as a result.\n\n“Juan Pablo is a giant twit on every possible level. But he was also very honest about what The Bachelor is, and what the relationships formed on the show really mean,” said Andy Dehnart, editor of RealityBlurred.com and director of journalism at Stetson University in Florida.\n\n“I don’t think a lot of (participants) play along in the sense that they’re faking things for the show. But I do think they buy into the same narrative many viewers do: that on this whirlwind adventure, they can actually meet the love of their life — when it’s probably the worst possible way to meet your spouse.”\n\nThe CliffsNotes on Galavis’s season: Boy meets girls; boy angers girls with dubious behaviour; boy declines to propose to last woman standing, instead responding to her confession of love by saying, with a playboy wink, “I like you a lot.”\n\nDuring the after-show, Harrison repeatedly tried to get Galavis to comply with The Bachelor’s fairy-tale formula by professing the Big L to winner Nikki Ferrell. Military Generals haven’t attacked from so many angles.\n\nBut in the end, ABC – along with the audience – would be left wanting by a man unwilling to divulge any details about his new relationship, for which you got the sense Galavis’s feelings ran about as deep as his abdominal crevices.\n\n“Chris Harrison basically tried to bully (Galavis) into saying he loved someone,” said Dehnart, who was baffled by the last-ditch effort to salvage a “romance” that nobody – including ABC staff – seemed to believe.\n\n“Even the set design for the final rose ceremony was just, like, ‘Ah, screw it.’ I’m sure by then they had a sense that the show wasn’t going to end the way it usually does.”\n\nAs for whether Galavis’s refusal to play by the rules will affect the show, which has proven bulletproof in the face of previous controversies, it’s doubtful. More likely, the wreckage will land directly on the outgoing Bachelor, who has already seen the Welcome mat at Dancing with the Stars pulled out from under him.\n\nDajana Fabjanovich, a long-time fan of The Bachelor, said while she respects Galavis’s prerogative to not propose marriage, it was “his job” to give viewers closure. A reality show veteran herself (Come Dine with Me Canada), the Edmonton woman described the process as a two-way street: you get, but you must also give.\n\n“I know what reality TV is about, in that it’s not reality… But he owed us some respect,” said Fabjanovich. “Juan Pablo wasn’t just condescending and rude to Chris; he was rude to all of us watching. I think he’s a tool.”\n\nmharris(at)postmedia.com\n\nTwitter.com/popcultini\n\n“(The final episode) exposed the fascinating disconnect between veteran show producers stubbornly anchored in tradition and a star who doesn’t follow – and frankly, couldn’t care less about – the rules of the franchise.” ~ Emily Yahr, Washington Post\n\n“Ladies, take note: Friends don’t let friends accept the final rose during The Bachelor when the bachelor is a misogynistic villain.” ~ Annie Georgia Greenberg, Refinery29\n\n“I’m sorry that this show didn’t end up like you guys wanted it to.” ~ Juan Pablo Galavis, After the Final Rose\n\n“(Juan Pablo) indirectly exposed the show for what it is: an empty, heavily orchestrated charade that makes no rational sense. The Bachelor may be entertaining and silly, but it’s a process people get really invested in. And while some hate-watch, others watch for the fairy tale, no matter how contrived or how damaging it is, with its reinforcement of outdated gender roles and, worse, its insistence on forcing a relationship inside an artificial context.” ~ Andy Dehnart, RealityBlurred\n\n“I knew our audience wasn’t going to take his behaviour well, but I thought if we could at least show that in the end he’s happy and in love and I could get him to show some real emotion or feelings, it might help.” ~ Chris Harrison, Entertainment Weekly blog\n\n“Treatment of Juan Pablo seemed to suggest that in the world of The Bachelor, it’s better to end up alone than with someone whom you’re enjoying dating and getting to know. That’s just so realistic, so logical, so anti-climactic, so real. Everything The Bachelor isn’t.” ~ Em & Lo, Huffington Post', 'In 18 seasons of The Bachelor, nobody has worked harder to compel a declaration of love than did Chris Harrison with Juan Pablo Galavis during Monday’s After the Final Rose episode.\nAnd when the reality host failed, 11 million people watched all five stages of grief play out across his face.\n“Juan Pablo is a giant twit on every possible level.\n“I know what reality TV is about, in that it’s not reality… But he owed us some respect,” said Fabjanovich.\n“Juan Pablo wasn’t just condescending and rude to Chris; he was rude to all of us watching.']"

From the tears, to the breakups to the lack of proposal, fans of the ABC dating series were left scratching their heads after the finale. And since Juan Pablo and Nikki’s bizarre interview with Chris Harrison during the “After The Final Rose” special, there are a lot of rumors and speculation regarding their relationship.\n\nSo, what is one of the big rumors going around? Some are claiming that Juan Pablo and Nikki’s relationship is already over.\n\n“Bachelor” fans will remember that despite Nikki declaring her love for the 32-year-old single dad, Juan Pablo could only reply that he likes her “a lot.” Chris Harrison questioned Juan Pablo about his feelings for the 26-year-old pediatric nurse a couple months after the final rose ceremony was filmed, but the bachelor star still refused to say those three words, instead just saying that she’s fantastic and that they are happy.\n\nLife & Style magazine claims that the pair have already split. But the social media accounts for Juan Pablo and Nikki tell a different story.\n\nImmediately after their appearance during “The Bachelor” special, Juan Pablo posted a selfie on Instagram with Nikki. “We are FREE,” he captioned the photo, which shows the pair with wide smiles on their faces. But unfortunately the public scrutiny seems to be taking a toll on them.\n\nPhoto: Juan Pablo/ Instagram\n\n“Being in the public eye does NOT give you the right to say what you want to me,” Nikki tweeted the following day. “Your words hurt no matter what. Be ashamed of yourselves.”\n\nSupporting his lady love, Juan Pablo posted an encouraging message and a sweet video to show his followers how he really feels about Nikki.\n\n“Amor @Nikki_Ferrell, glad that we stay TRUE to ourselves and we are REAL … This is for YOU …,” wrote Juan Pablo about the video.\n\nThe video, titled “Adventures In Loving You,” kicks off with a message for the viewer: “This is a RECAP of Mi Aventura … Thanks to Obie Bermudez for using the words I sent him and TURNING them into a SONG … ‘Adventures In Loving You’ is for you Mi Catira …” (For those unfamiliar with the phrase Mi Catira, it means “my blonde.”)\n\nAfter Juan Pablo’s message, “The Bachelor” star compiled photos and video clips to accompany Obie Bermudez’ song. But it’s not just all photos and videos that fans of the show have seen before; Juan Pablo also used behind-the-scenes videos and photos of them from their time while filming “The Bachelor,” as well as the months following the “Final Rose” ceremony. Viewers can see the two love birds cooking together, video chatting, and even lounging around the bedroom. But the sweetest part of the video comes at the end, where Juan Pablo included a message for his beloved.\n\n“Thanks for the INTERESTING 4 months of HIDING, now that the CHARACTER of ‘The Bachelor’ is OVER, it is time for US to live our life for REAL. Te ADORO.”\n\nWatch the video below and let us know what you think.\n\n[Click HERE to download Obie Bermudez’ song, “Adventures In Loving You.”]\n\n)', 'Some are claiming that Juan Pablo and Nikki’s relationship is already over.\nBut the social media accounts for Juan Pablo and Nikki tell a different story.\nImmediately after their appearance during “The Bachelor” special, Juan Pablo posted a selfie on Instagram with Nikki.\n“Amor @Nikki_Ferrell, glad that we stay TRUE to ourselves and we are REAL … This is for YOU …,” wrote Juan Pablo about the video.\nBut the sweetest part of the video comes at the end, where Juan Pablo included a message for his beloved.']"

Lowe took to Twitter to give Pablo a pass on the wedding proposal, while at the same time slamming his overall attitude and performance as subpar for the job.\n\nIt is not unusual for the each season\'s Bachelor to have their final rose decision questioned by the American audience, but it is a little unorthodox to be immediately called out by former position holder, only hours after the job is completed.\n\nBut unorthodox or not Sean Lowe thought the situation could use his two cents after the disaster that was last Monday night.\n\nNot only did Claire tell him where to go, he wouldn\'t really admit to having any kind of deep feelings for one of the only women he could trick into staying around until the finale.\n\nIt was his combative refusal to host Chris Harrison that riled Sean up enough to take his Blackberry out and get to bashing via Twitter:\n\n""My take on last night: I commend JP on not proposing if he isn\'t ready.

That\'s the job.\n\n""Lastly, disrespecting the nicest guy in show business @chrisbharrison should be a crime.

It was just, things weren\'t adding up and it was just bizarre. Their body language was telling me one thing and his words were telling me another. It was him.\n\n""I don\'t know what his motivation was for what he pulled last night. That was the most puzzling thing. I really felt like I was sitting here, like Jerry Maguire, saying, \'Help me help you. I\'m trying to make you look better. Come up with an articulate thought about this woman next to you who has pledged her devotion to you.\'\n\n""[But] the more he spoke, the worse he looked.""\n\nDo be fair to Juan Pablo he kind of seems like a d-bag when he isn\'t saying anything either.\n\nAbout the Author\n\n© 2016 The Classical Art, All rights reserved.

I also know that when we chose him we truly believed he had the qualities that would make him a great Bachelor,"" he wrote. ""But from the beginning something just didn’t seem right and something didn’t fit. We can debate over what that is, but the truth is that is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is this was a struggle for Juan Pablo and it was a struggle almost all the way through.

He evaded the issue, and kept trying to change the subject. Whenever his cell phone would ring, he would step out of the room to take the call.

Her messages would also often go unanswered. When Juan Pablo did eventually respond to her, it would be with one word texts which said, ‘busy,’ ‘can’t talk,’ and ‘call later.’”\n\nThe strain of the whirlwind and controversial union was on show for everyone to see when viewers saw Juan Pablo tell Ferrell, 26, that he “liked” her “a lot,” but that he wasn’t going to propose because he wasn’t 100 percent sure.\n\nThe fractured fairy tale ended with the two kissing and they appeared together to supposedly let fans know they are still dating.\n\n“This relationship isn’t going to go the distance. Count on it.

She said it was offensive and she would not repeat it, but it looks like Us Weekly has a source confirming what was said: “I love f—ing you but I don’t know you.”\n\nWowza is all we have to say. Juan Pablo always used the “I’m honest” thought process in justifying what he said and how he handled situations during the show. However, does there come a time when honesty is a little too much? You can think it, but you don’t say it. That statement above pretty much sums up my idea of who Juan Pablo really is and I can’t wait for the breakup between him and Nikki and to see how she really feels about him!\n\nJuan Pablo is over the producers of The Bachelor 2014 and he is skipping public appearances and over it all! He thought the producers wanted to know too much about his personal life and what he was doing all the time. Imagine that, you sign up to be El Bachelor and expect to be out of the limelight?\n\nJuan Pablo tweeted out this, as one of the rare moments of speaking since The Bachelor 2014 finale:\n\nAmor @Nikki_Ferrell, glad that we stay TRUE to ourselves and we are REAL… This is for YOU… http://t.co/pGlpIrkVAX — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 12, 2014\n\nJoin us on Gossip & Gab for all your The Bachelor 2014 spoilers, recaps, photos, news, previews, predictions and much more!

11698,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/reef-karim-do/juan-pablo-syndrome-the-b_b_4944578.html,entertainment,"['Let\'s analyze the bachelor, Juan Pablo.\n\nWith four potential personality characteristics.\n\nAnd for all you ladies out there, if you meet a man that has the characteristics below... beware.\n\nFor the record, I don\'t know Juan Pablo but since so many people are talking about him after The Bachelor series finale, it seems appropriate to deconstruct what\'s really going on.\n\nFirst off, it doesn\'t take a psychiatrist or a relationship expert to figure out there\'s a problem. Per articles and interviews, people are calling him all sorts of names like ""jerk"", ""selfish"", ""rude"" and a bevy of other negative terms and phrases.\n\nLet\'s start by analyzing The Bachelor series itself.\n\nThe Bachelor series is like a good Bollywood movie. It relies on voyeuristic fantasy. We want to see love and connection. We want to hear love and connection. We want sensory overload of love and connection. And there\'s never been any prior bachelor LESS willing to allow us to feel love and connection from the show. He wasn\'t willing to play. He wasn\'t willing to give the people what they want. He wasn\'t willing to play the ""role"" of the bachelor.\n\nMost question what his motives were and that\'s a good question. Was he really looking for love or was he looking for fame or looking to just hook up or looking to fight a well established system?\n\nSince he doesn\'t appear to have the greatest communication skills, we may never know. Perhaps HE doesn\'t even know. And that leads us to the Bachelor Diagnosis and what some may call ""Juan Pablo Syndrome"".\n\nBachelor Diagnosis: The bachelor must be open to being a part of a system (the Bachelor system) with the rules consisting of being a part of people\'s fantasy, being a public figure and being a representation and symbol of relationship love and connection. If you\'re not willing to play the game, don\'t be the bachelor. Because you will definitely take some heat if you don\'t give the people what they want. It\'s finding love in an artificial system.\n\nJuan Pablo Syndrome: Without knowing him but based on basic television viewing, he may fit the mold of a man who will continually get himself into trouble based on the following characteristics.\n\n1) Ego, Ego, Ego\n\nA man\'s ego needs to be well balanced. Too little ego is a problem. Too big of an ego is a problem. In this case, the ego can cause your downfall if you choose ego and pride over love and connection. When the ego speaks for you, you come across as insensitive, arrogant and selfish.\n\n2) Fear of Intimacy\n\nLots of men (and many women) have fears of intimacy but how we mask those fears is what determines how lonely you may be or how self destructive you may be. We call them defenses.\n\nAnd when you defend against intimacy by being rude, dismissive and patronizing, people are going to run from you. Or leave an island.\n\n3) Not Psychologically Minded.\n\nBeing psychologically minded is something many people take for granted. It\'s being able to communicate your emotions to other people. Being expressive allows people in. In life, there needs to be a connection between what you feel and what you do. And if that connection isn\'t there (or hasn\'t been learned yet), you may come across as blunt, rude, selfish or insensitive.\n\nAnd you won\'t know how to express how you really feel.\n\n4) Not Being Vulnerable\n\nVulnerability is a strength. It\'s a muscle women traditionally ""work out"" more than men do. Being vulnerable brings people closer to you. It\'s how people share feelings with each other. And if you\'re fully against showing vulnerability, people won\'t know how to connect with you.\n\nUnless someone is a total sociopath, we all desire to be liked. And we learn tools (sometimes shortcuts) like charm, humor, looks and intellect to make us more attractive to others.\n\nWe also learn defenses to hide our insecurities and flaws. And sometimes those defenses get the best of us. They repel people and keep us from finding what we really want -- true connection.\n\nI wish Juan Pablo well. Hopefully he works out whatever problems he\'s had on the show. But if he truly has a constellation of the above characteristics, it\'ll be tough to maintain a healthy relationship and not be looked at negatively.\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\nDr. Reef Karim\n\nPsychiatrist, Behavioral Expert\n\nDirector: The Control Center in Beverly Hills\n\nwww.thecontrolcenter.com\n\nreef@doctorreef.com\n\nAuthor, Personality\n\nTwitter: @DrReef\n\nFacebook: @/DrReef', 'Let\'s analyze the bachelor, Juan Pablo.\nAnd that leads us to the Bachelor Diagnosis and what some may call ""Juan Pablo Syndrome"".\nJuan Pablo Syndrome: Without knowing him but based on basic television viewing, he may fit the mold of a man who will continually get himself into trouble based on the following characteristics.\n1) Ego, Ego, EgoA man\'s ego needs to be well balanced.\nI wish Juan Pablo well.']"

The three-hour long ABC event was full of red flags, tears and completely odd (and rude) behavior. But there was one thing that actually left fans scratching their heads.\n\nFor the first two and a half hours, “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison teased fans that Juan Pablo had a “big surprise” planned for the “After The Final Rose” special. However, when Juan Pablo finally came out on the stage with his lady love, Nikki Ferrell, he claimed to not know what Chris was talking about.\n\n“Big secret?” Juan Pablo said in response to Chris Harrison’s question about what the big surprise/ secret he had planned. “Nope. You’re talking about a surprise.”\n\n“The Bachelor” host was caught off guard but rolled with the punches and continued to question the 32-year-old single dad about his relationship with Nikki. But as viewers know, things got a little ugly between Chris and Juan Pablo.\n\nSo, what was the scoop with the “big surprise”? And did it even exist?\n\nAccording to E! News, the “big surprise” did initially exist because the bachelor had told show producers that he had something special in store for the audience. The production team was under the impression that he was going to propose to Nikki during the “After The Final Rose” special; however now it’s unclear whether he was “toying” with them or if something derailed his plans.\n\nCheck out some theories regarding his big surprise:\n\nIs Nikki Ferrell Pregnant?\n\nPhoto: ABC/ screenshot\n\nJuan Pablo and Nikki were very secretive about their relationship during the “After The Finale Rose” special; however, fans believe that they were dropping hints about something big … like that Nikki Ferrell might be pregnant.\n\nWhen asked about their plans for the future, Juan Pablo told Chris Harrison that their plans “drastically” changed, but he wouldn’t go into any more detail about it. Twitter immediately blew up with questions regarding whether Nikki was pregnant, with many claiming that Juan Pablo kept looking at her stomach and even pointed to it.\n\n“We’re going to start today being ourselves,” Juan Pablo told Chris while looking at Nikki. “We’re kind of happy over the things we’re going to do next.”\n\nAnd when Chris Harrison proceeded to question him about the specifics of their plans, Juan Pablo seemingly pointed and looked at Nikki’s stomach, saying “we have our plans.” (Check out the 9:52 mark and 10:30 mark in the video below.)\n\n)\n\nIf that wasn’t suspicious enough, many fans believe that their new People magazine cover also hints toward Nikki’s pregnancy. The couple’s first cover (and possibly last since they declined to do more press) shows Juan Pablo with his hand over Nikki’s stomach. Nikki can be seen smiling and looking at him with her hand placed on top of his.\n\nWas Juan Pablo Going To Propose?\n\nPhoto: ABC\n\nFans of “The Bachelor” (and Nikki herself) weren’t the only ones surprised when Juan Pablo chose not to propose … jeweler Neil Lane was too! In a scene that ended up being cut from the show, the jewelry designer met with the bachelor to pick out an engagement ring for his beloved.\n\n“He studied the rings, and we talked about the differences between a cushion cut and an emerald cut,” Lane told People. “He liked that the cushion cut was a romantic stone. He was talking to me like a guy who is about to propose would talk, and he seemed to take it very seriously.”\n\nNeil Lane continued that “sitting in St. Lucia and talking to him, it was clear he had a girl in mind and he wasn’t taking it lightly.” But as viewers know, Juan Pablo didn’t pull out the ring for Nikki.\n\nIf a proposal doesn’t happen on “The Bachelor,” the show’s producers hold onto the ring – which means that Juan Pablo didn’t have it in his possession when he appeared on the “After The Final Rose” special. However E! News reports that producers kept a Neil Lane ring “on standby” in case Juan Pablo’s “big surprise” was a proposal.\n\nWas Juan Pablo Going To Appear On “Dancing With The Stars”?\n\nShortly after Juan Pablo denied having a “big surprise,” he made a comment about his future plans with Nikki and how they recently got derailed. As fans know, Nikki is based out of Kansas City while Juan Pablo lives in Miami with his daughter. Since their relationship is now out in the open, the initial thought was that the pair would move in together or move closer to each other. But as mentioned earlier, Juan Pablo told Chris Harrison that their plans “drastically” changed two weeks ago during the “Women Tell All” episode. Initially saying that their plans were a “private matter,” the single dad did confirm that their change in plans had something to do with information he got from production, not from something that happened during the episode.\n\nThe “Women Tell All” episode aired right around the same time that news broke that Juan Pablo would be “too risky” to appear on fellow ABC show “Dancing with the Stars.” Like Sean Lowe last season, producers had first thought that the Season 18 bachelor would be a great addition to the dance competition, especially since one of his passions is dancing. However a source claimed that there was “too much negativity” surrounding Juan Pablo.\n\nThe theory is that Juan Pablo had planned on being cast on “Dancing with the Stars” and was making plans to move to Los Angeles with Nikki.\n\nWhat do you think was Juan Pablo’s “big surprise”? Do you think Nikki is pregnant? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section or send a tweet to @AmandaTVScoop.', '“Big secret?” Juan Pablo said in response to Chris Harrison’s question about what the big surprise/ secret he had planned.\n“We’re going to start today being ourselves,” Juan Pablo told Chris while looking at Nikki.\nThe couple’s first cover (and possibly last since they declined to do more press) shows Juan Pablo with his hand over Nikki’s stomach.\nNews reports that producers kept a Neil Lane ring “on standby” in case Juan Pablo’s “big surprise” was a proposal.\nWhat do you think was Juan Pablo’s “big surprise”?']"

11716,http://www.yourtango.com/2014210091/love-bachelor-one-thing-juan-pablo-galavis-got-right,entertainment,"['By not giving out a ring on the final episode, \'The Bachelor\' embodied reality.\n\nBy Carista Luminare, Ph.D.\n\nI\'m a grown woman with an extraordinary life and a fabulous relationship with the man of my dreams. I don\'t need to watch the ABC hit show, The Bachelor. But I do and I have been for years. On Monday night, I found myself outraged by the final episode. I think Chris Harrison was reckless.\n\nAs a relationship counselor, I was curious what the hype was about. People suggested that it was an alluring romance saga. Then my teen daughter took a liking to it, and that gave me the chance to watch it with her, guiding and teaching her about psychology, love and the illusory nature of so-called ""reality"" shows.\n\nSuperficial behavior filled the screen week after week. The show barely touched on real love, and rarely demonstrated what a sustainable relationship might look like. I guided her carefully, teaching her what healthy love is — and what it is not. Now, as she goes off to college, she has the wisdom and confidence to pick good men from among the creeps. That made the show worth watching.\n\nWomen are attracted to fairytale stories, and many people seem to want one for themselves — even if it means sealing their fate for an unhappy life. The Bachelor is a fairytale cooked up to stir the imagination. The true reality is that successful relationships — the kind that can be sustained over decades of life\'s challenges — don\'t feel like fairytale romances.\n\nFairytale romances have princes who never get upset when you react emotionally, or demand more connection time. In real romances, sometimes he just annoys the hell out of you because he\'s clueless how to love you. You might be lucky enough to live in a fairytale romance with an athletic Ph.D. who made millions as an entrepreneur, or you might have found a real King — one who is kind, who has a big belly and who loves to watch The Bachelor with you (as long as you don\'t tell his friends). In your real relationship you may get to be a Queen with wrinkles and grey hair, having earned your wisdom through life’s real battles, with resulting battle scars around your heart.\n\nI have found my King, but I don\'t yearn for a fairytale fantasy with romantic sunsets (and TV cameras rolling). I wanted a man I could be REAL with — raw and gritty, not fabricated to trick a love-starved global audience into believing that love can be found on a televised show in just 10 weeks. There are no guaranteed ""happily ever afters"" in real life — once the cameras stop broadcasting your every move.\n\nI found myself very disturbed at what I witnessed during the Final Rose Ceremony. Chris Harrison, supposedly a caring therapist, was attempting to manipulate Juan Pablo into professing his love, when he could not, in good conscience, do so. Surprising everyone, Juan Pablo had enough integrity NOT to propose.\n\nYes, as with almost all of the bachelors and bachelorettes, Juan Pablo frequently expressed insensitive remarks to various women that were foolish and hurtful. And, in a powerful demonstration of maturity, we finally saw him as a real man protecting his woman from false promises. He refused to be pushed into rash behavior. But this makes bad television, and pisses people off. It doesn\'t follow the show\'s fairytale formula. He demonstrated strength of character instead of allowing himself to be intimidated by Chris Harrison\'s manipulative tactics. He blew The Bachelor\'s brand, so he got vilified.\n\nJuan Pablo is supposed to give the audience what they want: all sweetness and light, with a strong commitment to happily ever after. Cue the music, fade to black, everybody goes home happy. But no. Juan Pablo doesn\'t take the bait. He says he doesn\'t know her well enough, having had 26 other woman to distract him during the past 10 weeks. He\'s smart enough to understand that authentic love takes time to build. It\'s not an instant fix made up between commercials.\n\nHe has a choice, and he and Nikki together as a couple choose to keep their plans private. Chris was appalled they would not disclose anything other than they are happy with being together starting a real exploration without cameras. I was appalled by him being appalled. Authentic love does not happen on demand or for the purpose of popularity and great TV ratings. Here, for the first time, a Bachelor broke from the script, refusing to become a media darling. Instead of being praised for maturity and truth, he was publically humiliated; they spit him out for being true to his heart. That screwed with the show\'s branding of instant love in just ten weeks. Keep Reading ...\n\nMore love advice from YourTango:', ""Chris Harrison, supposedly a caring therapist, was attempting to manipulate Juan Pablo into professing his love, when he could not, in good conscience, do so.\nSurprising everyone, Juan Pablo had enough integrity NOT to propose.\nYes, as with almost all of the bachelors and bachelorettes, Juan Pablo frequently expressed insensitive remarks to various women that were foolish and hurtful.\nJuan Pablo is supposed to give the audience what they want: all sweetness and light, with a strong commitment to happily ever after.\nJuan Pablo doesn't take the bait.""]"

It had been a long road for the former professional football player bachelor and the victorious bachelorette but sparks weren\'t exactly flying at the end of the long and emotionally-testing selection process.\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis Offered His Final Rose To Nikki Ferrell.\n\nAs Juan Pablo swept Nikki into his arms, the couple seemed happy enough but there was no marriage proposal or even a declaration of love. Such a lack of romance on the final episode of the love-seeking show was picked up on by fans, who criticised Juan Pablo. However, the Venezuelan reality television star has since taken things into his own hands and has released a video montage of his and Nikki\'s best moments together on the show.\n\nWatch Juan Pablo\'s \'Adventures In Loving You\' Montage:\n\n\n\nEntitled Adventures in Loving You, the montage is apparently soundtracked by a song adapted from words that Juan Pablo wrote. The song isn\'t amazingly inspired - ""You\'re the only one for me/ your love is like a big blue sea"" - but makes for a nice ditty as the memories roll. The clip shows the pair\'s best bits from the show, including abseiling, smooching on a baseball pitch, and riding a mechanical bull together.\n\n""This is a RECAP of Mi Aventura.Thanks to Obie Bermudez for using the WORDS I sent him and TURNING them into a SONG.\'Adventures In Love You\' is for you Mi Catira.,"" Juan Pablo writes at the beginning of the clip. It\'s a very sweet and original display but not entirely convincing after the lack-lustre finale on Monday night.\n\nIt should be pointed out that if Nikki and Juan Pablo stayed together, they\'d be bucking the trend laid out by seventeen previous Bachelor seasons and sixteen couples who are no longer together. Season 17\'s Sean Lowe and Catherine Guidici seem to be the only couple so far whose relationship has stood the test of time since they were married in a televised ceremony last year.\n\nWell we can\'t say that we\'re not hopeful but we\'re mostly pretty sceptical too because the odds just aren\'t in their favour. In fact, a show insider speaking to E! Online said they\'d give the new couple ""less than a month"" before they called it all off.

The things that I’ve learnt during this whole process have just been life affirming.”\n\nThe book features pen-and-ink illustrations by Theodora, who studied at the New York Academy of Art and School of Visual Arts, as well as photographs from the Richards family collection. “This unique autobiographical picture book honors the special bond between a grandfather and grandson and celebrates the artistic talents of the Richards family through the generations,” the book’s description reads.\n\nRichards has certainly been staying busy, as the Rolling Stones are currently in the middle of a sold-out tour of Asia, a leg of the band’s 14 On Fire tour. The band also recently announced appearances at two summer festivals in Europe, Holland’s Pinkpop Festival and Belgium’s TW Classic Festival. “Let’s keep this show on the road… the band are in top form so I’m really looking forward to getting back to Europe,” Richards said of the gigs in a statement on the Rolling Stones’ website.

11907,http://theboot.com/taylor-swift-kenny-chesney-top-earners/,entertainment,"[""There's apparently money to be made in country music. Billboard magazine has released their list of the Top Music Money Makers of last year, and not surprisingly, Taylor Swift and Kenny Chesney claimed the top two spots.\n\nSwift easily took the No. 1 slot, making $39,699,575.60 in 2013. Her hefty paycheck is thanks to her 2012 multi-platinum album, 'Red,' and the record's accompanying global tour. She also scored sponsorships from three major companies -- Keds, Elizabeth Arden and Diet Coke -- for the worldwide trek. In addition, the songtress claims almost 10 million downloads and makes an estimated $17 per head from each concert attendee in merchandise.\n\nChesney came in about six million dollars behind Swift at $32,956,240.70. The Tennessee native's impressive earning are thanks to his sold-out tours, which boast more than one million in attendance for ten consecutive tours, including 2013's No Shoes Nation trek. In addition, Chesney's 'Life On a Rock' album soared to the top of the charts, and continued his reign as one of the highest digital and physical sellers of all time.\n\nSwift and Chesney aren't the only country artists raking in the big bucks. Luke Bryan came in at No. 8, making just over $22 million, thanks to his 2.7 million albums and 7.6 million digital downloads sold, as well as his sold-out Dirt Road Diaries Tour.\n\nBryan's former tour boss, Jason Aldean, came in at No. 14, with just under $18 million. Aldean's impressive revenue is at least partly due to his streak of No. 1 hits, including the title track of his platinum-selling album, 'Night Train,' and his own run of sold-out shows on his Night Train Tour, including filling every seat in several stadium venues.\n\nCountry music icon George Strait came in at No. 15 with $16 million. While the 61-year-old landed behind several artists half his age, he certainly still made a respectable earning in 2013, due largely to his farewell The Cowboy Rides Away Tour, which netted him almost $14 million alone.\n\nBlake Shelton also landed on the list, with his earnings of just over $10 million ranking him at No. 27. The singer-songwriter filmed two seasons of 'The Voice' last year, as well as spent the summer on his Ten Times Crazier Tour, and released the No. 1 record, 'Based On a True Story...'\n\nOther country artists who made it in the Top 40 include the Zac Brown Band, Rascal Flatts and Miranda Lambert. Swift and Chesney beat out Justin Timberlake, who came in at No. 3 with $31,463,297.03, Bon Jovi at No. 4 with $29,436,801.04, and the Rolling Stones rounding out the Top 5 with $26,225,121.71.\n\nSee the complete list here."", ""There's apparently money to be made in country music.\nBillboard magazine has released their list of the Top Music Money Makers of last year, and not surprisingly, Taylor Swift and Kenny Chesney claimed the top two spots.\nChesney came in about six million dollars behind Swift at $32,956,240.70.\nSwift and Chesney aren't the only country artists raking in the big bucks.\nCountry music icon George Strait came in at No.""]"

She surpassed the likes of Beyoncé, Bon Jovi and even the Rolling Stones to earn nearly $40m (£24m) from US tour dates, music sales, streaming and publishing royalties, according to Billboard’s annual Money Makers report.\n\n\n\nThe official total for Swift’s 12 months of earnings is $39,699,575.60, about 75% of which came from concert ticket sales. It’s clear that in 2014, playing gigs is the way to earn money: Swift tops the overall Billboard list despite ranking only sixth in digital music sales and eighth in physical album sales. What’s more, over the course of Swift’s 66 sold-out concerts last year, each ticket-buyer apparently spent an average of $17 (£10) on the singer’s tour merch.\n\n\n\nSwift previously crowned the Billboard rich list in 2012, earning a similar amount – and again, mostly through touring. Last year she was unseated by Madonna, who also went on to top Forbes’ annual ranking of musicians’ earnings. Unlike Billboard, the Forbes list uses worldwide figures.\n\n\n\nThe difference between the US and international markets is also reflected elsewhere in the roster of Money Makers. Besides Swift, two other country stars appear in the top 10: Kenny Chesney at No 2, and Luke Bryan at No 3.

11915,http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/03/problem-with-the-ban-bossy-campaign.html,entertainment,"['Photo: Maya Robinson and Photos by Getty\n\nWhether you see her as a feminist torchbearer or a corporate cheerleader, Sheryl Sandberg’s Lean In organization has achieved something older women’s-rights groups have struggled to do lately: Grab headlines. In the past few months alone, Lean In announced a partnership with Getty Images to expand stock-photography depictions of working women and mothers. And this week, in partnership with the Girl Scouts, it made waves with a Beyoncé-endorsed campaign exhorting people to stop using the word bossy.\n\nWhile there was a generally warm reaction to Lean In’s new stock photos, the response to “Ban Bossy” has ranged from rather tepid to downright hostile. “I am bossy. And I don’t give a *$&% if you call me that,” wrote Jessica Roy at Time Magazine. Slate’s Katy Waldman declared, “I don’t intend to stop using it, even if the feminist super-team tells me to.” Count me among the detractors. I’m all for encouraging girls to lead, but the term bossy is hardly a problem big enough to warrant the combined star power of Sandberg and Beyoncé and Jennifer Garner and Condoleezza Rice. I’ll admit it: Bossy doesn’t bother me. Maybe it’s because I’m a grown-up, proudly self-identified boss-lady. Or because I associate the term more with Kelis’s 2006 single (“You don’t have to love me / You don’t even have to like me / But you will respect me / You know why? / ‘Cause I’m a boss”) and Tina Fey’s humorous memoir than with schoolyard taunts. Sure, according to the dictionary it means “inclined to domineer,” but I interpret it more as “inclined to dominate” — to be a woman with power who isn’t afraid to use it. Bossy has never made me flinch the way overt slurs like cunt and bitch do.\n\n\n\nThe main reason I can’t stomach a bossy ban, though, is that it represents a feminist strategy that’s failed in the past, and it plays into a negative characterization of feminism more generally. The movement for gender equality is at its best when it emphasizes expanding choices for everyone. Most feminist efforts — from ensuring reproductive rights to making public spaces safe to fighting for flexible work arrangements — do just that. But the conservative narrative about several decades of feminist victories claims that by giving women options they didn’t have in the past — to be proud single mothers, unapologetic CEOs, sexually active without a dozen children — feminists are actually stomping on the rights of women who want to make more traditional choices. Not to mention men.\n\nThis anti-feminist narrative has been surprisingly persuasive. (Just think about how many women you know who have said, “I’m not a feminist, but …” and then proceeded to say the most feminist thing you’ve ever heard.) In the 1960s and 1970s, feminist protests in the offices of women’s magazines and in front of beauty pageants were powerful visual spectacles, but they didn’t end what activists perceived to be sexist cultural institutions. Later, feminists founded alternative publications themselves, and foundations set up scholarships for women based on brains, not bathing suits. Since then, the cultural relevance of women’s magazines and Miss America have waned considerably (with and without the help of feminists) — just look at the beauty pageant’s decades-long ratings slide, and how the old glossies have struggled to compete with feminism-inflected publications online. Despite the nonthreatening tone and digital platform of “Ban Bossy,” the campaign is an heir to that earlier type of activism, which sought to restrict bad stuff rather than create a compelling alternative.\n\nOf course, many restrictions are worth fighting for, especially when they protect physical safety and personal autonomy — think of child-pornography laws or perimeters around abortion clinics. When it comes to cultural change, though, applying such hard-nosed tactics doesn’t make much sense.\n\nCulture is a constantly changing thing that we create and shape collectively, not a set of rules that are formally written and rewritten by some governing body. Sure, radio stations can be persuaded to drop a host who used racial slurs or Wal-Mart can be pushed to stop selling girls’ underwear with the phrase “Who needs credit cards …” on the front. Bans and boycotts can be used to great effect when they’re concrete and narrowly focused. But the feminist movement, at its best, does not simply decry negative media depictions or declare certain words off-limits; it creates better alternatives and rewrites narratives to be more inclusive. Kathleen Hanna didn’t start a “Ban Slut” campaign in the ‘90s — she wrote the word on her belly with a Sharpie, owned it, and continued making awesome music.\n\nWhich is why it’s so frustrating to watch Lean In try to expand girls’ options by restricting the way we talk about them. It’s counterintuitive, and it makes feminists look like thought police rather than the expansive forward-thinkers we really are. Sandberg knows better — the Lean In stock-photo effort proves it. If she had released a report about how stock photos perpetuate negative stereotypes about working women, the response would have been a collective shrug.

The Ban Bossy drive, launched by billionaire Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg, claims the adjective puts down girls and discourages them from being ambitious. They urged parents and teachers to avoid using the word. On the campaign’s website, banbossy.com, Mrs Beckham says: “It is thought-provoking that a man in charge may be described as commanding, however, a woman in the same situation may be called bossy.” In a promotional video for the campaign, Beyonce states simply: “I’m not bossy. I’m the boss.” Mother-of-two Miss Sandberg said the campaign doesn’t just want to ban the word but get rid “of the negative messages that hold our daughters back”.\n\nShe said that she and most of those involved in the campaign had suffered from being labelled bossy at an early age.\n\nBritish feminist and Justice For Women founder Julie Bindel said: “You never hear the word used against men. It’s ‘she’s getting a bit bossy’. It’s like ‘feisty’ – you never hear that said of men either.”\n\nHowever, she added: “You need to educate people about terms that are discriminatory.

If you call a little girl bossy, you will stunt her growth. Or something.\n\nSporting their brand new “Ban Bossy” buttons, a high-powered trio of anti-bossy bosses—former secretary of state Rice, Facebook COO and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg, and Girls Scouts CEO Anna Maria Chavez—talked to Parade magazine last Sunday about the pressing need to put yet another word on the politically incorrect list.\n\nAs the magazine put it, they “aim to change the conversation about girls and leadership.” We were treated to some of the personal trials that led them to undertake this worthy crusade.\n\n“Ninth graderSheryl Sandberg wasn’t shy about raising her voice,” Parade notes. “But the message she got from a faculty adviser didn’t praise that trait. ‘She’s too aggressive, too bossy,’ the teacher said. ‘You don’t want to be bossy.’” Parade comments—rather needlessly—that “luckily” little Sheryl ""didn’t listen.”\n\nCondoleezza Rice who has been viciously attacked by the Left shares her own story, though it is hard to imagine that this is really a tramatic moment or the worst name the brave female conservative has been called.\n\n“I remember when I was six years old,” Dr. Rice shared, “we were having an event at school where different dolls were on display. I said that the tallest doll needed to be on the end, and my little friend said to me, ‘Oh, you’re just so bossy.’” And you thought growing up in segregated Birmingham, Ala., was the challenge!\n\nMs. Chavez\'s recollection was more uplifting. “Instead of teaching me how to cook, my mother taught my brothers how to cook, and me how to run a board meeting,” she said. Can\'t say that hasn\'t paid off, can you? Ms. Chavez, by the way, has held up as role models for adolescent girls such peerless leaders as former speaker Nancy Pelosi and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. If you call Kathleen bossy, she\'ll cancel your health insurance policy.\n\nAdmittedly, bossy is a word most likely to be applied to women or metro-sexual men (Hillary and Barack are bossy—Vladimir Putin, not so much--he\'s more--uh—forceful). But so what? Sometimes bossy just happens to be the right word to describe a bossy little girl—or a bossy big girl or a man or boy. And we\'re supposed to refrain from calling a domineering girl-child (of any age) bossy because it might injure her delicate psyche?\n\nNot only is the “ban bossy” campaign a hopelessly trivial way for three highly-successful women to be spending time, it comes at a time when it’s boys, not girls, who seem most in need of extra attention from our society. Girls are thriving academically compared to boys. Schools tend to be more girl-centric after forty years of feminist activism on our behalf. Fifty-seven percent of bachelor’s degrees and 52 percent of doctorates in the United States are now awarded to women. Female academic achievement is a cause for celebration, but we should not be blind to the marginalization of boys.\n\n“Boys in all ethnic groups and social classes are far less likely than their sisters to feel connected to school, to earn good grades, or to have high academic aspirations,” Christina Hoff Sommers recently wrote in The Atlantic magazine. She cited a 2011 report from Brookings Institution that quantified the remarkable decline in the earning power of men from 1969 until the study was done.\n\nPsychologist Helen Smith, author of “Men on Strike: Why Men Are Boycotting Marriage, Fatherhood, and the American Dream—and Why It Matters,” believes that a legitimate feminist movement “has morphed into a whole political system based on women having special privileges, and the more privileges they have the more entitled they feel.” Latest privilege grab: a girl or woman must never be called bossy!\n\nLikely it’s still acceptable to call a man patriarchal—and that’s a relatively nice word in the feminist-approved lexicon. It is particularly disappointing that Condoleezza Rice signed onto this ridiculous campaign.\n\nSurely, Rice, a Republican, realizes that Democrats have been using the “war on women” rhetoric as a ploy to raise cash and get votes by convincing women that Republicans are scary. The underlying theme of the “ban bossy” campaign is that women are ill-treated in American society. The campaign will be a boon to Democrats who will now be able to step forward and protect women from the scourge of being called bossy.\n\nMaybe Rice thinks it’s productive for conservative-leaning women to become involved in these mainstream campaigns. If so, she is sadly mistaken. She should know from her treatment at the hands of the enlightened academics at Rutgers that no matter how conciliatory conservative women try to be, it just doesn’t win many friends on the left.\n\nIn the light of the Rutgers controversy (it does appear that Rice will be allowed to deliver the speech) should Dr. Rice be working to promote more intellectual diversity rather than banning a word? Just for the record, I don’t intend to let Rice, Sandberg, and Chavez tell me what to do. They may be three bossy ladies, but they can\'t stop me from exercising my right to free speech, and nor should they really try.', ""If you call a little girl bossy, you will stunt her growth.\nAdmittedly, bossy is a word most likely to be applied to women or metro-sexual men (Hillary and Barack are bossy—Vladimir Putin, not so much--he's more--uh—forceful).\nSometimes bossy just happens to be the right word to describe a bossy little girl—or a bossy big girl or a man or boy.\nJust for the record, I don’t intend to let Rice, Sandberg, and Chavez tell me what to do.\nThey may be three bossy ladies, but they can't stop me from exercising my right to free speech, and nor should they really try.""]"

I enjoyed being in charge. At an early age, I persuaded my younger brother to trade bedrooms so that he would share with our little sister and I would get his bedroom to myself. When he hesitated, I sat on him and smothered him until he said yes.\n\nIn Grade 7, I got scolded in ballroom dancing class because I couldn\'t stop leading. And so it went. I was a bossy little girl, no doubt about it. (The term ""obnoxious"" also comes to mind.) But we aren\'t supposed to say the word ""bossy"" any more. It makes girls feel bad. It destroys their fragile self-esteem and discourages them from being more assertive.\n\nThe campaign to ban ""bossy"" (I am not making this up) was launched by Facebook\'s Sheryl Sandberg, author of the wildly bestselling Lean In, a guide to business success for the female top 1 per cent. The fear of being labelled ""bossy,"" she argues, has a real impact on girls\' lives, because it encourages them to sit down and shut up. ""We, too, were called bossy as girls,"" Ms. Sandberg and campaign co-founder Rachel Thomas wrote on LinkedIn. ""Decades later, the word still stings, and we still remember the sentiments it evoked: Keep your voice down. Don\'t raise your hand. Don\'t take the lead. If you do, people won\'t like you.""\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMs. Sandberg has enlisted Beyoncé, the Girl Scouts, Victoria Beckham and Condoleezza Rice in the anti-bossy cause, which she kicked off with a round of media appearances and a piece in The Wall Street Journal. The campaign is trying to revive the notion that society is systematically silencing girls because of oppressive stereotyping. As the Guardian\'s Jill Filipovic wrote approvingly, ""Calling girls \'bossy,\' and the whole universe of gendered socialization that comes along with it profoundly impacts behaviour, cognition and perception.""\n\nMs. Sandberg\'s website, banbossy.com, does its best to revive the notion that girls, unlike boys, suffer a crisis of self-confidence as they approach adolescence. By high school, it claims, female self-esteem drops 3.5 times more than male self-esteem. There is undoubtedly some truth in this, although I suspect the reasons have more to do with hormones than with gendered socialization. In any event, this crisis does not prevent them from academically out-achieving the boys by quite a wide margin, or from asserting themselves in sports, volunteer work and student government, or from flooding the medical, law and business schools, or from out-earning their husbands. These days, it\'s not the girls who need a leg up. It\'s the boys.\n\nSo instead of trying to ban pejorative words for girls (What\'s next – ""tattletale""?), here\'s another way to go: Help them learn to overcome adversity and suck it up. For example, Ms. Sandberg seems to have overcome ""bossy"" and soldiered on – to say nothing of Beyoncé and Ms. Rice.\n\nAny girl who\'s smart and assertive learns at some point that not everyone is going to like her. This is a valuable life lesson, and there are two ways to respond. Play dumb, or find people who appreciate smart, assertive girls, and spend more time hanging out with them.\n\nThat\'s what my friend Sarah did. She got the top mark in Grade 11 trigonometry. It was the worst day of her life. Instead of congratulating her, the teacher told the boys he was ashamed of them for letting a girl beat them. She was humiliated. But she picked herself up and got the top mark the next time, too. She went on to succeed in a male-dominated field where men don\'t always appreciate assertive women, and raised two successful and assertive daughters. ""They were very bossy girls,"" she says happily.\n\nSo let\'s not ban bossy. Let\'s reclaim it, like Tina Fey, who wrote her book Bossypants as a badge of honour. And let\'s stop treating girls as fragile flowers who will wilt and fade under the least amount of stress. Real leaders of both genders need thick skins. And ""bossy"" is by no means the worst name they can call you.', '""We, too, were called bossy as girls,"" Ms. Sandberg and campaign co-founder Rachel Thomas wrote on LinkedIn.\nAs the Guardian\'s Jill Filipovic wrote approvingly, ""Calling girls \'bossy,\' and the whole universe of gendered socialization that comes along with it profoundly impacts behaviour, cognition and perception.""\nFor example, Ms. Sandberg seems to have overcome ""bossy"" and soldiered on – to say nothing of Beyoncé and Ms. Rice.\nPlay dumb, or find people who appreciate smart, assertive girls, and spend more time hanging out with them.\n""They were very bossy girls,"" she says happily.']"

According to banbossy.com, between primary school and secondary school, girls’ self-esteem drops 3.5 times more than boys’ and that by the age of 12 girls are much less interested in leading. “By middle school girls are less interested in leadership than boys and that’s because they’re worried about being labelled bossy,” Sandberg says.\n\n“We too were called bossy as girls. Decades later, the word still stings, and we remember the sentiments it evoked: Keep your voice down. Don’t raise your hand. Don’t take the lead. If you do, people won’t like you,” Sandberg and co-founder Rachel Thomas write in a post on LinkedIn.\n\nAlong with Sandberg, high-profile women including Garner, Beyonce and former US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, have filmed a video message, released earlier this week, that encourages people to join the #banbossy campaign. “I’m not bossy, I’m the boss,” says Beyonce.\n\nWithin days of the #banbossy launch more than 100,000 people have already signed a pledge to stop using the word. As with all viral campaigns, however, there have been a number of vocal detractors.\n\nIt has been labelled ‘Stupidest campaign ever’ across social media, while Peggy Drexler writes in an op-ed for CNN that instead of banning the word bossy, women need to reclaim the positive nature of “bossiness“.\n\nSo hurtful, Tina Fey. So hurtful. pic.twitter.com/xY9vSzWQ8K — T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) March 10, 2014\n\n“By banning the word ‘bossy’ it risks sending the message that there’s something wrong with the characteristics associated with the word,” she writes.\n\nJessica Roy, in an op-ed for TIME says she, “doesn’t give a $*%& if you call me bossy.” Through this campaign, she believes Sandberg is using energy, money and influence to focus on “insignificant” issues, when important issues like lack of affordable childcare, sexual assault and domestic abuse as well as the lack of access to education worldwide would benefit more from the attention and money that Sandberg is providing for this campaign.\n\n“It says a lot about Sandberg’s brand of feminism that this campaign focuses on policing language rather than bringing attention to important issues that have real impact on women and girls”, Roy writes.\n\nWhat do you think about banning the word bossy? Will you join the #banbossy campaign?', 'Sheryl Sandberg has long wanted to ban words like “bossy” when referring to young girls..

Her behavior could be seen as an early indication of her leadership prowess, but at the time, she was simply called ""bossy."" That word -- which Sandberg now calls ""the other b-word"" -- is so common it may seem benign or even cute. Not so, Sandberg wrote in a recent column for The Wall Street Journal. ""Bossy,"" she argues, can hurts girls and even stunt their leadership potential, and if she had her way, it would be banned altogether. A new campaign aims to do just that.\n\nSandberg and Girl Scouts USA CEO Anna Maria Chávez have joined forces to launch a new public service campaign called ""Ban Bossy,"" reports ABC News. The goal is to bring awareness to the word ""bossy"" and its negative impact on girls well into their working years.\n\n""Although the two of us come from different backgrounds, we both heard the same put-down. Call it the other B-word,"" Sandberg wrote the Wall Street Journal column announcing the venture. ""Whether it is said directly or implied, girls get the message: Don\'t be bossy. Don\'t raise your hand too much. Keep your voice down. Don\'t lead.""\n\nSandberg notes that the word ""bossy"" is almost exclusively reserved for girls; even the Oxford Dictionary defines the word as a ""meddling woman."" When a boy takes charge in the classroom or playground, she notes, he is seen as a strong leader. When a girl does the same, she is criticized. She suggests this attitude conditions girls to avoid leadership roles, stunting their potential.\n\n""We know that by middle school, more boys than girls want to lead, and if you ask girls why they don\'t want to lead, whether it\'s the school project all the way on to running for office, they don\'t want to be called bossy, and they don\'t want to be disliked,"" Sandberg told ABC News. She adds that the label may change as girls grow up, but the sentiment does not. ""They\'re bossy as little girls, and then they\'re aggressive, political, shrill, too ambitious as women.""\n\nSandberg and Chávez suggested in their column that this sort of demonization of leadership qualities has a widespread societal impact.\n\n""If you look at the world, women do 66 percent of the work in the world. Woman produce 50 percent of the food. Women make 10 percent of the income and women own 1 percent of the property. We are 50 percent of the population. We are 5 percent of the Fortune 500 CEOs,"" Sandberg told ABC News. ""We are 17 percent of the board seats. We are 19 percent in Congress. That\'s not enough for 50 percent of the population. We live in a world that is overwhelming run and owned by men.""\n\nSandberg is quick to note that the Ban Bossy campaign -- and its accompanying website, banbossy.com -- are not meant to encourage rude, mean-girl behavior, reported ABC News. In an interview at Facebook headquarters, she emphasized that leadership is ""not bullying"" or ""aggression,"" but rather ""the expectation that you can use your voice for good.""\n\nSandberg made women\'s workplace success a social cause, reports NPR.

11931,http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/03/12/why-we-should-be-banning-word-bossy,entertainment,"['When I was a little girl, I liked to direct. I orchestrated plays starring the neighborhood kids that we performed in my backyard. I organized hopscotch tournaments. And I was called ""bossy"" more than once.\n\nThere was never any doubt this was an insult.\n\nSo, in the interest of all the well-organized, socially developed little girls of tomorrow, I’m intrigued by the new initiative to ban the word, launched by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in partnership with Girl Scouts USA CEO Anna Maria Chavez and former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice—and a little help from Beyoncé.\n\nSandberg has become a somewhat polarizing figure since writing Lean In, a book with advice for women on how to succeed in corporate America. She is, after all, a privileged, wealthy, white woman whose best-selling “feminist manifesto” attributed the gender disparity in leadership roles more to individual choices than to the very real structural barriers that block advancement for so many.\n\nSo it\'s no surprise that Sandberg is taking her share of flack for the ""Ban Bossy"" campaign too. Critics contend that women have bigger fish to fry than the word “bossy,” and a better strategy might be to reclaim the word, making it a badge of honor instead of an insult. Fair enough.\n\nAnd yet the ripple effects of the word are undeniable, particularly when we\'re talking about girls. When a girl taking charge is labeled “bossy” for behavior that when exhibited by a boy might be called ""leadership,"" it\'s clear understanding that “bossy” is bad. There is no nuance; the tidy admonishment says there’s something wrong with taking the lead, and people won’t like you if you do. It’s a label girls learn pretty quickly to avoid it by keeping quiet and backing down when challenged.\n\nIt’s not just the word that’s a problem: It’s the gendered expectations encapsulated in it. We think we’re beyond these biases, but research shows that even when we think we’re treating boys and girls equally, we’re not. Sandberg cites studies showing that teachers who think they call on girls as frequently as boys actually favor boys.\n\nThe socialization takes hold rapidly: According to ""Ban Bossy,"" by middle school, girls are less interested in leading than boys, and girls are twice as likely to worry that leadership roles will make them seem “bossy.” This happens around the same time that girls who excelled in science and math during elementary school suddenly seem to lose interest.\n\nThese biases persist into adulthood. Where a man is considered “assertive,” a woman is considered that other b-word. Even some of the most successful women in the world shy away from the label “ambitious.”\n\nAccording to Sandberg, numbers tell the story.\n\n“Women do 66 percent of the work in the world,” she said on Good Morning America, but “make 10 percent of the income and own 1 percent of the property. We are 50 percent of the population. We are 5 percent of the Fortune 500 CEOs. We are 17 percent of the board seats. We are 19 percent in Congress.”\n\nIn the face of such statistics, a splashy campaign devoted to banning a word might seem an outsize effort directed at a trivial goal, but I’m not so sure. A girl who’s called bossy is left to her own devices to fight back—if she’s up for a battle at all—or she turns silent, questions herself. And anyway, why can\'t we have both a new awareness of ""bossy"" and work to even out the disparity in leadership roles? With a little more of the former now, we might need less of the latter when today\'s kids are all grown up and running the show.\n\nWhen we’re young, articulately combating something as gnarled and ingrained as gender norms is probably a bit beyond our capabilities, particularly if we’re in the middle of organizing a hopscotch tournament. If I were transported back to my schoolgirl days of being called bossy on the playground, I think I’d be pretty happy to have a comeback—cheesy marketing slogan or not—at the ready.\n\n“To quote Beyoncé,” I might have said, “I’m not bossy—I’m the boss.”', 'When I was a little girl, I liked to direct.\nAnd I was called ""bossy"" more than once.\nWhen a girl taking charge is labeled “bossy” for behavior that when exhibited by a boy might be called ""leadership,"" it\'s clear understanding that “bossy” is bad.\nSandberg cites studies showing that teachers who think they call on girls as frequently as boys actually favor boys.\nA girl who’s called bossy is left to her own devices to fight back—if she’s up for a battle at all—or she turns silent, questions herself.']"

And I understand part of an organization\'s role involves spreading the word about its mission, sometimes by any means necessary. But Sandberg\'s latest media push with Girl Scouts CEO Anna Maria Chávez and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice -- a proposed ban on the word ""bossy,"" which she feels derides a trait in girls that is lauded in boys -- falls into the same trap similar campaigns did. Basically, a ban on any word is an infringement on the right to free speech.\n\nI\'m not saying Sandberg\'s wrong about how differently girls and boys are treated. She\'s quite right, in fact. I won\'t rehash Lean In\'s proof, but we\'ve all seen the stats and studies showing this to be the case. So, bravo to Sandberg, Rice and Chávez for attempting to address this injustice.\n\nBut ban the behavior, not a word.\n\nAbout the Ban Bossy fervor, Jill Krause of Baby Rabies said, ""How about we focus on teaching our girls self worth and independence and not internalizing words. Because, sadly, \'bossy\' is one of the most benign that will be thrown at them.""\n\nOr as Zach Rosenberg of 8BitDad put it, ""It\'s all a lot more complicated than a word.""\n\nBanning words is like banning books one word at a time. When you tell me to exorcise a word from my vernacular, you are removing one tiny piece of that large and vital freedom, which, by the way, is the same one Sandberg used to make her pitch.\n\nNow, I understand the people behind the Ban Bossy campaign really don\'t think they\'ll ever kill the word. It\'s just to drum up exactly the type of attention they\'re getting. For me, however, the messaging and implication of banning words shifts my focus from the intended topic. No matter how much I agree or disagree with a stance, free speech trumps everything. I love freedom of speech. I love it so much I want to write it a sonnet using banned words, the kind that\'ll make flowers wilt and Christians faint.\n\nLook, one day, my boys will drop the f-bomb, probably during a visit with the grandparents or in front of the school principal. When that happens, I will reiterate the lesson I\'ve been telling them since they grasped language: ""Words are powerful, so use them appropriately. There\'s a time and a place for all words."" I\'ll address their behavior, ask why they used it and what they thought might happen. I\'ll show them how they might have chosen a better word or phrase to achieve their goal. But, I won\'t tell them to never use it, because sometimes, you just need to. (Hell, liberal use of the f-bomb did me quite well last year.)\n\nRather than banning it, we can teach girls to own it, leaving us free to use it when and how we want. Mother of two Christina Berube said, ""My daughter (5) has been called an alpha female since age 2. Thankfully, she is in a preschool where strong girls are admired and encouraged. I understand that her bossiness has an upside, and we are working to build up that strength--something I think could lead to leadership skills."" And she added, ""When my daughter orders my son around like some kind of hired plaything and begins every command with a contradictory \'NO\' to his ideas, she\'s not showing leadership skills, she\'s showing dictatorship skills. She\'s just f*&^%ing bossy.""\n\nBesides, trying to ban the word ""bossy"" seems kinda bossy.

Bossy has a negative connotation in our society, and that is unfortunate. Men are rarely labeled bossy; they\'re just called bosses. I was once one of less than a handful of women in an executive position at a company of hundreds, if not thousands, and much of what I did exactly in the same way as my male counterparts was received negatively. They were seen as strong leaders, while I was often labeled bitchy and probably menstruating. The men ""knew what they wanted,"" while I was ""hard to figure out."" The hardest part was that a lot of times these labels came from other women.\n\nIt bothered me at times, but honestly, I don\'t think being called bossy is the biggest problem women face at work.\n\nIf you think about it, you can be bossy without being good at your job. You can be bossy without having an ounce of leadership qualities. Frankly, you can be bossy and have every right to be, because that\'s what bosses have to do sometimes, whether they\'re the head of a company or a household.\n\nIf we keep taking every single thing that\'s said about us in the workplace personally, we are going to get... nowhere. In my almost 20 years in the corporate world, I saw our penchant towards sensitivity and an inability to let things roll off our backs as easily as men to have far greater consequences. We tend to feel things before we think them through. Maybe it\'s how we\'re wired; maybe it\'s not. But for those of us who constantly push ourselves to ditch that stereotype and approach our work -- dare I say it -- like a man, it often backfires.\n\nThat\'s where the other ""B"" word comes in, and I was probably called it more times than I would ever care to think about.\n\nSo, while millions have already flocked to Sandberg\'s website and more than 100,000 have signed pledges promising to stop using the word, I sigh with disappointment that these women with huge platforms aren\'t seizing the opportunity to talk about far more important issues facing working women, like say, flexible work schedules, better maternity leave policies, mentorship programs and more affordable child care.\n\nBut far be it for me to tell anyone else what to do.', 'Men are rarely labeled bossy; they\'re just called bosses.\nThe hardest part was that a lot of times these labels came from other women.\nIt bothered me at times, but honestly, I don\'t think being called bossy is the biggest problem women face at work.\nIf you think about it, you can be bossy without being good at your job.\nThat\'s where the other ""B"" word comes in, and I was probably called it more times than I would ever care to think about.']"

To ban the word ‘bossy’.\n\nSheryl believes that when a little girl is called bossy, it sends a message: don’t raise your hand or speak up.\n\nShe says that by middle school, girls are less interested in leading than boys – a trend that continues into adulthood.\n\nSheryl reckons that by banning bossy, “together we can encourage girls to lead.

We should own it, instead.\n\nBossy is, after all, not a gender specific word. Unlike completely hateful terms such as ‘slag’, it applies to both sexes.\n\nThe difference, the issue, is what happens when each sex is called it – women, apparently, find it derogatory, men don’t give it a second thought, let alone take it as an insult.\n\n(Mind you, if anything else was happening anywhere in the world at the time they were called it, they’re unlikely to have heard it in the first place. *Cough* can’t multi-task *cough*.)\n\nInstead of banning bossy, we need??to redefine it.\n\nWhy should bossiness be a negative quality?\n\nI bet if you thoroughly researched the entire history of our planet, you’d discover that all the important things, the triumphs, the great leaps forward, had been made by bossy people.\n\nThere probably would have been other bossy people behind the scenes of each one of them too, being just as bossy but doing it a bit more quietly.\n\nPrepare to be stunned: I’ve been called bossy all my life. I’ve never argued because it’s pretty much undeniable (and preferable to ‘pushy’).\n\nNo man would be ashamed of it and neither am I.\n\nTo me, being bossy means being passionate and confident in my opinions, of which I have many.\n\nWhat’s wrong with that?\n\nAll the women I like and admire are bossy. My mum’s bossy and so was her mother before her. Most of my friends are bossy.\n\nAll of the people I wish I was friends with seem bossy.\n\nBossy characters are the best ones in TV shows and the bossy member of the band is the one you always look at.\n\nThe simple truth is we have to forget about banning it, and realise that bossy is BEST.\n\nIt’s definitely the most interesting.\n\nAnd maybe if we drew future generations’ attention to that, instead of thinking that we need to censor parts of the dictionary for half of them, we’d stand a better chance of achieving true equality one day.\n\nSo girls, be bossy and proud.

11938,http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/03/12/should-facebooks-sheryl-sandberg-and-beyonce-ban-bossy,entertainment,"['Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has employed the help of several female celebrities in a new campaign to “ban bossy.” The initiative aims to stop use of a word they say discourages young girls’ desire to become leaders.\n\nThe public service campaign is a partnership between Sandberg’s LeanIn.org and the Girl Scouts meant to stop squashing girls’ ambition by associating it with a negative word. Sandberg said that stereotypes of men are “aggressive” and “assertive” but those of women are “giving” and “speak when spoken to.” She said this means girls who are outspoken are called bossy four times as much as boys.\n\n“The word ‘bossy’ typifies what is a very serious problem for women, which is we don’t like female leadership,” Sandberg said. “Women got 50 percent of the college degrees in this country over 30 years ago. Thirty years is plenty of time to get more women into a leadership role. But if we continue to react negatively when girls lead or women lead, we are not going change the numbers at the top of any industry.”\n\nBeyonce, Jennifer Garner, Jane Lynch and Condoloeezza Rice are among the women joining Sandberg in a public service announcement calling for a ban of bossy. The campaign says parents and teachers should encourage girls to talk about their ambitions and take more risks, and should provide them with strong female role models.\n\n“Women are 5 percent of the Fortune 500 CEOs, and it doesn’t hit 5 percent in any country in the world except Vietnam, where it’s 5.5 percent. So it’s basically 5 percent or lower for the top listed companies in the world, regardless of industry,” Sandberg said. “And that’s why this bossy campaign is so important, because our stereotype that women shouldn’t lead is holding back women in every industry.”\n\nBut some argue that banning the word bossy doesn’t actually address the problem. Assistant Professor of psychology Peggy Drexler said that if bossy is banned, other negative words will crop up in its place. She also argues that, by nature, bosses are bossy:\n\n[M]oving to abolish the word ""bossy"" risks sending the message that there\'s something wrong with those characteristics associated with bossiness: taking charge and speaking your mind. Again, the problem isn\'t the word, or the behavior, but the reaction to the behavior, and the acceptance among women of the word as a disparaging one.\n\n\n\nDrexler also emphasizes the harm in sending young girls a message that the only way to success is being a leader, “and that\'s just not true.”', '“The word ‘bossy’ typifies what is a very serious problem for women, which is we don’t like female leadership,” Sandberg said.\n“And that’s why this bossy campaign is so important, because our stereotype that women shouldn’t lead is holding back women in every industry.”But some argue that banning the word bossy doesn’t actually address the problem.\nAssistant Professor of psychology Peggy Drexler said that if bossy is banned, other negative words will crop up in its place.\nShe also argues that, by nature, bosses are bossy:[M]oving to abolish the word ""bossy"" risks sending the message that there\'s something wrong with those characteristics associated with bossiness: taking charge and speaking your mind.\nDrexler also emphasizes the harm in sending young girls a message that the only way to success is being a leader, “and that\'s just not true.”']"

To ban the word ‘bossy’.\n\nSheryl believes that when a little girl is called bossy, it sends a message: don’t raise your hand or speak up.\n\nShe says that by middle school, girls are less interested in leading than boys – a trend that continues into adulthood.\n\nSheryl reckons that by banning bossy, “together we can encourage girls to lead. I want every little girl who’s told she’s bossy to be told instead that she has leadership skills.”\n\nYes, that sounds like a phrase that would just roll naturally off the tongue, doesn’t it?\n\n“She’s such a leadership-skilled cow!”\n\nIt’s probably ungrateful to criticise this campaign, because at least Sheryl is doing something, taking action to improve the future for all of us – so rather than simply saying it’s wrong, let’s go with… misguided.\n\nForbidding people from using the word bossy is not the right way of dealing with this problem.\n\nWe shouldn’t ban bossy. We should own it, instead.\n\nBossy is, after all, not a gender specific word. Unlike completely hateful terms such as ‘slag’, it applies to both sexes.\n\nThe difference, the issue, is what happens when each sex is called it – women, apparently, find it derogatory, men don’t give it a second thought, let alone take it as an insult.\n\n(Mind you, if anything else was happening anywhere in the world at the time they were called it, they’re unlikely to have heard it in the first place. *Cough* can’t multi-task *cough*.)\n\nInstead of banning bossy, we need??to redefine it.\n\nWhy should bossiness be a negative quality?\n\nI bet if you thoroughly researched the entire history of our planet, you’d discover that all the important things, the triumphs, the great leaps forward, had been made by bossy people.\n\nThere probably would have been other bossy people behind the scenes of each one of them too, being just as bossy but doing it a bit more quietly.\n\nPrepare to be stunned: I’ve been called bossy all my life. I’ve never argued because it’s pretty much undeniable (and preferable to ‘pushy’).\n\nNo man would be ashamed of it and neither am I.\n\nTo me, being bossy means being passionate and confident in my opinions, of which I have many.\n\nWhat’s wrong with that?\n\nAll the women I like and admire are bossy. My mum’s bossy and so was her mother before her. Most of my friends are bossy.\n\nAll of the people I wish I was friends with seem bossy.\n\nBossy characters are the best ones in TV shows and the bossy member of the band is the one you always look at.\n\nThe simple truth is we have to forget about banning it, and realise that bossy is BEST.\n\nIt’s definitely the most interesting.\n\nAnd maybe if we drew future generations’ attention to that, instead of thinking that we need to censor parts of the dictionary for half of them, we’d stand a better chance of achieving true equality one day.\n\nSo girls, be bossy and proud.

11942,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adrienne-becker/boss-vs-bossy_b_4950540.html,entertainment,"['I\'ve been asked about Sheryl Sandberg\'s campaign to ban the word ""bossy"" over and over this week because I\'m one of the founders of the ""She\'s So Boss"" movement ( www.shessoboss.com ). The feeling seems to be that we might be threatened by the ""Ban Bossy"" initiative. But you\'ll find no catfight here. I\'m delighted by ""Ban Bossy,"" which is an organized effort like our own that is devoting resources to publicly giving girls more attention and empowering them to fully realize their potential. It is long overdue and sorely needed. The entire world, including the West, continues to treat girls and women inequitably -- as Sandberg points out, women represent 50 percent of the population and perform 66 percent of the world\'s labor, but they earn only 10 percent of the income and own just 1 percent of global goods and property. And while it\'s tempting to think that the modern world has changed all that, we must not be seduced into complacency -- this inequity continues to be one of today\'s most pressing problems. There is strong evidence to suggest that having women in leadership positions in representative numbers would go a long way toward relieving many of the world\'s ills, from poor education to the prevalence of violent crime, stagnant economies to malnutrition. Women\'s issues, it turns out, are human issues, and we can thank the so-boss Hillary Clinton for reminding us of this point. As with any pressing issue, of course, you can explain it to someone, and substantiate it with countless facts and figures -- but until that person sees it for herself, she won\'t be able to truly make the fight her own. So if ""Ban Bossy"" and Beyoncé and the compelling collection of celebrities supporting the ban can engage young women to consider all the implications of that word in relation to themselves, it is well worth the effort. Especially since the whole point of highlighting the negative associations of the word ""bossy"" is to encourage girls to pursue the brass ring without fearing the stigma and implicit condemnation for having the temerity to be openly ambitious.\n\nAnd that\'s precisely what the mission of ""She\'s So Boss"" is: to encourage young women to strive for empowerment, for ownership. For equality in all walks of life. If we can connect today\'s girls with female bosses around the country -- whether it\'s the girl who started a music festival because there were none in her city that would have her; the girl who got a public pool to re-open in an economically depressed neighborhood so kids from poor families could learn how to swim; or the girl who skied the giant slalom in Sochi as the only Olympian from the U.S. Virgin Islands -- we have created an opportunity to show the next generation just how much potential they have.\n\n\n\nHere\'s another figure to help make the case: there are more than 150 million females out there in the U.S. alone, but less than 20 percent of leadership positions across all industries -- including the government -- are held by women. Clearly, we need all the help we can get in encouraging girls to reach for the top. Sure, nobody wants to be known as ""bossy,"" but many of us want to be ""the boss."" Just ask Sheryl Sandberg.\n\n\n\nWhen you get down to it, the ""Ban Bossy"" and ""She\'s So Boss"" campaigns are complementary, accretive -- the more, the better. Getting girls to recognize, and to realize, their power is the common goal. Call it what you like just so long as we all strive together to change the world for the better by giving women a representative voice and equal rewards for their efforts.\n\n\n\nAt ""She\'s So Boss,"" we really see it as a pay-it-forward kind of thing, with older generations of women giving back to the girls they raise, teach, and mentor, so the cycle can perpetuate and grow. Whether you want to ban ""bossy,"" be ""so boss,"" or be ""the boss,"" let\'s make it happen together. And yes, that\'s -- if you\'ll forgive me for being just a little bossy here -- an order.', 'I\'ve been asked about Sheryl Sandberg\'s campaign to ban the word ""bossy"" over and over this week because I\'m one of the founders of the ""She\'s So Boss"" movement ( www.shessoboss.com ).\nThe feeling seems to be that we might be threatened by the ""Ban Bossy"" initiative.\nSure, nobody wants to be known as ""bossy,"" but many of us want to be ""the boss.""\nWhen you get down to it, the ""Ban Bossy"" and ""She\'s So Boss"" campaigns are complementary, accretive -- the more, the better.\nWhether you want to ban ""bossy,"" be ""so boss,"" or be ""the boss,"" let\'s make it happen together.']"

But on Fox & Friends, phony expert Suzanne Venker portrayed it as some kind of dangerous feminist plot – to make 50% of world leaders women and 50% of households run by men. Oh, the horrors!\n\nIn its article about the campaign, ABC News explains how and why Sandberg recruited Rice and GSUSA’s Anna Maria Chávez in an effort to empower girls and women for leadership roles.\n\nI will admit I have my doubts about the usefulness of this campaign. But Fox & Friends addressed the issue in typical “fair and balanced” fashion: by demonizing its proponent and ignoring the substantive issues.\n\nCo-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck set the tone with her introductory “question”: “Is this just feminist propaganda masked as empowerment?”\n\nBooking Venker as the only guest ensured the answer. She’s an anti-feminist who thinks women should submit to men, who accuses feminists of waging a war on men and who urges women to “let husbands bring home the bulk of the bacon so women can have the balanced lives they seek.”\n\nNot that Venker has any suggestions about raising wages or other strategies to make those “balanced lives” actually affordable. But hey, those details are for the real experts. Venker’s “credentials” consist of being a wife and mother, a middle school English teacher in a “former life,” an author and a regular media personality. I’m sure it doesn’t hurt that she’s Phyllis Schlafly’s niece, either.\n\nYet somehow, nobody told Fox & Friends viewers any of this about Venker. She was introduced by co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck merely as “the founder of Women For Men and the author of the War on Men.”\n\n“If you are a bossy person, then just stop being bossy,” Venker advised with a giggle. Which is so not the point of the campaign.\n\nIt was Brian Kilmeade, of all people, who seemed to get it. He pushed back, albeit in the mildest way possible. “I like the fact that you might have a daughter or a sister or somebody in your family that has that leadership tendency and you maybe can hone that a little. I wouldn’t push that away,” he admonished.\n\nVenker had to agree. But rather than follow that path – which could lead straight to endorsing women as leaders - Venker switched to demonizing. And revealing that sinister plot behind Sandberg’s campaign!\n\nPeople have to understand that these movements… (have) a much greater mission. It’s not as simple as it seems. Her ultimate goal is that – well, there are several things. Number one, she wants 50% of men to run the home and 50% of women to run the countries and the companies. That’s the bigger mission. Then her argument is, why (aren’t) there more women at the top? Well, obviously, gender stereotypes. It can’t be anything else but that. …And the reality is, there are sound reasons why there are not more women at the top. And this is just um, a silly way of trying to focus on something that is not a real issue.\n\nI’m all for debating the merits of Sandberg’s campaign or even if there’s “a real issue” as Venker put it. But not one of the three Fox co-hosts fostered that kind of discussion. Their silence here gave Venker an implicit stamp of approval.\n\nShe continued:\n\nI taught for years – I’m not sure that (Sandberg) has – and I can tell you that it is boys who desperately need our attention, not girls. And we do not hear that on any kind of major media. …Why are we not addressing that issue? Why are we focusing on this kind of thing when we should be focusing on boys?\n\nOf course boys need help, too. But Venker, in her agenda-driven focus, failed to consider that helping one sex does not preclude helping the other.\n\nCo-host Clayton Morris wrapped up the segment by saying, “I think she’s one of the most wise women in this country.”', 'Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has spearheaded the “Ban Bossy” campaign along with such other leaders as Condoleezza Rice and the CEO of Girl Scouts of the USA.\nBut on Fox & Friends, phony expert Suzanne Venker portrayed it as some kind of dangerous feminist plot – to make 50% of world leaders women and 50% of households run by men.\nBut Fox & Friends addressed the issue in typical “fair and balanced” fashion: by demonizing its proponent and ignoring the substantive issues.\nNumber one, she wants 50% of men to run the home and 50% of women to run the countries and the companies.\nI’m all for debating the merits of Sandberg’s campaign or even if there’s “a real issue” as Venker put it.']"

The movement has people worried that the celebrity endorsers are manipulating the public in an effort to control people\'s civil liberties.\n\nBan Bossy is a campaign between Girl Scouts USA and Leanin.org, aiming to encourage leadership among young girls. Beyoncé, Jennifer Garner, Jan Lynch, Condoleezza Rice and other female notables teamed up to release a public service announcement encouraging others to ban the word Bossy from people\'s vocabulary.\n\n""I\'m not bossy,"" Beyoncé says in the video. ""I\'m the boss.""\n\nSheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook is also featured in the PSA. In a recent interview with ""Good Morning America"" she said, ""We call girls \'bossy\' on the playground, we call them \'too aggressive\' or other B-words in the workplace. They\'re \'bossy\' as little girls, and then they\'re \'aggressive\', \'political,\' \'shrill,\' \'too ambitious\' as women.""\n\nThe banbossy.com website says, ""When a little boy asserts himself, he\'s called a ""leader."" Yet when a little girl does the same, she risks being branded ""bossy."" Words like bossy send a message: don\'t raise your hand or speak up.""\n\nAs Christians it is important to know what Gods words says about women and their role in society. In ancient Jewish culture it was patriarchy that excluded women from leading but in the Bible both in the old and new testaments powerful women like, the warrior and judge Deborah, who led Israel against her enemies; and Esther, who saved her people, and Mary Magdalene one of Jesus followers who was given the task of being the very first to inform others of His resurrection, were all referenced as leaders.\n\nWhile Jesus was physically on earth He publicly included many women as his followers. He taught crowds of both men and women. And he healed and performed miracles as willingly for women, as for men.\n\nBible scriptures also support the message of equality for women. Here are some examples:\n\n""There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."" Galatians 3:28\n\n""For as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God.""\n\n1 Corinthians 11:12\n\nAlthough the above scriptures are accredited to the writings of the apostle Paul he is also often looked at harshly for some of his statements in the Bible towards women. ""I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet."" 1 Timothy 2:12 states.\n\nMany scholars attribute the above statement to the customs of the time in which Paul was speaking. After His death and resurrection women continued to flock to meetings to hear the Gospel message since Christ embraced women as he taught.\n\nBiblical proof that Paul was not really against women teaching are his own writings. The apostle spoke highly of the couple Priscilla and Aquila. They lived, worked, and traveled with the Apostle Paul, and he described them as his ""fellow workers in Christ Jesus,"" in Romans 16:3. Verifying that he in fact called Priscilla a teacher.\n\nMany people\'s comments on the public service announcement to ban bossy are afraid that this movement is a way for feminist people to try and take away the public\'s first amendment rights of freedom of speech as described in the United States constitution.\n\n""They want to CONTROL you,"" one comment read, as many others agreed. Another added, ""So..what? Strike it from dictionaries, prosecute anyone who uses the word?""\n\nOthers felt like the celebrity endorsements and any funds used to produce the video would be better spent towards other efforts. ""Why not use a fraction of this campaign to develop programs to empower young girls/ young women vs censuring everyone,"" someone else remarked.\n\nChristians are instructed in the bible to live with a balance, whether the public fears that Ban Bossy is a ploy to change the structure of society or not.\n\n""Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord,"" the Bible states. Actress Candace Cameron described the definition of Biblical submission after Feminist greatly criticized her for living by the scripture.\n\n""The definition I\'m using with the word \'submissive\' is the Biblical definition of that,"" she said.

Those gifts were in keeping with Shailene Woodley’s hippie ways. She makes her own medicines (good luck with that), doesn’t have a cellphone, and said, “a big theme in my life is sisterhood”. She also may have landed the lead in Divergent because she told the producers her hobby is learning how to survive in the wild. That’s my hobby, too!

According to Shailene Woodley: healthy relationships. “Twilight, I’m sorry, is about a very unhealthy, toxic relationship.

In a world ruled by tweets and memes, Netflix and YouTube, is there even a place for late-night talk shows anymore?\n\nFOR THE RECORD:\n\nJimmy Fallon: A critic’s notebook in the March 13 Calendar section implied that “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon has not interviewed a U.S. president. In fact, Fallon interviewed President Obama on his previous show, “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon.” —\n\n\n\nDon’t know about talk shows plural, but there’s certainly a place for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” if only because Fallon’s been rigorously carving it out from the calcified post-nightly news landscape himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPHOTOS: Jimmy Fallon hosts his first ‘Tonight Show’\n\nWhether he’s playing Flip Cup with Annette Bening, photo-bombing tourists with Jon Hamm, taking a Polar Plunge dare from Rahm Emanuel or just chatting it up with the endless array of his “very favorite” people, Fallon has, in less than two months, re-framed the franchise and sparked the kind of audience excitement “The Tonight Show” hasn’t seen in years.\n\nThe ratings have soared, and why not? Where else are you going to see Michelle Obama hamming it up with Will Ferrell, Emma Thompson playing Pictionary with Bradley Cooper or Idina Menzel killing the freshly Oscar-anointed “Let It Go” with only toy instruments as accompaniment?\n\nFallon’s midcareer energy infuses his “Tonight Show” with the kind of good-natured, slightly silly “welcome to the party” feel that Ellen DeGeneres brought so successfully to daytime (and more divisively to this year’s Oscars). Night after night there is music and games, pranks and funny anecdotes, all involving A-list stars with whom Fallon interacts as admiring peer rather than benevolent dictator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt may still be difficult to imagine Fallon interviewing the president (although if Zach Galifianakis can do it...) or taking on a celebrity with real issues (à la the famous Leno/Hugh Grant interview). But he happily brought Randy Newman on in early weeks to criticize “The Tonight Show’s” move from Los Angeles to New York, which Newman then punctuated by playing “I Love L.A.”\n\nAdmittedly, Fallon gave us quite a scare in the beginning. His Feb. 17 debut was nothing if not underwhelming. Uncharacteristically subdued and pale, Fallon spent much of the hour downplaying his worthiness to accept the mantle.\n\nPHOTOS: Classic ‘Tonight Show’ moments\n\nIf it hadn’t been for U2 (who played on the roof of Rockefeller Center) and Stephen Colbert (who showered Fallon with pennies), the first show would have been a total dud.\n\nWhether it was a clever exercise in expectation management or just a bad case of opening-night jitters, that initial clammy uncertainty is now just a distant memory. Fallon has swiftly claimed ownership of the iconic hour in a way that pays homage to tradition — relax everyone, there will still be an opening monologue — but, mercifully, does not bow to it.\n\nUnder Johnny, and then Jay, “The Tonight Show” became very pleased with itself. For up-and-coming comedians, snagging a “spot on Carson” could make or break a career, and eventually that feeling extended itself across the entertainment industry. For moviemakers, musicians, writers and eventually politicians, an appearance on “The Tonight Show” became such a marketing necessity it was treated as an honor.\n\nWhile this cemented the show as a ratings leader, it also made the guy behind the desk seem more monarch as host; even the ever-amiable Leno granted an audience more than sat down for a chat.\n\nFallon may have the desk, but it seems more like a place for him to park his Chinese food or write his Thank You notes than a symbol of authority. Sweetly enthusiastic enough to overcome even an annoying reliance on first-person plural — every guest is “our favorite” whom “we just love” — Fallon is much closer to his pre-hosting days than Leno or Letterman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPHOTOS: 13 memorable stars from ‘Saturday Night Live’\n\nIndeed, many of his early guests, including Tina Fey, Cameron Diaz, Adam Sandler and Demi Lovato, are actual friends and former colleagues. Lovato gave him a homemade BFF sweatshirt; Diaz “pranked” Fallon’s infant daughter Winnie and brought a photo. It’s hard to imagine David Letterman even having a BFF or Leno being privately pranked by anyone.\n\nAnd it isn’t just age. Unlike, say, Conan O’Brien or even Jimmy Kimmel, Fallon’s shtick is his everyman quality. He is the Tom Hanks of hosting, able to project endearing uncertainty even as he clearly runs the show.\n\nAs both a recently married guy and a new father, Fallon straddles the thirty/fortysomething demo. His famous boyishness, musical inclinations and facility with social media resonate with a younger generation. All of which he knows and plays up to his advantage. Who doesn’t like a good photo-bombing set?\n\nHis “Tonight Show,” like his “Late Night,” is also much more of an ensemble gig than his predecessors.

I’ve learned that both The Tonight Show With Jay Leno and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon are being submitted by NBC along with Late Night With Seth Meyers, Last Call With Carson Daly and the network’s venerable late-night sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live. NBC was in a similar situation during the 2009-2010 season when both The Tonight Show With Conan O’Brien, which aired through January, and Tonight Show With Jay Leno, which succeeded it, were submitted (O’Brien landed a nomination). Given the fact that Fallon just moved into Tonight Show and is looking to establish himself as host, it makes sense for him only to be submitted for that show. For Leno, this could be the last time he is up for a late-night Emmy. His Tonight Show has been nominated 10 times for Best Music, Comedy Or Variety Series, winning once. Fallon and Meyers’ previous shows, Late Night and SNL, also have been nominated in the top variety category.\n\nIn other Emmy submission news, Netflix’s Orange Is the New Black is switching to comedy series after its surprise run as a drama series at the Golden Globes, where it netted an acting nomination for Taylor Schilling.

Brenner, who died Saturday at age 78, leaves the stand-up stage as a master of observational humor.\n\nSure, his act, while smart, didn’t carry the intellectual heft of a Mort Sahl. And while his punchlines could be pointed when appropriate, his humor arrived devoid of the anger that fueled the likes of George Carlin and Richard Pryor.\n\nBut Brenner’s affable relatability proved his strength, letting audience members feel like they were in on the joke as he mined everyday absurdities for material. In that first “Tonight Show” appearance, he won over the crowd with eight minutes about asking for directions, with his comic curiosity driving the routine.\n\n“Whose the guy who makes maps?” Brenner asked the audience in Carson’s New York studio, as if he were talking just to them and not to the millions watching at home. “Why does every map have to be 20 feet by 38 feet? Everyone’s gotta get out of the car when you open them.”\n\nThe bit, which included what would become many comedians\' go-to phrase – “Did you ever notice…” – offered a roadmap for future great and not-so-great stand-ups. It’s a routine that could have rolled out of the mouth of Seinfeld, whose “Tonight Show” debut in 1981 included a gag about the folly of “Left Turn O.K.” traffic signs.\n\nBrenner never quite reached the success of Seinfeld or fellow Philadelphian Bill Cosby, whose deeper experience-driven, storytelling-style humor he came closest to capturing in his at-times achingly funny 1983 memoir, “Soft Pretzels and Mustard.”\n\nWhile Brenner appeared on or guest hosted “The Tonight Show” 150 times, he wasn’t even in the running for the job when Carson stepped down in 1992 (though Brenner believed the post would have been his had Carson quit a decade earlier). Personal issues during Brenner’s later career limited his stand-up appearances.\n\nBut at his best, David Brenner took his many fans on somewhat warped journeys into the silliness of the commonplace – and got us lost in laughter.\n\nJere Hester is founding director of the award-winning, multi-media NYCity News Service at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism.
