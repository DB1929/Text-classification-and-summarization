Yahoo also said authorities withdrew some requests after it announced in July that it would notify individuals in many cases when their records are being sought. Google has a similar policy.\n\nGoogle said it received 27,477 requests from government agencies around the world in the second half of 2013, while Yahoo reported 21,425. Most of those originated in the United States and stemmed from criminal or other legal investigations, rather than national security intelligence-gathering.\n\nBut after recent news leaks about online surveillance by the United States and its allies, Internet companies such as Google and Yahoo have increasingly sought to reassure consumers that they carefully screen demands for user data.\n\n“We work hard to protect your information from unclear, improper, overbroad or unlawful government data requests,” Yahoo general counsel Ron Bell said in a blog post Thursday.\n\nGoogle issued a similar statement, while repeating its call for reforms of government surveillance programs and other laws governing Internet communications.\n\nPrivacy advocates said the reports underscore the need for congressional reforms, both to rein in government intelligence agencies and tighten standards for law enforcement requests — so, for example, police or prosecutors would need a judge’s approval to subpoena information in more types of cases.\n\n“The transparency reports show huge increases in surveillance demands made on companies, year after year after year,” said Gregory Nojeim, senior counsel at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology. He said it’s not clear whether the decline in the second half of 2013 is statistically significant.\n\nGoogle said it received 16,407 requests from U.S. authorities in 2012, not counting national security matters, and 21,492 last year. That includes 10,918 in the first half of 2013 and 10,574 in the second half.\n\nYahoo reported a more significant decline: It received 12,444 requests from U.S. authorities in the first half of 2013 — the first year it reported totals — and only 6,587 in the second half. The numbers for the first six months included national security requests, while the total for the second half didn’t because authorities are now allowing companies to disclose those requests as separate categories, provided they use ranges such as 0 to 999.\n\nBut under the new reporting procedures, Yahoo’s total for the first half of 2013 appears to include no more than 3,000 national security requests, which means it still saw a significant decline in the second half.\n\n“We’ve noted that law enforcement agencies frequently choose to withdraw their request once we inform them of our user notification policy,” said a Yahoo representative.\n\nGoogle has long had a similar policy of notifying users, in part so they can seek their own legal assistance. Both companies say they may not provide notification in unusual circumstances or when there’s imminent danger of physical harm.\n\nFollow this reporter at Twitter.com/BrandonBailey or google.com/+BrandonBaileyOnline or on Facebook at http://on.fb.me/ULIOfb .', 'Yahoo and Google both saw a decline in demands for users’ data from U.S. law enforcement authorities in the second half of last year, although the number of government information requests has grown steadily over previous years.\nYahoo saw a more dramatic dip in the second half of last year, but it hasn’t disclosed numbers for periods before 2013.\nGoogle said it received 27,477 requests from government agencies around the world in the second half of 2013, while Yahoo reported 21,425.\nMost of those originated in the United States and stemmed from criminal or other legal investigations, rather than national security intelligence-gathering.\nGoogle said it received 16,407 requests from U.S. authorities in 2012, not counting national security matters, and 21,492 last year.']"

CNN talked to the PR manager at the Government Printing Office, who called the study “remarkable” but was unwilling to commit to changing fonts.

You can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard. The most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. Simple, right?\n\nNow imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents. Then think of how much ink would be needed.\n\nOK, so that may have been a first for you, but it came naturally to 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his Pittsburgh-area middle school.\n\nIt all started as a science fair project. As a neophyte sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School, Suvir noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school.\n\nInterested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability, Suvir decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink.\n\nReducing paper use through recycling and dual-sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources, but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts.\n\n“Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,” Suvir says with a chuckle.\n\nHe’s right: Chanel No. 5 perfume costs $38 per ounce, while the equivalent amount of Hewlett-Packard printer ink can cost up to $75.\n\nSo Suvir decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid.\n\nCollecting random samples of teachers’ handouts, Suvir concentrated on the most commonly used characters (e, t, a, o and r).\n\nFirst, he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces: Garamond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic and Comic Sans.

At 14, he doesn’t file a tax return.\n\nHe couldn’t drive himself to a television studio on Friday, either, as CNN interviewed the Fox Chapel Area Senior High School freshman about his just-published revelation in the Journal of Emerging Investigators. The peer-reviewed publication, founded at Harvard University, spotlights the work of middle and high school students.\n\n“Really, there’s no cost. It’s a very easy decision to go to the font menu, change the font and start the savings. I think it’s worth the shift,” said Mirchandani, who competed on Friday alongside his brother, Rishi, 17, in the Pittsburgh Regional Science and Engineering Fair at Heinz Field.\n\nThe Government Printing Office in Washington will review the printing suggestion and praised Suvir Mirchandani for “his efforts to identify savings for the American taxpayer,” spokesman Gary Somerset said.\n\nMirchandani’s idea dates to 2011, when he competed in the regional science fair as a sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School. He found his teachers there relied a lot more on printed handouts than his former teachers at O’Hara Elementary School did.\n\nAlthough conservation often focuses on saving paper, Mirchandani wondered if the school could save money and ease its environmental impact by cutting back on ink, too.\n\nHe determined the Fox Chapel district could eliminate about $21,000 of an $89,000 ink budget if workers printed all documents in a 12-point Garamond font — a thinner, more delicate font than some thick, blocky typefaces — a discovery he presented at the 2011 science fair.\n\nMirchandani said the district did not accept the wholesale change — a school spokeswoman on Friday did not respond to messages for comment about that — but the Journal of Emerging Investigators picked up on and published the concept.\n\n“I think what really captured our attention was partly the creativity of the work and the way (Mirchandani) was able to use two different methods to verify his results,” said Rebecca Reh, the journal president. “It’s not something we see with high school research or middle school research.”\n\nThe journal staff asked Mirchandani to apply his methods at the federal level to produce a second report, released earlier this month in the journal. With Dorseyville teacher Peter Pinko, Mirchandani wrote that the government could save $62 million to $394 million in ink every year by printing documents in the Garamond font.\n\nMirchandani found annual printing costs for federal agencies run about $1.8 billion.\n\n“He’s frugal in a practical sort of way. He’s very lucid in a very young way,” said Mirchandani’s mother, Shabnam Mirchandani, a former English professor.\n\nShe said her sons are accomplished pianists. Her husband and the boys’ father, Prakash Mirchandani, is a professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nTheir mother said the brothers showed well at the Friday competition, which drew more than 1,000 participants. Rishi Mirchandani’s entry looks at improving traffic patterns, while Suvir Mirchandani explored an Internet browser for people with disabilities.\n\nMeanwhile, he said the public attention on his ink-saving idea could help anybody cut costs, even if the government declines the pitch.\n\n“It’s definitely helping me get the word out. That’s my highest priority,” Mirchandani said.\n\nAdam Smeltz is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.

He compared four different popular typefaces — Times New Roman, Garamond, Century Gothic, and Comic Sans — and focused on how much ink was used per each letter, focusing on the common characters a, e, o, r, and t.

Eventually, Suvir repeated his tests on sample pages from the Government Printing Office — which has an annual printing budget of $1.8 billion — and found the same results.

This is because Garamond uses thinner strokes for its letters, meaning less ink is used on each character.\n\nIf the U.S. government stopped using Times New Roman and Century Gothic and switched to Garamond, it could reduce its annual cost of ink from $467 million per year by more than 29%.

For now, the U.S.'s reduction efforts are focused on moving documents to the Web instead, Somerset told CNN.\n\nBut that hasn’t discouraged Mirchandani.\n\n“I definitely would love to see some actual changes and I’d be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible,” he told CNN.\n\n[Update, 1:26 p.m. PDT March 28: Currently, the General Services Administration has an awareness campaign called “PrintWise” to prompt government employees into using toner-efficient fonts.

Fourteen-year-old Suvir Mirchandani from Pittsburgh became deeply involved in a science fair project.\n\nDespite being interested in computer science, he noticed that there was still a lot of paper flying about the world. So he began to wonder about printer\'s ink.\n\nFollowing diligent research, he learned that ink is more expensive by volume than Chanel No. 5. Some might adore an ad in which models sprayed printer\'s ink on themselves. That may say more about their personal artistic tastes.\n\nAs CNN reports, Mirchandani has purer ideas. Using APFill Ink Coverage Software, he analyzed just how much ink was being used by common letters such as ""e,"" ""o,"" and ""t.""\n\nHe then tested different typefaces to see which might simply use the least. He settled on Garamond, with its more thinly sculpted strokes. He got out his calculator and discovered he could save his school $21,000 a year.\n\nNext, he published his results in the Journal For Emerging Investigators, which is in no way affiliated with the NSA.\n\nThis fine publication then asked Mirchandani a simple question: ""Hey, how much do you think the government could save?""\n\nThe young brain got to work and soon deduced that, again by switching to Garamond, the savings would be, oh, $136 million.\n\nAnd if the state governments played along, that would be another $234 million.\n\nWhat says the federal government to this fine work? You will be stunned that it says it will think about it, though it\'s focused more -- in environmentally positive terms -- on moving everything to the Web.\n\nPerhaps committees will have to be formed and they will have to form more committees to discuss such a difficult venture. These committees will probably cost considerable amounts of time and money.\n\nMeanwhile, Mirchandani has a simple response: ""They can\'t convert everything to a digital format. Not everyone is able to access information online. Some things still have to be printed.""\n\nThis first experience in trying to disrupt government may turn Mirchandani toward different horizons.\n\nWho would be surprised if he owned a startup by the time he\'s 18 and made millions from, say, an online system that bypasses the need for committees?', 'Fourteen-year-old Suvir Mirchandani from Pittsburgh became deeply involved in a science fair project.\nDespite being interested in computer science, he noticed that there was still a lot of paper flying about the world.\nSo he began to wonder about printer\'s ink.\nSome might adore an ad in which models sprayed printer\'s ink on themselves.\nThis fine publication then asked Mirchandani a simple question: ""Hey, how much do you think the government could save?""']"

You can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard. The most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. Simple, right?\n\nNow imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents. Then think of how much ink would be needed.\n\nOK, so that may have been a first for you, but it came naturally to 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his Pittsburgh-area middle school.\n\nIt all started as a science fair project. As a neophyte sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School, Suvir noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school.\n\nInterested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability, Suvir decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink.\n\nReducing paper use through recycling and dual-sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources, but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts.\n\n“Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,” Suvir says with a chuckle.\n\nHe’s right: Chanel No. 5 perfume costs $38 per ounce, while the equivalent amount of Hewlett-Packard printer ink can cost up to $75.\n\nSo Suvir decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid.\n\nCollecting random samples of teachers’ handouts, Suvir concentrated on the most commonly used characters (e, t, a, o and r).\n\nFirst, he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces: Garamond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic and Comic Sans. Then he measured how much ink was used for each letter, using a commercial tool called APFill® Ink Coverage Software.\n\nNext he enlarged the letters, printed them and cut them out on cardstock paper to weigh them to verify his findings. He did three trials for each letter, graphing the ink usage for each font.\n\nFrom this analysis, Suvir figured out that by using Garamond with its thinner strokes, his school district could reduce its ink consumption by 24%, and in turn save as much as $21,000 annually.\n\nEncouraged by his teacher, Suvir looked to publish his findings and stumbled on the Journal for Emerging Investigators (JEI), a publication founded by a group of Harvard grad students in 2011 that provides a forum for the work of middle school and high school students. It has the same standards as academic journals, and each submission is reviewed by grad students and academics.\n\nSarah Fankhauser, one of JEI’s founders, says that of the nearly 200 submissions they have received since 2011, Suvir’s project was a real standout:\n\n“We were so impressed. We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir’s paper.”\n\nFankhauser said Suvir’s findings were so clear, simple and well thought-out, it had the peer reviewers at JEI asking, “How much potential savings is really out there?”\n\nFor the answer, JEI challenged Suvir to apply his project to a larger scale: the federal government.\n\nWith an annual printing expenditure of $1.8 billion, the government was a much more challenging task than his school science project.\n\nSuvir repeated his tests on five sample pages from documents on the Government Printing Office website and got similar results — change the font, save money.\n\nWill government printers embrace a change?\n\nUsing the Government Services Administration’s estimated annual cost of ink — $467 million — Suvir concluded that if the federal government used Garamond exclusively it could save nearly 30% — or $136 million per year. An additional $234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board, he reported.\n\nGary Somerset, media and public relations manager at the Government Printing Office, describes Suvir’s work as “remarkable.” But he was noncommittal on whether the GPO would introduce changes to typeface, saying the GPO’s efforts to become more environmentally sustainable were focused on shifting content to the Web.\n\n“In 1994, we were producing 20,000 copies a day of both the Federal Register and Congressional Record. Twenty years later, we produce roughly 2,500 print copies a day,” he said.\n\nOn top of this, the Congressional Register is printed on recycled paper, which GPO has been doing for five or six years, Somerset says.\n\nSuvir said he appreciates the government’s efforts to transition from paper to digital, but he still thinks his project is relevant.\n\n“They can’t convert everything to a digital format; not everyone is able to access information online. Some things still have to be printed,” Suvir argues.\n\nAnd even if it’s not the government but consumers doing the printing, ink savings could still be made.\n\nHolding out hope\n\nEven at 14, Suvir understands how difficult such a project might be to implement — “I recognize it’s difficult to change someone’s behavior. That’s the most difficult part.”\n\nBut he holds out hope: “I definitely would love to see some actual changes and I’d be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible.”\n\nWith decades ahead to lend a hand, Suvir and other young men and women like him may even be able to untangle some of the knotty political and technical issues that beset Washington, corporate suites and the world at large.', '× Student says government could save millions of dollars with one decision(CNN) — An e.

Each app has had between 1m and 5m downloads, meaning that up to 10m phones might be affected. Songs was still available at the time of publication.

Security researchers have continued to discover malware variants targeting Android. But Trend Micro\'s discovery is one of the most serious, because it involves apps with huge download numbers that are available on Google Play.\n\nAs the blog post points out, mining for cryptocoins in the background when a device is connected to the internet (i.e. throughout the day) saps its battery life, while charging it more often will wear it down in the long term.\n\n""Users with phones and tablets that are suddenly charging slowly, running hot, or quickly running out of batteries may want to consider if they have been exposed to this or similar threats,"" suggested the company.\n\nBoth G Data and Trend Micro sell security software for Android, so have clear commercial reasons for highlighting malware on the platform in order to attract new customers.

The other app, Songs, remained. Google representatives sent Ars an e-mail saying they won't be commenting on this report. The Google Play developer policy is here. Among other things, it requires that apps that engage in distributed computing behavior include up front disclosure that establishes user knowledge and obtains explicit consent.\n\nResearchers said they have uncovered two apps that were downloaded from the official Google Play market more than one million times that use Android devices to mine the Litecoin and Dogecoin cryptocurrencies without explicitly informing end users.\n\nAccording to a blog post published Tuesday by a researcher from antivirus provider Trend Micro, the apps are Songs, installed from one million to five million times, and Prized, which was installed from 10,000 to 50,000 times. Neither the app descriptions nor their terms of service make clear that the apps subject Android devices to the compute-intensive process of mining, Trend Micro Mobile Threats Analyst Veo Zhang wrote. As of Wednesday afternoon, the apps were still available.\n\nMining apps typically consume larger-than-average amounts of electricity and can generate extremely hot temperatures as CPUs, GPUs, or other types of processors strain to perform cryptographic hashing functions required for users to mint new digital coins. The strain can be especially onerous on smartphones, because they're equipped with hardware that's much less powerful than that found in traditional computers. The apps discovered by Trend Micro were programmed to mine coins only when devices were recharging. That setting would help prevent batteries from draining quickly, but it would do nothing to prevent devices from overheating or consuming large amounts of bandwidth.\n\nTrend Micro's finding comes a month after researchers from G Data Software discovered malicious Android apps available outside of Google Play containing hidden code that made handsets part of an anonymous Dogecoin mining pool. The network belonging to the purveyor of the apps subsequently earned thousands of Dogecoins. The Trend Micro report also came as researchers from smartphone security provider Lookout also reported finding cryptocurrency mining apps targeting Android users in Spanish forums dedicated to the distribution of pirated software.\n\nGiven the extremely modest resources of the typical smartphone, it's not at all clear why anyone would take the time to create an Android app that overtly or covertly mines currencies. As Zhang explained:\n\nClever as the attack is, whoever carried it out may not have thought things through. Phones do not have sufficient performance to serve as effective miners. Users will also quickly notice the odd behavior of the miners – slow charging and excessively hot phones will all be seen, making the miner’s presence not particularly stealthy. Yes, they can gain money this way, but at a glacial pace. Users with phones and tablets that are suddenly charging slowly, running hot, or quickly running out of batteries may want to consider if they have been exposed to this or similar threats. Also, just because an app has been downloaded from an app store – even Google Play – does not mean it is safe.\n\nGoogle representatives didn't respond to an e-mail asking for comment on the Trend Micro report and for the company's position of Google Play apps that mine crypto currencies. This post will be updated if a response arrives later."", ""Update: About 12 hours after this post went live, one of the two mentioned Android apps, Prized, was no longer available in Google Play.\nThe Google Play developer policy is here.\nThe apps discovered by Trend Micro were programmed to mine coins only when devices were recharging.\nAlso, just because an app has been downloaded from an app store – even Google Play – does not mean it is safe.\nGoogle representatives didn't respond to an e-mail asking for comment on the Trend Micro report and for the company's position of Google Play apps that mine crypto currencies.""]"

Well according to a report from The Information (paywall), it seems that the next build of Android we can expect from Google will be aimed more at the business user.\n\nWhile Android devices have made some inroads with enterprises, they’re not necessarily designed with enterprise use in mind. For example there might be productivity needs that Android does not have, or it might not have the security that enterprises require, and this is apparently what the next major Android release will feature: office-grade security.\n\nAccording to The Information’s sources, the new build of Android will allow apps to require their own form of authentication, meaning that some apps might require biometrics in order to open to prevent sensitive information from being seen by unwanted parties. Data could also be saved onto secure chips, and will reportedly offer better remote management which does sound a bit like BlackBerry’s BES services.\n\nThere’s no telling if the report is true, but with Google I/O taking place in late June, we guess we will only have a few more months to wait to see if the rumors pan out.

Although Blackberry won over the White House once again, players like Samsung, with their Knox initiative, and Apple’s ‘for Business‘ offerings, have been aggressively trying to oust Blackberry as the preferred vendor of business and enterprise mobile devices.\n\nUpdates and enhancements to Android could include stronger data encryption and storage of sensitive data directly on chips, both of which prevent unauthorized users from breaking into sensitive data stored on device. Compatibility with authentication driven apps and services such as bio-metric readers and enterprise controlled authentication management would prevent unauthorized access of corporate resources, such as email. Finally, remote device management would allow a company to control what apps are installed on a device and initiate a device data wipe if required.\n\nGoogle’s attempts to boost Android’s security and conquer the business world are said to be headed up by Sundar Pichai, head of Android and Chrome. This is important, as a part of the Chrome team, Sundar has seen Chrome, specifically the Chrome OS, experience significant growth in the education sector. Many schools have opted for Chromebooks and Chromeboxes for their staff, students and classrooms. Some device management principles of Chrome OS leapt onto Android last year with Google Play for Education. Google Play for Education allows an educator to purchase and push an app install onto all of the devices belonging to their students, including Nexus 7 tablets. These proven user/device and app management tools could easily translate into enterprise offerings with the proper security measures.\n\nWhen will we see these new features? There is no official word from Google, but The Next Web thinks we’ll see new security built into Android’s next big release, known currently as the “L” release in Google’s alphabetical naming scheme for Android.

Stronger data encryption is also part of the plan.\n\nWhat\'s more, the Information notes that Google has considered a separate approval process for enterprise apps, and availability limited to employee devices. It isn\'t clear from the report how likely this process is to show up, but evidently Google has informed potential corporate customers of their intended changes.\n\nGoogle also has considered a separate approval process for enterprise applications to make sure they are safe and a way for companies to offer certain apps on the Google Play app store but make them available only to their employees’ Android devices.\n\nOne more option may be the ability to choose specific apps that require additional authentication (like biometric readings) before an employee can use them.\n\nWith KNOX, Samsung has already begun trying to gain traction with enterprise buyers, but the security enhancements offered by KNOX are limited to select Samsung devices and as it stands, KNOX evidently doesn\'t satisfy security requirements for certain industries with strict compliance regulations like healthcare and finance.\n\nIf the Information\'s sources are correct and Google can pull off advanced security features in Android, available to all manufacturers making certified devices, it may just beat alternatives to the punch.

Besides crashing Android devices, shortly after Balic uploaded his proof of concept exploit file to Google Play to test it against Google\'s Bouncer, hundreds of developers reported being unable to upload their apps to Google\'s marketplace for several hours, suggesting to Balic that it also caused a denial of service there.\n\nA further analysis released yesterday by Trend Micro highlights that Balic\'s exploit can cause several Android device services to crash, including WindowsManager, PackageManager and ActivityManager, making it a potentially valuable tool for cybercriminals.\n\n""We believe that this vulnerability may be used by cybercriminals to do some substantial damage on Android smartphones and tablets. The device is stuck in an endless reboot loop, or a bootloop. This can render the device unusable, which some may consider \'bricking\' it,"" Trend Micro\'s mobile threat analyst Veo Zhang said.\n\nAccording to Zhang, Balic\'s exploit involved entering large amounts of data into the Activity label, which is the equivalent of the window tile in Windows.\n\nThe avenue that Balic used to insert an oversized name was AndroidManifest.xml, an Android element which allows developers to, for example, change an existing app\'s name without creating an entirely new project.\n\nAccording to Zhang, it wouldn\'t be possible to set an app name to a string as large as Balic had done were it not for a commonly used tool known as Android Debug Bridge.\n\n""In AndroidManifest.xml, apps\' label names can be set in the ""android:label"" attribute of the element, and it can be written with a raw string, not only with the reference of the string resource. Normally, apps with very long raw string labels declared in AndroidManifest.xml cannot be installed, due to the Android Binder\'s transaction buffer size limit. But through the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) interface, which is used by many third-party market clients, such apps can be installed–which, inevitably, causes an instant PackageManager service crash.""\n\nAs far as the potential for cybercriminals to exploit the vulnerability goes, Zhang points out that they could build an app containing a hidden Activity with a large label that exploits and crashes the devices when it is running. In this case, it will cause the device to crash and reboot.\n\nThe worst case scenario, however, is when the malware is written to start automatically upon device startup.\n\n""Doing so will trap the device in a rebooting loop, rendering it useless.

64955,http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/malicious-apps-can-hang-android-devices-erase-data-via-new-reported-bugs-499996,technology,"['Some reports have emerged claiming that cybercriminals could exploit Android-based smartphones and tablets using bugs that cause devices to become unresponsive or unusable.\n\nArs Technica reports that bugs in the Android operating system can allow malicious third-party apps to send vulnerable smartphones and tablets into a series of looping crashes and could also wipe all stored data.\n\nThe first of these bugs, reported by Trend Micro, is claimed to keep the Android device (smartphone or tablet) stuck in endless reboot loop that could leave the device unresponsive or even unusable, which can be considered to be \'bricking\' of the device. If the device can be hard factory reset for recovery, it would result in all data being lost.\n\nArs Technica also cites researcher Ibrahim Balic, who claims to have discovered a similar vulnerability in Android devices which caused memory corruption. The memory corruption bug could be triggered by a seemingly legitimate app once it is installed. If the \'appname\' field of the app contained an extremely long value, in excess of 387,000 characters, the device on which is installed could go into an endless loop.\n\nBalic said on his blog post, ""I think all android versions are affected by this vulnerability."" However, Balic only confirmed that Android 2.3 Gingerbread, Android 4.2.2 and Android 4.3 Jelly Bean had been tested to be affected by the bug. Interestingly, it seems that such an app could also cause the cloud scanner Google employs to check for malicious apps on the Play Store (called Bouncer) to be affected. Bouncer reportedly experiences a denial-of-service type condition when scanning a freshly uploaded app that contained the exploit. Balic said after uploading his proof-of-concept app, he received errors from Google Play, and noticed other developers weren\'t able to upload their apps to the store for a short period after.\n\nTrend Micro\'s claimed exploit is quite similar, with the \'Activity\' label the vulnerable field. The security company says if large amount of data is fed into the Activity label, it could stop system functionality, and cause the device to reboot. The company\'s Veo Zhang detailed the process in a blog post\n\n\n\nOur analysis shows that the first crash is caused by the memory corruption in WindowManager, the interface that apps use to control the placement and appearance of windows on a given screen. Large amounts of data were entered into the Activity label, which is the equivalent of the window title in Windows. If a cybercriminal builds an app containing a hidden Activity with a large label, the user will have no idea whatsoever that this exploit is in fact taking place. Cybercriminals can further conceal the exploit by setting a timed trigger event that stops the current app activity and then opens the hidden Activity. When the timed event is triggered, the exploit runs, and the system server crashes as a result. This stops all functionality of the mobile device, and the system will be forced to reboot. An even worse case is when the malware is written to start automatically upon device startup. Doing so will trap the device in a rebooting loop, rendering it useless. In this case, only a boot loader recovery fix will work, which means that all the information (contacts, photos, files, etc.) stored inside the device will be erased.\n\nFurther, Trend Micro\'s analysis revealed that PackageManager and ActivityManager on an Android device, alongside the WindowManager service, are also vulnerable to a series of crashing. The blog post notes that with the installation of any malicious third-party app with such an exploit, the Android device will crash immediately without needing any special permission to run the app.\n\nAs of now, there is no word from Google on the reported bugs that are said to make the Android smartphones or tablets vulnerable to threats from malicious apps.', ""However, Balic only confirmed that Android 2.3 Gingerbread, Android 4.2.2 and Android 4.3 Jelly Bean had been tested to be affected by the bug.\nLarge amounts of data were entered into the Activity label, which is the equivalent of the window title in Windows.\nCybercriminals can further conceal the exploit by setting a timed trigger event that stops the current app activity and then opens the hidden Activity.\nFurther, Trend Micro's analysis revealed that PackageManager and ActivityManager on an Android device, alongside the WindowManager service, are also vulnerable to a series of crashing.\nAs of now, there is no word from Google on the reported bugs that are said to make the Android smartphones or tablets vulnerable to threats from malicious apps.""]"

Google\'s app store ran less vigorous security checks of applications than Apple did with its eponymous marketplace, yet most malware was downloaded from unofficial sources, notably Chinese app stores.\n\nIn 2011, the trojan known as DroidDream infected more than 260,000 Android phones within 48 hours, the authors pointed out in justifying the need for AirBag. Scores more malicious apps have surfaced since then that have turned phones into zombies for botnets and often signed users up to expensive premium SMS numbers.\n\n""The fundamental openness design behind Android implies that any app is allowed to communicate with other apps or system daemons running in the phone. In other words, once a malicious app is installed, it has a wide attack surface to launch the attack,"" the researchers wrote in a paper (PDF).\n\nGoogle\'s sandboxing of an app based on the permissions it requested and its marketplace vetting process were insufficient. This security shortfall gave rise to anti-virus offerings designed Android devices that aimed to fill this gap, but AirBag\'s authors point out that those solutions were also ineffective.\n\nAirBag\'s approach to defending against malware was unique, according to the authors. They noted that anti-malware applications and techniques including TaintDroid, which extended the Android framework to monitor the flow of sensitive data, and Aurasium which repackaged untrusted apps and enforced runtime access control policies, assumed the Android framework was trustworthy when it could be compromised in advanced attacks if privileged system daemons such as init or zygote were targeted.\n\nThey also distinguished AirBag from tools such as Kirin and Saint which analysed and blocked certain permissions requested by apps if they were excessive or dangerous when used in combination.\n\n""In contrast, our system assumes that the Android framework inside AirBag could be compromised (by untrusted apps) but the damages are still contained in AirBag to prevent the native runtime environment being affected,"" researchers Chiachih Wu; Yajin Zhou; Kunal Patel; Zhenkai Liang, and Xuxian Jiang of the unverisities of North Carolina State and Singapore wrote.\n\n""We aim to mitigate the risks by proposing a separate runtime that is isolated and enforced through a lightweight OS (operating system) - level extension.""\n\nAirBag could further benefit from developments in so-called virtual machine introspection which could be applied to bolster monitoring capabilities and better integrate with anti-virus software to more reliably monitor runtime behaviour beyond mere statical scanning of untrusted apps.\n\nJoin the newsletter!

This week, security company F-Secure tipped us to an Android app that is very interested in your phone calls and SMS messages. In fact, it watches all your communications, and even uploads phone recordings for reasons unknown.\n\nMessage Snoop\n\nAccording to F-Secure, the malicious app is dressed up like a system settings application. It even request device admin access, meaning it\'s capable of locking you out of your device entirely.\n\nBut this app seems more interested in your messages. It watches SMS and phone calls, checking to see if any phones numbers have a Korean code prefix (specifically, +82). If it detects one, it clears that number from your phone\'s log. It can also send SMS messages on its own.\n\nScariest of all, the app records phone calls, SMS messages, phone numbers, and network data, and uploads its stolen data to a remote server.\n\nWhat\'s It Doing?\n\nIn their analysis, F-Secure didn\'t speculate about the malware\'s goal. That\'s understandable, because the behaviors are pretty odd. Clearing call logs of specific numbers and sending SMS messages sounds like some kind of premium SMS scam, where victims are nickel and dimed with small charges made via surreptitiously sent messages. Such malware relies on geographically-locked shortcodes to send SMS messages. That might explain why the app profiled by F-Secure checks for a Korean code prefix.\n\nOn the other hand, this malicious app is also interested in very personal information—like recordings of phone calls. This suggests something more targeted, something more along the lines of a login-capturing Trojan or a legal-ish spyware app installed by a jealous spouse.\n\nHow To Stay Safe\n\nWhatever the app is doing it\'s not the kind of thing you want on your phone. Unfortunately, F-Secure isn\'t sure where the app is coming from. If it\'s run-of-the-mill malware, then it\'s probably lurking in third party app stores. If it\'s a more targeted tool, it\'s likely being sent around by bad guys/creepy boyfriends. Either way, the remedy is the same: don\'t sideload apps. By default, your Android won\'t let you install apps from ""unknown sources,"" and it\'s best to keep it that way.\n\nAndroid security apps like Editors\' Choice winners avast! Mobile Security & Antivirus and Bitdefender Mobile Security and Antivirus can also help keep your phone safe with malware detection and numerous other security tools. For its part, Google bakes in a number of unique security tools to help protect your device even when you\'re installing apps from outside Google Play.\n\nLastly, use some common sense when installing any application and read over the list of requested permissions. After all, you never know when an app might be listening to you.', 'This week, security company F-Secure tipped us to an Android app that is very interested in your phone calls and SMS messages.\nIt watches SMS and phone calls, checking to see if any phones numbers have a Korean code prefix (specifically, +82).\nScariest of all, the app records phone calls, SMS messages, phone numbers, and network data, and uploads its stolen data to a remote server.\nOn the other hand, this malicious app is also interested in very personal information—like recordings of phone calls.\nMobile Security & Antivirus and Bitdefender Mobile Security and Antivirus can also help keep your phone safe with malware detection and numerous other security tools.']"

However, Taiwanese security company Trend Micro has since confirmed that Balic\'s discovery of the memory corruption bug is authentic and that the flaw is exploitable.\n\n""We believe that this vulnerability may be used by cybercriminals to do some substantial damage on Android smartphones and tablets, which include bricking a device, or rendering it unusable in any way,"" Trend Micro mobile threat analyst Veo Zhang wrote in a blog post.

In fact, describing a new vulnerability might cause new attempts of exploitation.""\n\nEarlier this month, another security researcher and CTO of startup company Doublethink, Bas Bosschert, discovered a flaw in the Android OS, claiming that it allowed cyber criminals to steal conversations from users of mobile messaging service Whatsapp.\n\nBosschert detailed the flaw in a blog post in which he demonstrated the method for accessing Whatsapp chats. He confirmed that the vulnerability still existed even after Google had updated the Whatsapp app the previous week.\n\nBosschert said the exploit is possible due to the Whatsapp database on Android being saved on the SD card, which can be read by any Android application if the user allows it to access the card.\n\nBosschert noted that this is an issue in the Android infrastructure, specifically a problem with Android\'s data sandboxing system, as opposed to a security flaw in Whatsapp.\n\nWhatsapp disputed such claims, calling them ""overstated"". µ', 'A SECURITY FLAW in Google\'s Android mobile operating system (OS) could be exploited by hackers looking to brick smartphones and tablets, security researchers have uncovered.\nThe security hole was found by independent researcher Ibrahim Balic, who revealed his Android bricking discovery in a blog post earlier this month.\nHowever, Taiwanese security company Trend Micro has since confirmed that Balic\'s discovery of the memory corruption bug is authentic and that the flaw is exploitable.\n""Trend Micro has not seen evidence of exploitation at this moment [but] as with every new vulnerability, this is no guarantee about the future.\nBosschert noted that this is an issue in the Android infrastructure, specifically a problem with Android\'s data sandboxing system, as opposed to a security flaw in Whatsapp.']"

It\'s never been truer that you need to be careful what you\'re downloading onto your Android handset. For starters, you can check out our guide to spotting Android scam and malware apps – but it\'s also important to get some good security software on board your smartphone. And that\'s exactly what we\'re looking at here, from our favourite mobile security suites through to password managers and VPN apps.\n\nThis completely free app packs in a ton of security features, like remote wipe, remote lock, app management, safe web browsing, a battery manager, and as an added bonus, an anti-virus engine that received top marks from independent testing labs. It\'s incredibly lightweight, too.\n\nBitdefender has all the features you\'d expect in a top-tier Android security app: On demand scans, automatic scanning of each newly installed app, anti-theft tools, app reputation info, web security, and more. But its laser-focus is on security, eschewing time consuming scans and using a superfast cloud-based method.\n\nWhile the annual fee may be off putting, it\'s a third of what other big name companies charge (and note that you get a two week free trial). If you don\'t want to pay, see the above app.\n\nA major overhaul to this powerful password manager means that it now looks as good as it performs. With LastPass, you can access your saved passwords, secure notes, and filled forms from your Android device, and you can also create new ones that will sync to all your devices.\n\nThe new version of the app ingeniously melds the password manager with a built-in browser, putting the app\'s auto-login features at the forefront. Staying safe has never been easier.\n\nSometimes you just don\'t want people to bother you, and that\'s where Mr. Number comes in. With this app, you can block calls and SMS messages from specific people, code prefixes, and whole area codes. It can also help you fight back against intrusive calls and texts with an easy spam reporting system.\n\nTor is probably more famous for providing access to the so-called ""Dark Web,"" but it\'s also a useful way to connect to the Internet while keeping your actions private. Working with a special browser, Orbot connects you to Tor within seconds. However, I did find that it sometimes takes a few attempts to get online.\n\nThe desktop version of this VPN service is excellent, and it also works great on Android. With just a few taps, your traffic is encrypted and routed through the developer\'s secure servers keeping your activities safe from snoopers.\n\nIf you need to check your bank account or any other sensitive information over a public Wi-Fi network, this is the way to go (but preferably, you should always avoid doing so if at all possible).', ""For starters, you can check out our guide to spotting Android scam and malware apps – but it's also important to get some good security software on board your smartphone.\nAnd that's exactly what we're looking at here, from our favourite mobile security suites through to password managers and VPN apps.\nBitdefender has all the features you'd expect in a top-tier Android security app: On demand scans, automatic scanning of each newly installed app, anti-theft tools, app reputation info, web security, and more.\nA major overhaul to this powerful password manager means that it now looks as good as it performs.\nThe new version of the app ingeniously melds the password manager with a built-in browser, putting the app's auto-login features at the forefront.""]"

Pileup, which is short for privilege escalation through updating, increases the permissions offered to malicious apps once Android is updated, without informing the user.\n\n""Every few months, an update is released, which causes replacement and addition of tens of thousands of files on a live system.

In total, the researchers claim that this leaves more than a billion Android devices vulnerable to a Pileup attack.\n\n""A third-party package attribute or property, which bears the name of its system counterpart, can be elevated to a system one during the updating shuffle-up where all apps are installed or reinstalled, and all system configurations are reset,"" the researcher wrote. ""Also, when two apps from old and new systems are merged as described above, security risks can also be brought in when the one on the original system turns out to be malicious.""\n\nThe researchers have also introduces a new scanner called SecUP that detects malicious apps already on a device lying in wait for elevated privileges.

A malicious app – one that would raise alarms in a newer version – can be installed in an older version without problems. It can't ask for dangerous permissions, because those permissions don't exist.\n\nHowever, because Android tries not to break apps during the update process, an update on the infected device will automatically assign the escalated permissions to the malicious app, without alerting the user.\n\nAs the paper states, the attack “is not aimed at a vulnerability in the current system. Instead, it exploits the flaws in the updating mechanism of the “future” OS, which the current system will be upgraded to … the adversary can strategically claim a set of carefully selected privileges or attributes only available on the higher OS version”.\n\nIn other words, the attacker compares API calls in a late version of Android, and defines that system permission in an app designed for installation on an older version. By way of example, they write, permission.ADD_VOICEMAIL would be ignored in Android 2.3.6 because it doesn't exist – that permission was added in 4.0.4. The app would look benign until the user upgraded to 4.0.4, at which point it becomes exploitable.\n\nThe researchers identified six “Pileup” flaws in the Android Package Manager, all of which have been reported to Google and one of which has been fixed.\n\n“With the help of a program analyser, our research discovered 6 such Pileup flaws within Android Package Manager Service and further confirmed their presence in all AOSP (Android Open Source Project) versions and all 3,522 source code versions customized by Samsung, LG and HTC across the world that we inspected,” they write. That means “billions” of devices are affected, they state. ®\n\nSponsored: Beyond the Data Frontier"", ""Researchers from Indiana University Bloomington have tagged a vulnerability in the way Android handles updates, which they say puts practically every Android device at risk of malicious software.\nWhat's going on in “Pileup” – privilege escalation through updating – is this: some permission settings offered in newer Android versions aren't present in older versions.\nA malicious app – one that would raise alarms in a newer version – can be installed in an older version without problems.\nHowever, because Android tries not to break apps during the update process, an update on the infected device will automatically assign the escalated permissions to the malicious app, without alerting the user.\nBy way of example, they write, permission.ADD_VOICEMAIL would be ignored in Android 2.3.6 because it doesn't exist – that permission was added in 4.0.4.""]"

When they were caught out, the pointed out that they\'d always reserved the right to read Hotmail users\' email, and tried to reassure other Hotmail users by saying that they were beefing up the internal process by which they decided whose mail to read and when.\n\nNow, citing the ""\'post-Snowden era\' in which people rightly focus on the ways others use their personal information,"" the company has announced that it will not read its users\' email anymore when investigating theft or copyright violations -- instead, it will refer this sort of thing to the police in future (they still reserve the right to read your Hotmail messages without a court order under other circumstances).\n\nAs Techdirt\'s Mike Masnick points out, this is a most welcome change. The message announcing the change by Brad Smith (General Counsel & Executive Vice President, Legal & Corporate Affairs) is thoughtful and forthright. It announces a future round-table on the questions raised by the company\'s snooping that the Electronic Frontier Foundation can participate in.\n\nSmith asks a seemingly rhetorical question: ""What is the best way to strike the balance in other circumstances that involve, on the one hand, consumer privacy interests, and on the other hand, protecting people and the security of Internet services they use?"" That is indeed a fascinating question, but in the specific case of Hotmail, I feel like it has a pretty obvious answer: change your terms of service so that you promise not to read your customers\' email without a court order. Then, if you think there\'s a situation that warrants invading your customers\' privacy, get a court order. This is just basic rule-of-law stuff, and it\'s the kind of thing you\'d hope Microsoft\'s General Counsel would find obvious.\n\nThe fact that the question is being raised casts more light on Microsoft\'s extensive ""Scroogled"" campaign, which (rightly) took Google to task for having a business-model that was predicated on harvesting titanic amounts of personal data. The takeaway here is that while Microsoft\'s business-model (at the moment) is less privacy-invading than Google\'s, that is not due to any inherent squeamishness about spying on people -- rather, it\'s just a practical upshot of its longstanding practices.\n\nIn part we have thought more about this in the context of other privacy issues that have been so topical during the past year. We’ve entered a “post-Snowden era” in which people rightly focus on the ways others use their personal information. As a company we’ve participated actively in the public discussions about the proper balance between the privacy rights of citizens and the powers of government. We’ve advocated that governments should rely on formal legal processes and the rule of law for surveillance activities. While our own search was clearly within our legal rights, it seems apparent that we should apply a similar principle and rely on formal legal processes for our own investigations involving people who we suspect are stealing from us. Therefore, rather than inspect the private content of customers ourselves in these instances, we should turn to law enforcement and their legal procedures. This also has focused our attention on other important questions about the privacy interests of consumers as they use services across the Internet. What is the best way to strike the balance in other circumstances that involve, on the one hand, consumer privacy interests, and on the other hand, protecting people and the security of Internet services they use? It’s an important question across the tech sector. And it’s the type of question we believe would benefit from broader discussion rather than a single company or industry trying to divine the answers by itself.\n\nWe’re listening: Additional steps to protect your privacy\n\n(via Techdirt)', ""Microsoft changes policy: won't read your Hotmail anymore to track down copyright infringement or theft without a court orderMicrosoft read the email of Hotmail users without a warrant, in order to catch someone who'd leaked some Microsoft software.\nWhen they were caught out, the pointed out that they'd always reserved the right to read Hotmail users' email, and tried to reassure other Hotmail users by saying that they were beefing up the internal process by which they decided whose mail to read and when.\nThe message announcing the change by Brad Smith (General Counsel & Executive Vice President, Legal & Corporate Affairs) is thoughtful and forthright.\nIt announces a future round-table on the questions raised by the company's snooping that the Electronic Frontier Foundation can participate in.\nThen, if you think there's a situation that warrants invading your customers' privacy, get a court order.""]"

Instead, we will refer the matter to law enforcement if further action is required.\n\nLast week, Microsoft defended its decision to search the blogger\'s email, saying it doesn\'t need a court order to search its own servers. An ex-Microsoft employee allegedly leaked the Windows 8 code to the blogger and was charged last week.\n\nHere\'s the full statement from Microsoft\'s Smith:\n\nLast Thursday, news coverage focused on a case in 2012 in which our investigators accessed the Hotmail content of a user who was trafficking in stolen Microsoft source code. Over the past week, we\'ve had the opportunity to reflect further on this issue, and as a result of conversations we\'ve had internally and with advocacy groups and other experts, we\'ve decided to take an additional step and make an important change to our privacy practices.\n\nEffective immediately, if we receive information indicating that someone is using our services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property from Microsoft, we will not inspect a customer\'s private content ourselves. Instead, we will refer the matter to law enforcement if further action is required.\n\nIn addition to changing company policy, in the coming months we will incorporate this change in our customer terms of service, so that it\'s clear to consumers and binding on Microsoft.\n\nIt\'s always uncomfortable to listen to criticism. But if one can step back a bit, it\'s often thought-provoking and even helpful. That was definitely the case for us over the past week. Although our terms of service, like those of others in our industry, allowed us to access lawfully the account in this case, the circumstances raised legitimate questions about the privacy interests of our customers.\n\nIn part we have thought more about this in the context of other privacy issues that have been so topical during the past year. We\'ve entered a ""post-Snowden era"" in which people rightly focus on the ways others use their personal information. As a company we\'ve participated actively in the public discussions about the proper balance between the privacy rights of citizens and the powers of government. We\'ve advocated that governments should rely on formal legal processes and the rule of law for surveillance activities.\n\nWhile our own search was clearly within our legal rights, it seems apparent that we should apply a similar principle and rely on formal legal processes for our own investigations involving people who we suspect are stealing from us. Therefore, rather than inspect the private content of customers ourselves in these instances, we should turn to law enforcement and their legal procedures.\n\nThis also has focused our attention on other important questions about the privacy interests of consumers as they use services across the Internet. What is the best way to strike the balance in other circumstances that involve, on the one hand, consumer privacy interests, and on the other hand, protecting people and the security of Internet services they use? It\'s an important question across the tech sector. And it\'s the type of question we believe would benefit from broader discussion rather than a single company or industry trying to divine the answers by itself.\n\nFor this reason, we\'ve reached out to the advocacy community to undertake a project that brings together a variety of stakeholders to help identify, flesh out and discuss these important issues. The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) has agreed to convene stakeholders and the Electronic Frontier Foundation will be a key participant. We hope that this project can help us all identify potential best practices from other industries and consider the best solutions for the future of digital services. We\'ve agreed to help support this effort and will participate wholeheartedly. We hope that other companies will join in as well. Ultimately, these types of questions affect us all, and they will benefit from even more of the thought-provoking discussions that the events from last week have encouraged.', 'Microsoft reversed a policy today that let the company snoop into personal email accounts it hosts through services like Hotmail and Outlook if it suspects a user of owning stolen intellectual property.\nLast week, Microsoft defended its decision to search the blogger\'s email, saying it doesn\'t need a court order to search its own servers.\nHere\'s the full statement from Microsoft\'s Smith:Last Thursday, news coverage focused on a case in 2012 in which our investigators accessed the Hotmail content of a user who was trafficking in stolen Microsoft source code.\nWe\'ve entered a ""post-Snowden era"" in which people rightly focus on the ways others use their personal information.\nAs a company we\'ve participated actively in the public discussions about the proper balance between the privacy rights of citizens and the powers of government.']"

Microsoft will not be doing that ever again, the post says, and instead they’ll refer any and all potential similar situations to law enforcement directly.\n\nThe case in question involved Microsoft checking a blogger’s email when they found an ex-employee had leaked said blogger proprietary software. They did so on the basis that the case was extraordinary, and that fast response was the best way to quash the illegal distribution of their proprietary content before it got out of hand. Microsoft followed up that report with a blog post from another of its top lawyers, Deputy General Counsel John Frank, who justified the action and provided context for why the company did what they did.\n\nNow, however, they’ve gone even further, promising not to operate in this manner ever again, even under the kind of extreme circumstances that prompted them to do this before. They still claim no legal wrongdoing in the previous case; it was “clearly within [their] legal rights,” according to the new post by Smith. Even so, Smith also concedes that they’ve been listening to feedback from customers and realize they should take their own medicine so to speak, and rely on formal legal processes going forward.\n\nThe dogfooding aspect here comes from Microsoft realizing that it has been advocating more openness and a strict adherence to the letter of the law and going through proper channels, by the government in accessing Microsoft’s customer data. The same standard should apply to Microsoft itself, and Smith clearly acknowledges that in this case, it didn’t. Microsoft isn’t just making a promise, however; it’s partnering with The Center for Democracy and Technology and The Electronic Frontier Foundation to help it identify the best way forward regarding customer privacy issues like this one that may crop up in the future.\n\nThis is progress, and it’s nice to see Microsoft’s view on the matter evolve in response to clear customer expression of distaste and disappointment. Of course, legally they’re still primarily watching out for their own interests, but at least this shouldn’t happen again, or if it does, Microsoft won’t have its terms of service to fall back on.', 'Microsoft will not be doing that ever again, the post says, and instead they’ll refer any and all potential similar situations to law enforcement directly.\nThe case in question involved Microsoft checking a blogger’s email when they found an ex-employee had leaked said blogger proprietary software.\nThey still claim no legal wrongdoing in the previous case; it was “clearly within [their] legal rights,” according to the new post by Smith.\nThe same standard should apply to Microsoft itself, and Smith clearly acknowledges that in this case, it didn’t.\nThis is progress, and it’s nice to see Microsoft’s view on the matter evolve in response to clear customer expression of distaste and disappointment.']"

At issue is the fact that the Typo keyboard’s physical design, especially the key and fret design are identical to the design used on the BlackBerry Q10 and the overall BlackBerry device lineup, which forced BlackBerry to file a trademark infringement suit in order to defend the various patents it holds regarding its hardware keyboard designs. Orrick further stated:\n\n“BlackBerry has convincingly shown that BlackBerry’s keyboard designs are a key driver of demand and goodwill for BlackBerry phones. Typo’s keyboard directly targets the segment of smartphone users that prefer a physical keyboard, the market in which BlackBerry competes.”\n\nFurthermore, the ruling requires BlackBerry to post a bond in an amount sufficient to pay damages sustained by Typo if later found that the injunction wasn’t supposed to be granted. Once the bond is posted, which could take as long as two weeks, Typo will be barred from selling the keyboard case. This is despite the judge rejecting Typo’s previous contention that BlackBerry isn’t irreparably harmed by Typo’s actions because it was already struggling and losing market share before the sale of Typo keyboards began last year.\n\nThroughout the months of legal fighting since the suit was first filed in January by BlackBerry, Typo has insisted that its product does not infringe on any BlackBerry patents or trademarks, while BlackBerry has insisted since the release of the Typo keyboard that it violates multiple patents and trademarks. BlackBerry was satisfied with the decision and released the following statement:', 'U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco stated BlackBerry’s arguments warranted placing a preliminary injunction on sales of the Typo pending a full trial, while Typo has declared that it will appeal the injunction.\nOrrick further stated:“BlackBerry has convincingly shown that BlackBerry’s keyboard designs are a key driver of demand and goodwill for BlackBerry phones.\nTypo’s keyboard directly targets the segment of smartphone users that prefer a physical keyboard, the market in which BlackBerry competes.”Furthermore, the ruling requires BlackBerry to post a bond in an amount sufficient to pay damages sustained by Typo if later found that the injunction wasn’t supposed to be granted.\nOnce the bond is posted, which could take as long as two weeks, Typo will be barred from selling the keyboard case.\nThroughout the months of legal fighting since the suit was first filed in January by BlackBerry, Typo has insisted that its product does not infringe on any BlackBerry patents or trademarks, while BlackBerry has insisted since the release of the Typo keyboard that it violates multiple patents and trademarks.']"

The suit alleges that a nifty little device Typo Products intended to sell for $99 retail called the iPhone Case infringed on their patents. What the product does is give the iPhone 5 a QWERTY keyboard. Speaking on technical merits, it’s a pricey but wonderful device for people who are more productive pressing actual keys as opposed to a touch screen virtual keyboard.\n\nBlackberry, which is struggling to emerge from years of poor sales, seems to believe that if customers have a QWERTY keyboard option to the iPhone, they’d opt for that device over their Q10 smartphone.

In his ruling, Judge Orrick stated that Blackberry made a strong case for patent infringement. So much so that the justice claimed their patents were likely infringed upon. Conversely, he stated that Typo Products did not offer a comparative challenge to Blackberry’s patent infringement allegations. Citing these reasons, he issued the temporary injunction against Typo Products which is owned by American Idol host Ryan Seacrest.

By no means are new CEO Satya Nadella and team done with Microsoft\'s transition to a leading mobile, cloud, and big data provider, but there are multiple signs that strides are being made.\n\nNaturally, there are still those who aren\'t buying what Microsoft\'s selling. Though several analysts are finally recognizing Microsoft\'s advancements in key growth areas, a majority remain unconvinced. Too bad for them, and for the clients that heed their advice.\n\nFirst, some good news\n\nIn what was widely hailed as a successful debut as Microsoft\'s new number one, Nadella made his first presentation a couple days ago, showing off Microsoft\'s new Office for iOS. In a world of bring-your-own-device to work, cross-platform apps have quickly become a necessity, not a nicety. And that\'s what makes Office for iOS such an intriguing move on Microsoft\'s part. If Nadella gleans much of the praise for an app that\'s most certainly been in the works longer than he\'s been CEO, so be it.\n\nNadella\'s first shot at the spotlight also served as a precursor of things to come, as much by what he didn\'t say as what he shared about Office for iOS and the future of Microsoft. Noticeably absent from Nadella\'s introduction was a Windows software demonstration. Microsoft isn\'t a PC company any longer, which Nadella made clear by forgoing the use of a PC during his presentation. Instead, Nadella focused on the importance of cross-platform apps to fuel future growth.\n\nNow, more good news\n\nOver half of the analysts covering Microsoft are stubbornly clinging to their respective versions of a ""hold"" rating, despite a nearly 41% jump in share price the past 12 months. This, however, should change, considering the average target price of the Microsoft-haters is $38.84 a share, nearly 3.8% below Friday\'s close. Other analysts are coming around, including a couple that recently raised Microsoft\'s price target to $44 a share.\n\nSomewhat lost in the hoopla surrounding Nadella\'s first presentation as CEO and the Office for iOS introduction was news of what could be a game-changing cloud deal for Microsoft. Already growing by leaps and bounds -- cloud-related revenue more than doubled last quarter -- the deal Microsoft inked to bring cloud services to Chinese consumers could be absolutely huge. It\'s the first partnership of its kind involving an ""outsider,"" and it\'s been a long time coming.\n\nSome background\n\nThe process of bringing cloud services to Chinese consumers began about a year ago, when Microsoft certified over 100 techs of China data service provider 21Vianet. The partnership limited what Microsoft could offer Chinese business customers, but turned out to be an important first step to establish a more expanded relationship in the future. Thankfully, the future is now.\n\nWith the deal in place, 21Vianet can begin offering its business customers Microsoft\'s cloud platform Azure. With a domestic Azure customer base that includes over half the Fortune 500, China businesses that opt for Azure will find themselves among some pretty good cloud company.\n\nFinal Foolish thoughts\n\nOpening the Office door to the millions of iOS users, and the incremental revenue that will come from the new app, certainly warrants all the press that Microsoft\'s received these past couple of days. Add to that a successful introduction of Microsoft\'s new CEO, and it\'s easy to see why its stock price is bumping up against its 52-week high of $40.99 a share.\n\nIf anything, analyst price targets for Microsoft in the mid $40 a share range are on the low end for mid and long-term investors. Yes, Microsoft stock is up 40.9% the past 12 months, which may be worrisome for value investors. But remember, its stock price had been depressed for so long, you could argue Microsoft\'s recent run has simply brought its stock back to ground zero. Microsoft remains a solid long-term alternative, especially when you consider the potential of bringing the cloud to China.', ""And that's what makes Office for iOS such an intriguing move on Microsoft's part.\nOther analysts are coming around, including a couple that recently raised Microsoft's price target to $44 a share.\nSomewhat lost in the hoopla surrounding Nadella's first presentation as CEO and the Office for iOS introduction was news of what could be a game-changing cloud deal for Microsoft.\nWith the deal in place, 21Vianet can begin offering its business customers Microsoft's cloud platform Azure.\nYes, Microsoft stock is up 40.9% the past 12 months, which may be worrisome for value investors.""]"

In celebration, I'd like to take a deeper look at the three new additions to the App Store: Word , PowerPoint, and Excel, and I've decided to start with what will probably be the most popular of them all. Now that Microsoft Word for iPad (Free, requiring Office 365 subscription) by Microsoft Corporation is actually here, questions are rising everywhere. How does it compare to Apple's Pages ? Can it really make an impact in the mobile office space after it's arrived this late to the game? And, most importantly, is it worth $99 a year?\n\nIn my day-to-day experiences of making simple documents, I've run into and had to find ways around the sea of limitations that Pages comes with. Want to change the page orientation? Can't do that. Want to skip lines when creating a numbered list? Can't do that. Want to change the header and footer on each page? Can't do that. And those are just the simple things, all of which Microsoft Word for iPad can do just as well as it does on the desktop.\n\nOther winning features over Apple's document editor include more advanced formatting options when it comes to bullets and numbering, a boss of a ruler, a plethora of adjustable parameters for tables and shapes, and a whole tab dedicated to adjusting “Layout” options that is full of features Pages is missing. Finally, even those well-known fonts that are exclusive to Word have been ported over. I could spend an eternity preaching about how Word on the iPad has many more robust editing options than Pages does, but I think you get the idea.\n\nBeyond the app's strengths, however, is one obvious drawback. This doesn't involve document creation and editing, but rather, it has to do with sharing and exporting. Users can import documents into Word from other apps using iOS' native share sheets, so clearly Microsoft knows the functionality exists. However, when getting a document out of the app, the only options available are through a link to the OneDrive file or via email."", ""After years of waiting, Microsoft's Office for iPad is here .\nNow that Microsoft Word for iPad (Free, requiring Office 365 subscription) by Microsoft Corporation is actually here, questions are rising everywhere.\nAnd those are just the simple things, all of which Microsoft Word for iPad can do just as well as it does on the desktop.\nI could spend an eternity preaching about how Word on the iPad has many more robust editing options than Pages does, but I think you get the idea.\nUsers can import documents into Word from other apps using iOS' native share sheets, so clearly Microsoft knows the functionality exists.""]"

65059,http://www.gurufocus.com/news/253273/microsoft-set-to-make-an-impact-in-2014,technology,"[""Ever since Satya Nadella has donned the cap of the CEO at Microsoft (MSFT) tables have turned in the tech-giant’s favor. Things seem to be shaping up for a very bright Fiscal 2014. When things have not gone well in MSFT’s favor for past few days, things have now started to change. As much as quality and care of design language is natural to Apple (AAPL), the ability to persist through growing pains and breakthrough to profitability is natural to Microsoft. Experts are of the view that Nadella is probably the best thing to have happened to MSFT so far. This is so because of his long innings with the company. His experience as the company’s vice president of the company’s Cloud and Enterprise group will definitely come in handy in his stint as the CEO.\n\nThe Performance\n\nThe Cloud Services revenue for the company grew by an astounding $315million or 107%. This is owed to the hugely successful Commercial Office 365 which yielded higher revenues. One more thing to look forward too is the launch of Office for iPad. This has clear sent clear indications that the revenues for Microsoft's Devices & Consumer Licensing division can grow revenues and profit year-over-year. During FY2014 Q2, Office revenue declined $244 million or 24%, reflecting the transition of customers to Office 365 Home Premium as well as continued softness in the consumer PC market. The iPad’s is a growing market with oodles of revenue. This therefore more than makes up for the softening markets for the now unwanted PCs. For the record, in the fiscal quarter that ended on December 28, 2013 Apple sold 26 million iPads. There lies gold for MSFT. Making use of this ever increasing market cap of the iPads, MSFT can hit a jackpot. What is even more impressive is that Microsoft managed to get into the iPad market first before Google introduced its own suite of enterprise focused offerings.\n\nMSFT’s Performance in the Rest of the World\n\nMicrosoft’s latest strategy seems to be striking deals with fast growing Indian mobile phone makers. A rumored deal with Micromax is currently doing the rounds. This, the company thinks will save them more cash rather than upgrading their Windows Phone.\n\nThe company has also decided to go ahead with the launch of its much awaited Xbox One that comes with the “Titan Fall”. This is company’s latest strategy to capture the advanced gaming market where Sony’s PS4 is ruling the scene. This is why the company has decided to price it at par with PS4. This was evident when Microsoft cut the prices to its Titan Fall XBox One bundle to $449 in its Microsoft stores and other retailers. This boosted sales of Xbox One by 96% over a week in the UK.\n\nWith Satya Nadella at the helm, there’d be no stopping Microsoft.

Particularly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) finally brought its Office productivity suite to iPad and the Apple rumor mill has some more details on the iPhone 6.\n\nApple\'s stock outperformed the market during the week with a 0.75% gain versus the S&P 500\'s 0.5% decline. The outperformance helped Apple finish 1.5 percentage points ahead of the S&P 500 in March.\n\nOffice for iPad\n\nIn the first major strategic move under recently appointed CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft finally launched Office for iPad. For Microsoft, this is a sign the company is likely taking on a multiplatform strategy, aiming to bring its software and applications to every platform.\n\nSince the iPad was originally launched in 2010, Microsoft has hoarded the world\'s most popular productivity suite from Apple\'s iOS in hopes that it would give the company a competitive advantage. The move wasn\'t effective. Not only has iOS grown by leaps and bounds with Apple\'s iPad remaining the world\'s most popular tablet, but PC sale sales are declining as the overall important tablet market soars -- and Microsoft\'s Surface tablet has failed to gain traction.\n\nA fast-changing competitive environment has brought on other key drivers that likely played a role in convincing Microsoft to finally launch Office for iPad. For instance, as tablets improve and end-users spend increasingly more time on them, they are becoming better devices for productivity. Also, an onslaught of free competitive productivity software from Google, Apple, and others tablets have created a new threat to Microsoft\'s Office.\n\nWhile the Office apps can be downloaded from the iPad app store and activated without cost for users that already have an Office 365 subscription, users without a 365 subscription can pay from within the app. These in-app subscriptions won\'t receive any special treatment from Apple; Microsoft will still have to pay a 30% cut to Apple for every purchase made within the app.\n\nThe latest iPhone 6 details\n\nApple may launch the new iPhone 6 ""as early as September,"" according to Japanese business newspaper Nikkei (via MacRumors). The iPhone will come in two display sizes, Nikkei asserts: 4.7 and 5.5 inches. Manufacturers are already making some parts for the new iPhone lineup, according to Nikkei.\n\nA report from The Korea Herald earlier this year predicted that the iPhone 6 will have bezel-free edges that enable an edge-to-edge display.\n\nThe investor takeaway\n\nAs far as the iPhone 6 rumors go, it\'s at least reaffirming to hear that production for Apple\'s most important product line may be under way.\n\nMicrosoft\'s decision to bring Office to iOS is excellent news for Apple shareholders. Not only does the move strengthen Apple\'s ecosystem of products (especially the iPad), but it signals that Microsoft and Apple may be working together more frequently in the future. As the world\'s most powerful software giant, Microsoft is an excellent player to have on your team.', ""Particularly, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) finally brought its Office productivity suite to iPad and the Apple rumor mill has some more details on the iPhone 6.\nApple's stock outperformed the market during the week with a 0.75% gain versus the S&P 500's 0.5% decline.\nOffice for iPadIn the first major strategic move under recently appointed CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft finally launched Office for iPad.\nAlso, an onslaught of free competitive productivity software from Google, Apple, and others tablets have created a new threat to Microsoft's Office.\nThese in-app subscriptions won't receive any special treatment from Apple; Microsoft will still have to pay a 30% cut to Apple for every purchase made within the app.""]"

Microsoft unveiled Office for the iPad, a software suite that includes programs such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and works on rival Apple Inc.'s hugely popular tablet computer.\n\nNEW YORK - Microsoft Office fans who've spent the last nine months using the software's suite of apps on their tiny smartphone screens are probably thrilled that they can finally create and update documents on the iPad's significantly bigger display surface.\n\nThe new version of Office for Apple's tablet is not likely to be a big deal for anyone else. While the apps are beautiful, intuitive and include many familiar functions from the popular desktop version of Office, typing and maneuvering the cursor within documents remains awkward and inefficient.\n\nMicrosoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet. It includes the Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps that will be familiar to both business and everyday people.\n\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013. Competitors like Apple and Google also created similar software for the iPad, but those apps have very basic features and don't always mesh perfectly with Microsoft documents.\n\nMicrosoft's new apps are free, but you need an annual subscription to Microsoft's Office 365, which costs between $70 and $100 depending on the version, to do more than just read documents.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the trio of apps occupied the top three spots on the App Store's real time list of most downloaded free apps.\n\nHonestly, the free versions may meet the needs of a lot of people, because displaying documents is one of the most useful functions of the apps.\n\nPulling up documents is quick and easy, especially if they're stored on a user's OneDrive account, which comes with 20 gigabytes of cloud storage space as part of the Office 365 subscription.\n\nYou can shrink or enlarge the type to fit as much or as little of it as you like on your screen. I could fit my entire one-page resume, which is largely written in an eight-point font, on the iPad's screen and still easily read it.\n\nBut the iPad Air's super-clear retina display probably helped. And it's worth mentioning that I don't wear glasses. People with impaired vision might have a tougher time. Either way, it's still a big upgrade from looking at the same document on an iPhone screen.\n\nExcel spreadsheets, especially the large ones I viewed, required a little more pinching and stretching to view, because of their larger size, but were still fairly easy to scroll through.\n\nFor people who want to take notes or presentation materials into a meeting without dragging along a stack of printouts or a laptop, this is going to be really handy. And if you use OneDrive, it's nice to know you can always have access to your files on a relatively compact and lightweight device.\n\nUnfortunately, other cloud-based services like Dropbox aren't compatible.\n\nBut is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad?\n\nRather than stripping down Office to a super-basic version, like it did with the smartphone software, Microsoft created a version of Office that's customized for the tablet user and includes many of the bells and whistles of the desktop version.\n\nThe app is relatively easy to use and its layout is clean and simple. Word's toolbar at the top lets you do things like change the typeface of fonts and size, highlight text and customize margins and columns. You can also insert page breaks and pictures from your iPad's camera roll or photo stream. There's also a nice selection of compatible fonts to choose from --even Wingdings, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nIn order to cut and paste and make other changes to text in Word, you have to tap twice on the area you want to update, which brings up a set of scrolling bars, much like in other iOS applications. You can move the bars to select text, then cut copy or paste the selection. It's a little cumbersome and slow, but pretty easy to figure out.\n\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office's Mac and PC versions.\n\nOne nice feature is a built-in AutoSave function, which can be disabled if you're worried about data usage. There's also a basic spell checker, with those familiar red and green lines to warn you of potential mistake, but no thesaurus.\n\nExcel functions are also somewhat paired down, but the app displays documents created elsewhere very nicely. All three of the apps come with sets of templates that speed up the creation of basic documents.\n\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions. But I'm curious how much even people like that will use the apps. Even if you buy a nice keyboard to use with your iPad, it's much faster to create and edit documents on laptop.\n\nMeanwhile, typing on an iPad itself should be reserved for quick edits and desperate situations, no matter how nice an app you're using."", ""The new version of Office for Apple's tablet is not likely to be a big deal for anyone else.\nMicrosoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet.\nBut is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad?\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office's Mac and PC versions.\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions.""]"

The sudden success of its Office software for Apple\'s iPad suggests that is where new chief executive Satya Nadella is taking the company.\n\nFor far too long, Microsoft has remained dedicated to an increasingly obsolete business paradigm, in which the operating system is the core product. In this model, the goal is to get the operating system onto as many devices as possible, and to have the best and broadest selection of applications. To that end, former Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer was willing to buy an entire mobile handset business from Nokia, just to get Windows onto more devices. Microsoft also was reluctant to make versions of its most popular applications for other operating systems. Hence, no Microsoft Word for Linux or Android. Profitable opportunities were sacrificed on the altar of Windows.\n\nNow, though, in a world where Microsoft Office applications can be accessed in the cloud from any computer running any operating system, the Windows-centric approach makes no sense. Judging from his blog post explaining the release of Office for iPad, Nadella recognises this. He was immediately rewarded for the insight: On its first day in Apple\'s App Store, Word was the uncontested leader in the productivity category and the most downloaded app, period; in the US, PowerPoint and Excel were also doing great.\n\nThere is no such thing as being late to the market when you\'ve delivered a good product under an instantly recognisable brand name. Word, PowerPoint and Excel are still industry standards, and despite competition from excellent (and free) products such as OpenOffice or Apple\'s productivity suite, you still have to send files in traditional Microsoft formats to make sure anyone in the world, running any office software, can open them. That may no longer be entirely deserved, but it\'s not worth fighting.\n\nIn terms of profits, Windows has long since stopped being Microsoft\'s dominant offering. In 2013, the operating system accounted for 33 per cent of the company\'s operating profits, down from 54 per cent in 2010. Windows versions for the PC had grown progressively weirder and more misunderstood, culminating in Windows 8 with a combined touch and traditional interface as confusing as it is unnecessary. The new touch-based version of Office is not available for Windows 8 yet because there are not enough tablets running it.\n\nThe business division, which includes Office, contributed 60 per cent of operating profit in 2013. Last year, Morgan Stanley estimated that Microsoft was missing out on $2.5 billion in revenue by not releasing Office for the iPad. That\'s 13 per cent of the 2013 revenue of the entire Windows division - just for an Office edition for a single platform.\n\nWindows revenue won\'t disappear, if only because corporate clients have already invested in the operating system and aren\'t going to drop it in the foreseeable future. But it is a legacy business that, under Nadella, is becoming secondary to the company\'s goals. Reports that Microsoft is now giving away Windows licenses to some (decidedly minor) mobile-phone producers confirm the strategy shift.\n\nNadella promised on the Microsoft blog that he would make it clear next week ""where we are going with key platforms like Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox and Azure."" With the launch of Office for iPad, though, Nadella has already made his major statement: Products are now more important for Microsoft than platforms. With plenty of cash and talent at its disposal, the software giant may well be able to reinvent itself and produce more cross-platform hits.\n\nThe author is a BlombergView columnist.

That news garnered a lot of well-deserved attention -- after all, Office is one of the most widely used tools for enterprise users, and the iPad is the enterprise tablet of choice.\n\nThe long-awaited pairing of Office and iPad will likely be a great thing for both companies. Microsoft will sell more Office 365 subscriptions because of it and hold onto its enterprise software dominance just a little tighter. Meanwhile, subscriptions purchased through Apple\'s App Store, as opposed to directly through Microsoft, allow Apple to skim 30% off the top of Office 365 pricing.\n\nWhile all of this is certainly good news for investors of both tech companies, the Microsoft investors should be more focused on Microsoft\'s announcement of the company\'s Enterprise Mobile Suite, or EMS.\n\nDiving deeper into the enterprise cloud\n\nSo, what is EMS? The company\'s new CEO Satya Nadella calls it ""the most strategic piece of the infrastructure development we\'re doing in support of enterprises."" The suite of products essentially brings together several of Microsoft\'s previous enterprise offerings, with a few new ones, and packages them together in a comprehensive device and user-management system across Windows, iOS, and Android platforms.\n\nEMS combines the company\'s Azure Active Directory Premium service, Windows Intune, and Azure AD Rights Management Services to allow IT professionals to manage user identity and access, protect data, control mobile app access, and manage bring your own devices (BYOD) in the workplace.\n\nIn short, it\'s Microsoft\'s way of securing its mobile future in the enterprise sector.\n\nWhy all of this matters to Microsoft investors\n\nEnterprise Mobility Suite offers is an integral part of the Microsoft\'s cloud and mobile ambitions going forward. Up until now, the company focused more on its Windows customers, but this latest move shows Microsoft knows that true mobile integration means creating services for Apple\'s products and the Android platform.\n\nBeing open to offering services on platforms other than Windows allows the company to further expand its reach with products like OneDrvie, Azure, and Office 365. And that could have huge payoffs in the BYOD world. When it comes to Office 365 subscriptions, Microsoft says it\'s the company\'s ""fastest-growing commercial product ever."" Now that Enterprise Mobility Suite has launched, the combination of this package plus Office 365 could bring on-going revenue streams for Microsoft.\n\nThe company\'s software is already the preferred choice for many IT professionals, and offering a suite of mobile and security applications that integrate with current systems and any mobile platform make it that much easier for EMS to take off. This really is a huge step in the bring your own device direction for the company, and it\'s an important factor in continuing the long marriage between enterprise businesses and Microsoft.', 'Microsoft will sell more Office 365 subscriptions because of it and hold onto its enterprise software dominance just a little tighter.\nMeanwhile, subscriptions purchased through Apple\'s App Store, as opposed to directly through Microsoft, allow Apple to skim 30% off the top of Office 365 pricing.\nWhile all of this is certainly good news for investors of both tech companies, the Microsoft investors should be more focused on Microsoft\'s announcement of the company\'s Enterprise Mobile Suite, or EMS.\nWhen it comes to Office 365 subscriptions, Microsoft says it\'s the company\'s ""fastest-growing commercial product ever.""\nNow that Enterprise Mobility Suite has launched, the combination of this package plus Office 365 could bring on-going revenue streams for Microsoft.']"

This is a pretty outlandish thought in a day and age when free is the most important aspect for adopting an app, but Microsoft has decades of experience developing office productivity software so it is not a far reach to consider that Office for iPad could be a good purchase.\n\nOn the flip side is Microsoft's convoluted way it is offering the app. The product suite is comprised of three free apps, Word, PowerPoint and Excel. These can be downloaded and give the user a read-only ability with content created elsewhere.\n\nIf you want to unlock the ability to create or edit these documents, then one has to reach for their credit card. Manipulating Office content can only be done by subscribing to Office 365. This will cost $99 per year or $9.99 per month for the Home Premium version. For this price, the subscriber is given enough licenses to equip five PCs or Macs plus five tablets.\n\nThere are also three distinct plans for businesses that start at $5 per month, $60 per year for up to 25 users. For this price, you get Business-class email, online conferencing, public website, file storage and sharing and office online. The step-up program is $12.50 per month or $150 per year and adds access to the desktop versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and several other titles. The flagship program requires a one-year contract and costs $15 per month, but can be used by up to 300 people and it adds Active Directory integration self-service business intelligence.\n\nApple's iWork delivers the same for free via Pages (documents), Numbers (spreadsheets), Keynote (presentations) and for the fun side of life, it includes iPhoto, Garageband and iMovie.\n\nThe primary difference between the two is Office for iPad is set up for businesses to use. There are two points that tie all this together. Most companies are Windows based and the latest trend of staffers bringing their own devices (BYOD) - read iPads - means there needs to be a way to tie the iPad into the office systems.\n\nNow, while iWork is compatible with some aspects of Microsoft Office, it was not designed from the ground as such so a Microsoft created app is a better choice for businesses.\n\nFor home use, it would seem iWork is the better choice, in much the same way Open Office is a suitable, free, substitute for Office on a desktop or laptop.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Users don’t get complete desktop PC or Mac Office functionality, but they do get many of the features needed to create and edit documents, spreadsheets and presentations, including a familiar-looking user interface. These apps also work with the iPad’s voice dictation to provide hands-free drafting. Users can also use Apple AirPlay to present their creations via wireless.\n\nAlthough the benefits to iPad users who have waited years for Microsoft Office are many, there are several things lacking with this release. Office for iPad includes Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote apps, but there isn’t an Access or equivalent database app. The iPad-compatible Office also does not give users the ability to insert videos in PowerPoint. In fact, the PowerPoint app appears to be optimized more for presentation display rather than presentation creation.\n\nPrinting is another area lacking in the service. You must save your documents and then print using another program or open them using the Office Web app and then print. Users who like Dropbox or Google Docs aren’t given an option to save directly from Office for iPad to those services. Lastly, only iPaid users with iOS 7 or higher can take advantage of this release.\n\nIt’s unknown at this time if in the future Microsoft will provide missing features or offer additional compatibility with other services.\n\nOn The Web:\n\nAnnouncing the Office you love, now on the iPad\n\nhttp://blogs.office.com/2014/03/27/announcing-the-office-you-love-now-on-the-ipad/\n\nMicrosoft Office for iPad sets the gold standard for tablet productivity\n\nhttp://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-office-for-ipad-sets-the-gold-standard-for-tablet-productivity-7000027797/', 'On March 27, Microsoft Corporation released its office document-processing suite, Microsoft Office, as apps for iPad through the iTunes Store.\nIn Office for iPad, you produce and edit your documents and then save to consumer or business OneDrive, Sharepoint or your iPad.\nAlthough the benefits to iPad users who have waited years for Microsoft Office are many, there are several things lacking with this release.\nOffice for iPad includes Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote apps, but there isn’t an Access or equivalent database app.\nOn The Web:Announcing the Office you love, now on the iPadhttp://blogs.office.com/2014/03/27/announcing-the-office-you-love-now-on-the-ipad/Microsoft Office for iPad sets the gold standard for tablet productivityhttp://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-office-for-ipad-sets-the-gold-standard-for-tablet-productivity-7000027797/']"

The millions of iPad owners have gotten along just fine without Office and they\'ve moved on.""\n\nThat\'s a sentiment that some have been expressing for a while, but this quote is mine. I made this comment just a few months ago, and Microsoft is already proving me wrong. I\'m the first to admit when I\'m wrong with my analysis, and that I\'m doing so now is due to Office for iPad, and how Microsoft got it exactly right.\n\nMy earlier panning of Office for iPad was based on the belief that Microsoft would never create iPad versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint that would offer just the right features for the tablet. My thoughts were that Office for iPad would either be failed full ports of the mammoth suite, something inappropriate for the iPad, or would be so stripped down that they\'d offer little value to iPad owners.\n\nI\'m the first to admit when I\'m wrong with my analysis, and that I\'m doing so now is due to Office for iPad, and how Microsoft got it exactly right.\n\nAfter playing around with the Office apps on the iPad, I concede that I was wrong. Microsoft has totally built the iPad versions of the apps to offer just the right features to make them a worthy addition to iPad owners\' tool box. They don\'t seem bloated, yet they will handle most everything iPad owners are likely to need. All three Office apps have the right mix of features and usability that is appropriate for tablets.\n\nThe freemium model that Microsoft has chosen is the right approach to generate the large downloads that we\'re already seeing. While I\'d prefer some light editing to be included in the free offering, the Apple royalty charge (30 percent) probably was a factor in Microsoft\'s decision to require an Office 365 subscription to unlock editing. After careful thought I\'m OK with that.\n\nIt remains to be seen how many subscriptions Microsoft will sell due to the Office for iPad apps. How many iPad owners who have downloaded the free apps, and there have been a lot downloads, continue to use them over time will be what determines the impact to Microsoft\'s bottom line.\n\nCNET Video: Microsoft Office for iPad in action\n\nMany of those iPad owners will probably use them heavily, and that\'s due to the fine job Microsoft has done with Office for iPad. All three apps have just the right mix of features and a very good interface adapted for the iPad. It is Office done right for the iPad. Kudos to the folks in Redmond for understanding that it needed to rebuild Office for the device, and then having the guts to do it.\n\nThis writer believes the release of Office for iPad is one of Microsoft\'s finest moments. It is a clear indication that the company is serious about its ""devices and services"" vision. It makes sense to release the new tablet version of Office first on the biggest platform and not its own. The way forward is now clear.\n\nDon\'t miss ZDNet\'s outstanding coverage of Office for iPad:', 'The millions of iPad owners have gotten along just fine without Office and they\'ve moved on.""\nMy thoughts were that Office for iPad would either be failed full ports of the mammoth suite, something inappropriate for the iPad, or would be so stripped down that they\'d offer little value to iPad owners.\nIt remains to be seen how many subscriptions Microsoft will sell due to the Office for iPad apps.\nCNET Video: Microsoft Office for iPad in actionMany of those iPad owners will probably use them heavily, and that\'s due to the fine job Microsoft has done with Office for iPad.\nThis writer believes the release of Office for iPad is one of Microsoft\'s finest moments.']"

Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he will “hold nothing back” in getting the company’s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker’s longtime focus on its Windows operating system\n\n[/np_storybar]\n\nThe new version of Office for Apple’s tablet is not likely to be a big deal for anyone else. While the apps are beautiful, intuitive and include many familiar functions from the popular desktop version of Office, typing and manoeuvring the cursor within documents remains awkward and inefficient.\n\nMicrosoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet. It includes the Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps that will be familiar to both business and everyday people.\n\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013. Competitors like Apple and Google also created similar software for the iPad, but those apps have very basic features and don’t always mesh perfectly with Microsoft documents.\n\nMicrosoft’s new apps are free, but you need an annual subscription to Microsoft’s Office 365, which costs between $70 and $100 depending on the version, to do more than just read documents.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the trio of apps occupied the top three spots on the App Store’s real time list of most downloaded free apps.\n\nHonestly, the free versions may meet the needs of a lot of people, because displaying documents is one of the most useful functions of the apps.\n\nPulling up documents is quick and easy, especially if they’re stored on a user’s OneDrive account, which comes with 20 gigabytes of cloud storage space as part of the Office 365 subscription.\n\nYou can shrink or enlarge the type to fit as much or as little of it as you like on your screen. I could fit my entire one-page resume, which is largely written in an eight-point font, on the iPad’s screen and still easily read it.\n\nBut the iPad Air’s super-clear retina display probably helped. And it’s worth mentioning that I don’t wear glasses. People with impaired vision might have a tougher time. Either way, it’s still a big upgrade from looking at the same document on an iPhone screen.\n\nExcel spreadsheets, especially the large ones I viewed, required a little more pinching and stretching to view, because of their larger size, but were still fairly easy to scroll through.\n\nFor people who want to take notes or presentation materials into a meeting without dragging along a stack of printouts or a laptop, this is going to be really handy. And if you use OneDrive, it’s nice to know you can always have access to your files on a relatively compact and lightweight device.\n\nUnfortunately, other cloud-based services like Dropbox aren’t compatible.\n\nBut is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad?\n\nRather than stripping down Office to a super-basic version, like it did with the smartphone software, Microsoft created a version of Office that’s customized for the tablet user and includes many of the bells and whistles of the desktop version.\n\nThe app is relatively easy to use and its layout is clean and simple. Word’s toolbar at the top lets you do things like change the typeface of fonts and size, highlight text and customize margins and columns. You can also insert page breaks and pictures from your iPad’s camera roll or photo stream. There’s also a nice selection of compatible fonts to choose from — even Wingdings, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nIn order to cut and paste and make other changes to text in Word, you have to tap twice on the area you want to update, which brings up a set of scrolling bars, much like in other iOS applications. You can move the bars to select text, then cut copy or paste the selection. It’s a little cumbersome and slow, but pretty easy to figure out.\n\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office’s Mac and PC versions.\n\nOne nice feature is a built-in AutoSave function, which can be disabled if you’re worried about data usage. There’s also a basic spell checker, with those familiar red and green lines to warn you of potential mistake, but no thesaurus.\n\nExcel functions are also somewhat paired down, but the app displays documents created elsewhere very nicely. All three of the apps come with sets of templates that speed up the creation of basic documents.\n\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions. But I’m curious how much even people like that will use the apps. Even if you buy a nice keyboard to use with your iPad, it’s much faster to create and edit documents on laptop.\n\nMeanwhile, typing on an iPad itself should be reserved for quick edits and desperate situations, no matter how nice an app you’re using.', 'Microsoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet.\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013.\nBut is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad?\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office’s Mac and PC versions.\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions.']"

After release of new office suite on app store, it shows download charts within 24 hours. Office apps took place at the top on apps charts in one day.\n\nAll three apps including Word, Excel and PowerPoint are full-featured and more advanced as compared to iPhone office apps.

When you take a look on charts of free downloads at App store, you will see the list of all these office apps touching the high spot.\n\nMicrosoft OneNote doesn’t require any subscription fee. It has a fourth position on download charts and first three positions are taken by subscription office apps. It’s free to view document through all three apps, but to enjoy complete features of office suite, you need to be an office 365 subscriber.\n\nBack in 2012, Microsoft approached to launch an iPad version of office suite. But, these rumors failed to convert in reality.

You can also insert page breaks and pictures from your iPad's camera roll or photo stream. There's also a nice selection of compatible fonts to choose from —even Wingdings, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nIn order to cut and paste and make other changes to text in Word, you have to tap twice on the area you want to update, which brings up a set of scrolling bars, much like in other iOS applications. You can move the bars to select text, then cut copy or paste the selection. It's a little cumbersome and slow, but pretty easy to figure out.\n\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office's Mac and PC versions.\n\nOne nice feature is a built-in AutoSave function, which can be disabled if you're worried about data usage. There's also a basic spell checker, with those familiar red and green lines to warn you of potential mistake, but no thesaurus.\n\nExcel functions are also somewhat paired down, but the app displays documents created elsewhere very nicely. All three of the apps come with sets of templates that speed up the creation of basic documents.\n\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions. But I'm curious how much even people like that will use the apps. Even if you buy a nice keyboard to use with your iPad, it's much faster to create and edit documents on laptop.\n\nMeanwhile, typing on an iPad itself should be reserved for quick edits and desperate situations, no matter how nice an app you're using.\n\nAssociated Press"", ""The new version of Office for Apple's tablet is not likely to be a big deal for anyone else.\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013.\nBut is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad?\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office's Mac and PC versions.\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions.""]"

While Office has been hitting headlines, there were several other major updates to mobile and desktop apps this week that you should check out. Here’s a quick recap.\n\nMicrosoft Office\n\nMS Office needs no introduction, and its launch for iPad isn’t the only good news to come from Microsoft. It has now made Office for iPhone and Android smartphones free. Earlier while reading on the apps was free, users needed a subscription for editing features. However, the iPad version will still require an Office 365 subscription if you want to edit any document. As far as prices go the Office 365 Premium version costs around Rs 4,199 or around $69.9 per year and gives users access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint and SkyDrive cloud storage for 5 PCs or Macs, and mobile devices as well. You can also take a monthly subscription for around Rs 420.\n\nUsers can download Microsoft Office Mobile for Android from Google Play Store, and Office Mobile for iPad and iPhone from the App store.\n\nGoogle Now for Chrome\n\nEarlier this week, Google’s Chrome team announced the availability of Google Now for desktop (i.e. not mobile) Chrome users, both PC and Mac. The Google Now feature is accessible only by signing into Chrome with the same account that one uses on their Now account on Android or iOS. The new update will display informative cards that appear on Android phones on your desktop browser. These cards provide information about weather, sports and other updates, depending on what you search. It will also display information related to your travel time to home or office, if you have saved the addresses.\n\nInterestingly, if you are searching for something on the desktop, it reportedly also pops up a card on the phone too. Those who use multiple devices will need to manage the location settings for each of their devices separately.\n\nMicrosoft OneNote\n\nMicrosoft has released a version of its OneNote note-taking software for Macs and added new features and a free tier for all of the software’s users in moves clearly targeted at up-and-coming productivity software rival Evernote. New Microsoft users also get 7 gigabytes of free online storage through its OneDrive cloud storage service. Some new features play catch-up to what Evernote offered already, including a OneNote Clipper button for Web browsers that saves Web pages as notes, and a universal email address me@onenote.com that gives users a single destination to email documents to themselves for saving as notes.\n\nIt is available for download at Mac App store.\n\nPocket TV for Android\n\nYesterday, Airtel Digital TV, the DTH service arm of Bharti Airtel has launched ‘Pocket TV’, a mobile app that enables customers to watch their favorite TV programs while on the move. The app promises to offer more than 150 Live TV channels, over 10,000 hours of video content and over 13 channels on anytime TV for an introductory pricing of just Rs 60 per month. Once the app is installed, customers need to activate the service by sending the SMS to 54325 from their registered mobile number. It is now available for Android, and will be launched for iOS within a month.\n\nThe app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.\n\nSkype for Outlook.com\n\nEarlier available for select countries, Microsoft now brings Skype for Outlook.com across the world. With the new update, the company has included some bug fixes and other improvements. The latest version adds Safari for Mac support. It also brings HD video calling for PC users, with a fine print that reads, “both users must have compatible HD displays, web cams, messaging clients, and broadband internet.”', 'tech2 News StaffThis week, we saw Microsoft finally launch an Office app for iPad, which is known to have become a huge hit instantly.\nMicrosoft OfficeMS Office needs no introduction, and its launch for iPad isn’t the only good news to come from Microsoft.\nHowever, the iPad version will still require an Office 365 subscription if you want to edit any document.\nUsers can download Microsoft Office Mobile for Android from Google Play Store, and Office Mobile for iPad and iPhone from the App store.\nNew Microsoft users also get 7 gigabytes of free online storage through its OneDrive cloud storage service.']"

While the apps are beautiful, intuitive and include many familiar functions from the popular desktop version of Office, typing and maneuvering the cursor within documents remains awkward and inefficient.\n\nMicrosoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet. It includes the Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps that will be familiar to both business and everyday people.\n\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013. Competitors like Apple and Google also created similar software for the iPad, but those apps have very basic features and don't always mesh perfectly with Microsoft documents.\n\nMicrosoft's new apps are free, but you need an annual subscription to Microsoft's Office 365, which costs between $70 and $100 depending on the version, to do more than just read documents.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the trio of apps occupied the top three spots on the App Store's real time list of most downloaded free apps.\n\nHonestly, the free versions may meet the needs of a lot of people, because displaying documents is one of the most useful functions of the apps.\n\nPulling up documents is quick and easy, especially if they're stored on a user's OneDrive account, which comes with 20 gigabytes of cloud storage space as part of the Office 365 subscription.\n\nYou can shrink or enlarge the type to fit as much or as little of it as you like on your screen. I could fit my entire one-page resume, which is largely written in an eight-point font, on the iPad's screen and still easily read it.\n\nBut the iPad Air's super-clear retina display probably helped. And it's worth mentioning that I don't wear glasses. People with impaired vision might have a tougher time. Either way, it's still a big upgrade from looking at the same document on an iPhone screen.\n\nExcel spreadsheets, especially the large ones I viewed, required a little more pinching and stretching to view, because of their larger size, but were still fairly easy to scroll through.\n\nFor people who want to take notes or presentation materials into a meeting without dragging along a stack of printouts or a laptop, this is going to be really handy. And if you use OneDrive, it's nice to know you can always have access to your files on a relatively compact and lightweight device.\n\nUnfortunately, other cloud-based services like Dropbox aren't compatible.\n\nBut is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad\n\nRather than stripping down Office to a super-basic version, like it did with the smartphone software, Microsoft created a version of Office that's customized for the tablet user and includes many of the bells and whistles of the desktop version.\n\nThe app is relatively easy to use and its layout is clean and simple.

Upon launching the app, it asked me to sign in using a Microsoft or Office 365 account, or create a new account. I went with an Outlook.com account I\'d created a while back.\n\n3. Once I was signed in, the app asked me to either ""Buy Office 365 Home"" or ""View for Free.""\n\n4. Selecting the Office 365 option presents a menu where you can purchase a one-year Office 365 subscription for £80, which provides access to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more, and lets you access your Office 365 account on up to five devices (including your iPad). Interestingly, this goes through the App Store, which means Apple is getting a 30 per cent cut of every Office 365 subscription purchased via the app.\n\n5. Subscriptions, which provide a free 30-day trial, can also be purchased on Microsoft\'s website. If you don\'t want to commit to a whole year, meanwhile, you can opt for a month-to-month payment of £7.99 for Office 365 Home Premium. Office for iPad is also compatible with Office 365 subscriptions for Small Business Premium, Midsize Business, E3 and E4 (Enterprise and Government), Education A3 and A4, and ProPlus. The new Office 365 Personal will also qualify when it becomes available later this spring.\n\n6. If you have an existing Office 365 account and don\'t need to purchase it through the iPad app, tap ""Buy Office 365 Home"" and then scroll to the bottom of the next menu, to where it says ""I already have a subscription.""\n\n7. With a subscription, you can edit and create documents. Non-subscribers can still access all the content uploaded to their OneDrive account, as well as shared documents; you just can\'t make any changes to these documents without an Office 365 subscription. But for quick reviews, it\'s easy enough; I uploaded a small Word document to OneDrive on the web and it showed up on the iPad app seconds later, allowing me to download and view.\n\n8.

If you want to edit them, you have to sign in with an Office 365 account.\n\nTo get an Office 365 account, you have to have one of the subscription options: $99/year for a family account (works on up to five devices); $80 for a student account that last four years and covers two devices.\n\nBut the only subscription that can be bought from within the iPad app is the $99/year option.\n\nBy giving the app away for free, Microsoft gets a shot at completely side-stepping revenue sharing with Apple, reports Computerworld's Gregg Kiezer.\n\nIf users download the freebie iPad app first and then they upgrade to the full app from the iPad app, Microsoft will have to pay Apple the 30%.\n\nBut if Microsoft sells them the Office 365 account first and then they get the iPad app, Microsoft doesn't have to pay Apple.\n\nGiven that Office 365 is software that you install on directly on your PC or Mac and that the $99 version covers five devices, many users will buy it first for their PC or Mac, and then get the iPad app. Microsoft says it has already signed on 3.5 million consumers for Office 365, before the iPad app became available.\n\nMicrosoft will soon a release a cheaper $70/year personal account that covers two devices. This lower-cost version will likely be the most popular with iPad users who buy Office through the iPad app. And the lower price also means less revenue shared with Apple.\n\nBut by far, the biggest money maker for Office for iPad will be businesses, and Apple won't see a cut of those contracts.

65109,http://www.bgr.in/news/4-low-cost-alternatives-to-office-for-ipad/,technology,"['A version of Microsoft Office for the iPad has finally arrived, but it has done so with a hefty $99-a-year price tag. That’s the cost of a subscription to Office 365, the Microsoft’s online service that allows consumers web access to their Word, PowerPoint and Excel files and for being able to use Office applications on other people’s computers. The new iPad apps will still work without this subscription, but users will only be able to open and view files. They won’t be able to edit and save a document or create one from scratch. Times might be changing but Office is still by far the world’s most popular productivity suite of software — Microsoft claims it has over 1 billion users. Still, many tablet owners may think that an Office 365 subscription is a high price to pay for the sake of continuity and compatibility with documents stored on their PCs. So, what are the alternatives?\n\nEVERNOTE\n\nIt doesn’t offer the same scope as the full Office suite, but for written notes, voice memos, to-do lists and filing images and sketches, the app is becoming invaluable. And it automatically syncs content across all devices so that an idea that’s born on a smartphone can be developed on a desktop or tablet and vice versa.\n\nIWORK\n\nIf you have an iPad, then why not use Apple’s own take on Office, iWork? It has a word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and even a desktop publishing app. It links with iCloud (Apple’s cloud storage service) and files can be synced and accessed across Apple’s computers, smartphones and tablets. And, it’s “sort of” free. If your iPad or iPhone was bought after September 2013 then the suite of apps can be downloaded and installed for free. Users with older devices can buy the apps individually for $9.99.\n\nGOOGLE DRIVE\n\nLast, but by no means least. A suite of apps that’s growing more comprehensive by the day and one that’s free to access on pretty much any device capable of computing. And as such it is probably the closest direct competitor to Office currently available in terms of its scope of uses. One of its neatest tricks is its ability to open and read documents created in Word or Excel.\n\nOFFICE FOR IPHONE OR ANDROID\n\nAs one door closes, another opens. The smartphone version of Office is now free to use and doesn’t require a subscription. Ok, creating a spreadsheet or slide presentation on a tiny screen might not be the simplest of things, especially on the move, but word processing is only one step up from texting.', 'A version of Microsoft Office for the iPad has finally arrived, but it has done so with a hefty $99-a-year price tag.\nThe new iPad apps will still work without this subscription, but users will only be able to open and view files.\nEVERNOTEIt doesn’t offer the same scope as the full Office suite, but for written notes, voice memos, to-do lists and filing images and sketches, the app is becoming invaluable.\nIWORKIf you have an iPad, then why not use Apple’s own take on Office, iWork?\nA suite of apps that’s growing more comprehensive by the day and one that’s free to access on pretty much any device capable of computing.']"
65110,http://www.financialexpress.com/news/review-microsoft-office-for-ipad-is-pretty-and-functional/1236724,technology,"[""Microsoft Office fans who've spent the last nine months using the software's suite of apps on their tiny smartphone screens are probably thrilled that they can finally create and update documents on the iPad's significantly bigger display surface.\n\nThe new version of Office for Apple's tablet is not likely to be a big deal for anyone else. While the apps are beautiful, intuitive and include many familiar functions from the popular desktop version of Office, typing and maneuvering the cursor within documents remains awkward and inefficient.\n\nMicrosoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet. It includes the Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps that will be familiar to both business and everyday people.\n\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013. Competitors like Apple and Google also created similar software for the iPad, but those apps have very basic features and don't always mesh perfectly with Microsoft documents.\n\nMicrosoft's new apps are free, but you need an annual subscription to Microsoft's Office 365, which costs between $70 and $100 depending on the version, to do more than just read documents.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the trio of apps occupied the top three spots on the App Store's real time list of most downloaded free apps.\n\nHonestly, the free versions may meet the needs of a lot of people, because displaying documents is one of the most useful functions of the apps.\n\nPulling up documents is quick and easy, especially if they're stored on a user's OneDrive account, which comes with 20 gigabytes of cloud storage space as part of the Office 365 subscription.\n\nYou can shrink or enlarge the type to fit as much or as little of it as you like on your screen. I could fit my entire one-page resume, which is largely written in an eight-point font, on the iPad's screen and still easily read it.\n\nBut the iPad Air's super-clear retina display probably helped. And it's worth mentioning that I don't wear glasses. People with impaired vision might have a tougher time. Either way, it's still a big upgrade from looking at the same document on an iPhone screen.\n\nExcel spreadsheets, especially the large ones I viewed, required a little more pinching and stretching to view, because of their larger size, but were still fairly easy to scroll through.\n\nFor people who want to take notes or presentation materials into a meeting without dragging along a stack of printouts or a laptop, this is going to be really handy. And if you use OneDrive, it's nice to know you can always have access to your files on a relatively compact and lightweight device.\n\nUnfortunately, other cloud-based services like Dropbox aren't compatible.\n\nBut is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad\n\nRather than stripping down Office to a super-basic version, like it did with the smartphone software, Microsoft created a version of Office that's customized for the tablet user and includes many of the bells and whistles of the desktop version.\n\nThe app is relatively easy to use and its layout is clean and simple. Word's toolbar at the top lets you do things like change the typeface of fonts and size, highlight text and customize margins and columns. You can also insert page breaks and pictures from your iPad's camera roll or photo stream. There's also a nice selection of compatible fonts to choose from -even Wingdings, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nIn order to cut and paste and make other changes to text in Word, you have to tap twice on the area you want to update, which brings up a set of scrolling bars, much like in other iOS applications. You can move the bars to select text, then cut copy or paste the selection. It's a little cumbersome and slow, but pretty easy to figure out.\n\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office's Mac and PC versions.\n\nOne nice feature is a built-in AutoSave function, which can be disabled if you're worried about data usage. There's also a basic spell checker, with those familiar red and green lines to warn you of potential mistake, but no thesaurus.\n\nExcel functions are also somewhat paired down, but the app displays documents created elsewhere very nicely. All three of the apps come with sets of templates that speed up the creation of basic documents.\n\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions. But I'm curious how much even people like that will use the apps. Even if you buy a nice keyboard to use with your iPad, it's much faster to create and edit documents on laptop.\n\nMeanwhile, typing on an iPad itself should be reserved for quick edits and desperate situations, no matter how nice an app you're using."", ""The new version of Office for Apple's tablet is not likely to be a big deal for anyone else.\nMicrosoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet.\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013.\nSadly, the iPad version lacks the speedy keyboard shortcuts of Office's Mac and PC versions.\nOn-the-go business types will probably love the functionality of the Office apps and eagerly add their iPads to their existing Office 365 subscriptions.""]"

Instead he was unveiling Office for iPad, the software suite that has for almost four years resisted the lure of Apple’s tablet.\n\nIt was a big moment for both the company and Nadella. While the apps are likely to have been in development for some time, the fact that their release marks his first major event since taking over is something of an indicator of his priorities as chief executive.\n\nIt’s a challenging role to fill. While Microsoft was once considered the top of the class in the software market, a few missteps and experiments have seen it slip slightly. And that’s before you start looking at its mobile strategy in recent years. Nadella has a significant task ahead of him to compete in a fast moving market.\n\nThis week he outlined a new mobile-first, cloud-first strategy that he hopes will put Microsoft on the right track.\n\nThe difference in style between Nadella and his predecessor, Steve Ballmer, was marked. You couldn’t imagine Nadella dancing around a stage, perspiring heavily while chanting about developers. Or throwing office furniture after hearing an employee was leaving for a rival.\n\nWhile Ballmer was known for his wildly energetic performances, Nadella was more poised and polished. Where Ballmer was all about over-the-top enthusiasm for Microsoft and its products, Nadella was more understated but optimistic. There was even a touch of humour when relaying the reaction to his staff email that outlined the mobile-first, cloud-first world: “Like any place that’s got predominantly computer scientists, I get back this mail saying, ‘Hey, look, how can two things be first? I mean, do you have a problem with ordinal numbers or something?’”\n\nAnd with Ballmer’s focus trained on Windows, perhaps to the detriment of Microsoft’s future, his successor gave a clear signal that times are changing. In fact, Microsoft’s Surface tablet was conspicuous in its absence from the event.\n\nWill Nadella be what Microsoft needs to steer it on the right path? Time will tell, but he certainly got off to a strong start.', 'It was telling that he wasn’t there to show off Windows software optimised for its touch-focused operating system.\nWhile Microsoft was once considered the top of the class in the software market, a few missteps and experiments have seen it slip slightly.\nThis week he outlined a new mobile-first, cloud-first strategy that he hopes will put Microsoft on the right track.\nWhere Ballmer was all about over-the-top enthusiasm for Microsoft and its products, Nadella was more understated but optimistic.\nWill Nadella be what Microsoft needs to steer it on the right path?']"

The news appears to be worth the wait, involving a rig of drones and lasers that will provide internet to those without access.\n\nIn a brief post published on his Facebook yesterday, Zuckerberg discussed launching solar-powered drones to distribute wireless internet access to under-served areas. In order to do so, Facebook acquired aerospace technology company Ascenta, makers of the world’s longest-flying, solar-powered, unmanned aircraft, Zuckerberg announced in the post. Although Ascenta consists of just five people, these people list Boeing, Honeywell, and QinetiQ on their resumes, so it was no small acquisition.\n\nIn suburban locales, the plan involves sending drones 20,000 meters above the ground to continually and connecting with each other via a system of lasers. Internet.org went into further detail in a video.\n\nThe video does say what we’re all thinking – ""we\'re just at the beginning.""\n\nHowever ambitious the plan is, it does suggest a solution to the integral problem preventing internet service providers from moving into underdeveloped markets – it’s just not worth the investment for the providers. As is explained in the video, distribution towers are a massive undertaking, and satellite is too unreliable. And as we’ve seen recently, ISPs often decline to serve areas in the U.S. when they don’t see the right numbers.\n\nThe project has also elicited comparisons to Google’s Project Loon, which takes a similar approach except with balloons distributing Wi-Fi signals from the stratosphere. Now that both Facebook and Google have captured most of the internet-connected world, it only makes sense for them to create new markets by connecting the rest of it.\n\nInternet.org’s announcement doesn\'t really come as a surprise to many either, as reports earlier this month claimed Facebook was planning to acquire drone maker Titan Aerospace for this same purpose. It’s unclear whether that acquisition will happen, but with the acquisition of Ascenta, it might not have to.\n\nThe question remains - how realistic is an aerial plan to bring internet connectivity? Shortly after Google launched Project Loon, several of the balloons ended up crashing into the ocean, resulting in criticism both of Google\'s environmental footprint and how realistic such a plan was. Even Bill Gates publicly questioned what Google was thinking with the project.\n\nInternet.org\'s unmanned drones, by contrast, are solar-powered and likely easier to control than a large balloon launched into space.\n\nRegardless of whether Facebook\'s new drones are safer, they still face just as big a challenge - regulations. Drone regulation remains a confusing and hotly debated issue. Some drone operators, including Major League Baseball\'s Washington Nationals, are being faced with fines by the Federal Aviation Administration for violating regulations they didn\'t even know existed. Add to that the vitriol with which some communities view drones, including the small Colorado town selling its residents permits to shoot drones mid-flight for just $25, and you have a recipe for a difficult project.\n\nOf course, Facebook\'s drones will fly high enough to be unobtrusive, and out of the range of hunters\' shotguns. But the project\'s success relies largely on how the technology is received by the people it intends to serve.', ""The news appears to be worth the wait, involving a rig of drones and lasers that will provide internet to those without access.\nIn a brief post published on his Facebook yesterday, Zuckerberg discussed launching solar-powered drones to distribute wireless internet access to under-served areas.\nThe question remains - how realistic is an aerial plan to bring internet connectivity?\nRegardless of whether Facebook's new drones are safer, they still face just as big a challenge - regulations.\nOf course, Facebook's drones will fly high enough to be unobtrusive, and out of the range of hunters' shotguns.""]"

While it certainly seems like everyone uses the internet, 62.7 percent of people in the world still don’t use the internet and getting access to it is the biggest issue, especially in the developing world.\n\nInternet.org is a Facebook funded project that plans to get that 62.7 percent number a bit lower. They hope to one day bring the internet to the entire world, presumably so that they will become Zuckerberg’s friend on Facebook.\n\nToday, Zuckerberg announced that the Internet.org project has brought internet to another 3 million people in the Phillipines and Paraguay. That is impressive for a company that was just started by Facebook and other tech companies last year, but it is still a far cry from connecting the 2/3rds of the people on this earth that don’t have access to the internet.\n\nHoping to bring the project to the next level, Zuckerberg announced the creation of a team called Connectivity Labs, which is part of a talent acquisition of the U.K. based Ascenta, which worked on projects like the Zephyr, the worlds longest flying unmanned solar aircraft.\n\nIn order to bring internet to the unfortunate mass of people who haven’t gotten to experience it, Facebook is taking two approaches. One is for low level orbiting satellites. They can provide reliable internet connection to low density areas but require a constant line of sight to the users. Since they operate outside of the earth’s orbit, there needs to be enough of them up there that there is always a satellite for users to access. What they plan to do is build a ring of satellites that will essentially create an internet backbone up in the air.\n\nBut the distance between the earth and the satellites also make it a less than ideal solution for high density areas. For this, Facebook is working on something not unlike the Zephyr.\n\nFacebook plans to fly drones at around 20,000 meters above the earth’s surface. That is higher than commercial airplanes and even weather systems, but low enough to provide a reliable connection for those below. The solar powered drones will fly in circles above suburban areas for months at a time, beaming internet to the population below.\n\nTo help everything communicate, Facebook wants to use lasers, yes lasers, to help these satellites and drones talk to each other and to devices on earth below. Facebook says these “Free Space Optics” will provide data streams similar to what you would find on fiber optic lines.\n\nIt is all very sci-fi, but Facebook has been into sci-fi a lot these days.', 'Internet.org is a Facebook funded project that plans to get that 62.7 percent number a bit lower.\nThey hope to one day bring the internet to the entire world, presumably so that they will become Zuckerberg’s friend on Facebook.\nIn order to bring internet to the unfortunate mass of people who haven’t gotten to experience it, Facebook is taking two approaches.\nThey can provide reliable internet connection to low density areas but require a constant line of sight to the users.\nTo help everything communicate, Facebook wants to use lasers, yes lasers, to help these satellites and drones talk to each other and to devices on earth below.']"

In 2004, he (along with college friends—we all know the story) launched the world’s current number one social networking platform, which started as a dream. As Zuckerberg puts it, “even the internet was once a dream.”\n\nWith Facebook’s most recent acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion on Tuesday, the company’s most recent dream is becoming clear.\n\nOculus VR, the innovative company behind the Oculus Rift headset began as a Kickstarter campaign, a quite successful one at that. The headset’s virtual reality technology was initially intended for the gaming world, but now that that the company is teaming up with the social network, the technology’s future will extend beyond games.\n\nIt’s no wonder as caused some mixed emotions in the gaming community, but based on Zuckerberg’s own statement, there’s nothing to worry about in that department. In his Facebook announcement Tuesday, Zuckerberg noted that, “Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook,” which will allow them to continue developing their product.\n\nTo further lay worries to rest, Sony has announced a virtual reality prototype for PlayStation 4, Project Morpheus, which poses as competition for the Oculus Rift. So no matter what happens, it’s safe to say that the virtual reality gaming revolution is coming.\n\nFollowing Facebook’s big ticket acquisition of messaging app, WhatsApp, (a cash and stock deal equaling around 19 billion dollars), there’s significant a lot of backlash about Facebook’s recent spending spree. It’s been suggested that perhaps the company is more concerned with delighting the prospective customers of their future rather than facilitating relationships with the ones they have now.\n\nIn its defense, you just can’t please everyone. The technological world isn’t going to slow down for anyone. Facebook has proved their forward thinking and jumped at the opportunity to utilize these technological resources and creative minds to change the world as we know it. “The future is coming,” says Zuckerberg, “and we have the chance to build it together.”\n\nPoints to consider:\n\nFacebook, in your face\n\nIt’s too soon to tell, but some already speculate that using Facebook will become an immersive experience. This even raises the humorous, yet perhaps serious question: what does this mean for ‘pokes’?\n\nRecommended For You\n\nRegister Now\n\nIt’s not so farfetched at this point. After games, Facebook will begin to use the platform to transform other experiences.\n\n“Oculus’s mission is to enable you to experience the impossible. Their technology opens up the possibility of completely new kinds of experiences.” Zuckerberg said on Facebook. He believes that with the potential to be “the most social platform ever” Oculus will bring virtual and augmented reality to people’s everyday lives.\n\nMobile today, virtual reality tomorrow\n\n“Mobile is the platform of today, and now we’re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow.” – Mark Zuckerberg\n\nYou can’t hear it enough these days, it’s the age of mobile. It’s true, consumers are consistently on their mobile devices in an attempt to absorb content, make purchases, engage in social media and so much more.\n\nThere’s still much to be done on mobile – our smartphones and mobile devices aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. However, technology won’t stop there, and Zuckerberg and the team at Facebook believe they’re in a place where they can begin shaping these future experiences for us.\n\nWhat could this mean for marketers?\n\nIf anything, I would say this is an exciting time for technological innovation to be embraced by the marketing and business worlds. For inbound marketing purposes, a brand must honestly connect with its audience on a real and personal level. This promises advancements in brand humanization and engagement.\n\nZuckerberg believes that the new addition to the Facebook family has the potential “to be the most social platform in the world.” With this technology, he prompts us to, “Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face — just by putting on goggles in your home.”\n\nImagine not only providing your audience with visual content in an attempt to help them interact with you, but giving them a firsthand experience with your brand. Besides meeting in person, you can’t get more personal than that!\n\nCheck out the overview of the Oculus Rift straight from Palmer Luckey, its designer and the founder of Oculus:', 'Oculus VR, the innovative company behind the Oculus Rift headset began as a Kickstarter campaign, a quite successful one at that.\nIn his Facebook announcement Tuesday, Zuckerberg noted that, “Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook,” which will allow them to continue developing their product.\nTo further lay worries to rest, Sony has announced a virtual reality prototype for PlayStation 4, Project Morpheus, which poses as competition for the Oculus Rift.\nSo no matter what happens, it’s safe to say that the virtual reality gaming revolution is coming.\nHe believes that with the potential to be “the most social platform ever” Oculus will bring virtual and augmented reality to people’s everyday lives.']"

Now Facebook’s $2-billion purchase of Oculus may bring that dream one step closer to reality.\n\nVirtual reality enthusiasts say they’ve been waiting for decades for the technology to take off and have been developing headsets and content in the hopes they could soon have mainstream appeal.\n\nThis week’s blockbuster deal for Irvine-based Oculus is also casting the spotlight on Southern California’s growing role in developing virtual reality technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the activity is taking place at USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies, where Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, 21, once worked as a lab assistant. The Playa Vista institute has attracted several top VR researchers including Mark Bolas, who advised Luckey in the early days of Oculus.\n\n“We really do have an emerging hotbed here. I think this is the heart and soul of where virtual reality is going to be,” said Bolas, who is director of the Mixed Reality Lab, a joint effort between the institute and USC’s School of Cinematic Arts that trains art and engineering students in virtual reality design. “We’ve got a nexus of people here that have been working in the field for over 20 years.”\n\nL.A. is uniquely poised to play into the virtual world, with Hollywood and video game companies eager to develop content for virtual reality devices.\n\n“We definitely like being in Southern California because we see the platform as covering gaming and entertainment,” Oculus Chief Operating Officer Laird Malamed said. “It’s a good place to be, which is why we haven’t moved.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOculus’ headset, called the Rift, has been heralded as the device that could make virtual reality the next big thing in video game technology. It began as a project on Kickstarter, raising nearly $2.5 million from 9,522 backers in August 2012.\n\nResembling a pair of bulky ski goggles, the Rift promises to “take gaming to the next level” by immersing the viewer in a lifelike environment.\n\n“It tricks your brain and it feels like you’re somewhere you’re not. Except in real life, you’ve never gotten that sense of scale,” said Chris Dixon, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz who led Oculus’ $75-million Series B financing round in December.\n\n“It’s so effective in its illusion of reality that I think a lot of the current games will be too intense for people,” he said.\n\nVirtual reality incited a lot of buzz and briefly infiltrated pop culture in the 1980s and 1990s, but never really got off the ground. Many early versions were poorly made, uncomfortable and caused viewers to suffer from motion sickness. Soon the movement was relegated to the fringes of technological development, with the exception of high-end uses such as flight training and military tools.\n\nNowadays, motion-control advancements better allow for head tracking and cut down on delays in response time, meaning the images on the Rift screen move with the tilt of the player’s head. Software is also powerful enough to correct for lens distortion, and advances made in the mobile market have helped make such technology affordable because component parts are much cheaper.\n\nJaron Lanier, who began developing virtual reality headsets in the 1980s and is one of the pioneers of the technology, said the renewed excitement in the last few years is largely due to a cost breakthrough instead of a technical overhaul.\n\nMore than 30 years ago, Lanier made a head-mounted VR device similar to the Oculus Rift that cost $100,000. Developer kits for the Rift have been priced at $300 to $350; a consumer version is expected late this year or early next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The difference is not what’s possible now, it’s what’s possible at a price that might be manageable,” Lanier said.\n\nBesides the more attractive prices, virtual reality got a major boost from Facebook’s acquisition announcement this week — and raised Southern California’s profile as a tech region capable of churning out more than fashion websites and consumer apps.\n\n“This is a very technical company, so it didn’t fit the stereotype,” Andreessen Horowitz’s Dixon said. “This showed the diversity of the L.A. technology scene.”\n\nAround the Southland, several entrepreneurs are creating their own virtual reality companies. The Mixed Reality Lab is leading that effort by providing hardware and software plans free to help foster start-ups.\n\n“Being so close to Hollywood and having such a strong network in the film industry and the games industry, it’s really a fantastic place to explore a whole new medium,” said James Iliff, co-founder and president of Survios, an L.A. start-up that is developing its own VR hardware as well as a software platform and games.\n\nIliff, who worked alongside Luckey and Bolas at the Institute for Creative Technologies when he was a student at USC, said Survios aims to create “full-body simulation,” so viewers can see their arms and legs in virtual reality, making for an even more visceral experience.\n\n“Now that VR is finally hitting the mainstream and there’s this whole revolution behind it, this really becomes the ultimate medium,” the 23-year-old said. “I feel like it’s the pinnacle of this overarching goal over the last 30, 40 years of making entertainment more and more immersive.”\n\nBut Lanier cautioned that the technology still needs to prove itself to consumers, despite Oculus’ head-turning deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We shouldn’t mistake an investment for a win, because the only win that happens is out in the marketplace,” he said. “So this is still preliminary, even though it’s big.”\n\nandrea.chang@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @byandreachang', 'Creating an affordable virtual reality device for the mass market has been the holy grail of sorts for game developers and futurists.\nThis week’s blockbuster deal for Irvine-based Oculus is also casting the spotlight on Southern California’s growing role in developing virtual reality technology.\nI think this is the heart and soul of where virtual reality is going to be,” said Bolas, who is director of the Mixed Reality Lab, a joint effort between the institute and USC’s School of Cinematic Arts that trains art and engineering students in virtual reality design.\nVirtual reality incited a lot of buzz and briefly infiltrated pop culture in the 1980s and 1990s, but never really got off the ground.\n“This showed the diversity of the L.A. technology scene.”Around the Southland, several entrepreneurs are creating their own virtual reality companies.']"

Not only was the price enormous, but the virtual reality technology company doesn\'t even have a shipping product.\n\nThe Oculus deal has single-handedly reignited a broad interest in virtual reality, or VR. But as venture capital firms sign checks and engineers and software developers devise systems, the industry must still find exactly what it could sell and who might buy.\n\nThe idea of immersive technology that would effectively let users enter a digital world has been around since the 1960s. The concept became more broadly known in the 1980s with the science fiction movie ""Tron"" and with VPL Research, the first company to sell goggles and gloves that connected to a computer.\n\nThe expected uses of VR have been long and diverse. Gaming, of course, but also in such areas as social media and telecommunications to portray body language; fashion to build online shopping experiences; telemedicine and robotic surgery; and education.\n\nAnd while many of these applications are in current use, most tend to be niche implementations. Many reasons account for that, including the cost of the hardware, the sensation of wearing equipment and an historical problem with VR-induced motion sickness in many users.\n\nBut there\'s also the question of the perceived need for the technology. Want to communicate? You can make a video call over the Internet. Play a game? Millions are apparently happy with social gaming on a smartphone, although many hardcore gamers likely look forward to an ever more complete experience.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg effectively acknowledged this with a focus on the potential use for ""a new communications platform.""\n\nAfter games, we\'re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home.\n\n\n\nThe nausea problem is reportedly under much better control, and prices will come down with larger-scale manufacturing. But for the industry to really take off, it\'ll still have to convince people that they really want and need a VR experience .\n\nFor example, Google\'s Glass goggles have received mixed reviews, including complaints about the product being disorienting and capable of causing headaches.\n\nStill, there can be little doubt that, under the right circumstances, aspects of virtual reality can be big. Look at the popularity of Microsoft (MSFT) Kinect, the fast-selling motion-driven interface for the Xbox gaming console family.\n\nSeeing $2 billion paid for a VR company has whet the appetites of many. Some other startups are getting investment or acquisition offers. The question is which of these companies will see products actually come to market and become popular. New platforms are always coming out. Whether people will suddenly adopt them after decades is yet to be seen.\n\n', ""Not only was the price enormous, but the virtual reality technology company doesn't even have a shipping product.\nThe Oculus deal has single-handedly reignited a broad interest in virtual reality, or VR.\nMillions are apparently happy with social gaming on a smartphone, although many hardcore gamers likely look forward to an ever more complete experience.\nStill, there can be little doubt that, under the right circumstances, aspects of virtual reality can be big.\nSeeing $2 billion paid for a VR company has whet the appetites of many.""]"

This fills the future of the Oculus Rift with potential — more than it ever had without Facebook’s massive war chest — but it also casts a dark cloud of doubt over the device’s seemingly bright future. Along with too many questions regarding the Rift’s future, the Facebook deal both created and brought to light some interesting facts. For instance, John Carmack — famed developer, progenitor of the first-person shooter, and tech industry deity — now works for Facebook. John Carmack was acquired by Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nHowever, after the news settled in and we all began to rest our virtual reality gaming hopes on Sony’s Project Morpheus, some more interesting tidbits came to light: how much money would Kickstarter backers have made if the platform’s campaigns rewarded backers with equity?\n\nKickstarter doesn’t actually allow users to purchase a stake in a project. You’re not buying stock or angel investing in a company, you’re giving a donation and receiving a “thank you” reward in return. Due to that model, there’s no way that Oculus Rift Kickstarter backers — though their money helped fund the development of the Rift — are entitled to any portion of Facebook’s money. However, in a fun fantasy universe where they were, it turns out that backers who funded the standard $300 — the ones who purchased an actual headset rather than, for instance, the $20 t-shirt — would’ve made about $20,000 on their initial backing.\n\nThe initial Kickstarter campaign — without which the Oculus Rift might have never been developed and purchased by Facebook — had 9522 backers. After the campaign closed, the Oculus received funding from investment companies; hedge fund Matrix Partners and venture capital firm Spark Partners both ponied up $19 million. Now, each $19 millon investment is worth about $380 million. Your $300 Kickstarter “investment,” though? It’s worth the development kit you received in the mail some months later — and that was made clear going into Kickstarter, as it’s laid out in plain text on the site’s FAQ.\n\nIt’s impossible to tell exactly how much money each tier of Kickstarter backer would’ve received without knowing what percentage of the company those post-Kickstarter valuation rounds would’ve netted each investor. Even if you know how much money is sitting in a big pile, you can’t divvy it up without knowing who receives what.\n\nWe’ll have to wait and see how Facebook’s shadow affects the Rift. However, the internet vitriol directed at Oculus and Facebook for not giving Kickstarter backers a piece of the pie will hopefully die down soon enough, because they’ll likely realize that the risks of Kickstarter are plainly stated on Kickstarter itself.\n\nUntil then, though, it’s fun to play What If and see exactly how much money each $300 Rift “donation” would’ve returned if the world worked how a large portion of Kickstarter backers just realized they wanted it to work.', 'If Kickstarter backers received equity in a project that they helped fund, how much money would the backers of the Oculus Rift have made from Facebook’s two billion dollar purchase?\nYesterday, Facebook shocked and enraged the tech world when it purchased Oculus VR, maker of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, for a cool two billion.\nDue to that model, there’s no way that Oculus Rift Kickstarter backers — though their money helped fund the development of the Rift — are entitled to any portion of Facebook’s money.\nThe initial Kickstarter campaign — without which the Oculus Rift might have never been developed and purchased by Facebook — had 9522 backers.\nAfter the campaign closed, the Oculus received funding from investment companies; hedge fund Matrix Partners and venture capital firm Spark Partners both ponied up $19 million.']"

Of course, with the run Facebook has been on the last year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and team have earned the benefit of the doubt, at least for now.\n\nWith that said, there should be no questions -- though, of course there are -- about Facebook\'s decision to invest $2 billion in virtual reality headgear manufacturer Oculus. The potential for Facebook of incorporating virtual reality applications are enormous, and the deal for Oculus could prove to be a game-changer as the social media king continues pushing for more, and more diverse, revenue streams.\n\nWho are these guys?\n\nOculus builds and sells a virtual reality headset called Rift, and it just recently celebrated its one-year anniversary of its first dev kit for Rift. The relative infancy of Oculus and its technology -- the company itself is only two years old -- is why some analysts have questioned the price Facebook paid. Of course, near-term thinking is what analysts get paid for.\n\nOculus has already received over 75,000 orders for its Rift dev kit, most of which are used by gamers, which dovetails perfectly with Facebook\'s push to generate more game revenue. But the Oculus acquisition doesn\'t start and end with games. Facebook said it envisions Oculus technology being used ""to extend Oculus\' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.""\n\nFacebook\'s gone so far as to suggest that Oculus and its virtual technology are ""strong candidates"" to emerge as the next social media and communications platform. Is Zuckerberg talking about changing social media as we know it by the end of the week? Of course not. While the potential impact on Facebook gamers is evident, incorporating virtual reality into day-to-day Facebook usage is years down the line, and Zuckerberg\'s opted to get ahead of the curve, just as he should.\n\nNot surprisingly, the notion that virtual reality is a good five years from really having an impact on social communications in general, and Facebook in particular, is another issue brought up by naysayers. But as too many IT companies slow to transition to mobile can attest, waiting for a burgeoning technology to go mainstream before getting on board can be a disaster.\n\nThe deal\n\nOf the $2 billion Facebook is ponying up for Oculus, about $1.6 billion is in stock -- 23.1 million shares with an average trading price of $69.35 a share for the 20 trading days leading up to March 21 -- and the remaining $400 million in cash. With $11.45 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of last quarter, Facebook can certainly afford it.\n\nThe deal also includes the potential for another $300 million payout of cash and stock for Oculus, based on reaching ""certain milestones.""\n\nThe upsides\n\nZuckerberg hit the Oculus acquisition on the head by saying, ""Mobile is the platform of today, and now we\'re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow."" Regarding the impact of virtual reality on Facebook game revenue, ""tomorrow"" could be here before you know it. As alluded to in a recent article, Facebook is going full-throttle to generate more game revenue, and the Oculus deal fits perfectly.\n\nIncreasing game revenues are great, and reason enough to acquire Oculus, as are potential advertising opportunities. Picture product placements, much like in big-budget movies, littered throughout a gamers experience. The possibilities are endless.\n\nRevenue opportunities aren\'t the only upside to the Oculus deal. Preparing for the next-generation social platform today, rather than a couple years from now, speaks volumes about Facebook and how it\'s positioning itself in the market. Leaders dominate markets, not followers, and the Oculus acquisition makes it clear which side of the fence Facebook has decided on.', 'Facebook said it envisions Oculus technology being used ""to extend Oculus\' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.""\nIs Zuckerberg talking about changing social media as we know it by the end of the week?\nWhile the potential impact on Facebook gamers is evident, incorporating virtual reality into day-to-day Facebook usage is years down the line, and Zuckerberg\'s opted to get ahead of the curve, just as he should.\nRegarding the impact of virtual reality on Facebook game revenue, ""tomorrow"" could be here before you know it.\nLeaders dominate markets, not followers, and the Oculus acquisition makes it clear which side of the fence Facebook has decided on.']"

Oculus makes a virtual reality headset called the Oculus Rift, a bulky set of goggles that it has been demonstrating for some time but has yet to bring to market.\n\nUnlike most of Facebook\'s other investments – such as its recent $16 billion purchase of WhatsApp – this is a recognition that software needs hardware, the foundation without which even the most creative software program can do nothing. And Oculus\' hardware demonstrations have been impressive.\n\nThe Oculus Rift eliminates some of the blurry, head-spinning distortion of early VR headsets. True, it requires significant software, but it\'s the whole package that\'s important. As a system, it promises to overcome many of the constraints that have prevented VR technology from going mainstream. Oculus has been slow to get its product out the door, but it has promised to debut the Rift later this year. As an indication of possible pricing, development kits for programmers currently cost $350.\n\nFacebook\'s hardware investment is also a Google-esque move. It acknowledges that simply buying more social networking and messaging companies is not going to sustain the company in the future. So, like Google, it\'s branching out (but don\'t expect to see an autonomous Facebook car driving down the street any time soon).\n\nConversely, Oculus Rift is nothing like Google Glass. The Rift is not a visual supplement; it is a total-attention-grabbing experience originally intended for gaming, but with many other possible uses. One might, for example, put on the headset and watch movies in a “personal” Imax theater. Or walk through a high-definition version of Second Life, chatting with other avatars. Or sit onstage with Arcade Fire during a live performance. Or experience everything but the actual physical exertion of climbing to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. In social settings, the Rift could turn a video chat into an experience of being in the same room with friends who are thousands of miles away.\n\nBut it\'s not all clear sailing for Oculus and Facebook.\n\nFirst, the Rift is not the only VR headset in development. Many larger firms have their own headsets in research departments around the world, meaning there will be competing formats and no VR standard on the horizon. Sony, for example, has spent many years on VR technology, and if its system becomes dominant, Oculus could fade into the digital sunset.\n\nThe hardware still also requires software – or ""content,"" in Silicon Valley speak. Games need to be written specifically to work with Rift, and other applications will require similar reworking. This will take time.\n\nVR is also not for everyone. More than a decade ago, several companies abandoned their VR headsets because of a “cybersickness” effect. I spent a few too many hours testing one device on a game called Descent and felt some of its minor nausea-inducing effects. Oculus\' technology is much improved, but spending extended time in a VR environment can be disorienting.\n\nFinally, the 3-D effect of being somewhere that you really aren’t will require additional technology. Display technology is rapidly advancing, so practical, small 4K or Ultra HD headset screens that will create an immersive experience are on the way. But in order to create a ""you are there"" live form of video communication, much bigger data connections will be needed – far beyond the 15 Mbps connections currently enjoyed by many broadband users. How big a pipe will be needed is unclear, but it won\'t be delivered anytime soon.\n\nIn the meantime, Facebook friends will still appear as two-dimensional characters. And that may be a good thing – at least until we\'re ready to take our relationships to the next level.', 'The social networking behemoth is acquiring virtual reality startup Oculus VR for a cool $2 billion.\nThe Oculus Rift eliminates some of the blurry, head-spinning distortion of early VR headsets.\nAs a system, it promises to overcome many of the constraints that have prevented VR technology from going mainstream.\nSony, for example, has spent many years on VR technology, and if its system becomes dominant, Oculus could fade into the digital sunset.\nMore than a decade ago, several companies abandoned their VR headsets because of a “cybersickness” effect.']"

What is Oculus?\n\nIt\'s a virtual reality company based in Irvine, Calif. The start-up was founded by 21-year-old Palmer Luckey, described as a ""virtual reality enthusiast and hardware geek."" In 2012, the company used crowdfunding service Kickstarter to fund its first product, the Oculus Rift.\n\n2. How does the headset work?\n\nThe headset looks like a pair of goggles with a display attached. After strapping the device onto their heads, users see a display that delivers two parallel images to each eye, which helps create a stereoscopic 3-D effect.\n\nThe headset also boasts a wide field of view that extends beyond the user\'s peripheral vision. This is important because when wearing Oculus, it doesn\'t feel like you\'re staring at a screen. Instead, it\'s like Oculus just dropped you inside a virtual universe.\n\nUsing 360-degree head tracking, the headset monitors every movement in real time, projecting new views. Look up and you\'ll see a view of the sky, or look down to view your feet. Users can even look behind them. In demos, the headset is paired with headphones for audio and a video game controller to walk or run.\n\n3. When is it available to the public?\n\nDeveloper kits are available now to users who want to create games or other applications for Oculus. The company says they plan on releasing the headset to consumers, but have not set a release date.\n\n4. Who are Oculus\' primary competitors?\n\nOculus is in a unique position. There are very few major competitors in the virtual reality market. However, that\'s likely to change. Tech giant Sony recently entered the market with the announcement of its experimental Project Morpheus VR headset. Also, Xbox One maker Microsoft has reportedly expressed interest in the VR field. Other headsets that have generated buzz include the Avegant Glyph, a virtual retinal display for watching HD video.\n\n5. Why would Facebook want Oculus?\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\'s interest in Oculus goes beyond the VR company\'s ability to bring video games to life. He sees it as the next big computing platform, applying it to fields such as education and communication.\n\nOculus board member Antonio Rodriguez, a general partner at VC firm Matrix Partners, says Oculus has been approached by interested parties from all fields, including medicine and space exploration.\n\n""Mobile is the platform of today, and now we\'re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,"" Zuckerberg said in a statement.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @bam923.', 'Brett MolinanewsFacebook\'s $2 billion acquisition of tech start-up Oculus has pushed the world of virtual reality into the spotlight.\nHere are five questions about the virtual reality company.\nThe start-up was founded by 21-year-old Palmer Luckey, described as a ""virtual reality enthusiast and hardware geek.""\nTech giant Sony recently entered the market with the announcement of its experimental Project Morpheus VR headset.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\'s interest in Oculus goes beyond the VR company\'s ability to bring video games to life.']"

Its parent company, Oculus VR, was just acquired by Facebook for $2 billion.\n\nThe headset displays a fully immersive 3D experience that makes you feel like you are actually in the game.

Oculus VR put the product on Kickstarter about a year and a half ago — and on Tuesday, turned its a pipe dream of becoming a real product into a $2 billion acquisition offer. It\'s a three-way win — for Oculus, Kickstarter and Facebook — and could also revolutionize the way people interact with others online.\n\nWhile other virtual reality headsets already exist on the market, many have extremely high price points or are reserved for specific communities like the military. Pricing for the Oculus Rift has not yet been announced, but it will be competitively priced to fuel consumer interest and adoption.\n\nDevelopers can currently purchase the Oculus Rift and the developer kit for $350, so they can build software and games that will work with the device.\n\nBeyond gaming\n\nThe Oculus Rift\'s main sights are set on video games, but it also plans to impact the way we consumer all media, including movies. Just consider watching Avatar as though you\'re running through the rainforest and dodging explosions.\n\nVideo tech startup Condition One is currently working on a documentary called Zero Point about virtual reality headsets made specifically for the Oculus Rift. Although the production was announced last year, the company recently released its first interactive trailer, which gives a fascinating taste of what we might see.\n\nThe Oculus Rift supports 3D movies and a 360-degree viewing experience — Zero Point will take advantage of both — but the trailer is limited to 180-degree angles for now. The two-minute clip, above, lets you move your mouse in different directions to see different perspectives, likening the experience to moving your head while wearing the Oculus Rift.\n\nBacker backlash\n\nIt didn\'t take long for Oculus\' Kickstarter backers to complain about the Facebook acquisition.\n\n""What in hell was the point of Kickstarter if you sell out to a giant company like Facebook?"" Michael Cooper wrote on the project\'s comment page. ""This is very disappointing.

And now they’re both defending their decision for Facebook to buy Oculus for $2 billion.\n\nOculus, the future of computing\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has been casting a rather broad net of late, and as a result, many investors are asking why. Is it because the company is in trouble? According to Facebook, it is gazing beyond the current computing world and into the computing world of the future. We heard recently that the company was interested in buying a drone maker—another seemingly odd purchase at first. But drones will likely be a major part of the future of technology.\n\nWith the purchase of Oculus, Facebook is essentially banking on virtual reality becoming the next big thing. According to Oculus VR itself, Facebook representatives visited them a few months ago to explore how they could work together. The company says they are “culturally aligned [with Facebook] with a focus on innovating and hiring the best and brightest.”\n\nFacebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement that they intend to expand Oculus to uses “for many other experiences.” He suggested that it could be used for virtually attending a sporting event, attending class or even medical consultations. He believes that virtual reality will become the next major computing platform, following in the footsteps of mobile, which is on the rise right now.\n\nFacebook still strong in mobile\n\nThe social network did reassure investors that its mobile platform is still doing well. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) said more than 1 billion people are using its mobile app currently, compared to 945 million at the end of the fourth quarter. The company also sees more than half of its revenue from mobile. In other words, Facebook isn’t waiting until its mobile platform is in trouble—like it did with its desktop platform. The company is attempting to plan ahead with a $2 billion gamble.\n\nIn a research note dated March 25, 2014, Raymond James analysts Aaron Kessler and Ben Cohen note that the acquisition of Oculus probably won’t meaningfully contribute to Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)’s revenue in the near term. Also there’s no guarantee that virtual reality will indeed be the next computing platform. However, they like the social network’s “forward thinking strategy as it positions itself for the platforms of the future.”\n\nWhat the sell side says about Facebook’s acquisition\n\nStifel analysts are also positive on Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB)’s acquisition. However, the sell side sees this as more of a warning sign for the social network. They believe Facebook must be in trouble, or else it wouldn’t have bought Oculus. In addition, there are plenty of other similar acquisitions which didn’t turn out too well.\n\nAn article in the Salt Lake Tribune points to lessons learned from Star Trek: The Next Generation’s episode entitled “The Game.” In that episode, the warning is that people would use a gaming technology for things other than games, and the result is a bunch of mind controlled crew members. It sort of sounds like what Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) wants to do with Oculus’ technology.', 'Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Oculus Rift may not seem like a match made in heaven, but of course both companies say it makes sense.\nWith the purchase of Oculus, Facebook is essentially banking on virtual reality becoming the next big thing.\nFacebook still strong in mobileThe social network did reassure investors that its mobile platform is still doing well.\nIn other words, Facebook isn’t waiting until its mobile platform is in trouble—like it did with its desktop platform.\nAlso there’s no guarantee that virtual reality will indeed be the next computing platform.']"

That\'s because -- compared to someone using a laptop or desktop computer -- the mobile user is frequently in motion, which can present a problem for someone walking and texting at the same time.\n\n""Due to the visual nature of a text messaging session, such a user often will find it difficult to divide his attention between his device\'s display and his environmental surroundings,"" the application says.\n\n""A user who is walking while participating in a text messaging session may inadvertently collide with or stumble over objects in his path because his attention was focused on his device\'s display instead of the path that he was traversing,"" it points out.\n\n""Even if a user remains stationary while participating in a text messaging session, that user may expose himself to some amount of danger or potential embarrassment if he is so engaged in his device\'s display that he becomes oblivious to changes in his surrounding environment,"" it explains.\n\nAs well meaning as Apple\'s patent application may be, it actually might encourage risky behavior because people would get a false sense of being aware of their environment.\n\n""It\'s just like talking -- your head is somewhere else even though you can see what\'s in front of you,"" Jack Nasar, a city and regional planning professor at Ohio State University and co-author of a study on injuries from distracted walking, told TechNewsWorld.\n\nMyth of Multitasking\n\nEmergency room treatments of mobile-phone related injuries doubled from 2005 to 2010, last summer\'s Ohio State study found. More than two thirds of pedestrians\' emergency room injuries (69 percent) were incurred while talking on a mobile phone, while 9 nine percent occurred while texting.\n\nThat\'s not surprising since fewer people text and walk than talk and walk. However, another behavior also may be influencing the lower injury count.\n\n""If you\'re going to text, you\'re probably going to stop, while with talking everyone walks while doing it,"" Nasar said.\n\nOn its surface, Apple\'s see-through proposal sounds like a good idea, but that may not be the case on closer examination.\n\n""We\'re not capable of doing two things at once,"" Nasar maintained. ""We may rapidly go back and forth between texting and looking. That change could take a second or half a second -- time enough to walk into the street or walk in a hole.""\n\nAmong the injuries Nasar found while studying emergency room visits were a 14-year-old boy who fell off a bridge while talking on his cellphone and a 23-year-old man struck by a car as he wandered into the road while talking on his mobile.\n\nNot a Solution\n\nApple\'s proposed substitution of video for awareness won\'t make texting and walking less risky, contended Lisa Muratori, a clinical associate professor in the department of physical therapy at Stony Brook University and co-author of a study on the effect of cellphone distraction on walking and memory.\n\n""The visual system just doesn\'t work like that.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently building in Mesa, Arizona, known by the name of “Project Cascade,” is already producing sapphire crystal as quickly as possible despite being only partly constructed. What is more, construction at the site is ongoing, and reports indicated today that the Cupertino firm is arranging contracts with construction firms to expand the facility before it is even completed, indicating that sapphire displays are likely to be used in large numbers, possibly for multiple products.\n\nIntriguingly, the expansion is said to be related to a secret project, according to TechnoBuffalo, which would seem to indicate that another major product launch besides that of the iPhone 6 is planned for the near future. This project is clearly not small-scale, since the number of furnaces for creating sapphire boules to be sliced into displays jumped from a previous estimate of 950 to the current planned total of 1,700.\n\nThis represents a near-doubling of capacity, and though some of these furnaces are likely earmarked to make material that will be used for iPhone 6 displays, there is clearly a plenitude of manufacturing capacity on the docket. The partly completed and newly started facilities should all be fully constructed and operational by June. Bids are being requested from local construction firms, and Rosendin Electric and Graybar Electric will apparently be among those companies involved in powering the facility.\n\nTim Cook clearly mentioned the existence of a secret project at the annual shareholders’ meeting last month, but his words were vague enough to leave nothing but a cloud of speculation in their wake. A new size of iPhone (now confirmed as a reality) and the much rumored iWatch are two favorites as the item referred to in Mr. Cook’s statements. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that the “secret” is a true dark horse, something that nobody outside the secretive Apple (AAPL) offices even suspects. Suppressing rumors and leaks about such a project would be a monumental undertaking. Such exotic outliers as a full screen Apple television (iTV?) with a sapphire display or a radical new tablet or notebook design are not wholly out of the question, however.\n\nSome clues about the possible uses of all this new sapphire capacity come from the material itself. Its chief advantage is that it cannot be scratched by steel, making a display fashioned from manufactured sapphire practically scratch-proof. Since the material is expensive to make – even with the money saving economies of scale expected from the Mesa plant – it makes sense to only put it where scratching is likely. This limits use to mobile devices, which may end up in a pocket, purse, or attache case along with other objects that could score their surfaces. A sapphire TV screen seems superfluous, since televisions seldom come in contact with loose change, keyrings, or pocket knives.\n\nRegardless of the exact project planned, Apple (AAPL) clearly needs a lot of sapphire in a hurry. The partly constructed facilities in Mesa are already running at maximum possible capacity using a huge array of portable generators for temporary power. Steve Jobs’ brainchild does not take half measures, and investors will continue to watch developments as a sign of possible opportunities offered in the near future by product releases from the world-famous electronics giant.', 'with a sapphire display or a radical new tablet or notebook design are not wholly out of the question, however.\nSome clues about the possible uses of all this new sapphire capacity come from the material itself.\nIts chief advantage is that it cannot be scratched by steel, making a display fashioned from manufactured sapphire practically scratch-proof.\nRegardless of the exact project planned, Apple (AAPL) clearly needs a lot of sapphire in a hurry.\nThe partly constructed facilities in Mesa are already running at maximum possible capacity using a huge array of portable generators for temporary power.']"

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has been working on touchscreen implementations that utilize sapphire material.\n\nA patent filed by Apple on Sept. 23, 2013, and published on Thursday indicates that the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant has been working on an oleophobic (fingerprint and oil-resistant) coating, on sapphire material, which is rumored to be used for the next-generation iPhone. The sapphire-related patent correlates with Apple's efforts to ramp up sapphire production at its new sapphire manufacturing facility in Mesa, Ariz.\n\nThe patent filed by Apple details a process used to apply a fingerprint-resistant coating to a base layer, such as a single-sapphire crystal.\n\nApple describes the potential for this material in its patent description:\n\n“A surface layer may be formed on the transition layer, with a substantially silica content, for example substantially 100% silica or silica glass, and the surface coating may be oleophobic. A portable electronic device may comprise the coated component, the portable device may include a window, the oleophobic coating may be provided on an exterior surface of the window, and the window may also include a touch screen.”\n\nPhoto: United States Patent and Trademark Office\n\nAnalyst Mark Margolis notes that the particular patent application describes the oleophobic layer application process in a way that could allow for “batch processing” of a solid piece of sapphire instead of applying the fingerprint-resistant layer to individual device screens.\n\nWhile Apple currently uses sapphire for its iPhone 5S camera lens cover and the Touch ID home button, this latest patent filed indicates that Apple is looking to utilize the hard material in larger ways.\n\nEver since Apple announced its manufacturing partnership with GT Advanced Technologies (NASDAQ:GTAT) in Mesa, Ariz., there has been constant speculation surrounding the move. While Apple has been relatively mum about specifics surrounding its partnership with GT, industry-watchers have speculated that Apple may use the Arizona plant to manufacture sapphire screens for a next-generation iPhone, which some have called the iPhone 6.\n\nIn addition to the newly published patent by Apple, a February 2014 public statement by Tom Gutierrez, GT's president and chief executive officer, said, “We expect to return to profitability during the second half of 2014,” correlating with the rumored fall 2014 launch window for the next iPhone.\n\nSapphire material has been highly rumored to be utilized more extensively in the next batch of Apple iOS devices. But some critics, including Gorilla Glass manufacturer Corning Inc. (NYSE:GLW), have deemed the material to be inferior to more traditional smartphone display materials, such as glass. Earlier in March, Corning Senior Vice President Tony Tripeny criticized sapphire as a display material at the Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Media and Telecom Conference:\n\n“When we look at it, we see a lot of disadvantages of sapphire versus Gorilla Glass. It's about 10 times more expensive. It's about 1.6 times heavier. It's environmentally unfriendly. It takes about 100 times more energy to generate a sapphire crystal than it does glass. It transmits less light, which it means either dimmer devices or shorter battery life. It continues to break.”\n\nApple and GT Advanced Technologies appear to be pressing forward with sapphire manufacturing despite the criticism."", ""A patent published by the United States Patent and Trademark Office Thursday confirms that Apple Inc.

As seen above, a large main structure takes up a majority of available space, while parking lots, support structures and various equipment fill in the surrounding area. There is talk that the current site may be extended into an area directly behind Cascade, one person said.According to the most recent public records published by the U.S. International Trade Administration, adjacent parcels of land appear to be vacant and are large enough to replicate the size of Apple\'s existing facility.Although the exact purpose of the second unit is unknown, the build would likely be similar to Cascade\'s building as project planners are said to be fielding bids from existing construction companies and material suppliers. Firms actively working on the project include Rosendin Electric, Wesco Distribution and Graybar Electric, among others.Despite being under construction , the plant is powered by a massive array of temporary generators and is already churning out product.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) patent application, and today is no exception with the Cupertino firm’s new “transparent texting” concept. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published a patent application which describes a way to reduce the chances of someone texting and walking colliding with another person or an object. What is more, the concept could be “realized” simply by tweaking already existing tech with an app, rather than with a completely new device.\n\nThe concept of “transparent texting” involves using an iPhone’s built-in rear-facing camera to continuously stream video to the screen while the user texts. The video would be a real-time image of whatever was in front of the camera, which is also the scene that the texter is walking towards. This would, in effect, make the camera “transparent” except for the texting overlays. A sophisticated app would likely manage the juggling act needed to turn the phone into a “transparent” window onto the user’s forward path via video.\n\nOne major advantage of the idea, of course, is that it utilizes existing hardware, and does not involve the expense and delay involved in developing, testing, manufacturing, and marketing completely new technology to do the job. This patent application is also an interesting example of how innovation can also consist of using something that has already been invented in a completely new, unexpected, and effective way.\n\nThe idea could even have other applications beyond the immediate safety plan – for example, transmitting video of a scene onto special electronic “eyeglasses” of a person who was nearly blind could potentially give them crisp long-range vision.\n\nThe patent application, USPTO Number 20140085334, is boldly and simply titled “Transparent Texting.” It describes the method of using video streamed from the built-in camera to lessen the chance of collisions between a texter and the environment around them. The application was filed on September 26th, 2012, with Apple Inc. (AAPL) as the assignee. Stephen T. Payne of Waterford, Michigan is the inventor of record.\n\nSome issues will still remain even once the idea of “transparent texting” is implemented, of course. The angle at which the iPhone is held will have some impact on how safe a texter will be using it. Those who hold the iPhone at eye level will get a clear view ahead, but if they lean forward to text, then the view will be of the ground close to their feet. Even just gaining a view over the few yards just ahead of the iPhone user’s feet will be an improvement, though, as anyone who has had a texter sprawl catastrophically over their airport luggage can attest.', 'A day seldom passes that does not see at least one intriguing idea aired in an Apple Inc.

One new report claims that Apple will launch the iPhone 6 as early as September and iFanatics are going nuts.\n\niDevice launch events are among the most highly-anticipated and exciting launches for tech fanatics. It seems that as soon as Apple has released a new device, rumors start cropping up about its successor. Indeed, the iPhone 6 rumor mill got started just hours after the launch of the iPhone 5S. The closer we get to prime time, the faster and more accurate the rumors grow.\n\nThe latest reports hint that Apple will launch the iPhone 6 in September and that the company intends to sell 600 million in a very short amount of time. The new report states that both the 4.7 and 5.5-inch versions of the iPhone 6 are expected to debut in September at a huge launch event in California. The September launch date estimate is based upon reports from manufacturers that Touch ID sensors, Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) and other key components are already in production.\n\nIt is entirely possible that Apple will introduce the iPhone 6 in September, as it habitually holds launch events in September. Back in September 2012, Apple released the iPhone 5, its first-ever 4-inch iPhone. It would make perfect sense for Apple to launch the even bigger iPhone 6 around the same time two years later. The recent increase in leaked photos and supposed specifications of the hottest iDevice yet also suggests that a launch date is imminent.\n\nAlthough it seems clear that Apple will most likely release a 4.7 and 5.5-inch version of the iPhone 6, there is some controversy as to whether the two devices will arrive at the same event. Recent reports state that the 5.5-inch phablet-version of the iPhone 6 could arrive at a later date, riding on the coat tails of the smaller, 4.7-inch version.\n\nHowever, knowing Apple's fondness for simplicity, it seems more likely that the company will release both iPhones at the same time just like it did with the iPhone 5S and 5C as well as the iPad Air and iPad Mini with retina display. Apple doesn't like messy follow ups. Apple likes to make big splashes and inspire its audiences.\n\nOverall, recent rumors point to a pretty incredible device. Both versions of the iPhone 6 are widely expected to have displays made of sapphire glass without bezels, Touch ID, the 64-bit 20-nm A8 processor, 10-megapixel camera and iOS 8.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

This hasn’t been confirmed, but a newly discovered patent for an oleophobic coating on sapphire from the company suggests the rumors are correct.\n\nMost telling among all the details is a sketched image of the iPhone in the patent, but the filing also details products like tablets and other similar gadgets.

In describing the need for such game-changing technology, the patent describes the ""rather unique predicament"" of the text message-ers:\n\nA user who is walking while participating in a text messaging session may inadvertently collide with or stumble over objects in his path because his attention was focused on his device\'s display instead of the path that he was traversing. Even if a user remains stationary while participating in a text messaging session, that user may expose himself to some amount of danger or potential embarrassment if he is so engaged in his device\'s display that he becomes oblivious to changes in his surrounding environment.\n\nHow to fix the potentially embarrassing and dangerous problem of being so engrossed in a text that you are completely oblivious to your surroundings? How to ensure that the walking mobile text message participant be allowed to select the correct emoji with the concentration required? This is clearly the only solution.\n\nThe patent applications explains that ""it is common, even if not entirely safe, for a mobile device user to engage in a text messaging session while he is concurrently walking,"" adding that ""such a user often will find it difficult to divide his attention between his device\'s display and his environmental surroundings."" Don\'t worry, avid texters, Apple will save you. It knows how hard it is to deal with environmental surroundings, and it want to make sure that you won\'t have to for much longer. Like, how hard would it be to talk to your best buddy Steve about cows and also notice that tree? It\'s impossible, without the transparent texting technology.\n\nTechCrunch explains that there could be other, less ridiculous uses for the technology:\n\nThe patent goes on to detail potential extensions of the concept of transparent texting — i.e. beyond an iMessage-style texting use-case, including replacing the background of a webpage with a live video feed, so that the text of a website is overlaid over whatever environs the device user is moving through.\n\nAs well as other, equally ridiculous ones:\n\nOr even replacing the static white background of an e-book – so iPhone users on the way to work could keep reading their iBook and not bump into any lampposts.\n\nApple first filed the patent back in 2012, the same year the Associated Press reported that ""reports of injuries to distracted walkers treated at hospital emergency rooms have more than quadrupled in the past seven years and are almost certainly underreported."" According to AppleInsider: it\'s not clear when or Apple will actually be ready to adapt the technology to their phones, but it could be soon.\n\nIt is unknown if Apple is planning to work such a feature into its next iOS build, but the tech required to enable similar functionality is already in place.

It may not be as dangerous as texting while driving , but you could still hurt yourself or someone else. Apple is looking to take the danger out of your preoccupying habit by creating a transparent texting system.\n\nAccording to Apple Insider’s report on the patent application, the system uses an iPhone’s rear-facing camera to capture video and transform the background of an iPhone’s messaging system into a live-feed of the users’ surroundings. Imagine turning on your phone’s camera and then texting on top of the live display and you have the basic idea.\n\nOf course, since oncoming cars, people, bikes, birds, and runaway pianos don’t usually pop out of the ground directly at your feet, users would have to point the phone upright and straight ahead to ensure full visibility\n\nThe camera can continuously capture and present the video images as the background in the text messaging session, so that the device’s user continuously can be aware of the environment beyond the device’s display while still focusing on the text messages being communicated. The background within the text messaging session can continuously be a live and current video image of the view seen by the camera at any given moment. Consequently, the device’s user is less likely to collide with or stumble over an object while participating in a text messaging session.\n\nTo activate the system users would simply select an in-app button to transform the regular white background into a live video.\n\nThe company says the system could also be used with other Apple apps like iBooks.\n\nWhile we see the benefit of a transparent background, is it really necessary?\n\nSure that message might seem important, but if it were truly urgent wouldn’t you actually be talking on the phone? And in that case, you could actively watch where you’re walking.\n\nAnd what about when you’re crossing the street? A car could be coming to your right, but the live feed would only show what’s directly ahead of you.\n\nWouldn’t it be more reasonable, and safer, to just put your phone down for a few minutes and get where you’re going?\n\nIt’s unclear when the new system will be available, but Apple Insider says the invention proves the company is looking for new ways to enhance the mobile experience….by taking over every waking moment of our lives.\n\nApple’s ‘transparent texting’ tech lets iPhone users safely message while moving [Apple Insider]', 'Apple is looking to take the danger out of your preoccupying habit by creating a transparent texting system.\nThe background within the text messaging session can continuously be a live and current video image of the view seen by the camera at any given moment.\nConsequently, the device’s user is less likely to collide with or stumble over an object while participating in a text messaging session.\nTo activate the system users would simply select an in-app button to transform the regular white background into a live video.\nApple’s ‘transparent texting’ tech lets iPhone users safely message while moving [Apple Insider]']"

The patent in question covers a new method for applying an oleophobic coating on the already scratch and break-resistant material.\n\nOleophobic, for those wondering, is simply a fancy term for a coating that resists smudging and reduces the presence of oily fingerprints. Apple currently applies an oleophobic layer to the standard glass displays on current iPhone and iPad models along with a hydrophobic coating for added protection against water (the new sapphire patent briefly mentions hydrophobic protection, as well).\n\nThe method with which Apple plans to apply fingerprint protection to sapphire crystal display glass varies substantially from current procedures. Sparing the details, the process allows for the coating to be applied in bulk before the displays are cut to size. Currently, a coating must be applied individually to each pre-cut screen.\n\nIt’s fair to say that it is no longer a question of if Apple will introduce sapphire displays but only when.

The the new application describes how an oleophobic (oil-repelling) coating might be added to sapphire glass to make it smudge and fingerprint-resistant. So far, we’ve seen most of the evidence around Apple’s sapphire display plans come from its partnerships with third-party manufacturers, but this is a fairly direct admission it’s working on that kind of tech.\n\nIt’s more straightforward because Apple directly refers to using the coating on device displays including those for phones, tablets and other mobile hardware. Oleophobic coatings currently figure in Apple’s device, preventing the all-glass touchscreens from accruing too much in the way of grime from being constantly poked with your grubby fingers. Apple first debuted the tech in the iPhone 3GS, and has used it pretty much ever since.\n\nThe issue is that using the same technique that makes it work with Gorilla Glass doesn’t necessarily work with sapphire. Apple’s patent details how standard treatments also break down quicker when used with sapphire, as it has found through testing. Apple proposes some workarounds from this, including a method by which a sandwich layer of Gorilla Glass-like material is used on top of the sapphire base layer to make sure the coating sticks.\n\nThis is a relatively recent patent, originally filed for in September of last year, so it’s a good indicator that Apple got serious about working out the specifics around building sapphire displays around that time. Corning has already preemptively gone on the defensive, suggesting that sapphire would have weaknesses compared to its own Gorilla Glass solution, but Apple’s partnership with GT Advanced for a $578 million sapphire production facility is another strong indicator the next iPhone (or the one after that) could use a new material for its touchscreen display.', 'Apple has filed for a patent (via AppleInsider) that adds further fuel to the fire around the possibility it will use sapphire glass for future device displays.\nThe the new application describes how an oleophobic (oil-repelling) coating might be added to sapphire glass to make it smudge and fingerprint-resistant.\nIt’s more straightforward because Apple directly refers to using the coating on device displays including those for phones, tablets and other mobile hardware.\nThe issue is that using the same technique that makes it work with Gorilla Glass doesn’t necessarily work with sapphire.\nApple’s patent details how standard treatments also break down quicker when used with sapphire, as it has found through testing.']"

In a Facebook post, Zuckerberg said, “Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face — just by putting on goggles in your home.”\n\nHe then added that, “This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.” Sounds exciting, huh? Of course it does. But the problem is that with Oculus — as well as WhatsApp — Zuckerberg’s not only pulling out his wallet, but also a boatload of stock.\n\nIn a five week span, Facebook has announced plans to spend up to $21.3 billion, including $19 billion for WhatsApp and $2.3 billion for Oculus. Investors have continuously argued the meaning of these two acquisitions, as most note that while WhatsApp may have 465 million monthly active users (MAUs), it earned just $20 million last year. However, the bigger deal — rather than speculating on what these companies may or may not become — is the amount of stock that Zuckerberg has used to purchase these companies.\n\nAt the end of 2013, Facebook had $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, but combined is spending $4.4 billion of that cash on WhatsApp and Oculus. The remaining $16.9 billion will be paid in common stock and restricted shares. With that said, WhatsApp payout will be given over a period of four years, although an undisclosed bulk will be paid upfront.\n\nFacebook still has over $7 billion in cash after all payouts and with an operating margin of 37 percent, the company accumulates cash quickly. Also, it’s worth noting that debt remains cheap, and with $17.9 billion in assets and just $2.4 billion in total liabilities, Facebook could easily finance debt. This essentially tells investors that Zuckerberg and company believe that Facebook’s stock is overpriced, and gives them the most bang for the buck in terms of acquisitions.\n\nToday, $16.9 billion is nearly 11 percent of Facebook’s market capitalization, and conveniently, since the acquisition of WhatsApp was made public, shares of Facebook have fallen approximately 11 percent. Now, while this decline may have little to do with the use of shares to acquire, it’s possible if not likely that other investors, including at the institutional level, notice the way in which Zuckerberg is using the company’s stock to make acquisitions.\n\nIf you are an investor in Facebook, you must remember that $21.3 billion is a lot of money, and one way or another, it’s going to be felt when spent. In this particular case, it appears that Facebook’s stock will be the victim, and given Zuckerberg’s recent track record, don’t be surprised if the multi-billion dollar stock spree doesn’t stop. In that event, Facebook shares might continue to fall.\n\nMore From Wall St. Cheat Sheet:', 'Mark Zuckerberg seems excited about Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) acquisition of Oculus.\nIn a five week span, Facebook has announced plans to spend up to $21.3 billion, including $19 billion for WhatsApp and $2.3 billion for Oculus.\nThis essentially tells investors that Zuckerberg and company believe that Facebook’s stock is overpriced, and gives them the most bang for the buck in terms of acquisitions.\nIn this particular case, it appears that Facebook’s stock will be the victim, and given Zuckerberg’s recent track record, don’t be surprised if the multi-billion dollar stock spree doesn’t stop.\nIn that event, Facebook shares might continue to fall.']"

LOL!"" that everyone raced to wryly observe first. Plus the fact that legendary PC coder and unmitigated brainbox John Carmack is now a humble Facebook employee caused many simple people some low levels of mirth.\n\nThese jokes were even funnier when they were repeated the next day, becoming funnier still by the third day.\n\nBut mostly there was anger. Anger about Kickstarter being used to kickstart a $2bn business, anger at Facebook chucking its money around again and anger that the promising VR tech may eventually be used as little more than a new way to get your mum to click on adverts for discounted last-minute cruises around the Norwegian fjords.\n\nWorst thing ever, for the next 18 hours at least\n\nThose writing beneath a Valleywag piece suggested Facebook was the ""worst possible partner"" for the VR firm, fury was vented by those who saw Oculus using Kickstarter as a method of not only building a project, but building a company worth $2bn in a couple of years.\n\nThis was accurately nutshelled by commenter I\'m Here Mostly for the Chicks, who said: ""At this point it\'s safe to assume Kickstarter in its entirety is for suckers. Maybe the first few months it was a good outlet for homebrew ideas, but all you\'re doing now is subsidising corporations so they don\'t have to take risks.""\n\nReader Greensky was a little more generous about his criticism of the deal, suggesting: ""Kickstarter has led people to believe that they\'re investing in an independent company. That their contributions are vital in allowing them to get off the ground and to forge their own way. Oculus proves that there can also be Kickstarters whose sole goal is to become popular enough to sell. Which isn\'t wrong per se, but it\'s also not the nice heart-warming underdog story that most Kickstarters use to get more backers.""\n\nImagine a screen strapped to a human face - forever\n\nOn a more aggressively negative vibe was Economist reader Guest Sensation, who said: ""The very last thing humanity needs is a life sucking screen strapped to its face. What a shame people are embracing this technological \'advancement\'. Bye bye family time, hello 3D porn, virtual worlds to waste your life in, and mass media control. Disgusting.""\n\nThere\'s 3D porn? *Writes cheque for $2.5bn, phones bank to arrange overdraft facility*\n\nThis is all a sign that Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg has gone bonkers and is currently on a cash-fuelled spree he\'ll eventually come to regret, according to Pondbridge72, who raged: ""Paying twice the market price for Instagram and then WhatsApp was one thing. But this latest digression into geek hardware while alienating the very gamers necessary for Oculus to succeed is ham-fisted at best. Florid 5 and 10 year visions disguise an I-know-better-than-the-market intellectual arrogance and inability/unwillingness to take counsel from others.""\n\nJust looked up what ""florid"" means. It\'s a real word. It means ""excessively intricate or elaborate."" Nice one, Pondbridge, teaching people about online fury and English at the same time.\n\nSTR agreed and was baffled by the decision, eventually concluding: ""This is a case study in why no investor should trust their money with a company who has a 29 year old with sole majority control.""\n\nBillions of ideas\n\nBut not everyone\'s entirely negative about the sale. $2bn is a lot of money, and Register reader Stu is fantasising about how it might be spent by the newly loaded Oculus team, dreaming: ""Well I\'ve pre-ordered DK2, and am thinking of cancelling, but I\'m coming to realise that Facebook have injected a serious cash flow into Oculus, hence would have a lot more clout in the HW market to demand the screens and other tech they want - specifically it would benefit from curved OLED, ultra resolution, very low latency, and very low persistence.""\n\nStu then suggests creating a throwaway Facebook profile to use solely for Oculus (and perhaps Tinder at the weekends), although he adds: ""Adverts, well if that happens then I\'m out!""\n\n2,000,000,000 dislikes\n\nBeneath a Guardian piece entirely structured around how bad an idea it all seems, comment turned to whether or not Kickstarter backers ought to get a cut of the $2bn, seeing as they are, in some small way, the original venture capitalists that set Oculus on its way to financial stardom.\n\nReader Unpleasantmilk contributed the observation that: ""People put money into it, to help the company build. Now that company has been sold for billions, why shouldn\'t those who helped make it so, profit? This leaves a bad taste, but that is no surprise if *uckerburg is involved.""\n\nAnd ChrisKS wasn\'t happy with Oculus either, raging: ""Oculus did exactly the opposite of what Kickstarter is used for, and didn\'t actually do what their stated aims were. Look at their Kickstarter campaign and you\'ll see that the support was generated by promises of open-sourcing and prototypes being built to facilitate/accelerate games development.""\n\n""It was NOT supposed to be their engine for personal enrichment, but that\'s what they used all that money for,"" he finished with, probably hitting the keyboard really hard and with a satisfied flourish on that final full stop.\n\nFinally, Facebook\'s flaw of letting the most thumbed-up comments float up to the top of response threads meant Zuckerberg\'s own announcement of the Oculus deal was instantly hammered by negativity, with Dave Woodruff rising to internet fame with his 1,000+ liked satirical comment: ""I\'m excited to announce we can\'t innovate but we can buy other companies.""', 'Plus the fact that legendary PC coder and unmitigated brainbox John Carmack is now a humble Facebook employee caused many simple people some low levels of mirth.\nThese jokes were even funnier when they were repeated the next day, becoming funnier still by the third day.\nOculus proves that there can also be Kickstarters whose sole goal is to become popular enough to sell.\nBut this latest digression into geek hardware while alienating the very gamers necessary for Oculus to succeed is ham-fisted at best.\nAnd ChrisKS wasn\'t happy with Oculus either, raging: ""Oculus did exactly the opposite of what Kickstarter is used for, and didn\'t actually do what their stated aims were.']"

All Oculus has managed to do is put out a prototype virtual-reality headset.""\n\nKay, who tried the headset at a tech show last year, described the experience as ""rather disorienting Š I had to remove the goggles fairly quickly to get rid of the nausea they caused.""\n\nEven if the product comes on the market, Kay pointed out, ""Facebook has no experience in hardware manufacture, distribution, and service. This is a company that you can’t reach by telephone.""\n\nAs a techno-skeptic who avoids Facebook and other so-called social media, I rather enjoyed this takedown of ""Zuck,"" as Kay calls him. All the more so after encountering a published description of Facebook’s view of the future as ""a 3-D virtual world where you feel as if you are hanging out with your friends rather than staring at their pictures.""\n\nNever mind the obsolete idea of actual telephonic or even face-to-face communication. That’s so last century!\n\nOf course, there’s always a ""rest of the story,"" so in deference to Zuckerberg, widely celebrated as a visionary and a financial whiz for creating an online behemoth with 1.2 billion users worldwide, here’s his take.\n\nOculus, he has stated, is ""a long-term bet on the future of computing Š a chance to create the most social platform ever and change the way we work, play and communicate.""\n\nEven though Oculus’s headset is considered a highly specialized technology for hard-core video games, Zuckerberg outlined his vision in a post, where else, on Facebook: ""Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face to face -- just by putting on goggles in your home.""\n\nArticle Continues After These Ads\n\nMaybe he’s trying to out-goggle Google, whose high-tech Glass eyewear projects maps and other data on a transparent lens in front of people’s field of vision -- presumably, it’s transparent so users can walk down the street without a risk of collision.\n\nKay is not an outlier in questioning the rationality of Zuckerberg’s futuristic fantasy -- other analysts have opined that virtual reality is mainly a preoccupation of gamers.\n\nOculus’s developers disagree as they tout the motion sensors in their headset that shift the wearer’s screen view so he or she feels like an active participant in a virtual world.\n\nAs Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus, told reporters: ""If you can see somebody else, and your brain believes they’re right in front of you, you get goosebumps. You start to realize how big this could be."" He envisions users socializing at online parties.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters, Zuckerberg trotted out statistics showing that gaming occupies 40 percent of the time people spend online, with social communication taking up another 40 percent.\n\nThrough Oculus, he suggested, ""people will build a model of a place far away and you’ll go see it. It’s like teleporting.""\n\nIt can be argued that since Facebook has a market value of $184 billion, based on its current stock price, a $2 billion investment is minuscule. Young users have been drifting away from Zuckerberg’s creation in favor of newfangled apps, so it’s understandable that he wants his company to take seemingly wild, long-shot chances.\n\nBut it says something about the future we all share when our supposedly most creative, forward-thinking innovators seem intent on helping shape a world where more, perhaps most, of our socializing will be virtual, or make-believe, rather than actual.\n\nDown the rabbit hole into a wonderland we go. ""How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another,"" said Alice. Lewis Carroll was really on to something when he wrote that Š in 1865.\n\nTo contact Clarence Fanto:cfanto@yahoo.com', 'Clarence Fanto: Zuckerberg\'s investment virtual error?\nEven if the product comes on the market, Kay pointed out, ""Facebook has no experience in hardware manufacture, distribution, and service.\nKay is not an outlier in questioning the rationality of Zuckerberg’s futuristic fantasy -- other analysts have opined that virtual reality is mainly a preoccupation of gamers.\nThrough Oculus, he suggested, ""people will build a model of a place far away and you’ll go see it.\nIt can be argued that since Facebook has a market value of $184 billion, based on its current stock price, a $2 billion investment is minuscule.']"

The purchase of Oculus is perhaps a phenomenon because the company only unveiled its VR component in 2012 via Kickstarter.\n\nOculus VR is the maker of virtual reality hardware; one can still buy the Oculus Rift, but they are sold as software development kits, so you need to have some kind of technical know-how to operate it, the NBC News reported. The Oculus Rift is one of the most advanced VR headsets on the market, and perhaps VR technology is getting a boost. Other companies who have similar VR systems have recently had an increased interest, Bloomberg mobile reported.\n\nThe Oculus Rift headset uses displays set over the eyes, and motion-tracking technology to immerse users in a 3D computer-generated environment. In other words, one can really kick butt in a game of Doom. Others have spied similar VR opportunities. Sony recently unveiled a prototype VR headset for its PlayStation 4 game console, and Microsoft is rumored to be developing one for its Xbox console, The Economist reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Google is concentrating on spending money on futuristic projects such as, its secretive Google X lab. And perhaps it wants Glass to be more mass produced; Google stated this week that Luxottica, a seller of high-end eye wear, would help to make them look nicer. Google's vision of the future is to augment the real world seen through its Glass with a visual feed from its search engine and other services, The Economist reported.\n\nForbes presented an alternative perspective for Facebook's Virtual Reality (VR), and Google's augmented reality. With Facebook's acquisition of Oculus, it can advance its own VR capabilities; in other words, Facebook virtually allows you to communicate and travel with friends, family, and make new friends from thousands of miles away or from next door. With Oculus, it will allow us to do things we cannot by making it seem more real.\n\nOn the other hand, Google wants us to do things we cannot by expanding our capabilities. Reality for Google has been great; it has been in line with everything since its inception: searching as fast as you can effectively and efficiently, with little interruption to your life.\n\nGoogle has made reality a little easier, the Oculus Rift could present a virtual world where you do not have to take a plane, or boat in order to visit another country.\n\nFacebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that immersing gaming with Oculus will be the first experience.

There are some that say the move will help Facebook and take Oculus VR to the next level, while others claim it’ll ruin the company.\n\nBut I’m here to tell you that, quite honestly, none of it matters.\n\nI think it’s high time we take a look back at the history of virtual reality. For decades, we’ve been hearing from companies that virtual reality is the next big thing. And for decades, that has never proven true. With each new company offering virtual reality, something new is promised, and nothing actually makes it to the mainstream.\n\nLook no further than the Virtual Boy for the epitome of what the virtual reality market is all about. A technology comes along that woos us, makes us think about Sci-Fi movies, and then dies as quickly as it comes along.\n\nThe internet is Not Happy about Facebook buying Oculus\n\nOculus VR’s Oculus Rift was undoubtedly an interesting product with some promise. But like so many technologies that came before it, the offering appealed only to a very small section of the gaming market, and there was no guarantee that the startup over the long-term could actually do something that could get the mainstream to play ball.\n\nKudos, then, to the company’s co-founders for bailing now and making boatloads of cash. It was a much better move than waiting for the business to fail.\n\nI can’t say for sure why virtual reality doesn’t work out. Perhaps it’s that the technology is too advanced and takes too long to develop, or perhaps it’s the kind of technology that appeals only to the geeks out there and not the average consumer looking for a product that can enhance their lives.\n\nSee, virtual reality is a solitary exploit. You put something on your face and you’re theoretically sent to another place to immerse yourself in that environment. But today’s consumers wants to be a part of the broader community and they like having products that help them achieve that goal. The Oculus VR, like other virtual-reality technologies, doesn’t do that.\n\nAs for Facebook? I think the social network is the real loser here. I think Zuckerberg, like Google with its Nest home-automation buy, is trying to figure out what the next frontier is in tech and pulled the trigger a bit too soon on Oculus VR.\n\nSure, the technology could put us into a different place with other Oculus owners and thus improve the “social” side of Facebook, but do you really see anyone actually doing that?\n\nFacebook and Oculus might be a great thing, really\n\nAs a full-fledged geek, I love the idea of virtual reality overtaking our lives. But as someone who has watched this industry for a very long time, a modicum of reality always seeps in. And the reality in this situation is that virtual reality still isn’t ready for primetime. Before long, Oculus VR will be another company with promise that we forgot all about.\n\nSorry, but I don’t see why there’s so much concern over this buy – in a few short months, it won’t matter at all.', 'Why the Oculus VR buy really doesn’t matterNearly everywhere I turn, I see opinions across the spectrum on Facebook’s recent decision to acquire Oculus VR for $2 billion.\nLook no further than the Virtual Boy for the epitome of what the virtual reality market is all about.\nI can’t say for sure why virtual reality doesn’t work out.\nThe Oculus VR, like other virtual-reality technologies, doesn’t do that.\nBefore long, Oculus VR will be another company with promise that we forgot all about.']"

In fact, early backers of Oculus VR are supremely irate with CEO and founder Palmer Luckey. They say that Facebook will destroy the Oculus vision for VR. They say that Facebook will mine all their data and harass them with advertisements. And they are probably right.\n\nFacebook has a bad reputation in the tech world for taking people\'s data and turning it into cold hard cash - with or without their expressed permission. Facebook is known to buy companies, games and services and then force users to log in to Facebook to accomplish any task. Facebook tends to advertise first and think about its users second. Most of all, Facebook likes to have control.\n\nThese are things we know, or think we know, about Facebook. Are they true? Kinda-sorta-maybe. Facebook typically comes off as the bad guy, but is it really? A lot of tech pundits aren\'t so sure and neither is Luckey.\n\nYeah, Facebook steals your data and uses it to harangue you with advertisements, but its CEO Mark Zuckerberg also stood up to the government and demanded a roll back of NSA surveillance. Facebook also picked out a few diamonds in the rough with the hope of polishing them and catapulting them to success (here\'s looking at you, WhatsApp and Oculus VR).\n\nLuckey has been devoting every spare moment to convincing fans of Oculus Rift that selling his company to Facebook does not mean selling out. He promised the Oculus fan base that the company will focus on games, even if it expands to other areas as well. He promised the games will stay open and praised Facebook\'s commitment to open source ventures. He told gamers that not only will Facebook\'s help make Oculus Rift cheaper, it will make the company\'s VR gaming capabilities grow faster.\n\n""Oculus continues to operate independently! We are going to remain as indie/developer/enthusiast friendly as we have always been, if not more so,"" Palmer wrote, adding that, ""I guarantee that you won\'t need to log into your Facebook account every time you wanna use the Oculus Rift.""\n\nHe also told Oculus Rift users that now that the two companies have joined forces, ""we can make custom hardware, not rely on the scraps of the mobile phone industry. That is insanely expensive, think hundreds of millions of dollars."" He also claimed that, ""If anything, our hardware and software will get even more open, and Facebook is onboard with that.""\n\nLuckey seems determined to keep these promises to the Oculus community, but they don\'t believe him. Early supporters of Oculus backed the company when it was just a kid with a great idea for VR gaming. The Kickstarter community believed in his vision and Luckey quickly grew his idea into an influential company with a huge fan base. The appeal of Oculus VR lay in its open, free spirit approach. Now that Luckey agreed to sell Oculus to Facebook, that allure and promise is gone.\n\nEven if Facebook doesn\'t bombard Oculus Rift with ads, require a login or manipulate user data for its own purposes at first, the worry is that after a time, it will. The same concerns about privacy and data mining for advertisements surfaced shortly after Facebook\'s purchase of WhatsApp. WhatsApp users don\'t trust Facebook either - it seems that no one does.\n\nThis could be Facebook\'s chance to turn the tables and shock everyone by doing the right thing: letting WhatsApp and Oculus VR do what they do best - their way.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

If you haven't noticed, Minecraft is all the rage with the kids these days.\n\nSupposedly, this Oculus VR is one hot technology -- so hot that the creator of Minecraft got serious about it before deciding, in a fit of Facebook-pique, that he was no longer going to create a version of Minecraft for the technology, because, and I quote: “Facebook creeps me out.”\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nIn essence, that's exactly why Facebook bought Oculus VR -- because it's all the rage, not among 10-year-olds, but among the hoodie-wearing set. Is it an allegedly cool technology that makes people look irredeemably goofy? Why… yes! But will it make Facebook a lot of money? Who the hell knows?\n\nIt actually doesn't matter, because increasingly, Facebook's business model is about fashion, and since no one knows what will be fashionable in tech even a year from now, it is buying up all it can, as long as it is still sitting on a pile of cash and has a $58 billion market cap. Why worry about silly little things like the rapid decline in advertisers' organic reach on the platform when there are so many bright, shiny objects to buy?\n\nThe truth is, however, that Facebook is right to be concerned about staying on the cusp of fashion despite this columnist's cracks about shoeboxes. While there is no immediate crisis, Zuckerberg & Co. should be haunted by the specter of decline that has faced nearly every hot tech company of the last 20 years, with only two notable exceptions: Apple and Google. Both Apple (market cap: $479 billion) and Google (market cap: $376 billion) have the stable, proven revenue streams and gargantuan sums of money required to be on a tech-buying spree. In fact, in terms of revenue and market cap, either has the ability to make Facebook look like an also-ran.\n\nAnd Facebook knows this, and probably knows that its advertising model may never have the staying power of either of those companies. This means that in terms of acquiring hot new companies, in many cases, Facebook is going to have to act fast. Buying up a promising -- but nascent -- virtual reality company is a perfect example of this tactic.\n\nYes, you can make the case that virtual reality makes more sense strategically for Facebook than for Apple or Google, because lately people have this annoying tendency to never want to hang out with each other in the physical world. And you'd have a point. The same goes for something like WhatsApp, the communications platform that Facebook bought earlier this year for a mere $19 billion.\n\nBut in doing so, you'd also be making the case that both acquisitions were extremely strategic, when in fact they aren't. WhatsApp's founders, famously, hate advertising. And virtual reality? It's impossible to know what sort of revenue-generator Oculus will be, or if it will even end up being a player in the virtual reality arms race.\n\nSo ultimately, what these acquisitions are about is placing bets, with Facebook not being a social network so much as it is a v.c.

He’s done marketing for Twilio, Asana, and Salesforce and blogs about marketing, growth, and storytelling at Threadling.\n\nThere are many people out there who take a pessimistic view of Facebook. To them, Mark Zuckerberg is a huckster, out to sell us the snake oils of distraction and dopamine in exchange for our eyeballs and personal data.\n\nI take the more optimistic view.\n\nI do not believe Zuckerberg is building Facebook to offer the world’s advertisers a better way to target humanity with ads. No, giving advertisers this vaguely sinister power is just a means to an end — a way to create billions of dollars of value on the current Internet while bridging the gap to the Internet of the future.\n\nIn my mind, the future Facebook in Zuckerberg’s imagining is much grander, bolder and more futuristic. And what is that futuristic end? It has a lot to do with the Oculus Rift. Before I explain why, let’s talk about the metaverse.\n\nThe metaverse?\n\nIn the seminal piece of literary sci-fi that is Snow Crash, the author Neal Stephenson imagines a metaverse — a virtual reality world into which the technologists of a collapsed, balkanized America project their avatars.\n\nAt the genesis of Stephenson’s virtual reality world (explained briefly in the book), the avatars started off as low-fidelity versions of the people behind them. But as the technology progressed, they became more and more representative and life-like, until the avatars reached the point that they were essentially digital replicas of their owners, projected into the cyber realm.\n\nIn Neal Stephenson’s near-futuristic America, this metaverse was made possible by some wearable technology and a virtual reality headset.\n\nThe piece he missed was Facebook.\n\nHow Facebook can help us project ourselves into virtual reality\n\nIn one potential future, the identities we project into the metaverse will be fuzzy or even obscured. Here, our avatars will have little or nothing in common with our actual selves in the real world. They will range from pseudonymous constructions to total fantasies, like the socially-awkward straight male who plays the female dark elf seductress when he enters cyberspace.\n\nIn another potential future, the avatars we project into the metaverse will much more closely mirror our actual selves. They will look like us, move like us, reflect our personal mannerisms, and so on. When we socialize in this virtual reality, we will be among friends, just from anywhere in the world with high-speed bandwidth, at anytime we choose.\n\nWhile it’s entirely possible (even likely) that both of these scenarios will co-exist, the latter future (where we project our real identities) will require some kind of authentic digital identity service that verifies that we are who we say we are, knows who we are friends with, and understands what we like and what we have in common with everyone else.\n\nIn other words, it will require something a lot like Facebook.\n\nSocial, local, and virtual\n\nFor all the hype (some deserved, some inflated) around the intersection of social, local and mobile, that trend will have nothing like the world-changing power at the intersection of social networks and virtual reality.\n\nAfter the gaming industry has worked out the VR interface kinks (there are a lot) and figured out how to develop credible, fully immersive experiences in a virtual world, it will be time to create something far more profound: the feeling of being “present” with your friends, colleagues and interesting strangers in virtual space.\n\nVirtual reality will be compelling because it will be free-form in ways actual reality can never be. Want to fly around the buildings of San Francisco with your girlfriend? No problem. The Grand Canyon? Sure. Want to have that board meeting in the world’s fanciest boardroom? How about a tropical beach instead?\n\nIt gets pretty deep.\n\nWhy Facebook spent $2 billion for Oculus VR\n\nFacebook was late to the mobile game. Indeed, Facebook’s inability to control the platforms it relies on for mobile reach (Android and iOS) presents one of the biggest risks to its medium-term success.\n\nThis threat is the major reason that Facebook built Facebook Home: to do an end-run around Google and slowly-but-surely command the flow of attention and traffic on tons of Android devices.\n\nHome hasn’t panned out.\n\nBut Zuckerberg is a visionary. He knows that smartphones and tablets are not the only interfaces of the future, and he’ll be damned if he misses the next boat.\n\nIf you haven’t experienced the feeling of presence in virtual reality, or can’t imagine what the implications of that feeling are, it’s easy to believe that virtual reality isn’t that next boat, that VR is just a bunch of techno-nonsense hype.\n\nBut it’s not. Feeling present in virtual reality–your mind believing it is there–is unlike anything else, and that feeling will change the world in all sorts of crazy ways.\n\nAs Michael Abrash of Valve points out, the display technology and processing power necessary to create the feeling of presence in VR is already here, and, though the Oculus Rift has a long way to go, it’s as close as anyone has got.\n\nWith Facebook’s money behind it, Oculus VR’s team will (likely) be able to nail their product faster and have an easier time bringing it to market at scale.\n\nAs Zuckerberg has promised, Oculus VR will start by revolutionizing games. But not too long after that, it will revolutionize digital social interaction, and after that, the world.\n\nFor all of this, $2 billion dollars for control of a virtual reality platform looks like a steal.', 'Facebook Bought Oculus VR To Create The Metaverse, Or Why Angry Kickstarter Backers Need To ChillEditor’s note: Dan Kaplan helps startups tell their stories.\nIn my mind, the future Facebook in Zuckerberg’s imagining is much grander, bolder and more futuristic.\nAt the genesis of Stephenson’s virtual reality world (explained briefly in the book), the avatars started off as low-fidelity versions of the people behind them.\nAs Zuckerberg has promised, Oculus VR will start by revolutionizing games.\nFor all of this, $2 billion dollars for control of a virtual reality platform looks like a steal.']"

One game that will go down in the books of gaming history and shape what\'s yet to come. A game that promises to have huge (wait for it) ram-ifications.\n\nWe don\'t want to speak too soon but we\'re pretty sure that game is Goat Simulator.\n\nAnd this week the hype train shifted up a gear as we were treated to this brand new trailer - a big wink to the famed Dead Island teaser. The game will be available for Windows on April 1 via Steam, and right now it has all the promises of a cult classic.\n\nIn case you\'re not already familiar with the concept, the aim of the game is to destroy things by head-butting them, thus earning yourself points. But a finely-tuned, narrative-driven game this is not. Goat Simulator is broken, silly, and very, very strange. Headbutt-a-gas-station-to-get-a-Michael-Bay-achievement strange.\n\nAlmighty goat of all that is goaty, we surrender ourselves to your sacred bovid-ness.\n\nGoats not your thing? (weirdo) Then have we got the alternative animal simulator for you.\n\nCausing a Rift\n\nA slightly less goaty, but equally important event also took place this week. You might have heard about it: it involved a kickstart project, a social network, and the collective sound of every gamer\'s dreams shattering in unison.\n\nThat might be a tad dramatic but it was still a pretty big deal nonetheless.\n\nYes, we\'re talking about the news that Facebook will acquire Oculus Rift in one of the most unexpected tech land grabs that we can recall.\n\nThe startup tipped to be the saviour of VR has just been swallowed by a global conglomerate - it was never going to go down well with the gamers.\n\nAnd sure enough, the internet responded with vitriol, with a number of people going so far as to demand their money back.\n\nYou can understand why people are questioning this move: Facebook isn\'t a gaming company, so does it really care about immersive gaming technology? It\'s certainly made no secret of the fact it plans to extend VR well beyond that remit and into \'social VR\'.\n\nBut the move will obviously be beneficial to Oculus; it now has more resources to pump into its project and should be able to get it out of the door faster than originally anticipated.\n\nThat is, if Facebook doesn\'t choose to meddle too much. Oculus has done this deal before we\'ve even seen a market product so the widespread concern is understandable. We just have to cross our fingers that work on the Oculus project continues to push ahead mostly independently, and that Palmer Luckey and his team haven\'t forgotten that while VR will undoubtedly bring awesomeness to so many other remits, gaming needs to stay the priority.\n\nBatman\'s ride has got a bit of the Nolan factor to it\n\nThe Dark Knight returns\n\nAs both Zack Snyder\'s Batman vs Superman movie and Warner Bros\' Gotham TV series begin to come together, we\'re preparing ourselves for a post-Nolan Batverse. And what better way to ease us in than Rocksteady Studios\' next (and final) Batman outing?\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight arrives later this year, and we got to chat to Rocksteady about bringing the Arkham series to a thrilling conclusion. Of course, it\'s the drivable Batmobile that we wanted to know most about.\n\nRocksteady\'s Gaz Deaves summed it up nicely: ""We wanted to build this big, open Gotham… and smash it up"".\n\nThat was all we needed to hear - we might as well have handed over our wallets right then and left the room - but we stuck around to talk a bit more about how the next-gen Batman is shaping up.

Like another famous face on the rich list he also strides about in thongs and dropped out of school before he could get a degree.

Karp, who lives in New York City and was born on the Upper West Side, is worth an estimated $200 million (A$215 million), according to Forbes. Like Luckey, Karp was home-schooled and never graduated college.\n\nAndrew Mason, the 33-year-old founder and former CEO of Groupon, saw his net worth soar to over $1 billion (A$1.07 billion) when his digital coupon company went public in 2011. He was just 30 years old. Groupon’s stock has since lost more than two-thirds of its value and Mason stepped down as CEO last year. Still, he’s worth an estimated $200 million (A$215 million). Mason graduated college, but he dropped out of the prestigious University of Chicago one month into his graduate program.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is the 29-year-old Facebook founder and CEO — and the 21st richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $28.5 billion (A$30.6 billion). He dropped out of Harvard to work on Facebook, which was valued at more than $100 billion (A$107 million) when it went public last year. Zuckerberg’s early days with Facebook have already been well chronicled in the award-winning movie “The Social Network.” Of course, it wasn’t all roses. The hoodie-wearing CEO had a bitter legal battle over claims he stole the idea for Facebook from some of his Harvard colleagues.\n\nBlake Ross, the 28-year-old co-founder of web browser Firefox, is worth $150 million (A$160 million), according to Forbes.

66636,http://venturebeat.com/2014/03/28/this-oculus-rift-competitor-will-work-on-playstation-4-xbox-one-and-pc/,technology,"['More than seven years ago, a Canadian hardware firm teased a virtual-reality headset for Xbox 360. It has now resurfaced just days after Facebook acquired the leader in VR.\n\nThe company is True Player Gear, and its virtual-reality headset looks a lot like the competition from Oculus VR and Sony. The unnamed device straps to a player’s face and presents them with a 1080p OLED display that takes up a 90-degree field of view. It will also work with Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and Mac, according to True Player Gear president Bertrand Nepveu. The Montreal-based technology company first teased its VR unit during the 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo, but it never emerged as a consumer product. Now that Facebook has dropped $2 billion to purchase Oculus VR — makers of the Oculus Rift VR helmet — True Player Gear is back on the scene to talk about all of the things its hardware can do.\n\nThe device, which does not yet have a price or a release date, separates itself from the Rift and Project Morpheus by working with more than one platform as well as by supporting older games not optimized for VR. Additionally, the head-mounted display has its own lenses that players can adjust so that they don’t need to wear their glasses or contacts, and this also makes text in games more visible.\n\n“Yes, it is happening,” Nepveu told GamesBeat. “We finally have all the technologies we need.”\n\nThe True Player Gear boss told us that he has had talks with Microsoft and Sony about getting software support on their devices, but it isn’t necessary thanks to its ability to function with existing software.\n\n“Our system is based on emulated controls,” he said. “We emulate the thumbstick for headtracking.”\n\nYou’re probably already feeling motion sick at the thought of VR motion tracking that mimics thumbstick controls, and Nepveu knows that isn’t ideal.\n\n“Of course, it would be better to have native support,” he said. “If you want a great VR experience, the game will need to be designed for VR in mind. This is just a way to try your existing games in VR. The experience will depend on the games. Some are good. Some are bad.”\n\nTrue Player Gear’s device also has two cameras so that players can see the outside world at any time. The company will also use this to create augmented-reality games. Finally, the hardware features its own built-in processing power to lighten the load it would put on a PC or console.\n\nWhile the unit does have a lot of cool features, it’s missing the camera-based positional tracking that Rift and Morpheus are using to amplify the sense of presence. Also, Nepveu was unable to provide us any video of the device working. All we could find is this video that True Player Gear debuted in 2007:\n\nWe asked Nepveu where the device has been for the last seven year, and he said that they’ve been prototyping. The current revision is the fifth generation of the hardware, and he provided us with this picture of him showing off an early revision at the Consumer Electronics Show in early 2013:', 'More than seven years ago, a Canadian hardware firm teased a virtual-reality headset for Xbox 360.\nThe company is True Player Gear, and its virtual-reality headset looks a lot like the competition from Oculus VR and Sony.\nIt will also work with Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC, and Mac, according to True Player Gear president Bertrand Nepveu.\nNow that Facebook has dropped $2 billion to purchase Oculus VR — makers of the Oculus Rift VR helmet — True Player Gear is back on the scene to talk about all of the things its hardware can do.\nSome are bad.”True Player Gear’s device also has two cameras so that players can see the outside world at any time.']"

Well for those unfamiliar with True Player Gear, they are a company from Canada who has created a virtual reality headset of their own.

At the moment the company simply has a website and a promotional video, featured at E3 way back in 2006, but True Player Gear\'s twitter feed claims the new version of its VR device will be demoed at E3 this June, with a Kickstarter project planned for the summer.\n\nREAD: Oculus Rift goes swimming with sharks, and we don\'t just mean Facebook\n\nThe headset will be Full HD with a 1920 x 1080 resolution display that uses OLED screens for a 90-degree field of view.

Although the cameras are primarily listed for use in more accurate positional tracking.\n\nThanks to a host of sensors, users\' head movements will be tracked allowing for virtual world scanning using real world movement. Built-in will be a 3-axis 1kHz gyro, a 3-axis 4kHz accelerometer and a 3-axis magnetometer – so it should be accurate.\n\nDespite the promotional video showing no reference to gaming, the headset will be made to work with Xbox One and 360, PlayStation 3 and 4, plus PCs. It also supports multiple games development engines including Unreal, Unity, Havok and CryEngine.\n\nMore detailed specs were listed on a Reddit post by the company saying the headset will feature ""hardware accelerated pre-lens distortion, hardware accelerated motion tracking, on-board cameras for positional tracking (WIP), expansion port for makers, surround sound via standard headphones, individual focus per eye for long and short sighted people, oversized lenses for clearer text, and more.""\n\nWe\'ll be bringing you more details on the project as soon as we can.

Since debuting on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter two years ago, the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset quickly became the most-talked-about device in gaming.\n\nVirtual reality is so hot that Sony announced its own VR headset Project Morpheus last week, and even showed one of the first games made for the Oculus Rift running on Sony hardware: the starfighter simulator EVE: Valkyrie.\n\nGamers and developers alike have been expecting big things from Oculus, and even speculating about an acquisition just not by Facebook.\n\n""I\'d say I was pretty shocked,"" says E McNeil, the developer of a virtual reality game called Darknet. His first reaction to news of the Oculus acquisition was pretty common among his fellow developers, he says. ""A lot of people were thinking that maybe Microsoft would try to purchase Oculus or some other gaming company, and I guess Facebook is involved in gaming. No one really saw this coming. A lot of people are surprised right now.""\n\nSome of that surprise has turned to anger; many of the hundreds of comments on the Oculus blog post announcing the deal can\'t be read on air. The commenters accuse Oculus of abandoning its grass-roots vision, and worry that Oculus headsets will be flooded with Facebook\'s ads.\n\nThe companies are strange bedfellows.\n\n""Facebook is distraction-ware, and Oculus Rift is definitely not distraction-ware; it requires the application of a device to your face, and it\'s arresting, and it\'s immersive,"" says game industry journalist Leigh Alexander.\n\nUnlike clunkier attempts at virtual reality in the 1980s and \'90s, the Oculus Rift provides what developers call ""presence."" Putting on the snorkel-like Oculus mask feels like diving into another world ironically, like one free of the technological distractions of our own.\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, is synonymous with casual games like Candy Crush Saga that marry classic game mechanics with lucrative microtransactions, like paying for extra moves.\n\n""Facebook promised that it was going to be a viable platform for game developers before, and there\'s a lot of reasons why that hasn\'t gone so well, or why that fad was particularly short-lived,"" Alexander says. ""Even though there are games like Candy Crush that are still played pretty actively on Facebook, I think there are a lot of developers that would prefer to continue innovating and go in another direction.""\n\nA lot more is at stake with virtual reality than just games. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions the Oculus being used to take people courtside at sports games, and into distant classrooms. He calls it a ""new communication platform.""\n\nDanfung Dennis is an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker who is already at work on a film designed for the Oculus Rift and other VR headsets. He says Facebook is just looking to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n""This is a fundamentally new medium. A new form of computing. So I think it\'s natural for any company that is trying to build a stake in the future and is trying to have a stake in the next major platform to be considering VR,"" he says.\n\nOculus\' founder, 21-year-old Palmer Luckey, took to Reddit on Tuesday night to make his case for the buyout. And there\'s no shortage of explaining the company will be expected to do: At least one high-profile project, an adaption of the popular game Minecraft, has already been canceled. The creator of Minecraft went so far as to call Facebook ""creepy.""\n\nSome would-be Oculus developers are pledging to cancel their orders for the latest development kits that they would have used to build new software for the headset.\n\nAlexander says this could be a heat-of-the-moment reaction by gamers. ""We\'re used to pressing a button when something comes up, and I think right now we\'re in knee-jerk mode.""\n\nNot all developers see the purchase as a bad thing: There\'s a silver lining in the deep pockets that Facebook brings to Oculus. Facebook\'s billions can evolve Oculus far faster than the startup would have been able to on its own, and the social network says Oculus will continue to operate independently, much as Instagram has.\n\nTurnstyle News is a tech and digital culture site from Youth Radio.', 'Thursday, March 27, 2014 - 7:15amBacklash To Facebook Buying Virtual Reality Firm Comes SwiftlyWhen Facebook purchases a company, you can often hear a collective groan go around the Internet ""There goes the neighborhood.""\nThe Oculus VR acquisition announced Tuesday is Facebook\'s first high-profile hardware purchase a very popular one, too.\nSince debuting on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter two years ago, the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset quickly became the most-talked-about device in gaming.\n""I\'d say I was pretty shocked,"" says E McNeil, the developer of a virtual reality game called Darknet.\nUnlike clunkier attempts at virtual reality in the 1980s and \'90s, the Oculus Rift provides what developers call ""presence.""']"

The report follows widespread speculation from several other outlets and a number of sell-side analysts.\n\nNotably, the iPhones will sport larger screens than Apple\'s current flagship: one will offer a 4.7-inch screen, while the other will clock in at 5.5-inches -- Apple\'s first foray into the phablet space, a market long dominated by Google\'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) biggest hardware partner, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). By offering a similar-sized product, Apple could be poised to steal many of Samsung\'s (and Google\'s) best customers.\n\nISI Group projects a monster upgrade cycle\n\nAnalysts at ISI Group have big expectations for the iPhone 6. According to Brian Marshall, the iPhone 6 will be the ""mother lode of all upgrade cycles,"" prompting both Apple loyalists and longtime Samsung fans to make the switch.\n\nIt\'s easy to see why ISI Group would make such a projection: Although most of Google\'s share of the smartphone market comes from the low end, there is a significant group of buyers that choose high-end Android phones, mostly from Samsung. In 2013, Samsung sold at least 50 million Galaxy S4s and Note IIIs worldwide. These phones are powered by Google\'s mobile operating system, but cost as much (or even more) than Apple\'s high-end iPhone.\n\nWhy would buyers choose these phones? The biggest reason (no pun intended) is screen real estate -- if you want your smartphone to have a screen larger than four inches, you\'ve no choice but to go with a smartphone powered by Google\'s mobile operating system.\n\nThere might be more to it than a larger screen\n\nBut the big screen isn\'t the only reason some buyers choose Samsung\'s phones. And even if that was the only reason they purchased a Galaxy in the first place, they might find it difficult to switch.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, Samsung has built up a great degree of customer loyalty in recent quarters. In fact, about 58% of Samsung owners who upgraded last year opted for another Samsung device. That\'s notably less than Apple -- when it comes time to upgrade, more than 80% of current iPhone owners choose another iPhone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.\n\nBut it\'s arguably more impressive, because unlike Apple, Samsung doesn\'t control the Android operating system that powers its phones. It\'s relatively easy to switch from a Samsung Galaxy S3 to a rival HTC One, for example, or Google\'s own Nexus 5 -- purchased apps, movies, and music easily carry over, as the Android operating system remains constant across Google\'s many hardware partners.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that, like Apple\'s iTunes, Google\'s rival Google Play store seems to work just as well at trapping consumers. Unfortunately, Google doesn\'t break out the revenue derived from Google Play, but last quarter it did say that it was contributing meaningfully to the company\'s revenue growth, and the search giant has been aggressively advertising Google Play in recent months.\n\nPerhaps the most concrete evidence of Android lock-in is the rate of iPhone upgrades at major carriers: Historically, about 80% of AT&T\'s smartphone sales have come from Apple\'s phone; at Verizon, it\'s only about 50%. Until 2011, AT&T had exclusive rights to the iPhone in the U.S. -- Verizon customers who wanted a smartphone had to make do with something powered by Google\'s operating system. That trend has continued: T-Mobile, which didn\'t get the iPhone until last year, saw only one-fifth of its customers choose Apple\'s smartphone.\n\nThe iPhone 6 could be big, but not that big\n\nWhile a bigger iPhone obviously has the potential to steal many of Samsung and Google\'s customers, I wouldn\'t count on it. If Apple offers up a larger screen, it could catalyze a huge upgrade cycle, but perhaps not as big as analysts at ISI Group anticipate. Owners of Samsung\'s high-end Galaxy smartphones have reasons to stay loyal beyond just the screen size.', ""By offering a similar-sized product, Apple could be poised to steal many of Samsung's (and Google's) best customers.\nThese phones are powered by Google's mobile operating system, but cost as much (or even more) than Apple's high-end iPhone.\nBut it's arguably more impressive, because unlike Apple, Samsung doesn't control the Android operating system that powers its phones.\nThat trend has continued: T-Mobile, which didn't get the iPhone until last year, saw only one-fifth of its customers choose Apple's smartphone.\nThe iPhone 6 could be big, but not that bigWhile a bigger iPhone obviously has the potential to steal many of Samsung and Google's customers, I wouldn't count on it.""]"

This is the company that brought us the smartphone as we know it today, and the execution across every part of its product portfolio -- Mac, iPhone, or iPad -- has been nothing less than stunning. Apple\'s execution is so good that the company has, once again, been shamelessly copied by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and HTC in their most recent flagship phones.\n\nGold, silver, and space gray ... how original!\n\nApple launched its iPhone 5s lineup last September with devices that looked like this:\n\nGreat colors, right? You\'ve got the silver, gold, and space gray. Now look at the most recently released HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S5 lineups, respectively:\n\nCould it get any more obvious that both Samsung and HTC are pretty shamelessly playing ""follow the leader""? Sure, one could conceivably say that these are just colors. While this is true, the fact that Apple\'s competitors are using nearly identical color schemes to what Apple offers is no coincidence. In fact, if this idea were so ""obvious,"" then why didn\'t HTC or Samsung think to offer this particular set of colors beforehand?\n\nHere lies the investment risk for Apple\n\nApple is an innovator and a company that understands its customers. It has world-class design teams (both industrial and semiconductor), and its software ecosystem and development efforts really are unmatched in the smartphone space. While that\'s all well and good, it\'s tough to ignore the fact that (almost) anything that Apple can do (at least on the hardware side of things), others can and will copy.\n\nThe good news is that Apple is generally the innovator and that it has an extremely powerful brand that provides protection. For example, in the notebook space there are plenty of MacBook Air/Pro copycats, but the Mac has gained market share during 30 of the last 31 quarters. This isn\'t a coincidence -- it\'s a result of strong execution on Apple\'s part, even as some notebook vendors offer more ""whiz-bang"" features at lower price points, and a strong brand. But this success doesn\'t come easy.\n\nThe iPhone 6 will be critical\n\nApple has produced a certifiable winner with each and every iPhone. But as the competition heats up, it will need to deliver something outstanding with the iPhone 6. There\'s little doubt that as far as the silicon goes, it\'s going to be fantastic (look at the A7 chip), and iOS 8 should be even better than the already wildly popular iOS 7. However, strong execution on an improved industrial design -- Apple\'s forte -- will be crucial.\n\nFoolish bottom line\n\nApple\'s mission is simple: grow iPhone sales, and take as much of the high-end, high-value ""hero device"" market as possible. The iPhone 5s was a great device that managed to stop the Galaxy S4 dead in its tracks, but the iPhone 6 will need to halt and reverse the progress that Samsung has made with the Galaxy S and Note lines combined. It can probably be done with just the addition of new screen sizes, but a dramatically improved industrial design also couldn\'t hurt.', ""Apple's execution is so good that the company has, once again, been shamelessly copied by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and HTC in their most recent flagship phones.\nApple launched its iPhone 5s lineup last September with devices that looked like this:Great colors, right?\nWhile this is true, the fact that Apple's competitors are using nearly identical color schemes to what Apple offers is no coincidence.\nThe good news is that Apple is generally the innovator and that it has an extremely powerful brand that provides protection.\nHowever, strong execution on an improved industrial design -- Apple's forte -- will be crucial.""]"

The US International Trade Commission on August 9, 2013 blocked imports of some Samsung electronic devices following complaints by Apple that the South Korean company had violated its patents. The ruling by the Washington-based US trade body was the latest in a long-running global legal battle over alleged patent infringement between the two smartphone and tablet giants. The ITC ruled that Samsung had infringed two Apple patents -- numbers 949 and 501 -- but cleared the South Korean company of charges that it had violated four more.

As opposed to the ""dumb"" phone that produced a dial tone and nothing else, the iPhone initiated a multidimensional cage match in which connectivity (Verizon), device (Apple), content (Facebook) and service (Amazon) providers compete for consumer allegiance. The result has been a torrent of innovation, generating growth, income and employment, and dramatic change in our daily lives.\n\nBut those dynamics are now challenged by a court case taking place in California on Monday, in which Apple will probably seek a ban on the importation of new-generation Samsung phones and tablets, claiming patent infringement.\n\nApple claims - and previous courts have accepted - that Samsung infringed on five specific Apple patents for such features as ""slide to open."" But the remedy Apple proposes includes damages of $40 per new device sold; in a different case involving Motorola, Apple valued one of these patents at one-twentieth of the figure it now demands.\n\nBut Apple\'s bet is that it can get more from a jury than from a business negotiation, which raises important issues about the nature of patents, the evolution of the broadband Internet, and long-term economic performance.\n\nThe patent system was designed to achieve a difficult balance - to provide incentives to innovators and ensure that their innovations spread throughout the economy. So it offered protections to the inventor of proverbial better mousetraps. But technological progress has changed the nature of invention - the iPhone itself was never patented. Instead, it rests on a mass of patents, as does virtually any modern product or process. Seeking outrageous settlements or an outright ban on the entire product in which an individual component plays a part ignores the balancing aspect of the patent system - the need to establish terms on which innovations are spread throughout the economy.\n\nThe judge in the case has essentially taken this view, arguing that an outright ban ignores the reality that the patents in question aren\'t the driving reason consumers may opt for a Samsung phone instead of an iPhone. In fact, she\'s more right than she probably imagines.\n\nThe pundits who write about technology do so from offices with premium connections, Wi-Fi and the latest computers. But for many others, smartphones are the best option for reaching the Internet. The people who catch the early bus don\'t have a computer at work, may rent their homes and move often (leaving them unable to upgrade their wired connections), and can meld their Internet access with their need for telephony. The advantages of Samsung\'s products for many consumers are not such patented features as ""swipe to open"" or ""reverse pinch to expand,"" but a substantially lower price that allows those consumers to participate in the digital world. Prohibiting these products or driving up their costs would harm consumers far more than any losses related to infringement.\n\nThe Apple-Samsung case brings to mind the many defects of the patent system. Patent ""trolls"" buy patents hoping to catch unsuspecting companies that are in violation. Damages too often relate to the value of the entire product, rather than the economic contributions of the component of the feature in question (much like Apple\'s $40 per phone proposal). And many analysts and industry participants contend that patents - often for software such as ""one click ordering"" - don\'t live up to the traditional standard of something wholly new and innovative.\n\nThis confluence of issues is producing a business environment in which company strategies for competitiveness are premised on legal strategies rather than creating consumer value through innovation, service and marketing. It is the opposite of how a healthy business climate operates - the best legal framework is one that doesn\'t weigh on business decisions, much as the best umpire is one who goes unnoticed.

Some are legit, but many are totally bogus. As always, we\'ve parsed the week\'s rumors, ranking them in order from ""utterly ridiculous"" to ""duh, of course."" First up…\n\nDON\'T COUNT ON IT: Concept Shows iPhone 6 Looking Very iPod Nano-esque\n\nWhile not exactly a rumor, artist Martin Hajek posted a bunch of iPhone 6 illustrations this week. His design is super slender, featuring the larger display rumored to be on the next-gen phone. Hajek based his designs off rumors, and of course, his own imagination. Even if they end up bearing no resemblance to the real iPhone, they\'re certainly fun to look at. You can check out a bunch of images of his iPhone 6 rendering at Dutch site iPhone Club.\n\nASK AGAIN LATER: Split Camera Technology Could Make iPhones Even Thinner\n\nIf Apple could split its camera sensors into two separate units, it might be able to make iDevices even thinner than they are now. At least, that\'s what a patent application published Thursday proposes. ""Electronic device with two image sensors"" explains how the camera unit could be split in two, with one part housing a sensor for detecting brightness (luma) and the other for detecting color (chroma). Information from each sensor would be combined into a final image. The camera lens and sensors are often some of the chunkiest parts of a mobile device, so this method could, in theory, help make some of Hajek\'s super-skinny renderings a reality.\n\nASK AGAIN LATER: Apple Investigating Location-Based Privacy Settings\n\nWhen you\'re at home, sitting around with your family, you probably don\'t need impermeable security settings on your iPhone. But if you\'re traveling, walking through a busy city, or on the train, you may want to amp up these settings. A patent application describes how your iDevice could use your location to enable or disable different security settings. You could define privacy profiles for different types of apps (increasing the privacy settings on your SMS messages or email, for example), or turn off TouchID when you\'re at home. This is one of those ""sounds like a great idea, but who knows if Apple will ever implement it""-type patents.\n\nASK AGAIN LATER: Robots Are Going to Make Your iPhone\n\nApple is obsessive in its quest to streamline its production processes. So it\'s not too surprising to hear that the company may start automating iPhone battery production in the future. Apple already automated production of its iMac and Mac Pro lines. Humans are apparently only needed for materials and final assembly. With automated production, Apple is free to move production just about anywhere it likes, while saving money on labor costs. Most Apple products are still manufactured in China, for now.\n\nSIGNS POINT TO YES: More Diverse Emoji Coming\n\nThe people emoji in iOS are decidedly... homogenous. Perhaps not for long. Apple representative Katie Cotton said that Apple is working with the Unicode Consortium to bring some diversity to the illustrated icons. Apple\'s added emojis to its library in the past, including family icons and same-sex couple icons in iOS 6, so it\'s not too surprising to expect Apple would add some more in the next update of its mobile OS.\n\nSIGNS POINT TO YES: New MacBook Air Is on the Way\n\nPlease let this be true: A post on a Chinese forum and a Digitimes report say that we\'ll be getting a Retina MacBook Air later this year. The device will supposedly be fan-less, and even thinner than the current MacBook Air design. The new notebook is expected in the second half of the year, likely October, which is exactly when we\'d expect it to land, too. The challenge here will be battery life. If Apple can\'t keep it at least the same (9-12 hours) in a Retina version, it may not happen.\n\nSIGNS POINT TO YES: Apple Talking to Comcast About Streaming TV\n\nApple and Comcast are reportedly in the early stages of chatting about a deal that would let Apple streaming television traffic bypass traditional Internet congestion. Apple has reportedly been in talks with all sorts of different Internet and cable providers about its rumored television set or streaming TV service, which we\'ve been hearing about since 2011. Apple is definitely working on some sort of television project, but it\'s still unclear how and if it will ever manifest itself. One thing\'s for sure: Apple\'s taking its sweet time making sure it gets it right.', 'Each week, there are dozens of Apple rumors, reports, and patent filings that hint at what\'s coming out of Cupertino next.\nAs always, we\'ve parsed the week\'s rumors, ranking them in order from ""utterly ridiculous"" to ""duh, of course.""\nWith automated production, Apple is free to move production just about anywhere it likes, while saving money on labor costs.\nApple representative Katie Cotton said that Apple is working with the Unicode Consortium to bring some diversity to the illustrated icons.\nSIGNS POINT TO YES: Apple Talking to Comcast About Streaming TVApple and Comcast are reportedly in the early stages of chatting about a deal that would let Apple streaming television traffic bypass traditional Internet congestion.']"

66728,http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/smartphones/1306945/apple-iphone-6-could-have-two-camera-sensors,technology,"[""The iPhone 6 was a stellar handset but has since been usurped by the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 7 – as well as the much newer iPhone 8. In fact, it’s now hard to buy an iPhone 6 first-hand, with Apple instead offering the excellent iPhone SE as its cheapest handset.\n\nWe’d say that if you’re looking for a budget handset (at least if you're set on getting an Apple device) you’ll want to opt for the £280 iPhone SE. Alternatively, there are many incredible budget Android smartphones which are far more impressive – here's our pick of the very best you can find right now.\n\nREAD NEXT: iPhone 8 review: A worthy upgrade from the iPhone 7?\n\nOur original review continues below.\n\niPhone 6 review: Build quality\n\nThe one area that Apple hasn't changed for the iPhone 6 is the build quality, and this model is the best yet. Sticking to its usual design regime, the iPhone 6 uses a completely new design. Gone are the square edges of the iPhone 5S, replaced with a curvier, more rounded body. Given the extra size of the phone, the rounded edges don't just look great, they make the phone easier to hold and we've not once dropped our handset by mistake.\n\nApple's usual attention to detail is ever-present, with the front glass curving gently to meet the sides of the case, so you can't feel the join. It's this kind of quality that sets the iPhone apart from its rivals. An aluminium case gives the iPhone 6 the high-quality look and feels what we expect from Apple. Plastic runs between the individual metal parts, in order to allow for uninterrupted mobile and wireless reception. It's been neatly done and you can barely feel the join. Available in Space Grey, Silver or Gold, each colour has its own merits, so it's really a matter of which one you prefer.\n\nWhile the iPhone 6 has a bigger footprint than the iPhone 5S, there's not a lot of difference between the phones. For starters, the iPhone 6 is just 6.9mm thin, making it thinner than the iPhone 5S. Impressively, at 129g, the new handset is only 17g heavier than the old one.\n\nWith a bigger screen, some design changes have had to be made. The most obvious one is that the power button is no longer on the top but has been relocated to the upper right-hand side. This makes it much easier to reach with a finger or thumb, even more so than with the iPhone 6 Plus.\n\nWe're pleased to see that the other side of the phone still has the physical volume buttons and the silent switch. A physical switch to go into silent mode is a really useful thing to have and much easier than messing around with on-screen controls.\n\niPhone 6 review: Display quality\n\nWith its 4.7in display, Apple has had to up the iPhone 6's resolution in order to keep the Retina tag. According to Apple, this is the point at which you can no longer see individual pixels. In the iPhone 6's case, this is a resolution of 1,334x750 - slightly more than 720p. While the resolution may be higher, the pixel density is the same 326ppi as the iPhone 5S. In other words, you get the same screen sharpness as before.\n\nOther handset manufacturers have managed to squeeze in Full HD displays at this size, so why hasn't Apple? The simple answer is because it doesn't feel the need to. In fact, the issue of image quality is far more than simple pixel density. Comparing the iPhone 6 to the Nexus 5 (5in screen, Full HD, 445ppi), we found that the iPhone 6 was actually slightly sharper; comparing it to the LG G3 (5.5in screen, 2,560x1,440, 538ppi), the G3 was the sharper handset. In all of these cases, it has to be said that the difference is rather marginal, and in practical terms, the iPhone 6's screen is more than sharp enough. You certainly don't look at text or images and notice that any jagged lines or softening due to there not being enough resolution.\n\nThere's a good argument that adding more pixels would just drain the battery faster and give the CPU more work to do. In fact, only using the screen resolution that's required is something that's becoming more popular, as you can see from the 720p Samsung Galaxy Alpha.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Apple hasn't made any changes to the screen. While it still uses a LED-backlit IPS panel, this time around it uses dual-domain pixels. This technology helps improve viewing angles and even looking at the screen almost edge on we couldn't detect any noticeable colour shift.\n\nApple has also stated that the new screen has better contrast and black levels than on previous handsets. Our colour calibrator confirmed this, with a black level reading of a low 0.37cd/m2 and a contrast ratio of 1,456:1. The screen brightness of 543cm/m2 is impressive too, meaning you can see it clearly in direct sunlight, while blacks are still inky and dark.\n\nColour accuracy is also very good, with our colour calibrator measuring the phone as capable of producing 95.1% of the sRGB colour gamut (the graph below shows the gamut, with the dotted line representing sRGB). This puts this screen in the top leagues of LCD displays. Super AMOLED screens, such as that on the Samsung Galaxy S5 have better colour reproduction and black levels, although they're dimmer and some find their colours a little over-saturated.\n\nIn our regular image tests, photos on the iPhone 6 looked great, with natural colours and plenty of detail throughout the image. Overall, it's a great screen, as you'd expect from an Apple handset; it's not the best display available though there's practically no cause for complaint.\n\nAlthough we were all hoping for a sapphire glass display, that technology's not quite ready yet. Instead, Apple has used ion-strengthened glass, which is both scratch and shatter resistant; as always, treat the phone with care and use a decent case to add extra protection."", ""The iPhone 6 was a stellar handset but has since been usurped by the iPhone 6S, the iPhone 7 – as well as the much newer iPhone 8.\nIn fact, it’s now hard to buy an iPhone 6 first-hand, with Apple instead offering the excellent iPhone SE as its cheapest handset.\nREAD NEXT: iPhone 8 review: A worthy upgrade from the iPhone 7?\niPhone 6 review: Build qualityThe one area that Apple hasn't changed for the iPhone 6 is the build quality, and this model is the best yet.\niPhone 6 review: Display qualityWith its 4.7in display, Apple has had to up the iPhone 6's resolution in order to keep the Retina tag.""]"

We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir\'s paper,"" Fankhauser was quoted as saying.JEI challenged the teenager to apply his project to a larger scale, preferably the federal government, to determine how much real savings his idea could generate.The government has an annual printing expenditure of $1.8 billion and implementing Suvir\'s idea on such a massive scale was more challenging than a school science project, the CNN report said.Media and public relations manager at the Government Printing Office Gary Somerset described Suvir\'s idea as ""remarkable"" but said it was concentrating on saving money by publishing documents online instead of hard copies.""They can\'t convert everything to a digital format,"" Suvir said.""Not everyone is able to access information online. Some things still have to be printed.

66747,http://fox6now.com/2014/03/29/teen-proposes-font-change-to-save-government-millions/,technology,"['× Teen proposes font change to save government millions\n\n(CNN) — An e. You can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard. The most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. Simple, right?\n\nNow imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents. Then think of how much ink would be needed.\n\nOK, so that may have been a first for you, but it came naturally to 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his Pittsburgh-area middle school.\n\nIt all started as a science fair project. As a neophyte sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School, Suvir noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school.\n\nInterested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability, Suvir decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink.\n\nReducing paper use through recycling and dual-sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources, but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts.\n\n“Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,” Suvir says with a chuckle.\n\nHe’s right: Chanel No. 5 perfume costs $38 per ounce, while the equivalent amount of Hewlett-Packard printer ink can cost up to $75.\n\nSo Suvir decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid.\n\nCollecting random samples of teachers’ handouts, Suvir concentrated on the most commonly used characters (e, t, a, o and r).\n\nFirst, he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces: Garamond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic and Comic Sans. Then he measured how much ink was used for each letter, using a commercial tool called APFill® Ink Coverage Software.\n\nNext he enlarged the letters, printed them and cut them out on cardstock paper to weigh them to verify his findings. He did three trials for each letter, graphing the ink usage for each font.\n\nFrom this analysis, Suvir figured out that by using Garamond with its thinner strokes, his school district could reduce its ink consumption by 24%, and in turn save as much as $21,000 annually.\n\nEncouraged by his teacher, Suvir looked to publish his findings and stumbled on the Journal for Emerging Investigators (JEI), a publication founded by a group of Harvard grad students in 2011 that provides a forum for the work of middle school and high school students. It has the same standards as academic journals, and each submission is reviewed by grad students and academics.\n\nSarah Fankhauser, one of JEI’s founders, says that of the nearly 200 submissions they have received since 2011, Suvir’s project was a real standout:\n\n“We were so impressed. We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir’s paper.”\n\nFankhauser said Suvir’s findings were so clear, simple and well thought-out, it had the peer reviewers at JEI asking, “How much potential savings is really out there?”\n\nFor the answer, JEI challenged Suvir to apply his project to a larger scale: the federal government.\n\nWith an annual printing expenditure of $1.8 billion, the government was a much more challenging task than his school science project.\n\nSuvir repeated his tests on five sample pages from documents on the Government Printing Office website and got similar results — change the font, save money.\n\nWill government printers embrace a change?\n\nUsing the General Services Administration’s estimated annual cost of ink — $467 million — Suvir concluded that if the federal government used Garamond exclusively it could save nearly 30% — or $136 million per year. An additional $234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board, he reported.\n\nGary Somerset, media and public relations manager at the Government Printing Office, describes Suvir’s work as “remarkable.” But he was noncommittal on whether the GPO would introduce changes to typeface, saying the GPO’s efforts to become more environmentally sustainable were focused on shifting content to the Web.\n\n“In 1994, we were producing 20,000 copies a day of both the Federal Register and Congressional Record.

You can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard. The most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. Simple, right?\n\nNow imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents. Then think of how much ink would be needed.\n\nOK, so that may have been a first for you, but it came naturally to 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his Pittsburgh-area middle school.\n\nIt all started as a science fair project. As a neophyte sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School, Suvir noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school.\n\nInterested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability, Suvir decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink.\n\nReducing paper use through recycling and dual-sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources, but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts.\n\n“Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,” Suvir says with a chuckle.\n\nHe’s right: Chanel No. 5 perfume costs $38 per ounce, while the equivalent amount of Hewlett-Packard printer ink can cost up to $75.\n\nSo Suvir decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid.\n\nCollecting random samples of teachers’ handouts, Suvir concentrated on the most commonly used characters (e, t, a, o and r).\n\nFirst, he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces: Garamond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic and Comic Sans. Then he measured how much ink was used for each letter, using a commercial tool called APFill® Ink Coverage Software.\n\nNext he enlarged the letters, printed them and cut them out on cardstock paper to weigh them to verify his findings. He did three trials for each letter, graphing the ink usage for each font.\n\nFrom this analysis, Suvir figured out that by using Garamond with its thinner strokes, his school district could reduce its ink consumption by 24%, and in turn save as much as $21,000 annually.\n\nEncouraged by his teacher, Suvir looked to publish his findings and stumbled on the Journal for Emerging Investigators (JEI), a publication founded by a group of Harvard grad students in 2011 that provides a forum for the work of middle school and high school students. It has the same standards as academic journals, and each submission is reviewed by grad students and academics.\n\nSarah Fankhauser, one of JEI’s founders, says that of the nearly 200 submissions they have received since 2011, Suvir’s project was a real standout:\n\n“We were so impressed. We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir’s paper.”\n\nFankhauser said Suvir’s findings were so clear, simple and well thought-out, it had the peer reviewers at JEI asking, “How much potential savings is really out there?”\n\nFor the answer, JEI challenged Suvir to apply his project to a larger scale: the federal government.\n\nWith an annual printing expenditure of $1.8 billion, the government was a much more challenging task than his school science project.\n\nSuvir repeated his tests on five sample pages from documents on the Government Printing Office website and got similar results — change the font, save money.\n\nWill government printers embrace a change?\n\nUsing the General Services Administration’s estimated annual cost of ink — $467 million — Suvir concluded that if the federal government used Garamond exclusively it could save nearly 30% — or $136 million per year. An additional $234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board, he reported.\n\nGary Somerset, media and public relations manager at the Government Printing Office, describes Suvir’s work as “remarkable.” But he was noncommittal on whether the GPO would introduce changes to typeface, saying the GPO’s efforts to become more environmentally sustainable were focused on shifting content to the Web.\n\n“In 1994, we were producing 20,000 copies a day of both the Federal Register and Congressional Record. Twenty years later, we produce roughly 2,500 print copies a day,” he said.\n\nOn top of this, the Congressional Register is printed on recycled paper, which GPO has been doing for five or six years, Somerset says.\n\nOne federal initiative that focuses on minimizing ink-usage is called “Printwise.” Organized by the General Services Administration, it teaches government offices how to default their computer settings to Times New Roman, Garamond and Century Gothic to minimize printing waste. According to GSA’s press secretary Dan Cruz, they hope this type of initiative could save the federal government up to $30 million annually.\n\nSuvir appreciates the government’s efforts, but he sees his project as a means of making an even bigger impact nationwide.\n\n“Consumers are still printing at home, they can make this change too,” he says.\n\nHolding out hope\n\nAt 14, Suvir understands how difficult such a project might be to implement — “I recognize it’s difficult to change someone’s behavior.

That seems to be the strategy Yahoo is considering in its attempt to take on YouTube, according to a new report from Recode.\n\nCiting “several sources close to the situation,” Recode reports that Yahoo may be looking to luring some of YouTube’s biggest names to a service of its own with promises of higher ad revenue.\n\nFor now, Yahoo isn’t looking to build a direct competitor to YouTube that will accept video uploads from all comers, according to Recode; instead, it’s looking to build upon what it has started with its Yahoo Screen video site.\n\nHow much more money could YouTubers stand to make? According to an AllThingsD article from last April, if you place ads in videos you upload to YouTube, you can expect to make anywhere from $2.50 to $10 per thousand video views, depending on who you ask, after YouTube takes its 45 percent cut.\n\nEven though that may not sound like a lot, that isn’t stopping some from making some serious cash through YouTube. One site estimates that the top-paid YouTube users make anywhere between $1 million and $7 million each year.\n\nGranted, these are the absolute top earners—most of us would probably make enough for a dinner or two at Applebee’s over the course of a year—but it shows that there is money to be made if you can catch a break on YouTube.\n\nFor a channel with 10 million views per year, an extra dollar per thousand views would translate to an extra $10,000 annually.\n\nWhen you get to big numbers like that, an extra few dollars per thousand video views really adds up in no time. For a channel with 10 million views per year, an extra dollar per thousand views would translate to an extra $10,000 annually—not a bad raise.\n\nThe risk for video producers, of course, is that a competitor to YouTube—even one from a household name like Yahoo—may not draw as large an audience as YouTube does, thus negating any increased ad payout rate.\n\nYahoo could counter with a higher guaranteed payout, and Recode also notes that, according to its sources, Yahoo has “has offered extensive marketing, even on its homepage, as well as allowing video producers the ability to sell advertising along with Yahoo’s sales force.” For some, that alone may make it worth considering what Yahoo has to offer.\n\nThis story, ""Yahoo may try to draw YouTube\'s most popular acts with a video site of its own"" was originally published by TechHive .', 'That seems to be the strategy Yahoo is considering in its attempt to take on YouTube, according to a new report from Recode.\nFor a channel with 10 million views per year, an extra dollar per thousand views would translate to an extra $10,000 annually.\nWhen you get to big numbers like that, an extra few dollars per thousand video views really adds up in no time.\nFor a channel with 10 million views per year, an extra dollar per thousand views would translate to an extra $10,000 annually—not a bad raise.\nThis story, ""Yahoo may try to draw YouTube\'s most popular acts with a video site of its own"" was originally published by TechHive .']"

Today Recode is reporting that Yahoo will soon launch a new video service to take on YouTube. And while that might sound like a laughable endeavour, with YouTube yet to have a competitor steal their mainstream userbase, the company is hoping that the popularity of YouTube’s own stars is more important than the popularity of YouTube itself.\n\nThough the plan on poaching YouTuber’s for a new service is not just risky for Yahoo, but also for the creators themselves. Playing with audiences might not create a positive image for Yahoo, as seen with the acquisition of Tumblr recently, especially if Yahoo’s service doesn’t have feature parity with YouTube. After all, YouTube is available on practically every internet-connected device, whereas Yahoo won’t be from day one.\n\nWhile YouTube is entitled to a cut from ads, many content creators, such as Vox Media or RocketJump, use alternative services for on-site content, and find that this provides them with better control, and at a competitive price. Yahoo hopes to give disgruntled YouTube creators either higher revenue for content, or guaranteed ad rates, a proposition which, alone, could entice popular users, though it still might not be enough.\n\nThe service isn’t a clone either, with Yahoo’s launch ambitions ruling out an open service. Rather, Yahoo will just curate content, restricting uploads to established brands. As YouTube users upload 100 hours of content every day, a restriction like this can only hurt the potential for new talent. So while you might be able to find a big tech blog on the site, you won’t see independent blogs like TechGeek uploading video from day one. And you won’t see the next big viral video on Yahoo, until they poach that too.\n\nYahoo has already shown its ability to distribute content through their Yahoo Screen app, where the company provides access to SNL content, as well as other catch-up and original video, though this is a much bigger step in bringing the Yahoo brand back to relevance. Though how the new service will work isn’t yet known. It may simply be the same content-management system as Yahoo Screen, though there is also a possibility that Yahoo might purchase an existing competitor like Vimeo.\n\nThe news is just another sign that CEO Marissa Mayer is happy to clone existing Google services or to acquire pre-existing services, rather than to create completely new products internally. While this new step might help their brand, it might also just annoy users who shouldn’t have to be forced to use Yahoo products.

But Yahoo would like to try: The Web giant has been working on a plan to lure some of YouTube’s most popular stars and networks to show their stuff on the site, according to several sources close to the situation.\n\nThe strategy in the works — which Yahoo hopes to launch in the next few months — is aimed at taking advantage of persistent complaints by both video creators and owners, who think that they don’t make enough money on YouTube.\n\nYahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has been mulling how to have a much bigger presence in Web video. Under her leadership, the company tried and failed to buy France’s DailyMotion and has been pushing a number of other high-profile media initiatives, such as adding television news star Katie Couric to its site.\n\nBut creating an online video service is a much bigger deal and is not just conceptual — several industry sources say Yahoo has recently been approaching individual YouTube stars and some of the big networks now on the giant online video service.\n\nThe come-on? Yahoo executives have told video makers and owners that the company can offer them better economics than they’re getting on YouTube, either by improving the ad revenue or by offering guaranteed ad rates for their videos.\n\nIn addition, Yahoo has offered extensive marketing, even on its home page, as well as allowing video producers the ability to sell advertising along with Yahoo’s sales force.\n\n“Yahoo Screen was part one,” said one producer who has agreed to be part of Yahoo’s video effort, about its current offerings. “Now, this is part two.”\n\nFor now, at least, Yahoo isn’t talking about replicating YouTube’s open platform, which lets users upload 100 hours of content every minute to the site. Instead, it is interested in cherry-picking particularly popular, more professional YouTube fare.\n\nYahoo has also told some video owners that it can use its well-trafficked home page and other high-profile real estate to promote their clips on a non-exclusive basis.\n\nAfter a year, one source inside Yahoo said, it might open the platform up further. One source inside the company said that Yahoo is prepping a new content management system for the effort, although some have suggested it could also buy an existing service like Vimeo.\n\nMayer — a former Google exec who has imposed an awful lot of Googley ideas on Yahoo since she got there (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, ya know!) — has been pushing the effort. It is all part of her valiant and doubtlessly exhausting attempts to turn around the Silicon Valley Internet giant. So far, other than the spectacular run of its Chinese asset, Alibaba Group, that has boosted Yahoo stock, the core business continues to lag. That giant sum of money from Alibaba could easily pay the costs of mounting a challenge to Google, which some might think a fool’s errand.\n\nBut Yahoo needs to show it can grow. Sources inside the company said the first quarter — which ends right about now — was also lackluster, even as investors have been watching for signs that Mayer can turbocharge the business after two years in the job. Video is obviously an explosive area and an arena in which Yahoo can perhaps offer a credible alternative.\n\nAll of what it seems to be offering certainly runs counter to what’s available at YouTube, which takes a 45 percent cut of ad revenue, doesn’t offer guarantees and insists on relying on computers, not humans, to pick videos it thinks users want to see.\n\nThat environment has generated lots of grumbling from YouTube’s partners over the last couple years. And it has prompted many big YouTube players to try to build businesses outside of the world’s biggest video site as well, either on sites they own themselves or with other video portals, like Microsoft’s Xbox.\n\nNew YouTube head Susan Wojcicki has begun making overtures to its most high-profile producers, said sources, with an eye to making them happier. Wojcicki, who has been a prominent ad product exec at Google and one of its earliest employees, has deeper experience in generating revenue with a multitude of partners, and many are looking forward to seeing how she will change the service’s offerings.\n\nNevertheless, sources said, she and YouTube still consider the platform to be the best there is, in terms of reach and monetization, for video makers. “Yahoo tried to keep up with Google and AdSense in online ads, but they tend to settle where they get the best results,” said one person.\n\nHaving the giant YouTube dominate the online video space is frightening to many. But while video makers have openly pined for a well-financed competitor to try taking on YouTube directly, none have surfaced yet. Both Facebook and Amazon are also kicking around plans to move more aggressively into ad-supported video, as The Information and The Wall Street Journal have reported.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are showing renewed interest in YouTube-related businesses, sparked by Disney’s $500 million acquisition of Maker Studios, a YouTube network with 5.5 billion monthly views. Last fall, Erin McPherson, who at the time was Yahoo’s top video executive, joined Maker as its chief creative officer.\n\nWe’ve asked Yahoo for comment via email but have not heard back.\n\nDawn Chmielewski also contributed to the reporting of this story.', 'But creating an online video service is a much bigger deal and is not just conceptual — several industry sources say Yahoo has recently been approaching individual YouTube stars and some of the big networks now on the giant online video service.\n“Yahoo Screen was part one,” said one producer who has agreed to be part of Yahoo’s video effort, about its current offerings.\nHaving the giant YouTube dominate the online video space is frightening to many.\nBut while video makers have openly pined for a well-financed competitor to try taking on YouTube directly, none have surfaced yet.\nLast fall, Erin McPherson, who at the time was Yahoo’s top video executive, joined Maker as its chief creative officer.']"

And it's doing so by, uh, Facebookizing itself.\n\n\n\nJust a week ago, we talked about the possibility that Twitter will move much of the infrastructure we see -- the @ sign, or using the # for a hashtag -- behind the wall, as a way to streamline the user experience. It makes sense, sure, but in my mind, it would also cut out some of the fun that A) has been a part of Twitter since its inception and B) distinguishes it from Facebook.\n\n\n\nAnd then last week we learned of one big change and two other experiments, all of which would appear to further Twitter's Facebookization.\n\n\n\nAnd this is a big deal, boys and girls, big enough that I'm probably going to continue making up words for the duration of the column.\n\n\n\nLet's start with the one you guys are likely to notice first: Twitter's going to let us upload up to four photos to a single tweet -- and we can tag the people in those pix. Pretty Facebooky, right?\n\n\n\nI don't yet have the update, so I can't show you how this works yet, but the demo images I've seen will look familiar to Facebook users; tap to tag and add the name of your Twitter friends in the pic. They'll get a notification that they've been tagged and they can remove the tag if they prefer.\n\n\n\nWatch for updates to the official iOS and Android Twitter apps; that's where the photo changes are being rolled out first. Twitter said last week it's coming to the desktop version soon.\n\n\n\nThere is one thing you can do to prepare for the coming torrent of Twitter tagging: Make sure your settings for photo tags are where you want them to be. Even if you don't have the ability to tag yet, you can take care of that in the settings tab, under security and privacy. Note that the default is that anyone can tag you, which is definitely a Facebook-esque option. You can leave it there, you can allow only Twitter friends to tag you or you can shut them off altogether.\n\n\n\nWhat else is coming? A couple folks noticed last week that Twitter had snuck in mentions of how many people had viewed a particular tweet; Twitter's advertisers have long had that ability, but for peons like us, this is a new thing. It's safe to say that the views number is an experimental thing at this point, but as those of us who manage Facebook pages know, it would be an interesting addition, especially for those of us who do some professional tweeting, in addition to post pictures of cats and what we had for breakfast.\n\n\n\nAnd then there's the big one, discovered by an editor at Mashable last week (you can see it in the attached image; there's a link at timesonline.com as well): An entirely re-designed profile page, one that looks an awful lot like what we see when we open our Facebook and Google+ profiles.\n\n\n\nThere's a non-linear timeline. Bigger play for posts with images. And overall, it looks to be a much airier page, although some of that will have to do with the design preferences of individual users. As is the case with tweet-views thing, this is definitely in testing, as opposed to being rolled out en masse. But if it shows up sometime soon, it's going to be a huge change.\n\n\n\nSo, let's recap. Photo tagging? Check. Tweet views, disappearing @s and #s and Facebooky interface? Possibilities all.\n\n\n\nConclusion? Changing the look and feel of Twitter to more closely resemble the one built by the Fighting Zuckerbergs won't solve the issues Twitter has had once it went public -- but it could help assuage the fears of investors while Twitter figures out everything else.\n\n\n\nLike it or not, guys, I'd guess there are big changes coming to Twitter."", ""When Facebook went public, it made the changes necessary to improve its standing with its investors.\nTwitter, which went public last year, is apparently trying to do the same thing.\nTwitter said last week it's coming to the desktop version soon.\nChanging the look and feel of Twitter to more closely resemble the one built by the Fighting Zuckerbergs won't solve the issues Twitter has had once it went public -- but it could help assuage the fears of investors while Twitter figures out everything else.\nLike it or not, guys, I'd guess there are big changes coming to Twitter.""]"
66764,http://grahamcluley.com/2014/03/twitter-photo-tagging/,technology,"['Twitter last week introduced some new photo-related features, including one called photo-tagging which they “helpfully” turned on for users by default.\n\nThe new feature means that anyone can tag you in a photo (even if it’s not a photo of you), which will undoubtedly encourage you to check out the photo.\n\nAnd, because it’s possible to tag up to 10 people in a photo and still have a full 140 characters left for the tweet itself, you can imagine that this will be a feature that some will be delighted to try out.\n\nYep, you’re right. I’m thinking the same thing. it’s easy to imagine that spammers and scammers might love to take advantage of something like this.\n\nOf course, it’s very possible that you also don’t want to be tagged in photos for privacy or vanity reasons too.\n\nSo, what can you do about it?\n\nWell, firstly, you can retrospectively remove your tag from a photo that someone else has already tweeted.\n\nHere’s what Twitter’s own help page says:\n\nTo remove your name or username from photo(s) you’re tagged in, tap into the detail view of the Tweet, then tap the ellipsis (•••) and select Remove tag from photo. You can also stop an account from tagging you by blocking the user. Once you have blocked the user, your tagged name or username will no longer be shown on the photo.\n\nBut if the very thought of being photo-tagged makes your blood boil, here’s how you permanently switch the feature off.\n\nGo to the Twitter website on your desktop or laptop computer, and log into your account.\n\nGo to Settings / Security and Privacy and select from the following photo-tagging privacy options:\n\n* Allow anyone to tag me in photos\n\n* Only allow people I follow to tag me in photos\n\n* Do not allow anyone to tag me in photos\n\nObviously that last option is the one to select if you never want to be tagged in any photos shared on Twitter.\n\nScroll down to the bottom of the page, and press “Save Changes”.\n\nYou’re done!\n\nNow give yourself a pat on the back, and think yourself better off than all of those Facebook users. After all, they have never been given the option to stop people tagging them in unflattering photos, with their only options being to request a tag be removed or to prevent it appearing in their own personal newsfeed.\n\nSo, here’s how I feel about this new photo-tagging feature.\n\nI think it sucks that Twitter turned on this feature by default, and didn’t explicitly tell users that it had enabled this feature in users’ settings without their knowledge. It would have been much classier if Twitter had told users it was introducing the functionality, and managed to convince Tweeters that it was a cool feature and that they should turn it on for themselves.\n\nBut at least Twitter does give users a way to disable the feature. Which is more than Facebook does. So, kudos to Twitter for doing that at the very least.', 'Twitter last week introduced some new photo-related features, including one called photo-tagging which they “helpfully” turned on for users by default.\nOf course, it’s very possible that you also don’t want to be tagged in photos for privacy or vanity reasons too.\nSo, here’s how I feel about this new photo-tagging feature.\nI think it sucks that Twitter turned on this feature by default, and didn’t explicitly tell users that it had enabled this feature in users’ settings without their knowledge.\nBut at least Twitter does give users a way to disable the feature.']"

At this point this is just a rumor, but a pretty scary one.\n\nVivian Schiller, head of News at Twitter, called the #-hashtags and @-replies ""arcane,"" at a recent presentation at the Newspaper Association of America\'s MediaXChange Conference in Denver. Schiller also stated that ""We are working on moving the scaffolding of Twitter into the background.""\n\nWell, that set off a firestorm of surprise and shock.\n\nTwo questions came to mind: What will Twitter use to replace the hashtags and the replies? How soon, if it all, is Twitter going to make the switch or even an update?\n\nTwitter has about a billion registered accounts, but 250 million of those count as real users. The shock of Schiller\'s statement perhaps caused them to lose some users. In any case, the Fast Company reported that in theory, it is perhaps better to hide, rather than eliminate the replies and hashtags. By hiding those features, it could make Twitter more user friendly.\n\nIf Schiller\'s statement is any indication, Twitter has a lot to learn. They have attempted to update their profile page, all be it that it looks similar to Facebook. Twitter has also phased out the ""re-tweet."" Twitter aficionados call it now the manual ""re-tweet,"" Buzzfeed reported.\n\nTwitter\'s internet jargon adds confusion, and not only to regular users. It does not welcome uninitiated users either. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo reiterated what Schiller stated: by pushing the hash-tags and replies into the background, it can be more user friendly to first time users.\n\nCostolo also added that they do not need to change Twitter, just simply make it better. If Twitter did intend to eliminate the hashtags and the replies, it would be difficult, or at least tricky, to connect to a topic or person, Mashable.com reported.\n\nWhile some people doubt that Twitter will get rid of the very thing that has made them work, they are slowly but surely updating the Twitter universe, hopefully in more than 140 characters.', 'In case you haven\'t heard, Twitter might eliminate #-hashtags and @-replies.\nVivian Schiller, head of News at Twitter, called the #-hashtags and @-replies ""arcane,"" at a recent presentation at the Newspaper Association of America\'s MediaXChange Conference in Denver.\nTwo questions came to mind: What will Twitter use to replace the hashtags and the replies?\nIn any case, the Fast Company reported that in theory, it is perhaps better to hide, rather than eliminate the replies and hashtags.\nTwitter CEO Dick Costolo reiterated what Schiller stated: by pushing the hash-tags and replies into the background, it can be more user friendly to first time users.']"
66766,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/27/3-ways-to-value-twitter-today.aspx,technology,"[""Depending on who you ask, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) is either a tool to get real-time updates on your favorite subjects and people, or it's an incomprehensible social media site. The ironic thing is, Twitter might be the best tool for news delivery that millions of people have never used. To try and solve the question of what this business is worth, let's look at three ways investors might value the stock.\n\nValue per user\n\nIf a bigger audience means greater opportunity for growth and monetization, then in theory, Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) user base should be worth more than either Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google+ or Twitter. With a market cap of over $165 billion and 1.2 billion active monthly users, Facebook carries about $140 of market cap per user.\n\nBy comparison, Google+ is a real challenge to value. If Google's market cap was based just on this service alone, Google+'s 300 million users would work out to a value of over $1,300 in market cap per user. Obviously, Google is far more than just Google+. A better comparison might be YouTube's 1 billion users, in which case Google gets about $400 in market cap per user.\n\nTwitter, on the other hand, has a market cap of about $27 billion, and with 241 million monthly active users, this works out to about $112 in market cap per user. Compared to Google, Twitter users are valued far less. However, in comparison to Facebook users, Twitter users are only valued 20% lower.\n\nThough Facebook has about 400% more monthly users than Twitter, Facebook's stock value is 500% higher. This disconnect between users and market cap could mean an opportunity for Twitter investors.\n\nPrice to sales\n\nA core belief among growth investors is that the traditional P/E ratio doesn't work as well as price-to-sales. In theory, a growth stock is plowing extra cash into expansion and not generating earnings. However, as the company reaches scale and these expenses slow down, earnings will explode and catch up to the stock price.\n\nUsing the price-to-sales ratio, the comparison is staggeringly simple. Twitter's price-to-sales ratio is over 40, Facebook's is over 20, and Google's is 7. While it's true that Twitter and Facebook are expected to grow revenue much faster than Google, the difference in valuation is hard to ignore.\n\nIt is possible Twitter will grow revenue by double the amount of Facebook. In the current quarter, Twitter's revenue jumped 116%, compared to a 68% increase at Facebook. However, Twitter needs to make sure it fires on all cylinders to make this valuation worthwhile for investors.\n\nCash Flow\n\nThough huge cash flow isn't expected from many fast-growing companies, a path to free cash flow is always nice to see. Comparing how much free cash flow a company can generate from each dollar of sales may give investors a clue to which company is more efficient.\n\nGoogle is far more established than either Facebook or Twitter when it comes to cash flow generation. In the current quarter, the company generated about $0.20 of core free cash flow for every dollar of sales.\n\nConsidering Facebook's torrid growth, the company's $0.12 of core free cash flow per dollar of sales is very impressive. Where Twitter is concerned, we have to strip away the company's significant stock compensation expenses to find a path to free cash flow. On this non-GAAP basis, Twitter actually produced about $0.06 of core free cash flow. Of course, for this to be a sustainable figure, Twitter will need to find a way to quell its significant stock compensation expenses.\n\nIf Twitter can get past this initial phase as a publically traded company, it's hard not to notice the potential. On a non-GAAP basis, Twitter produced about half as much free cash flow as Facebook and 70% less than Google. However, the company's business model hasn't been centered on monetization, and Twitter has far fewer users to monetize than either of its peers.\n\nThe point\n\nTwitter is a great real-time news feed for those who know how to use it, and the market seems to understand the opportunity. As more users find their way to Twitter, the company can expand the currently limited profile to gain more information for advertising. The limitation on the length of tweets forces users to focus on what they want to say, which should be easier to mine for useful data as well.\n\nTwitter is a great way to get real-time socially sourced news. This is the company's competitive advantage and advertisers should realize this value over time. That is where Twitter is @, and adding TWTR to your Watchlist is just one way to keep up with this #opportunity."", ""With a market cap of over $165 billion and 1.2 billion active monthly users, Facebook carries about $140 of market cap per user.\nIf Google's market cap was based just on this service alone, Google+'s 300 million users would work out to a value of over $1,300 in market cap per user.\nCompared to Google, Twitter users are valued far less.\nHowever, in comparison to Facebook users, Twitter users are only valued 20% lower.\nCash FlowThough huge cash flow isn't expected from many fast-growing companies, a path to free cash flow is always nice to see.""]"

In one of the biggest changes, not official yet, some users have claimed that the historic retweet button inside their iOS app is now named the ‘share’ button.\n\nName changed, not the process\n\nEli Langer from CNBC was the first to notice the tweets from the concerned users, who are certainly witnessing a Facebook Inc.

Affected users are now asked if they want to ‘share’ or add comment and share.\n\nFrom the reactions to the share button, it does not appear that users are happy with the change. In past, Twitter has been careful to pay attention to feedback from the user – it even took back some decisions that offended users. From time to time, the social media company does come out with some tests, so it remains to be seen what would be the ultimate fate of the ‘share’ button that has replaced the popular ‘retweet’ option.\n\nOther recent changes from Twitter\n\nRecently, Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) also offered two more updates surrounding photos. Now a user can tag a photo by tapping, “Who’s in this photo?”, which will automatically notify the person tagged. Also, a user can tag up to 10 people in a photo without worrying about the character count.\n\nThe second update allows users to include up to four photos in a single Tweet, which would relieve users from not sending individual snaps.

The reason from the company was its ‘scaffolding’ was discouraging new users by making it difficult for them to understand and use the service.

He is also known to have donated money to a California Congressman who supported the bill. Mozilla’s most famous product is Firefox, and after Eich’s appointment, some gay developers who worked with Mozilla said they would be boycotting the Firefox Marketplace, the main app storefront for the Firefox mobile OS. App developer Rarebit pulled apps from the Marketplace. ""We morally cannot support a foundation that would not only leave someone with hateful views in power but will give them a promotion and put them in charge of the entire organization,” the CEO said in a statement, as reported by Ars Technica.\n\nAnd then last night it turned out that it wasn’t just app developers outraged over Eich’s appointment. Mozilla employees started tweeting their disapproval of the new CEO, asking Eich to quit. Ars Technica reports that as many as five prominent Mozilla employees tweeted, urging Eich to step down.\n\nHave waited too long to say this.

""I\'m an employee of @mozilla and I\'m asking @brendaneich to step down as CEO,"" he said in one of those tweets, a line which has been adopted by others as well. The embedded tweet above is from Mozilla designer Jessica Klein.\n\nThe internal protests come even as both the Mozilla Foundation and Eich have clearly said they will be increasing their efforts for LGBT outreach. Eich said on his personal blog, “I know there are concerns about my commitment to fostering equality and welcome for LGBT individuals at Mozilla. I hope to lay those concerns to rest, first by making a set of commitments to you. More important, I want to lay them to rest by actions and results.” He then went on to outline what employees and those associated with Mozilla can expect. “Active commitment to equality in everything we do, from employment to events to community-building” was one of the things Eich mentioned, along with “Working with LGBT communities and allies, to listen and learn what does and doesn’t make Mozilla supportive and welcoming.”\n\nMozilla also released a press statement on diversity at the workplace. “Mozilla has always been deeply committed to honoring diversity in sexual orientation and beliefs within our staff and community, across all the project’s activities. One concrete example of this is in our health benefit policies. Mozilla provides the same level of benefits and advantages to domestic partners as we do to married couples across the United States, even in states where it is not mandated,” it said.\n\nBoth statements came prior to the Twitter outburst by some employees and are clearly being seen as hollow words. It remains to be seen whether the controversial appointment of Eich will have a further adverse impact on Firefox and Mozilla, which is looking to make a major push in the mobile space in 2014.

I\'m also grateful for the messages of support. At the same time, I know there are concerns about my commitment to fostering equality and welcome for LGBT individuals at Mozilla. I hope to lay those concerns to rest, first by making a set of commitments to you. More important, I want to lay them to rest by actions and results. A number of Mozillians, including LGBT individuals and allies, have stepped forward to offer guidance and assistance in this. I cannot thank you enough, and I ask for your ongoing help to make Mozilla a place of equality and welcome for all... I know some will be skeptical about this, and that words alone will not change anything. I can only ask for your support to have the time to \'show, not tell\'; and in the meantime express my sorrow at having caused pain.""\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Hampton Catlin and his husband Michael Catlin said they will boycott Firefox, because of Eich\'s $1,000 donation to Prop 8 efforts, until Eich is either fired or announces his views have changed on same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n""Today we were shocked to read that Brendan Eich has been appointed Mozilla CEO,"" the developers said in a statement. ""As a gay couple who were unable to get married in California until recently, we morally cannot support a Foundation that would not only leave someone with hateful views in power, but will give them a promotion and put them in charge of the entire organization.""\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday Eich\'s boss, Mozilla chairwoman Mitchell Baker, also responded to the controversy in her blog:\n\n\n\n""Mozilla\'s commitment to inclusiveness for our LGBT community, and for all underrepresented groups, will not change. Acting for or on behalf of Mozilla, it is unacceptable to limit opportunity for *anyone* based on the nature of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. This is not only a commitment, it is our identity. This commitment is a key requirement for all leadership within Mozilla, including for the CEO, and Brendan shares this commitment as the new Chief Executive Officer... The CEO role is obviously a key role, with a large amount of authority. The CEO must have a commitment to the inclusive nature of Mozilla. This includes of course a commitment to the Community Participation Guidelines, inclusive HR practices and the spirit that underlies them. Brendan has made this commitment. Finally, I\'ve been asked a few times about my own personal views, and so I\'ll add a short comment... I am an avid supporter of equal rights for all. I support equal rights for the LGBT community, I support equal rights for underrepresented groups, and I have some pretty radical views about the role of underrepresented groups in social institutions. I was surprised in 2012, when his donation in support of Proposition 8 came to light, to learn that Brendan and I aren\'t in close alignment here, since I\'ve never seen any indication of anything other than inclusiveness in our work together.""', 'At the same time, I know there are concerns about my commitment to fostering equality and welcome for LGBT individuals at Mozilla.\n""Today we were shocked to read that Brendan Eich has been appointed Mozilla CEO,"" the developers said in a statement.\nThis commitment is a key requirement for all leadership within Mozilla, including for the CEO, and Brendan shares this commitment as the new Chief Executive Officer...\nThe CEO role is obviously a key role, with a large amount of authority.\nThe CEO must have a commitment to the inclusive nature of Mozilla.']"

According to Microsoft’s latest Security Intelligence Report, Windows XP with Service Pack 3 is 5.68 times more vulnerable than Windows 8, with 82.4 percent higher malware infection rate.\n\nMicrosoft typically supports each version of the Windows OS for less than ten years before moving its resources to newer products.\n\nWindows XP, however, has been on the lifeline for more than 12 years, the longest of any version of Windows. Support was scheduled to be terminated in 2009, but was subsequently extended to 2014 due to popular demand.\n\nSince then, Microsoft has been trying to convince users to migrate from Windows XP. In Singapore, the effort concentrated mainly on enterprise users, as tech-savvy consumers tend to use the latest platforms available.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, Windows XP share in Singapore has seen a 4.76 per cent decline from 12.12 percent a year ago to just 7.36 per cent as of February 2014, based on figures from StatCounter.\n\nBut Singapore is the least of Microsoft’s worries. Windows XP in emerging countries in the region still command market share well into the double digits. In Vietnam, for instance, 46 per cent of PCs are still running on Windows XP.\n\nClearly, Microsoft’s battle won’t end so soon. Even after the support switch to Windows XP is flipped, the company will still face an uphill fight to keep converting users to newer versions of Windows, or risk leaving millions of users stranded and vulnerable.\n\nTo make it easier for users to switch to newer systems, Microsoft has partnered with Laplink to provide an application called PCmover Express, which copies files and settings over from a Windows XP PC to a newer Windows version, for free.\n\nBusiness users can find out more about the risks they may face, and how they can migrate their operations to newer platforms on the Retiring Windows XP site.\n\nWhile your Windows XP machine will not stop working, the security threats facing Windows XP are real.\n\nTim Rains, Microsoft’s director of trustworthy computing, noted in a blog post that since security updates will never become available for Windows XP to address the same loopholes that plague Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines, Windows XP will essentially have a “zero day” vulnerability forever.\n\nIf you’re reading this on a Windows XP PC, we’d like to hear why, so sound off in the comments below!', 'That’s because every new security loophole found and patched in Windows 7 and Windows 8 can potentially be reverse-engineered for Windows XP, which means hackers can wait until they have an opportunity to strike.\nWindows XP, however, has been on the lifeline for more than 12 years, the longest of any version of Windows.\nWhile your Windows XP machine will not stop working, the security threats facing Windows XP are real.\nTim Rains, Microsoft’s director of trustworthy computing, noted in a blog post that since security updates will never become available for Windows XP to address the same loopholes that plague Windows 7 and Windows 8 machines, Windows XP will essentially have a “zero day” vulnerability forever.\nIf you’re reading this on a Windows XP PC, we’d like to hear why, so sound off in the comments below!']"

One tactic? Offer them a $100 dollar gift card towards a new machine or tablet, plus data transfer and tech support if they choose to upgrade their Microsoft PC to Windows 7 or higher. The tech giant is hoping these new incentives will nudge the millions of users still utilizing the 12-year old OS into the next generation of Microsoft computing technology.\n\nSo why has it been so hard to convince users to switch? Generally speaking, new technology and new operating systems are met with enthusiasm from users looking to stay current in the ever changing technology world. Just ask any iPhone user or tablet enthusiast. But according to Time Magazine:\n\n“Windows XP is the operating system that refuses to die. The software is now 12 years old — a dinosaur in the fast-moving technology sector — but runs nearly 30 percent of all Internet-connected desktop PCs, according to analytics firm Net Market Share.”\n\nAnd Microsoft has to accept the majority of blame for this predicament of users unwilling to upgrade their machines. The disastrous Windows Vista experiment left a sour taste in the mouths of many when it was first launched in 2006. In trying to keep pace with Apple’s slick operating system, Microsoft Vista tried utilizing interface features that would keep users locked into their PCs rather than making the switch to their competitor. But assorted bugs and added security features ended up souring the user experience and many failed to make the upgrade from XP to Vista due to the negative press surrounding it.\n\nWindows 7 was met with general skepticism as well, but ultimately became, according to the Time article, “the most popular OS in the world right now, with a market share of nearly 50 percent.”\n\nThat being said there is still the 30% that needs to upgrade from XP. According to Time the main hangers-on are schools and small businesses who can purchase refurbished computers on the cheap capable of handling their day-to-day operations despite the outdated Windows XP OS.\n\nAnd while many feel that bribing users to upgrade may be crossing a line, Microsoft hopes that by offering incentives like the gift card, it can overcome the financial burden of performing an upgrade. According to a report on the LA Times web site, “the promotion lasts through June 15 and is available only to customers who can verify that they are currently using a Windows XP machine.”', 'With Microsoft announcing an end-of-life for the beloved operating system Windows XP next week, the tech giant is getting desperate to make sure people upgrade their system before April 8th.\nOffer them a $100 dollar gift card towards a new machine or tablet, plus data transfer and tech support if they choose to upgrade their Microsoft PC to Windows 7 or higher.\nBut according to Time Magazine:“Windows XP is the operating system that refuses to die.\nThe disastrous Windows Vista experiment left a sour taste in the mouths of many when it was first launched in 2006.\nAnd while many feel that bribing users to upgrade may be crossing a line, Microsoft hopes that by offering incentives like the gift card, it can overcome the financial burden of performing an upgrade.']"

In fact it is so desperate that it is willing to offer a cash incentive if XP Users agree to abandon the OS, reports Tom’s Guide.\n\nEarly this week Microsoft launched an upgrade program that promises US$ 100 as instant rebate if users who were still clinging to Windows XP are willing to upgrade to Windows 8.1, the Redmond based company’s latest OS for the desktops. The upgrade offer is valid till June 15th and is available for users residing in United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. A store representative that Tom’s Guide called–up ‘clarified’ that the person had to be watching the Windows XP Offer Page from a Windows XP running machine, just to ensure he or she was eligible for the upgrade rebate.\n\nThe Microsoft Store promotional page states, “The $100 rebate offer is valid on select PC or Surface devices priced $599 or more”. Ironically, many of the users who are still using Windows XP own a dedicated PC with a ‘cabinet’. However, the upgrade offer is valid only for laptops, all-in-one desktops or Surface Pro 2 tablets. Two out of the three hardware categories never really used Windows XP anyways.\n\nThis makes the offer immediately redundant for people who have been using the old clunky desktops with huge cabinets that housed an IDE hard drive, a CD ROM drive and perhaps even sported a 3.5 Inch Floppy drive too. Moreover, PCs still running Windows XP regularly, will have to be relatively old (read ancient) with limited RAM and would certainly not sport any new chips from Intel’s processor line–up in the multi–core series (Core i3, i5, i7).\n\nSuch old PCs won’t be able to offer a smooth Windows 8.1 experience once upgraded. This means the user will have to consider upgrading the hardware and chances are high that all the internal components may have to be swapped–out for newer variants, since there will be compatibility issues. So the user is left with no other option, but to ditch the Windows XP machine & buy a relatively expensive Windows 8 computer.\n\nMicrosoft Store representatives also made it clear that any ‘upgrade’ meant the user had to leave his or her old device at the store before they could carry home a new device bought with the rebate. As an upgrade incentive package, Microsoft is offering free data transfer from an XP machine using Laplink PCmover Express, but this too appears to be a thoughtless addition since any XP user can download the free software and execute the migration process themselves. Additionally Microsoft is offering 90 days of the Microsoft Signature Experience, which every shopper is entitled to anyways.\n\nWindows 8 recently surpassed the 10% mark in installations and usage. But Windows XP still runs on more than 30% of the PCs. Windows 7, Windows 8’s immediate predecessor, still runs on 47% of the machines. Windows XP will be getting killed soon by the maker himself, but such offers certainly won’t convince a user who has steadfastly stuck with Windows XP.\n\n[Image Credit | gtaforums]', 'Microsoft is in a unique dilemma owing to its yesteryear Desktop Operating System (OS) Windows XP.\nIronically, many of the users who are still using Windows XP own a dedicated PC with a ‘cabinet’.\nTwo out of the three hardware categories never really used Windows XP anyways.\nSo the user is left with no other option, but to ditch the Windows XP machine & buy a relatively expensive Windows 8 computer.\nWindows XP will be getting killed soon by the maker himself, but such offers certainly won’t convince a user who has steadfastly stuck with Windows XP.']"

If you hold any kind of data for customers, it’s not something you can afford to ignore.\n\n“Failing to update to a newer operating system may see companies fined because those that hold customer data are required to take measures to protect themselves from hackers.”\n\nA spokesperson from Microsoft confirmed the April 8 deadline.\n\nShe said: “Windows XP users will no longer receive new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content updates from Microsoft.\n\n“This support lifecycle policy for Windows XP was first announced in October 2002 so customers could plan for their IT investments and migrations and since that time, we’ve been working hard to let our customers know about the end of support deadline.\n\n“Microsoft first announced that support for Windows XP would end on April 8, 2014, back in 2007.\n\nPCs running Windows XP after April 8 should not be considered to be protected, and it is important that customers migrate to a current supported operating system such as Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 so they can receive regular security updates to protect their computer from malicious attacks.\n\n“Windows XP and Office 2003 were great software releases more than a decade ago, but technology has evolved dramatically over the past 12 years and modern devices are not only faster and have greater performance than devices running older operating systems, but come with greater security features, new and improved networking tools, modern apps and more.”\n\nWindows XP was released in 2001 and by 2006, more than 400million copies were in use worldwide.

The firm rushed out Windows 8.1 last autumn, but it wasn\'t enough to reverse the lack of market momentum and the lingering effects of hard times in the economy, so 2013 PC sales were generally down for the year.\n\nRising sales of tablets and smartphones also contributed to last year\'s decline in PC sales by taking market share, but Microsoft\'s Surface tablets flopped so miserably that Microsoft had to write off inventory and, despite sacrificing Nokia\'s former dominance in mobile phones, its Windows Phone devices struggled with low market share.\n\nMicrosoft was failing on all fronts in the last quarter of 2013, so no wonder it doubled down on its plans to retire Windows XP, which was still running on nearly 30 percent of installed PC systems.\n\n\n\nThe firm thought it saw an opportunity to extract more money from Windows XP users by forcing them to upgrade their PC systems to its latest release of Windows, coincidentally also helping its PC OEM partners by driving sales of new PCs. Not only would Microsoft sell millions of copies of Windows 8.1, but in addition that would also force those users to upgrade Microsoft Office as well, which is far more expensive than Windows itself, drawing even more revenue into the company.\n\nOne can almost visualise the now former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer rubbing his hands with glee, contemplating how he would turn around disappointing sales of Windows 8.1 by forcing Windows XP users to upgrade. Except it hasn\'t worked.\n\nWhat Microsoft didn\'t reckon on was that businesses and consumers that are still running Windows XP find it adequate to meet their needs and aren\'t about to replace it anytime soon. Earlier this month, Net Applications reported that Windows XP market share actually increased in February as its stubborn users dug in their heels. It doesn\'t look like that\'s going to change next week, either.\n\nMicrosoft also didn\'t recognise that many Windows XP users have older PCs that they likely bought five to 15 years ago, and many if not most of those PC systems aren\'t powerful enough to run Windows 8.1. Many of them have relatively slow Pentium 4 or Celeron processors, only 256MB or 512MB of RAM, and old hard drives with less than 10GB capacity. Those PC systems can run Windows XP, but upgrading to Windows 8.1 would force those users to buy new PCs at substantial cost.\n\nFor many Windows XP users, including a lot of small businesses as well as relatively unsophisticated or barely computer literate consumers, many of whom think that the operating system is just part of ""the computer"", installing another operating system seems unnecessary and maybe more than a bit daunting. If their PC does what they need to do, they see no reason to buy another one, and their attitude to Windows and applications software can probably be described by the saying, ""If it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it.""\n\nI\'ve never used Windows XP, because I\'ve run Linux on all my PC systems for about 15 years, but Microsoft sysadmins claim it can be configured to be fairly secure if all of the service packs and patches have been applied.\n\nThus, if Windows XP users have done that and also have a good antivirus software package and keep that up to date, they probably can remain reasonably safe, as long as they also avoid clicking on links in suspicious email spam, don\'t do their banking online, and don\'t frequent disreputable websites.\n\nAs Microsoft ceases updating its Security Essentials service for Windows XP - which the firm has already extended until July 2015 due to ongoing usage - some users might want to upgrade their antivirus software, but that might be all they really need to do in order to retain peace of mind for quite a while.\n\nDespite Microsoft\'s desperate bluster and rather shrill imprecations, Windows XP users and businesses shouldn\'t have to buy new PCs or upgrade to Windows 8.1 if they can\'t afford it right now or don\'t believe they need or want to do so. Microsoft is just going to have to live with the fact that it can\'t force Windows XP users to give it more money, and keep looking for new revenue streams outside of its old Windows cash cow. µ', ""One can almost visualise the now former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer rubbing his hands with glee, contemplating how he would turn around disappointing sales of Windows 8.1 by forcing Windows XP users to upgrade.\nEarlier this month, Net Applications reported that Windows XP market share actually increased in February as its stubborn users dug in their heels.\nThose PC systems can run Windows XP, but upgrading to Windows 8.1 would force those users to buy new PCs at substantial cost.\nDespite Microsoft's desperate bluster and rather shrill imprecations, Windows XP users and businesses shouldn't have to buy new PCs or upgrade to Windows 8.1 if they can't afford it right now or don't believe they need or want to do so.\nMicrosoft is just going to have to live with the fact that it can't force Windows XP users to give it more money, and keep looking for new revenue streams outside of its old Windows cash cow.""]"

He wants to know what he should do.\n\nMicrosoft says it has provided security updates for Windows XP for the past 12 years and has decided to stop doing that and invest its resources into more recent technology instead.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) too sounded a warning last week asking banks to upgrade their systems.\n\nThe ageing operating system has long been a target of hackers and a Microsoft report estimates that Windows XP installations are six times more likely to be infected by malware than Windows 8 machines.\n\nATM manufacturers such as NCR are also providing software suites on their machines which prevent attacks from malware. Navroze Dastur, managing director at NCR India, explained that the companys Solidcore software suite whitelists applications running on an ATM and prevents changes on the operating system by malicious software.

And, if your existing computers are a bit ancient, they might not run the newer Windows as well as they did XP.\n\nSecond option, is to buy new computers for everyone, after doing good backups. Also not cheap.\n\nThe reality is, that you seem to have very few choices other than that. Windows (and more importantly, Microsoft Office, and a number of other proprietary software such as some document comparison tools or billing software only available for Windows) are still the gold standard in the corporate environment and particularly in law firms.\n\nJudges are doing it, could you?\n\nLegally India recently asked lawyers on social media whether an option for corporate and litigation lawyers could be Linux – the free (open source) operating system that’s known for being ultra-secure but not very user-friendly (and uses a Penguin as its mascot). Here’s what they said. It has alternatives for Microsoft Office such as Libre Office and Open Office, which are also available for free.\n\nAdvocate Nandita Saikia, tweeting @nsaikia, is a rather unusual example of a tech-literate lawyer (having grown up with astro-physicists who used Unix in the 80s). She wrote: “I used Ubuntu [Linux] till quite recently. I used it for everything… Changed mainly [because] Open Office formatting didn't always look the same on Windows which, for me, was a major irritant. As was having to contend with blank looks all the time.\n\n“For formatting, I've found Google Docs to be reasonably useless. [Microsoft] Word just works best because everyone uses it and it's a pretty safe bet that docs formatted on Word won't look bizarre to others.”\n\nManish (@jimanish), says is on Linux too and he and @_justice1 rightly add that most courts use it too. (The Supreme Court moved to Ubuntu in 2011, and a number of other government departments and courts have moved to Linux too for security and costs reasons).\n\nHowever, while Saikia says she would recommend Linux to other lawyers, when asked whether she thinks law firms would try Linux, she notes: “Have found there's MUCH resistance to experimenting with anything new & the money isn't [very] relevant to many law firm lawyers...”\n\nIndeed, that could be the biggest problem in migrating to an open source operating system for your office, alongside the need to train your staff and tech team (if you have one) in how to install and administer Linux.\n\nDo you have any experience of doing legal work with Linux? Do you know any law firms that are using Linux? Or XP? Can it become the future standard in Indian law? Please leave a comment below\n\nPs: If you’re interested in reading more on this topic, do check out the Yahoo Originals story today, or ask away in the comments for some useful links on how to install Linux or anything else.\n\nPps: A grand total of 1.9 per cent of Legally India visitors are using Linux on their computers right now (excluding Android mobile devices, which technically are a version of Linux).

66840,http://embedded-computing.com/20762-10-things-we-wont-miss-about-windows-xp-2/,technology,"['1. It’s a ticking time bomb…\n\n…at least in terms of security. Windows XP is a virus hot bed waiting to happen. Microsoft’s Security Intelligence Reports (SIRs) clearly show that XP is a magnet for malware. This is one of the reasons the computing giant is putting the kibosh on XP support. After extended support ends in April 2014 the gates will open for cyber criminals just itching to hack into outdated XP systems. It’s enough to send chills up your spine.\n\n2. You can forget about BYOD\n\nIf your business wants to implement an of-the-minute BYOD policy, you seriously need to move on from XP. Windows 7 and 8 are all set up and ready to support smartphones and tablets, while XP doesn’t have the mobility features to support a notebook, let alone newer technology. If you want any time, any place connectivity – XP will get you laughed out of town.\n\n3. You just can’t get the drivers\n\nForget about hooking up new technology with the greatest of ease. Outdated XP doesn’t have the drivers to make it so. If you’re using new hardware, chances are you’re going to need to trawl the internet to find a driver that works – all the while risking downloading one of those many XP security threats by accident in the process.\n\n4. Ugly gaming makes us sad\n\nIf you’re a gamer you should have jumped off the good ship XP many moons ago. The operating system is only able to support DirectX video cards up to version 9. In 2010 the vast majority of games were designed for DirectX 10 and 11, leaving gaming on XP a graphically rubbish no-no.\n\n5. Intrusive Windows updates drive us crazy\n\nWhatever you’re doing, no matter how important, Windows Update interrupts asking to restart your computer. In a blind mid-work panic it is all too easy to hit OK rather than to stall the little blighter for 15 minutes.\n\n6. Burning to DVD shouldn’t be difficult…\n\nBut XP makes it so. You can burn to CD using XP but if you want to copy files and movies to DVD you’ll be wanting a more up to date operating system.\n\n7. File searches take ages\n\nHunting for a particular file? Don’t worry, XP will find it in about 8 years’ time. File searches are far faster on recent OSs, overcoming the rage incurred by a 30 minute trawl for a Word document.\n\n8. Faffing with wireless connections is infuriating\n\nLater operating systems remember and organise all of your wireless connections wherever you go so you only have to set them up once. XP doesn’t do this which made working on the move a royal little pain.\n\n9. Incompatible applications were a headache\n\nIE9 and IE10 just aren’t compatible with XP, if you want to run anything above IE8, an upgrade is in order. Meanwhile, HTML5 is a total no-go on XP and you can forget all about .NET Framework 4.5 or above. .NET Framework 4.0 is supported but you’ll need to upgrade if you want anything more evolved.\n\n10. Desktop provisioning is tricky\n\nDesktop provisioning was a bit of a pain in XP. If you want to increase control over numerous VDUs via Windows thin clients while cutting costs and boosting security, XP is not the perfect platform by any stretch of the imagination. Windows 7 meanwhile has several features installed as standard which make provisioning for both physical desktops and VDI far simpler. These tool help to migrate user personalities, assist deployment of Windows 7 clean installs and enable the upgrade of existing scenarios across to Windows 7. Available standard tools include:\n\nMAP 4.0\n\nApplication Compatibility Toolkit 5.5 (including Standard User Analyzer)\n\nAutomated Installation Kit (including USMT)\n\nMicrosoft Deployment Toolkit 2010\n\nand many more tools at your disposal\n\nIf you’ve written off XP but don’t much care for Windows 7 or 8 either, provisioning tools are also available from Atalantis, Vmware and Citrix.\n\nView 10Zig’s Windows XP countdown to EOL clock at http://www.10zig.eu/static/xp/.\n\nPete Campbell, 10ZiG', 'Windows XP is a virus hot bed waiting to happen.\nThis is one of the reasons the computing giant is putting the kibosh on XP support.\nIntrusive Windows updates drive us crazyWhatever you’re doing, no matter how important, Windows Update interrupts asking to restart your computer.\nIf you want to increase control over numerous VDUs via Windows thin clients while cutting costs and boosting security, XP is not the perfect platform by any stretch of the imagination.\nView 10Zig’s Windows XP countdown to EOL clock at http://www.10zig.eu/static/xp/.']"
66841,http://www.infoworld.com/t/microsoft-windows/windows-7-sp1-downloads-dry-microsoft-distributor-digital-river-239224,technology,"['For Windows customers without immediate access to MSDN (or the defunct TechNet), acquiring genuine Windows ISOs has been a frustrating and ridiculously complex experience: Microsoft tells you to ask your hardware manufacturer for a Windows ISO; the hardware manufacturer either ignores the request or sends you a crap-filled recovery DVD, frequently charging you for the inconvenience.\n\nThat changed several years ago, when Microsoft contracted with outsourcing company Digital River to provide download services for Windows bits. But in the past few days, the links for Windows 7 SP1 versions at Digital River stopped working. It isn\'t clear if there\'s a technical problem or if Microsoft\'s contract with Digital River has lapsed.\n\nMost Windows customers came to know about Digital River through various Windows student/academic discount offers: Digital River apparently ran the student discount programs and provided ""genuine"" Windows bits for download. Over the years, many Windows experts -- including MVPs posting on the Microsoft Answers forum -- pointed customers to the Digital River links that contained real, direct-from-Microsoft copies of the software. Microsoft MVP and Answers forum moderator Andre de Costa put it this way:\n\nSince it is being download directly from Digital River servers, as long as you own a genuine license, which you probably should have already, then you are free to download it. The way I see it, the license takes precedence over the medium. If you bought Windows 7 retail, then it will already be accompanied with install media, if you bought it from the Microsoft Store for instance, you have the option of downloading it anytime you want or have discs shipped to you or if its a box license, you will have two physical discs. The persons these Digital River downloads would be most suitable for, even if they didn\'t purchase through the Student upgrade program are persons with OEM preloads who might have lost their recovery partitions or media and can\'t bother with the process of obtaining recovery media. Same applies to retail discs, the process of ordering, shipping, nominal fee.\n\nWorth noting: A year ago, Digital River announced in an SEC filing that it had come to an agreement with Microsoft to ""build, host and manage the Microsoft Store, an e-commerce store that supports the sale and fulfillment of Microsoft and third party software as well as consumer electronics products, to customers throughout the world."" It\'s possible that downloads from the Microsoft Store may, in fact, be coming from Digital River servers.\n\nLinks to Digital River\'s servers for Windows 7 SP1 bits were widely published shortly after SP1 was released. While using Digital River\'s bandwidth to download Microsoft products seems a gray area, the fact is that Windows 7 SP1 would run for up to 30 days without a product key -- clearly, Microsoft allowed installation of the product by those who didn\'t have a product key -- and the only way to get a permanent copy of Win7 SP1 was by purchasing a key from Microsoft or one of its dealers.\n\nStarting about March 20, the Win7 SP1 links to Digital River stopped working. I can find no explanation from either Microsoft or Digital River for the interruption. A request for information from Microsoft\'s PR agency didn\'t bring an immediate answer. (I\'ll update this post with future details.)\n\nOddly, the Digital River links for Windows 7 itself are still working fine. According to Jan Krohn at HeiDoc.net, the only versions currently available from Digital River are the windows 7 RTM (not SP1) versions in U.S. English and Spanish.\n\nIf you want Windows 7 SP1 in either U.S. English or Spanish, you have to download and install Win7 from one of the links, then go through the (lengthy) process of applying Service Pack 1 from Windows Update.\n\nIt\'s possible that Digital River\'s servers are down and have been down for a week. Given Digital River\'s prominence in the e-commerce community, however, that seems unlikely.\n\nIt\'s also possible that Digital River\'s contract with Microsoft is being tested. MVP and Answers Community moderator J W Stuart points to an article in the Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal, dated last May, that says, ""Digital River Inc. shares rose 4.25 percent on Wednesday after it announced that it had extended is distribution deal with Microsoft to March 2014. Microsoft is Digital River\'s largest customer, accounting for about 28 percent of the Minnetonka company\'s revenue last year.""\n\nPerhaps we\'re witnessing the beginning of the end of easily accessible, verified genuine Windows 7 bits.\n\nThis article, ""Windows 7 SP1 downloads dry up at Microsoft distributor Digital River,"" was originally published at InfoWorld.com.

Although there was plenty of advance warning, XP remains the second most popular operating system and, according to NetMarketShare, is still used by more than a quarter of all users.\n\nUnfortunately, the end of support for an operating system as popular as Windows XP brings with it very serious security risks with its continued use. After April 8, unsupported XP systems will no longer be able to receive security updates and patches to any known vulnerabilities. Security experts believe that adversaries have been holding on to the otherwise unknown vulnerabilities for use after April 8 to maximize their potential impact when the operating system will no longer be patched.\n\nMaking matters even worse for lingering Windows XP users is the fact that future patches for Windows 7 and Windows 8 will make it easier for attackers to compromise unsupported XP systems because of the architecture and code base shared between Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 8.\n\nWhen patches are provided for Windows 7 and 8, exploit developers can analyze the patch, reverse-engineer the security updates and then apply what they’ve learned about the vulnerability in the common code base to attack XP. Ordinarily, attackers have a limited amount of time to exploit vulnerable systems before patches are deployed. But for future Windows 7/8 vulnerabilities that also apply to unsupported XP systems, this small window of opportunity will turn into an open door for attackers. Any unsupported Windows XP systems will always remain vulnerable. As Microsoft stated in its security blog, “Windows XP will essentially have a ‘zero day’ vulnerability forever.”\n\nUnderstanding the very real security risks associated with the end-of-life of Windows XP is critical.

According to IDC, tablet sales in India grew 56.4 percent year-on-year to reach 4.14 million units in 2013, while Gartner says that worldwide sales of tablets grew 68 percent in 2013 over the past year. Nothing else in the world of tech is growing quite as fast.\n\nSo, chances are, if you’re not using a tablet already you are looking for one, because from homemakers to students to working professionals, everyone can get more done through the tablet form factor. And trying to satiate this hunger, numerous technology manufacturers are now dabbling in creating tablets that suit every person’s needs.\n\nWindows has been a powerhouse in the PC segment and is now bringing in tremendous innovation into the tablet space. Here are ten reasons why you should look closely at a Windows 8.1 tablet for your needs:\n\nWide range of budget devices to choose from\n\nFrom 8 inches to 13 inches in size, from HP to Lenovo, from Asus to Samsung, from Microsoft to Dell, the options for Windows 8.1 powered tablets are so vast that buyers are spoilt for choice. With a wide range of Windows tablets now competing for the consumer’s attention, most of these brands are available at very competitive prices. And that is one reason why a Windows 8.1 powered tablet will be a cool buy over any other device, because money saved is money that can be used to buy accessories, or even more gadgets!\n\nSuperior specs: built for real work\n\nA Windows 8.1 tablet rides high on the utility factor, thanks to Microsoft Office. This is an area where all other tablets lag behind. While all Windows 8.1 tablets are capable of supporting MS Excel, MS PowerPoint, MS Outlook and other applications from the very popular Microsoft Office suite, other tablets end up being just bigger-screen alternatives to smart phones. Simply put, with Windows 8.1 tablets you can go far beyond just viewing files, to also creating and editing them, leveraging a mobile-computing experience in the true sense of the term.\n\nAlso, powered by advanced processors for high speeds and with superior build quality for all-purpose use, one does not have to worry about glitches in a Windows tablet’s performance. They also boast of long battery life, making them reliable and efficient for heavy-duty work.\n\nMaximum engagement: Apps for all purposes\n\nIf Microsoft Office wasn’t enough, you get access to over 1.5 lakh applications to play with on a single Windows tablet. Travel applications, applications for entertainment, news, sports, finance and lot more makes the entire experience fun, while keeping you productive.\n\nAll purpose ports: connectivity to a wide range of devices\n\nWith Windows 8.1 tablets Microsoft has taken the utility angle a notch higher by offering connectivity to a wide array of devices, through the integration of all-purpose ports. So you can connect your Windows 8.1 tablets to a TV via the HDMI port, Internet via a plug-and-play dongle, and peripherals like a keyboard, mouse, and a printer via the USB port.\n\nCustomisable with movable Live Tiles\n\nThe mobile computing experience gets even more fun with customisable Live Tiles on Windows 8.1 tablets, making the user interface a superior one that’s built for ease of use. You can get these Live Tiles right under your fingertips on the Start Screen for quicker access and a unique, personalised experience.\n\nHybrid tablets powered with Windows 8.1\n\nCarrying forward the personalised experience, most Windows 8.1 tablets that are hybrid slates can connect to docks and detachable keyboards. So your tablet can double up as mini-laptop to get some serious work done, when you need to type a lot for instance, which isn’t easy on a touch screen.\n\nMulti-tasking capabilities\n\nWith so many features to put to use, it is needless to say that Windows 8.1 tablets are built for multi-tasking. You can get more than one thing done at a time, and make the most of your tablet, on the go.\n\n\n\nMaximum entertainment: great gaming experience\n\nAll work and no play would really make a power-packed tablet very dull, wouldn’t it? With some great specs under the hood, Windows 8.1 tablets are built to offer an amazing gaming experience. They allow you to squeeze the most out of Windows Store by choosing your favourite games. And as mentioned above, you will not have to worry about battery life with a lightweight form factor allowing you to get your share of entertainment for long hours.\n\nEverlasting dependability\n\nA history of evolution and innovation has made us rely on Windows with unmatchable trust for decades. It is easy to picture ourselves using a Windows 8.1 tablet for years to come. And the device remains relevant to suit all your needs with regular updates, promising long-term viability.\n\nSupport for awesome services\n\nSkype, Xbox Live, OneDrive, et al, Windows 8.1 tablet OS give you access to a host of online services that lets you keep in touch with your peers and family virtually from anywhere and everywhere.\n\nAnd well, there’s more.

And with that in mind, we\'ve been busy running some features imparting tips for Windows 7 lately – and this is another instalment in the series.\n\nIn this article, we\'ll look at how to make Windows 7 more secure. For more tips on the OS, check out our tips to make Windows 7 easier to use, 11 tips and tricks to give Windows 7 a speed boost, and 5 neat Registry hacks for Windows 7.\n\nControl what applications are used\n\nA feature called AppLocker adds another layer of protection that limits the use of applications to a known list of safe programs. You can even set up rules for authorised applications to cover all future versions of a file so you don\'t have to reconfigure AppLocker for updated software. Launch AppLocker by typing GPEDIT.MSC in the Start menu Search bar and press Enter, then navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Application Control Policies > AppLocker. From here you select Executable Rule, Windows Installer Rule and Script Rule. Then you can choose to apply this rule by Publisher, File hash or Path. Choosing Publisher, for example, will whitelist all apps from a specific digital signature, which will cover software updates as well. Choosing Path will restrict the execution of programs to a directory path.\n\nProtect your data in the event your system goes missing\n\nIf you ever lose your laptop, you can rest assured that unauthorised users can\'t recover your hard disk data by using BitLocker, a feature included in Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate editions. BitLocker will protect your data as long as your computer was powered off when it went missing. Recovering data requires access to the BitLocker keys or passwords associated with the locked volumes.\n\nThankfully, locating recovery passwords and keys with Windows 7 is much easier than with the tools in Windows Vista. Make sure your BitLocker keys and passwords are backed up by going to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption. Then choose the protected drive within the Operating System Drives node. Configure BitLocker so that passwords and keys are backed up to Active Directory when BitLocker protection is activated by enabling the following settings: ""Save BitLocker recovery information to AD DS for OS drives settings,"" and ""Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for OS drives.""\n\nEncrypt your removable drives\n\nWindows 7\'s new BitLocker To Go feature lets you protect removable drives without the need to buy special software. Be sure to carefully save the 40-digit recovery key, so you won\'t lose access even if you forget the passphrase. And bear in mind that the encrypted drive will open in read-only mode on pre-Windows 7 computers. Also, while only Enterprise and Ultimate editions can create BTG-encrypted drives, other editions can use them once created.\n\nKeep your kids safe\n\nWindows 7\'s Parental Controls let you limit how much computer time children have, their access to programs and games, and the times at which they can use certain programs. Access Parental Controls from the Control Panel > User Accounts and Family Safety. Then select or create a non-admin account for your child to use, and select what restrictions you wish to impose on that account. For added protection you can download the free Windows Live Family Safety, which lets you filter websites and monitor your child\'s activities while he or she is online.\n\nBack up on a regular schedule\n\nWindow 7\'s Backup and Restore Centre feature lets you select folders, libraries, and drives to back up on a regular schedule. To use it click Back Up Your Computer from the Control Panel. From there you can back up files to an external drive, network, or DVD. You can change the backup schedule or manually back up files at any time.', ""Despite Windows 8 being out for quite some time now, most folks are still using Windows 7, as you're probably aware.\nFor more tips on the OS, check out our tips to make Windows 7 easier to use, 11 tips and tricks to give Windows 7 a speed boost, and 5 neat Registry hacks for Windows 7.\nLaunch AppLocker by typing GPEDIT.MSC in the Start menu Search bar and press Enter, then navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Application Control Policies > AppLocker.\nFrom here you select Executable Rule, Windows Installer Rule and Script Rule.\nMake sure your BitLocker keys and passwords are backed up by going to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption.""]"
66850,http://healthitsecurity.com/2014/03/27/how-will-windows-xp-end-of-support-affect-health-it-security/,technology,"[""By Patrick Ouellette\n\nMarch 27, 2014 - As is the case with most pending vendor support deadlines, the upcoming end of Microsoft Windows XP support on April 8, 2014 has been a polarizing topic in the enterprise and healthcare spaces. There are some organizations that may be unaware that Microsoft will no longer be providing security patches and others that are building Fort Knox 2.0 because of the XP end of support.\n\nHowever, a few IT security professionals within healthcare organizations told HealthITSecurity.com that they believe the biggest impact will likely be on smaller healthcare organizations. The reality for these organizations is that they must account for projects such as ICD-10 or Meaningful Use and upgrading their XP machines may go on the back-burner out of necessity. Without the proper funding and IT security talent available to some providers, these security concerns become that much more difficult to manage.\n\nStephen Person, Network & Security Engineer at North Valley Hospital and HealthCare Information Security and Privacy Practitioner (HCISPP) said he guarantees that many organizations are looking at the end-of-life of Windows XP.\n\nThe obvious fear is that there’s someone out there squatting on a vulnerability that they don’t know about yet and as soon as the support life ends, they’re going to have this XP zero-day. I believe that probably what’s happening is everyone is containing their environments as tightly as they can at the network level and at the access control level. And [most organizations should] have a plan to get off of XP [if they're already not].\n\nSome organizations may be pegged in a hole at the moment, Person explained, because there are some healthcare vendors that may not support newer environments. Therefore, those organizations wouldn’t have a choice other than to use XP. He said that organizations should look at potential Windows XP upgrades from a risk perspective and treat their environments as though XP vulnerabilities are the reality. “We’re security, so we need to be paranoid about everything,” Person said.\n\nJeffrey Brown, Lawrence General Hospital CIO, echoed some of these thoughts as he explained that his organization tries to be very proactive about end-of-life hardware and software. Lawrence General has a whole program in place that tracks and monitors where it’s at in terms of end of life technology and it continually monitors that list. “We do have a few rogue machines that are on XP and we have a nice transition plan for those,” he said. “But I think about those thousands of smaller community hospitals where I can see that kind of transition being burdensome.”\n\nBrown also offered a reminder that Windows XP end of life support isn’t necessarily treated in a vacuum among organizations that have multiple responsibilities they’re dealing with, especially in 2014. These projects include ICD-10, Stage 2 Meaningful Use, and growing security needs such as BYOD policies.\n\nIn isolation, the transition from Windows XP might not seem like a big leap. But for resource and financially-constrained organizations that are dealing with a multitude of these other complex problems, it’s a small thorn in their side that could ultimately end up being a bigger deal than most people anticipate.\n\nPhil Alexander, Information Security Officer at UMC Health System, also agreed that he’s worried about smaller organizations dealing with the XP end of life. He said that even at UMC, there are some legacy apps that it can secure by putting them into a firewalled-off area because it has the resources to do so.\n\nIn general, it scares me more for smaller organizations such as clinics and doctor’s offices that don’t have the resources to be able to [upgrade their operating systems]. Many of them don’t have a dedicated security person on staff.\n\nAlexander added that he believes many organizations, including his own in UMC, moved up too slowly with the upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7. He said that about 15 percent of UMC’s machines are currently in the process of being upgraded to Windows 7 and the migration was mainly precipitated by the killing of XP support. “We’ll meet the deadline, but we shouldn’t be this close to it,” he said."", 'However, a few IT security professionals within healthcare organizations told HealthITSecurity.com that they believe the biggest impact will likely be on smaller healthcare organizations.\nHe said that organizations should look at potential Windows XP upgrades from a risk perspective and treat their environments as though XP vulnerabilities are the reality.\nIn isolation, the transition from Windows XP might not seem like a big leap.\nPhil Alexander, Information Security Officer at UMC Health System, also agreed that he’s worried about smaller organizations dealing with the XP end of life.\nAlexander added that he believes many organizations, including his own in UMC, moved up too slowly with the upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7.']"

66853,http://www.zdnet.com/for-atms-why-not-windows-8-7000027713/,technology,"[""With all the controversy and anxiety over ATM operators only now getting around to moving their systems from Windows XP to Windows 7, a good question arises: Why stop at Windows 7? Why not deploy Windows 8 now? I dug into this and now I think maybe the banks are right.\n\nMany people are unhappy with Windows 8, both for good and bad reasons. But none of those reasons are relevant to what an ATM does. Such devices have their own immersive user interface and Metro doesn't enter into it.\n\nThe hardware requirements for Windows 8 are essentially identical to those of Windows 7.\n\nEven so, why not stick with Windows 7? It's widely agreed that it works well. This is why:\n\nOS Mainstream Support End Date Extended Support End Date Windows 7 1/13/2015 1/14/2020 Windows 8 1/9/2018 1/10/2023\n\nYes, Windows 8 has three more years of service life than Windows 7. If I were a bank coming out of this Windows XP unpleasantness, I would look at the possibility of a longer lifecycle with great interest.\n\nI asked Dean Stewart, Senior Director, Self-Service Product Management at Diebold, Inc, why all the talk is of Windows 7. His response:\n\nThe answer generally lies not with the ATM, but with the ecosystem the ATM sits in. Bankers are conservative by nature. They have invested a lot of time, effort, and money in creating a secure maintainable environment based on Windows 7. The environment is not just the ATM, but the teller platforms, thousands of PCs, servers, and other systems. They want to maximize their return on that investment. They will run Win 7 until the end of its extended support in 2020. Only a very few have expressed any interest in Windows 8.\n\nClearly I don't think like a banker. All these banks must be on Software Assurance, so they don't incur any cost to Microsoft for putting Windows 8 on rather than Windows 7. Why hold back? Because they're bankers and that's what they do.\n\nAnother point Stewart made was:\n\nOur industry tends to skip a generation in Microsoft product. This is evident from the fact that no bank migrated to Windows Vista. Most banks will probably wait to see what Microsoft offers as the next generation after Windows 8.\n\nIt's true; by the time January 14, 2020 comes along, Windows 9 will be a mature product. Who knows what it will be? And Stewart's not alone. I asked the same questions of Wincor Nixdorf, another major ATM company and got a similar response:\n\nBanks strive to operate all their PC-based systems (workstations, ATMs, etc.) with one uniform operating system and have opted with high priority in the workstation environment for the available and proven Windows 7 as the successor to Windows XP.\n\nAnd in fact there are other good arguments for going with Windows 7 now: Ironically, one of them is something I've already said, that the system requirements for Windows 7 and Windows 8 are essentially identical. This means that future upgrades from Windows 7 to Windows 8 for ATMs in the field — if the bank actually wants to do it — should go well, certainly better than XP to Windows 7 upgrades. There should be few, if any software incompatibilities for the ATM moving from Windows 7 to 8.\n\nIt's also reasonable to presume that Windows 7 won't be the problem that Windows XP was. When January 2020 comes along, I suspect that lots of customers will want to stick with Windows 7 for many of the same reasons we're hearing now about Windows XP : it does everything I need, I don't want to go through the hassle of an upgrade, etc., but then they may have more of an argument than they have now. Of course, that's almost six years from now and Windows 7 may lose some luster by then.\n\nMaybe I was wrong. All things considered, the advantages of skipping a generation as a matter of (unofficial) policy are clearer to me. This is, at least partly, the price Microsoft pays for giving their products a ten-year lifecycle."", ""With all the controversy and anxiety over ATM operators only now getting around to moving their systems from Windows XP to Windows 7, a good question arises: Why stop at Windows 7?\nThis is why:OS Mainstream Support End Date Extended Support End Date Windows 7 1/13/2015 1/14/2020 Windows 8 1/9/2018 1/10/2023Yes, Windows 8 has three more years of service life than Windows 7.\nwith one uniform operating system and have opted with high priority in the workstation environment for the available and proven Windows 7 as the successor to Windows XP.\nThis means that future upgrades from Windows 7 to Windows 8 for ATMs in the field — if the bank actually wants to do it — should go well, certainly better than XP to Windows 7 upgrades.\nIt's also reasonable to presume that Windows 7 won't be the problem that Windows XP was.""]"

Given the comet has a diameter of only five kilometers at its widest point, its mass is not large enough to generate a gravitational pull strong enough to support a landing. A more accurate description of the event is a docking.\n\nThe docking process is no small feat. Rosetta will bring the Philae lander within three kilometers of the comet, which travels through space at speeds up to 135,000 kilometers per hour. Philae will then fire a harpoon into the comet\'s outer layer of ice and reel itself in.\n\nWatch video 03:32 Share How risky is the journey for Rosetta?

This object, called 2012VP 113 , is the second body of its class found since the identification of the dwarf planet Sedna in 2003. It joins an exclusive club composed of some of the strangest objects in the solar system.\n\nThe observable solar system can be divided into three regions: the rocky planets including the Earth and asteroids of the inner solar system, the gas giant planets, and the icy Kuiper Belt objects, which include Pluto. The Kuiper belt stretches from beyond Neptune, which is at 30 astronomical units (one astronomical unit, AU, represents the distance between the Earth and the sun), to about 50AU.\n\nSedna and 2012VP 113 are strange objects, because they reside in a region where there should be nothing, according to our theories of the solar system formation. Their orbit is well beyond that of Neptune, the last recognised planet of the solar system, and even beyond that of Pluto, which differs from planets because of its size, unusual orbit, and composition. (Pluto, once considered a planet, is now considered the lead object of a group of bodies called plutinos.)\n\nThe closest Sedna, which is 1000km-wide, gets to the sun is about 76AU and for 2012VP 113 , which is 450km-wide, that distance is 80AU. Their orbits are also at weird inclinations compared to most other solar system objects.\n\nThe results of the discovery have been published in Nature. Chadwick Trujillo of Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, who was also involved in finding Sedna, and Scott Shepherd of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who found 2012VP 113 with Trujillo, propose that these objects are members of the inner Oort cloud.\n\nThe Oort cloud is a hypothetical region that is thought to stretch outwards beyond the Kuiper belt. Beyond 5000AU, the Oort cloud expands out into a sphere centred on the sun. We have no direct evidence that the Oort cloud exists, but indirect evidence comes in the form of comets with extremely elongated orbits.\n\nStephen Lowry at the University of Kent said: “The orbital properties of these two objects are so very different from that of the Kuiper belt objects that it wouldn’t be wrong to suggest they may be part of the inner Oort cloud.”\n\nThe fact that these objects exist is remarkable, since they exist in a region where material is thought to have been too sparse for them to form. Current thinking is that they actually formed in the giant-planet region, and that their orbits may carry the signature of whatever events caused them to scatter to such distances. It is hoped that this discovery will lead efforts to find other objects.\n\nDavid Rothery of Open University said: “This is a remarkable discovery, but it is not entirely surprising. When they found Sedna, there was hope that they would find others in that region.”\n\nBut the fact that it took Trujillo, who was involved in the original team that found Sedna, more than ten years to find Sedna’s neighbour speaks to the challenge of discovery. “The farther you get from the sun, the less sunlight falls on these objects, which makes the task of locating them harder,” Lowry said.\n\n“Worse still,” Lowry continued, “the eccentric orbits of these objects means that there is very tiny window in which they can be observed from even the most powerful telescopes on Earth. What is needed to find these objects is not just technology but persistence.” For example, Sedna gets as close as 76AU away from the sun, but at its farthest it is nearly 1000AU. Its orbital period is about 11,400 years, which means it spends lots of time too far out to be detected.\n\nWhile 2012VP 113 and Sedna provide some information about the inner Oort cloud, to say any more, scientists are going to need more than two data points. Next generation instruments such as the Subaru telescope in Hawaii and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in Chile may hold the answers.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.', 'New Planet-Like Body Found Sneaking Through the Inner Oort CloudA new, planet-like body has been found on the outer edges of the solar system.\nThis object, called 2012VP 113 , is the second body of its class found since the identification of the dwarf planet Sedna in 2003.\nIt joins an exclusive club composed of some of the strangest objects in the solar system.\nTheir orbits are also at weird inclinations compared to most other solar system objects.\nWhile 2012VP 113 and Sedna provide some information about the inner Oort cloud, to say any more, scientists are going to need more than two data points.']"

""What we are witnessing is perhaps the unveiling of an object that is in the middle of the same stage of development as the Earth and the moon 4.5 billion years ago, when there was a giant collision between Earth and another planet,"" Jorgensen said in a news release from the University of Copenhagen. He added that if the rings eventually gather up into a single moon, it will be about two kilometres in diameter.\n\nThe second bit of news is much bigger, and concerns 2012 VP113 — a chilly ball of ice whose orbit is so big, and so distant from the Sun that a single loop around takes 4,000 years. 2012 VP113 is a big deal because scientists think it\'s likely part of the Oort Cloud, a hypothesized collection of huge, frozen planetoids that serves as the birthplace of our solar system\'s comets. We can\'t observe the Oort Cloud directly, but scientists have been collecting indirect evidence about it for a couple decades and there\'s reason to think that it exists and that 2012 VP113 is one of the closer objects that\'s a part of it. Observations of 2012 VP113 over the years to come will help scientists better understand what\'s going on in the far reaches of the solar system and what role (if any) the Oort Cloud plays in that.\n\nMore speculatively, writes Phil Plait at Slate.com, the orbit of 2012 VP113 (as well as that of a nearby planetoid called Sedna) could indicate the presence of an actual ninth planet, somewhere out in Oort Cloud territory.', ""Two new discoveries, one space object: Planetoids in the newsOur solar system has eight planets (again, sorry Pluto).\nBut it has many, many more planetoids — more than 600,000 at last count.\nPlanetoids are big news this week, with two new discoveries that will teach us more about the structure of objects in space and about our solar system, as a whole.\nThe researchers think the rings formed from debris left over from a collision of an object with Chariklo or between two objects orbiting it.\n2012 VP113 is a big deal because scientists think it's likely part of the Oort Cloud, a hypothesized collection of huge, frozen planetoids that serves as the birthplace of our solar system's comets.""]"

They’re just following the “consensus” (which, ya know, didn’t actually result from empirical evidence) because it’ll get them grants, or tenure, or publications… not because they’re promoting a conclusion reached from study of massive, varied amounts of data. [Hint: sarcasm at use here.]\n\nYeah, that would get old quickly. And most scientists really have no interests in policy or political debates: they just want to do their thing in their labs. But the constant questioning of the motives of climate scientists has pushed a number of them, along with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), to push back. The organization’s newest campaign on climate science, What We Know, focuses on a common misconception (promoted by climate change deniers) that there’s “a lot of disagreement among scientists” about the existence and causes of contemporary global warming. The very short answer to this error is “97%” – take a look at a response with just a bit more detail:\n\nConsensus Sense from What We Know on Vimeo.\n\nWill a media campaign like this change some minds? Probably not those of the most die-hard deniers: they’ve got too much invested – whether financially, or just in terms of self-esteem – to ever admit that greenhouse gas emissions produced from human activity are changing Earth’s climate. But I have no doubt that there are people who are genuinely confused by all of the misleading information out there – that’s what the whole denial project is designed to do. Some of these folks will recognize where the evidence and credibility lies in this debate when they hear directly from climate scientists that there is no argument within their community: 97% agreement puts global warming up there with gravity and a round Earth.\n\nAlso check out the campaign’s introductory video, browse its website a bit, and then let us know: do you think this will help correct misperceptions about the validity of climate science?\n\nVia GOOD and Motherboard\n\nImage credit: AAAS at Facebook\n\n\n\nFollow CleanTechnica on Google News.\n\nIt will make you happy & help you live in peace for the rest of your life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Global Warming Consensus (VIDEO)March 30th, 2014 by Jeff McIntire-StrasburgOriginally published on Sustainablog.\nI have no doubt that climatology is a challenging field in and of itself, but climate scientists – particularly those focused on global warming – also have to deal with consistent attempts to undermine their credibility.\nThe organization’s newest campaign on climate science, What We Know, focuses on a common misconception (promoted by climate change deniers) that there’s “a lot of disagreement among scientists” about the existence and causes of contemporary global warming.\nSome of these folks will recognize where the evidence and credibility lies in this debate when they hear directly from climate scientists that there is no argument within their community: 97% agreement puts global warming up there with gravity and a round Earth.\nAlso check out the campaign’s introductory video, browse its website a bit, and then let us know: do you think this will help correct misperceptions about the validity of climate science?']"

""Not to lead is deeply irresponsible. If you don\'t lead, you will not bring others with you.""\n\nThe report, from the Intergovern-mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), will be published on Monday and is expected to state that global warming has already left its mark ""on all continents and across the oceans"", harming food supplies and driving extreme weather like floods and heatwaves. The report, the work of more than 2,000 scientific experts, will warn that even a small amount of further warming could lead to ""abrupt and irreversible changes"".\n\nThe green agenda has been the battleground for the some of the coalition\'s bitterest rows. The most recent saw eco levies – reportedly dubbed ""green crap"" by David Cameron – cut from energy bills, leaving 400,000 homes without the insulation that would cut carbon emissions and bills. Britain also recently defeated a European attempt to set renewable energy targets for 2030 for each nation.\n\nBut Davey insisted that climate-change sceptics – ""flat earthers"" – in the government had been defeated. ""Those of us who care about climate change and believe it is something we need to lead on have won the argument internally,"" he said. ""People don\'t realise that we got a deal across the coalition that puts Britain right at the head, the most ambitious country."" He said Britain\'s agreed position was to slash emissions by 50% by 2030 as part of a global deal: ""That is way out there.""\n\nDavey added that global warming was not a distant threat to far-flung low-lying Pacific islands, but was here, now: ""Climate change is impacting our way of life in the UK.""\n\nHe criticised the 40% cut to funding for climate change adaptation made by environment secretary Owen Paterson, whose department also cut annual flood defence spending. ""The experience of flooding brought home to the whole government and the whole country that preparing for climate change should be a national priority,"" he said.\n\nThe IPCC report was ""an incredibly robust piece of science"", Davey said, adding that people should be ""more worried"" by climate change than ever. ""The impacts on our people could be huge. We could see problems of real devastation from flooding and other severe weather events hitting food and water availability – really significant things,"" he said.\n\nHowever, Davey claimed that there was also reason to feel ""more hopeful"" than ever about the UN\'s global negotiations towards a 2015 treaty to reduce the impacts of climate change, a treaty he said would rank alongside the greatest in history. ""At the UN the science has won out,"" he said. ""People can see the rational debate there.""\n\nIt was also highly significant that the world\'s two biggest emitters – China and the US – were moving fast to cut emissions, particularly from coal. ""Over in Beijing the change in a short period of time is massive. China has woken up to the fact that it is in its enlightened self-interest to start taking this seriously,"" he said.\n\n""On one level it is about the political control of the Communist party: the unrest in towns and cities is mostly related to environmental disputes. If your [only] child is ill because the water in the rivers and the streams is filthy and the air they breathe in cities is disgusting, you don\'t like your government.""

There are chapters on human health, on food security and conflict, but also four chapters on how we can adapt to the effects.\n\n""We have a lot more information,"" said Dr Chris Field, who is the co-chair of the working group that is behind the report.\n\n""The way I see it, we have a much sharper take on aspects of the issue that are serious but we also have a much sharper focus on the things that can be done to reduce the risks.""\n\nThe summary is likely to say that the observed impacts of climate change are ""widespread and consequential"".\n\nWhether it is increased melting of glaciers, or tree mortality, or impacts on rainfall patterns, the report says that the very real effects of warming are happening in the here and now.\n\nOver the next 20 to 30 years, the report highlights some important impacts that we have little chance of avoiding, given the level of warming the world is already committed to, say the scientists.\n\nThese include threats to some ""unique and threatened systems"" even at 1C.\n\nRisks from extreme weather events, including heat waves and flooding are also high at 1C.\n\nAt 2C, there are ""very high risks"" for Arctic sea ice and coral reefs.\n\nThe report is, according to authors, likely to be more doubtful of the benefits of warming on agriculture than its predecessor.\n\nIt is expected to say that yield losses of up to 2% per decade will occur for the rest of this century, at a time when population is set to rise sharply.\n\n""There is a lot more literature on the response of agriculture to a changing climate and we are able to make a more comprehensive assessment than before, based on observations and model calculations,"" said Dr Field.\n\n""The science on crop yields and especially on food security is getting to be a lot more actionable and usable.""\n\nFlood risks for people living in Asia are highlighted as a particular vulnerability.\n\nThe report talks about impacts on human health, how mortality increases with greater heating and how species the world over are likely to respond by moving towards the poles.\n\nFish will move, some stocks will be significantly impacted and people who depend on them for food will have to find other sources of protein.\n\nThe threat of the oceans becoming more acidic is spelled out as are threats to human security and migration.\n\nThe report spells out the likely impacts at different levels of warming in different parts of the world.\n\n""We\'ve projected climate change impacts at different levels of temperature rise, at levels of 2C and 4C and now beyond,"" said Dr Rachel Warren from the University of East Anglia, UK.\n\n""We\'ve also looked at how people and biodiversity can adapt to climate change. This notion of vulnerability is embedded in the concept of the report.""\n\nAdaptation is a key element of the report, with clear tables showing that what are currently classed as high-risk impacts could be reduced to low risks, if steps are taken.\n\nOverall there is a greater attempt to set climate change as one of a number of threats facing people now and in the future.\n\n""Once we think of the challenge as one of managing risk, rather than of, oh once we know for sure what\'s going to happen then we can do something, it becomes much more tractable,"" said Dr Field.\n\n""It becomes much more a question of figuring out what are the smart and effective things to do.""\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.', 'At stake is a dense 29-page summary detailing the effects of climate change on the planet over the next 100 years.\nThe first, published last September detailed the mechanics of climate change, explaining that warming was ""unequivocal"" and humans were behind it.\nThe summary is likely to say that the observed impacts of climate change are ""widespread and consequential"".\nThe report spells out the likely impacts at different levels of warming in different parts of the world.\nOverall there is a greater attempt to set climate change as one of a number of threats facing people now and in the future.']"

The IPCC is meeting in Yokohama to assess the impact of ongoing warming of the planet.\n\nAccording to the IPCC, there will be serious effects on the natural environment when global average temperatures rise 1.6 C higher than average levels before the Industrial Revolution, and conditions will worsen further with a rise of 2.6 C.\n\nRelated:\n\nExtreme weather disasters consistent with climate change, says UN\n\nNatural disasters cost $134 billion in 2013\n\nWhich foods are the worst for the environment?\n\nIts agreed-upon report, which will be released Monday, will affect ongoing international negotiations over global warming countermeasures, the main aim of which is to keep temperature rises within 2 C.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nAt the beginning of the agreement, the working group acknowledges that “observed impacts of climate change are widespread and substantial” and “in recent decades changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans.”\n\nThese acknowledgments are more serious than those in its 2007 report, which said: “Observational evidence from all countries and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases.”\n\nLater in the agreement, the working group touches on the effect that temperature increases have had on the environment. The current world average temperature has risen by 0.6 C since the start of the Industrial Revolution. It warns that an increase of 1.6 C from that time will have a wider impact on fragile natural systems that are not capable of adjusting to global warming.\n\nAs examples of such fragile natural environments, the group lists Arctic sea ice and coral reefs.\n\nIn the Arctic Ocean, sea ice has been melting for several years. Large swathes of coral reefs, including one south of Japan, have been turning white as a result of sea temperature increases.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nThe IPCC specifically stresses that irreversible effects on natural systems have accelerated.\n\nMeanwhile, the working group forecasts that with a 1.6 C rise will increase the risk of death from heat stroke and heat exhaustion, mainly in metropolitan areas.\n\nWith a 2.6 C increase, drought and unreliable rainfall will cause a decline in crop production and shortages of drinking and irrigation water, according to the group’s forecasts.\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.

According to the Guardian, the report’s language concludes that climate change has already “caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans.”\n\nAn early draft was actually leaked in November. The biggest danger it sees is apparently coastal flooding driven by sea level rise — which could shave 10 percent off global economic production by the end of this century, according to previous research. Climate change also threatens widespread damage to marine life and fish populations worldwide, as both warming seas and ocean acidification throw off ecosystems’ natural balances.\n\nMuch of the report’s language has already been finalized, including a warning that “both warm water coral reef and Arctic ecosystems are already experiencing irreversible regime shifts.”\n\nThe report also sees the potential for droughts, floods, and shifting patterns of rainfall to endanger global food production — again, a finding backed by other studies. Climate change is also cutting down on the globe’s supply of fresh drinking water, and stronger storms pose a danger to human infrastructure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest report is a product of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an international project aimed at providing the world a kind of grand summary and assessment of the known science on climate change. It put out its last big finding — the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) — in 2007. Now the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) is rolling out in a series of stages over the next few months.\n\nThe Working Group I report was the first stage, and covered how climate change arises from the basics of physical science. It was released in September of 2013. The report proposed, for the first time, an overall “carbon budget” that humanity cannot exceed if we’re to stay under 2°C of warming — what most scientist consider the safe upper limit. In short, the world can afford to release only 1,000 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere if it wants to stay under the 2°C threshold, and 531 gigatons have already been emitted as of 2011.\n\nRight now representatives and scientists from around the world are hold up in Yokohama, Japan, finalizing the language for the Working Group II report, which will come out on Monday. It will cover the impacts of climate change, which populations and societies are the most vulnerable, and how governments can adapt. According to the Guardian, almost 500 people must approve the Working Group II language, including 66 experts authors, 57 observers, 271 officials representing 115 countries around the world.\n\nThe IPCC’s Working Group III report is scheduled to be released in April, and will cover climate change mitigation. That will be followed by the final Synthesis Report in October. At that point, the AR5 release will be complete, setting the stage for the next big international meeting in 2015, where the world’s governments hope to develop some sort of coordinated strategy to actually tackle climate change and cut global carbon emissions.', 'The next big report from an ongoing international effort to nail down the science of climate change will be released on Monday.\nClimate change is also cutting down on the globe’s supply of fresh drinking water, and stronger storms pose a danger to human infrastructure.\nThe Working Group I report was the first stage, and covered how climate change arises from the basics of physical science.\nIt will cover the impacts of climate change, which populations and societies are the most vulnerable, and how governments can adapt.\nThe IPCC’s Working Group III report is scheduled to be released in April, and will cover climate change mitigation.']"

66962,http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/uk_seabirds_sound_climate_warning_20140329,technology,"['By Alex Kirby, Climate News NetworkThis piece first appeared at Climate News Network.\n\nLONDON — Several familiar British birds are now showing drastic declines in numbers as the reality of climate change strikes home even at these temperate latitudes.\n\nScientists believe climate change is the driving force behind a crash in the numbers of kittiwakes, a seabird species which used to thrive in northern Scotland. The birds are doing so badly that there are fears some colonies could disappear entirely.\n\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is the UK’s largest nature conservation charity. In a report to mark the publication on 31 March by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of its latest findings, the RSPB says that on current trends kittiwakes face extinction from areas that were once core strongholds.\n\nIt says that since 2000 kittiwake numbers have declined by 87% on Orkney and Shetland, two island groups north of the Scottish mainland. The islands were once home to thriving cliff colonies of thousands of birds, but today, the RSPB says, many cliffs are virtually empty in the breeding season.\n\nIt says research shows that sea temperature changes are affecting the availability of the birds’ preferred prey, small fish called sandeels.\n\nLeadership challenge\n\nPaul Walton, head of habitats and species for RSPB Scotland, says: “Ten years ago Marwick Head on Orkney was a thriving seabird city – but now it looks like a ghost town. Evidence points to rising sea surface temperatures driving huge declines and species shifts in plankton populations. This is the food of sandeels, and the sandeels are food for the birds.”\n\nTwo other seabirds are declining sharply. Razorbills are down 57% from a total of 2,228 in 2000 to just 966 in 2013, and guillemots have fallen by 46% during the same period.\n\nThe RSPB wants the Scottish Government to designate key seabird feeding sites as marine protected areas. But it says a much bigger challenge is to persuade world leaders to heed the warnings in the IPCC report and do more to tackle climate change.\n\nOther UK wildlife and habitats are also threatened by climate change. Machair is a rare, wildlife-rich coastal grassland, mostly found on Scottish islands, and home to a traditional agricultural system that works in close harmony with nature. Working the machair is a big part of Gaelic culture, supporting corncrakes, ringed plovers, dunlins and great yellow bumblebees.\n\nThe machair is singled out in the IPCC report as one of the habitats most threatened by climate change. The IPCC says rising sea-levels, and the increased risk of storms and flooding, will mean the land becomes increasingly eroded.\n\nCompounding the pressure\n\nAnother British bird of concern to the RSPB is the Dartford warbler, found on the heathlands of southern England and very sensitive to the cold. The species has been steadily moving northwards, apparently because of climate change. It is declining on the southern edge of its range in Spain, and in the UK conservationists are working hard to create new heathland habitat for the birds to move into.\n\nDotterels are birds which breed only on the highest mountain tops of Scotland. Their numbers have fallen from 630 breeding males in 1999 to 423 in 2011. Again, the RSPB believes, climate change is the culprit.\n\nMartin Harper, the RSPB’s conservation director, says: “Kittiwakes, dotterels and Dartford warblers are three examples of wildlife being affected on our doorstep, but further afield the picture is stark for a whole range of species.\n\n“Climate change will compound the many existing pressures on wildlife including habitat destruction, the introduction of non-native invasive species, over-exploitation and pollution.\n\n“The overwhelming scientific consensus suggests that unless we take urgent action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, climate change will commit many species to extinction this century. The silent kittiwake colonies on Orkney should be a warning.”', 'Scientists believe climate change is the driving force behind a crash in the numbers of kittiwakes, a seabird species which used to thrive in northern Scotland.\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) is the UK’s largest nature conservation charity.\nOther UK wildlife and habitats are also threatened by climate change.\nThe machair is singled out in the IPCC report as one of the habitats most threatened by climate change.\n“Climate change will compound the many existing pressures on wildlife including habitat destruction, the introduction of non-native invasive species, over-exploitation and pollution.']"

New reports from the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change only add to the weight of science’s verdict on the subject. Just what to do about climate change, however - and how quickly - is still a matter of intense political and policy debate.\n\nAnd if you really want to see the sparks fly, try suggesting geoengineering as a solution to global warming.\n\nDavid Keith took first prize in Canada\'s national physics prize exam, won MIT\'s prize for excellence in experimental physics, and was listed as one of TIME magazine\'s Heroes of the Environment for 2009. A proponent of geoengineering to address climate change, he\'s now a professor of applied physics and of public policy at Harvard University. (Courtesy Harvard) As the term implies, geoengineering is engineering on a planetary scale. geoengineering\n\nGeoengineering is an attempt to arrest the course of climate change through a number of different schemes, such as seeding the atmosphere with reflective particles. Or putting gigantic mirrors in orbit around the Earth to reflect sunlight back to space. Or fertilizing the ocean with iron to stimulate the growth of carbon-absorbing plankton.\n\nFor a lot of people, it sounds like mad science.\n\nAnd geoengineering has been a magnet for controversy and criticism. Its opponents include some of the world’s most prominent environmentalists, including David Suzuki and Al Gore.\n\nEarlier this year, in fact, the former U.S. Vice President said the very idea of geoengineering is “insane, utterly mad and delusional in the extreme.” He added, “the fact that some scientists who should know better are actually engaged in serious discussion of those alternatives is a mark of how desperate some of them are feeling due to the paralysis in the global political system.""\n\nThe Sunday Edition March 30 on The Sunday Edition on CBC radio, starting at 9 a.m.\u200b: Quebec votes: Three astute Quebec observers - Bernie St-Laurent, Francine Pelletier and André Pratte - explain how the early optimism of Premier Pauline Marois has dissipated.\n\nJonathan Schell tribute: The expert on the politics and morality of nuclear weapons died this week.\n\nSpare Change: For many of us, panhandlers provide a daily prick to the conscience.\n\nThe Centenary of the Newfoundland Sealing Disaster: Poet and novelist Michael Crummey and author Jenny Higgins, on the 1914 tragedy in which 79 sealers froze to death on the ice floes off Newfoundland.\n\nBut Canadian environmental engineer David Keith is taken seriously by policymakers and scientists when he speaks about the possibilities of geoengineering.\n\nKeith was a long-time professor at the University of Calgary and is now a Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Gordon McKay Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. He’s particularly interested in solar geoengineering, or solar radiation management, which would involve putting tiny sulphur particles into the stratosphere, where they would reflect solar energy back to space.\n\nIn his new book, A Case for Climate Engineering, Keith says geoengineering is a “brutally ugly technical fix.” He cheerfully admits he has a lot of qualms about it as a technology that could have dangerous and unintended consequences, and that it doesn’t address the root cause of climate change: the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nBut, as Keith told The Sunday Edition’s Michael Enright in an interview, that doesn’t mean we should ignore the fact that it could rapidly lower the Earth’s temperature and counteract some of the effects of climate change.\n\nIt’s technically feasible and relatively inexpensive to do, he adds.\n\nAnd given how the global community has dragged its heels on reducing emissions, he argues, a crude, quick fix for climate change may become necessary in the decades ahead.\n\n“I think the important point is that it’s not hard to do, that all the hard questions are about whether we should do it, who controls it, how well it works.”\n\nKeith also acknowledges the danger that if geoengineering were to become seen as a proven solution to rising global temperatures, there would be a strong temptation to forego costly emissions reductions and simply press ahead with geoengineering to counteract the results of rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere instead.\n\n“You [need to] do geoengineering during the time that you slow down emissions. In the long run, you have to bring emissions to zero,"" he says.\n\nAccording to Keith, if we want a stable climate, we must eventually stop putting more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. ""Carbon dioxide is like filling a bathtub. The climate risk comes from the historical sum of all emissions. The only way to stop adding to that risk is to stop putting more carbon dioxide in.""\n\n“But let’s say you’re going to stop carbon dioxide emissions over 100 years. If you do this solar geoengineering, you could spread out the climate change over 200 years, slowing down the amount of climate change, and I would say most climate risks have to do with the rate of change.”\n\nKeith is not calling for an immediate adoption of geoengineering. What he wants to see is scientific and political energy poured into research into geoengineering’s possibilities and risks, and a robust public debate so that informed policy decisions can be made about whether it’s a viable tool to prevent the worst effects of climate change.\n\n[You can hear Michael Enright’s entire conversation with David Keith this weekend in Hour 2 of The Sunday Edition, which begins at 10:05 a.m. on CBC Radio One, or in the audio-player link at the top-left of this page.]', '']"

Hopefully, good communication about this leading, essential scientifically based assessment, framed in terms of risk assessment and risk management, will lead the public discourse about the report and its implications.\n\nAnd risk management must, of necessity, include both emissions mitigation (stay tuned for the soon-forthcoming IPCC Working Group III report on those issues), and adaptive preparedness to limit and respond to disruptive climate change impacts (to the extent that is possible).\n\n* * *\n\nEarlier post: Matt Ridley op-ed is a laundry list of IPCC misrepresentations (March 28)', 'It’s good to see this latest IPCC report on the impacts of global climatic disruption, drafted and reviewed by many of the leading scientists in multiple disciplines, focusing on risk assessment, risk management, and preparedness.\nSuzanne Goldenberg, on top of things as usual, has an excellent piece in The Guardian (“IPCC report: climate change felt ‘on all continents and across the oceans’“) previewing the report from leaked text.\nThis report will, for the first time, look at the effects of climate change as a series of risks – with those risks multiplying as temperatures warm.\nThe thinking behind the decision was to encourage governments to prepare for the full range of potential consequences under climate change.\n…Researchers said … they hoped the reframing of the issue as a series of risks would help governments respond more rapidly to climate change.']"

The process, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), would make the power plants not only carbon-neutral but actively a part of extracting carbon dioxide from a natural cycle of plant growth and decay.\n\nThe technology could be twinned in coming decades with planting forests that absorb carbon as they grow, according to the study obtained by Reuters.\n\nIt would be a big shift from efforts to fight global warming mainly by cutting emissions of greenhouse gases from mankind’s use of fossil fuels in factories, power plants and cars, but may be necessary given the failure so far to cut rising emissions.\n\n“BECCS forms an essential component of the response strategy for climate change in the majority of scenarios in the literature” to keep temperatures low, according to a report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThe leaked report is Chapter 6 in a mammoth study due in mid-April in Berlin about solving climate change.\n\nIn theory, BECCS could extract between 3 billion and above 10 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air a year, it says, and seems more promising than technologies such as blocking sunlight or building machines to extract carbon from the air.\n\nChina, the top carbon producer ahead of the U.S., emitted 9.86 billion tons in 2012.\n\nBECCS will cost from $60 to $250 per ton of carbon dioxide eliminated, the IPCC says.\n\n“BECCS faces large challenges in financing and currently no such plants have been built and tested at scale,” it says.\n\nMost carbon capture and storage focuses on fossil fuels. Saskatchewan Power’s Boundary Dam coal-fired power plant in Canada, due to start this year as the first commercial project of its type, will capture 1 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.\n\nApart from the high costs of BECCS, “the area you need is vast,” said Joris Koornneef, an expert at sustainable energy consultancy Ecofys in Netherlands.', 'Among other techniques, a chemical process can strip carbon dioxide from the flue gases from combustion.\n“BECCS forms an essential component of the response strategy for climate change in the majority of scenarios in the literature” to keep temperatures low, according to a report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThe leaked report is Chapter 6 in a mammoth study due in mid-April in Berlin about solving climate change.\nBECCS will cost from $60 to $250 per ton of carbon dioxide eliminated, the IPCC says.\nSaskatchewan Power’s Boundary Dam coal-fired power plant in Canada, due to start this year as the first commercial project of its type, will capture 1 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.']"

Robust demand for the 1.0-liter in Europe prompted Ford to double production capacity at its state-of-the-art Cologne, Germany, plant to more than 1,000 engines a day.\n\nEcoBoost technology combines smaller-displacement engines with turbocharging, direct injection, variable valve timing and proprietary Ford software to bring customers outstanding performance and fuel economy. Ford EcoBoost engines deliver up to 20 percent better fuel economy than larger-displacement gasoline engines.\n\nFord’s global EcoBoost engine family now includes the 1.0-liter three-cylinder; 1.5-liter, 1.6-liter and 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines; and the powerful 3.5-liter V6 engine. EcoBoost technology is available in every region Ford serves worldwide, and will be offered on approximately 80 percent of the company’s global nameplates by the end of this year.\n\nIn addition to the new leadership claim for highway fuel efficiency, the new Fiesta boasts a best-in-class suite of technologies and features that gives drivers an ideal blend of a connected world and an untethered driving experience.\n\nA new MyFord Touch® system with 6.5-inch touch screen featuring enhanced voice control is now available, providing drivers more options than ever for navigation, communication and entertainment functions, helping them keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.\n\nFord MyKey® is a new feature for Fiesta. MyKey enables parents in particular to encourage safer driving and limit their teenagers’ exposure to risk at the wheel. The system allows owners to configure maximum speed and audio volume limits. It mutes audio until safety belts are fastened and ensures driver aids, safety systems and more vigorous alerts cannot be deactivated when used.', 'The new Ford Fiesta equipped with the award-winning 1.0-liter EcoBoost® engine will be North America’s most fuel-efficient non-hybrid, gasoline-powered car with a certified 4.3 L / 100 km rating on the highway.\nThe fuel economy rating not only establishes the Fiesta 1.0-liter EcoBoost as best-in-class, but it also outperforms some competitors’ diesels and hybrids on the highway driving cycle.\n“With the new Fiesta 1.0-liter EcoBoost we’re pushing into fuel economy numbers only seen on hybrids and diesels,” said Joe Hinrichs, executive vice president and president of the Americas for Ford.\nAutomotive journalists named the 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine in the 2014 Ford Fiesta International Engine of the Year in 2012 and 2013.\nFord EcoBoost engines deliver up to 20 percent better fuel economy than larger-displacement gasoline engines.']"

High-strength, military-grade aluminum alloys are used throughout the vehicle to help make the finished product up to 700 lbs. (317 kg) lighter than comparably equipped 2014 models.\n\nCurrent F-150s don’t offer a 2.7-litre EcoBoost V6, though. The all-new engine employs compacted graphite iron — the same material found in Ford’s 6.7-litre Power Stroke diesel engine — for a very dense, strong and lightweight cylinder block, then piles on twin-turbocharging, variable valve timing and a variety of modifications to the structural engine components to produce V8-like performance from an engine that weighs less than the current high-output 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6. The 2.7-litre EcoBoost will also be the first to offer engine start/stop technology in an F-150. Although the EPA rating isn’t yet available, the intent is clearly to produce a new leader in half-ton fuel economy.\n\nWhile the 2.7 EcoBoost will garner its fair share of attention, the F-150 will offer another new engine for value-conscious owners: A 3.5-litre naturally-aspirated V6 takes the place of the 3.7-litre powerplant offered in past F-150s. This will be the new entry-level engine, with a 5.0-litre V8 also on the option sheet. And, of course, the popular 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6 is still available, offering something close to the 365 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque available in the 2014 model.\n\nFord will offer a full range of entertainment, convenience and productivity technologies, with SYNC and MyFord Touch, a blind spot information system, and available high definition radio with 10-speaker sound system.

Probably not, and Three‘s developers kind of hate that.\n\nAsher Vollmer and Greg Wohlwend, the people behind Threes, took to their website to explain their problems with 2048’s sudden popularity. Specifically, they’re less upset with the proliferation of clones (they cite Numberwang as their favorite, though I’m gonna speak for all of the Geekosystem team and say that ours is the Doctor Who version) than they are with how quickly 2048 arrived to pull on their coattails and hog all the glory.\n\nThey explain further:\n\nWe want to celebrate iteration on our ideas and ideas in general.

It’s complicated and hard to express these conflicting feelings but hopefully this is a start. We are so happy with Threes and how it has done and all the response. Seriously. And even writing this feels like we’re whining about some sour grapes that we have no business feeling sour about. Like it’s not ok to feel the way we do some of the time. But we do.

Dr. Mario is a pretty great game by the way, so the comparison is a bit weird here. Hopefully you get the sentiment.”\n\nIn order to demonstrate just how long a process creating the game was for these developers, they’ve published over 45,000words worth of planning material on their website, including design illustrations, texts and emails between the designers, and a lot of minor inside-baseball kind of details outlining the 14-month journey of this game.\n\nSo if you’ve ever wondered just what goes into creating a successful app (because despite the clones, Threes is still doing fairly well for itself), head on over and check that out.

This week’s fad is 2048. I’m sure everyone on campus has heard of the game if they haven’t played it already. Everywhere I go, I see people on their phones playing it, whether it be during meals in Pierce, during class (that didn’t come from me), or while hanging out with people. It’s extremely addictive and not simple, and many get frustrated trying to win it once and for all. When I walk around campus all I hear is: has someone beaten the game yet, and if not how far into it have they gotten?\n\nThe fact is 2048 is perhaps the most addicting mobile game rage yet. In the game, the user swipes tiles around a 4X4 tile board in order to combine tiles of like value. All of the tiles values are powers of 2. The goal of the game is to create a tile worth 2048, or 2^11. It is a simple concept, but very difficult to accomplish. Before 2048 there was Flappy Bird, which I admit was pretty addicting as well. I remember constantly tapping my phone screen trying to get the bird through the pipes. However, once the game was removed from the App Store, and was surrounded with negative attention, it no longer offered any pull. At Stevens, 2048 is certainly the biggest craze for mobile gaming, and rightfully so. It’s actually loads of fun and hard to stop. Whatever you do, if you haven’t started it yet, do not try it anytime around finals or crunch time.\n\nI started playing 2048 this past weekend and was immediately drawn in. It’s perhaps the greatest distraction on my phone, even more so than Facebook or texting. For that reason, I’m still not sure whether to call 2048 the best or worst game on my phone right now. Thankfully though, I have resisted playing this game unless I’m by myself in my room and there is no homework left or paper to write. It especially bothers me that 2048 alienates people during social situations. Being a social person, I really appreciate eye contact when I talk to someone, and when everyone I’m hanging out with is playing this game at the same time, it defeats the purpose of hanging out with friends. Also, playing 2048 serves as yet another reason to use the phone in class which also defeats the purpose of why we are all here. There are enough opportunities outside of class and events to load 2048. I highly recommend resisting the temptation unless the timing is right.\n\nIn conclusion, 2048 is a great game. I strongly recommend to anyone left on campus who hasn’t already played the game to give it a try. However, 2048 has its rightful place. It should not serve to substitute more important things that are going on all around you. I view the game as a time-filler, when there’s a short break and there’s nothing else to do. And one last thing to fellow 2048-players: good luck!', 'In the game, the user swipes tiles around a 4X4 tile board in order to combine tiles of like value.\nI started playing 2048 this past weekend and was immediately drawn in.\nFor that reason, I’m still not sure whether to call 2048 the best or worst game on my phone right now.\nThankfully though, I have resisted playing this game unless I’m by myself in my room and there is no homework left or paper to write.\nAlso, playing 2048 serves as yet another reason to use the phone in class which also defeats the purpose of why we are all here.']"

In this case, 2048 and 1024.\n\nSome of the talk here deals with release dates of games on the iOS side, but it all stems back to the bigger issue. It seems some of this comes down to how long Threes took in development, and some of it was due to users thinking Threes was a clone of 2048. It was pointed out how 1024 was released 21 days after Threes, and about 10 days later came 2048.\n\nIt is hard to tell whether this talk of rip-offs comes as a result of frustration over what people are thinking, or if there was something deeper. To their credit, they did mention how it was “complicated and hard to express these conflicting feelings” and how “even writing this feels like we’re [they’re] whining about some sour grapes that we have no business feeling sour about.”\n\nBut having said that, the post on the Threes site does make some interesting points. For one, there was mention in regards to 2048 about how “when an automated script that alternates pressing up and right and left every hundreth time can beat the game” — it is broken. Things then go on with mention about how only 6 people in the world have seen a 6144 on Threes, and nobody has “beat” the game just yet.

The game has been built by 19 year old Italian programmer named Gabriele Cirulli. In the game, users have to swipe the tiles to add together 2s and 4s and 8s etc till they get to the number 2048. The game is quite easy to understand and fun. The game was released on 9 March and has been gaining immense popularity.\n\nEverything as they say, was awesome. That is, until the creator of the game was accused of plagiarism.\n\nCreators of another game called ""Threes,"" a paid game which is also available on both iOS and Android, have written a blog post saying that 2048 and another game called 1024 have blatantly copied them.\n\nSo what is Threes all about? Threes is all about matching numbers around multiples of three. That is adding one plus 2, which is 3, then three plus three which six and so on.\n\nThe developers of Threes wrote in a blogpost, saying, ""we’re not shy about calling a clone a clone, and believe us, there’s no shortage of straight-up clones out there, especially on Android.

Since then, Nguyen has made thousands of dollars daily from Flappy Bird.\n\nAs for Cirulli, he says that so far he has made hundreds of dollars from users who have chosen to donate money to him for making “2048.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore creating the game, Cirulli focused on developing Web apps and blogs.\n\n[Updated 10:15 a.m. PDT, March 28: Cirulli said “2048"" was inspired by “1024"" and another game that is also called “2048.” Those games were inspired by “Threes,” a game that launched last month.\n\n“I just wanted to make my own version with animations and slightly different gameplay, mostly as an exercise,” said Cirulli. “2048"" is Cirulli’s only game, and he said he has no plans to make more.\n\n“My incursion in the games industry was accidental!” Cirulli said in an email.]\n\nALSO:\n\nFacebook shares fall 7% on Oculus deal\n\nApple working on bringing racial diversity to emoji icons\n\nRocki music-streaming device useful but not ready to rock [Video]', 'How long does it take to create a hit video game these days?\nJust about one weekend, if you ask the creator of popular puzzle game “2048.”Gabriele Cirulli, an Italian Web developer, said he was able to put together “2048,” his first game, in a little more than two days earlier this month.\nSince releasing the game, “2048"" has gained high popularity and sparked dozens of copycat games, much to Cirulli’s surprise.\nDong Nguyen, the man behind popular game “Flappy Bird,” recently told Rolling Stone magazine that it took him only one weekend to create his mobile hit.\n[Updated 10:15 a.m. PDT, March 28: Cirulli said “2048"" was inspired by “1024"" and another game that is also called “2048.” Those games were inspired by “Threes,” a game that launched last month.']"

But it is closer to land than the previous search zone, its weather is much more hospitable - and Broken Ridge sounds a lot craggier than it really is.\n\n\n\nAnd the deepest part was believed to be 5,800 metres, within the range of American black box ping locators on an Australian ship that left on Sunday for the area and were expected to arrive in three or four days.\n\nLike snow, the layer of microscopic plankton shells tends to smooth out any rises or falls in the underlying rock. In places, the layer is up to 1km deep.\n\n\n\nBut if the fuselage of the Boeing 777 did fall on to Broken Ridge, it would not sink much into the muck.\n\n\n\n""The surface would be soft, it would squeeze between your toes, but it\'s not so soft that you would disappear like snow,"" Sager said. ""Something big like pieces of an airplane, it\'s going to be sitting on the surface.""\n\n\n\nSearchers will be hoping that if the latest area turns out to be where the plane crashed, the fuselage did not go down on the southern edge of Broken Ridge.\n\n\n\nThat\'s where the ocean floor drops precipitously - more than 4km in places, according to Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at Australia\'s James Cook University.\n\nIt\'s not a sheer cliff, more like a very steep hill that a car would struggle to drive up. At the bottom of this escarpment is the narrow Diamantina trench, which measurements put as deep at 5,800m, though no one is sure of its greatest depth because it has never been precisely mapped.\n\n\n\n""Let\'s hope the wreck debris has not landed over this escarpment - it\'s a long way to the bottom,"" Beaman said.\n\n- Fairfax and AP', 'An Australian military aircraft has spotted four orange objects at sea, more than two metres in size, which will be analysed by the Australian co-ordination centre for missing flight MH370.\nThe search zone is huge: about 319,000 sq km, roughly the size of Poland or New Mexico.\nBut it is closer to land than the previous search zone, its weather is much more hospitable - and Broken Ridge sounds a lot craggier than it really is.\nBut if the fuselage of the Boeing 777 did fall on to Broken Ridge, it would not sink much into the muck.\nSearchers will be hoping that if the latest area turns out to be where the plane crashed, the fuselage did not go down on the southern edge of Broken Ridge.']"

""Something big like pieces of an airplane, it\'s going to be sitting on the surface.""\n\nSearchers will be hoping that if the latest area turns out to be where the plane crashed — and that remains educated guesswork until searchers can put their hands on aerial debris sightings and check what it is — the fuselage did not go down on the southern edge of Broken Ridge.\n\nThat\'s where the ocean floor drops precipitously — more than 4 kilometres (2 1/2 miles) in places, according to Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at Australia\'s James Cook University. It\'s not a sheer cliff, more like a very steep hill that a car would struggle to drive up. At the bottom of this escarpment is the narrow Diamantina trench, which measurements put as deep at 5,800 metres (19,000 feet), though no one is sure of its greatest depth because it has never been precisely mapped.\n\n""Let\'s hope the wreck debris has not landed over this escarpment — it\'s a long way to the bottom,"" Beaman said.\n\nThe Diamantina trench, named after an Australian navy vessel, is one of the deeper sections of the parts of the oceans that surround Antarctica, according to Mike Coffin, the executive director of the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies at Australia\'s University of Tasmania.\n\nThe trench\'s rocky crags and crannies would make it difficult for ships using instruments like side-scanning sonar or multi-beam echo sounders to distinguish any debris from the crevices.\n\nSearchers will especially be hoping to locate the jet\'s two ""black boxes,"" which recorded sounds in the cockpit and data on the plane\'s performance and flight path that could help reconstruct why it diverted sharply west from its overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing on March 8. The black boxes were designed to emit locator pings for at least 30 days, and are projected to lose battery power — and thus their pings — by mid-April.\n\nThe pinger can be heard as far as 2 1/2 miles away, but the distance can vary widely, depending on the state of the sea and the wreckage location, said Joseph Kolly, director of research and engineering for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Black boxes can get buried or muffled by other wreckage, and thermoclines, which are layers of water with great variations in temperature, can refract the signal, he said.\n\nThe sediment on Broken Ridge is unlikely to inhibit the ping — but on the escarpment or in the trench, rocks could scatter the sound, making it harder to detect, according to Mike Haberman, a research scientist specializing in acoustics at the University of Texas, Austin.\n\nTo pinpoint the ping they hear from the surface, searchers likely will run a submersible equipped with sonar several hundred feet above the ocean floor. The unmanned underwater vehicle will putter along at a slow jog, able to ""see"" objects on the floor that may seem out of place. But its vision is limited — in a day it could cover an area only about the size of Manhattan, Sager said.\n\nThe observations stored in the vehicle\'s memory can be accessed only by bringing it to the surface.\n\nUnder the best conditions, to survey the entire new search area could take between three months and up to nearly two years, depending on the quality of data needed to identify the debris, according to calculations by David T. Sandwell, a professor of geophysics who specializes in seafloor mapping at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.\n\nBecause it is such a painstaking — and expensive — process, most mapping has been focused on things that people consider useful, like underwater shipping hazards and potential oil deposits. With nothing much to interest people in the this part of the Indian Ocean, the maps tend to follow features like the volcanically active mid-ocean ridges, leaving big blank spaces in between.\n\nThere are 80-kilometre (50-mile) -wide strips of the search area where no shipboard measurements have been taken and scientists use less detailed satellite measurements and educated guesswork to depict what the floor actually looks like.\n\nPrecisely what the seafloor looks like in detail in the area of the new search is another in a long line of Flight 370 mysteries.\n\nThe Associated Press', 'That\'s where the ocean floor drops precipitously — more than 4 kilometres (2 1/2 miles) in places, according to Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at Australia\'s James Cook University.\nIt\'s not a sheer cliff, more like a very steep hill that a car would struggle to drive up.\n""Let\'s hope the wreck debris has not landed over this escarpment — it\'s a long way to the bottom,"" Beaman said.\nTo pinpoint the ping they hear from the surface, searchers likely will run a submersible equipped with sonar several hundred feet above the ocean floor.\nPrecisely what the seafloor looks like in detail in the area of the new search is another in a long line of Flight 370 mysteries.']"

Like the previous two trials in California, this trial will be presided over by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh.\n\nThe latest trial will focus on several newer Samsung devices that Apple claims are infringing on five of its software patents, reports CNET. The patents cited by Apple cover a universal search feature used by Siri, a “slide-to-unlock” feature, an “autocomplete” feature, a “quick links” data detection method, and a background synching technology. As noted by CNET, all of the patented technologies cited by Apple are found in Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android operating system except for the “slide-to-unlock” feature. In this sense, the results of this trial may have future ramifications for Google, as well as Samsung. According to Apple, several of Samsung’s newer devices are infringing on its patents, including the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Note 2.\n\nOn the other hand, Samsung has accused Apple of infringing on its patents with the iPhone 5, iPad mini, and several other iOS devices, reports CNET. Samsung’s accusations are based on two patents that it holds that cover technologies related to remote video transmission and the recording and reproducing of digital images and speech.\n\nThe two smartphone rivals have been engaged in various legal battles in courtrooms around the world ever since Apple filed its first patent-infringement lawsuit against Samsung in 2011. Apple secured a significant victory in August of 2012 when a jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. However, Judge Koh later reduced this amount and ordered a new trial after discovering that the jury based part of its award amount on an impermissible legal theory.\n\nIn the damages retrial last November, a jury ruled that the Korea-based company must pay the iPhone maker more than $290 million in damages over thirteen products that were found to be infringing on five of Apple’s patents. Along with the damages award from the original trial, Samsung now owes Apple approximately $930 million. However, unlike the upcoming trial, the devices in dispute at the previous trial are no longer even sold by Samsung.\n\nAccording to patent expert Florian Mueller at FOSS Patents, Apple will be seeking an even larger damages award in the new trial based on the theory that Samsung would have paid the Cupertino-based company $40 per device for the use of Apple’s five patents. Mueller noted that this estimate is much higher than typical industry patent-licensing costs. Although it remains to be seen which company will come out ahead in the latest patent battle, it should be noted that Apple is entering this trial with some momentum after recently securing a patent-infringement win against Samsung in Tokyo District Court.\n\nMore From Wall St. Cheat Sheet:\n\nFollow Nathanael on Twitter (@ArnoldEtan_WSCS)', 'The latest trial will focus on several newer Samsung devices that Apple claims are infringing on five of its software patents, reports CNET.\nOn the other hand, Samsung has accused Apple of infringing on its patents with the iPhone 5, iPad mini, and several other iOS devices, reports CNET.\nApple secured a significant victory in August of 2012 when a jury awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages.\nAlong with the damages award from the original trial, Samsung now owes Apple approximately $930 million.\nHowever, unlike the upcoming trial, the devices in dispute at the previous trial are no longer even sold by Samsung.']"

According to Apple, Samsung is infringing on more of their patents, this time around the devices in question are the Samsung Galaxy S III, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2. The word is that Samsung is infringing on five of Apples patents with the two different devices, with the two most noticeable ones being for universal search and slide to unlock.

Although they were awarded a fairly large sum of money to atone for the infringements, Apple wanted more than that and they will seemingly stop at nothing to get at least some of Samsung's devices banned.

Samsung. Or Call it Apple v. Samsung: The Empires Strike Back.\n\nWhatever the description, the two warring titans of the smartphone and tablet industry are back in San Jose federal court on Monday, squaring off in another trial involving Apple’s claims that Samsung’s smartphones and tablets continue to trample on the patented features of the iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe case will unfold with jury selection, and the legal teams for the two companies — which to date have spent tens of millions of dollars on lawyers — are expected to make their opening statements on Tuesday.\n\nWith billions of dollars at stake, as well as bragging rights to technology that has transformed everyday life, legal experts and market watchers expect close attention on the trial, albeit perhaps with less zeal than the first showdown between them in 2012. That first round went to Apple, which secured a jury verdict finding that Samsung violated its patents on older lines of devices and owed nearly $1 billion in damages.\n\n“I guess they feel like they have to finish what they started,” said William Stofega, an analyst with the International Data Corp.\n\nThe second trial centers on Apple’s claims that more recent lines of Samsung products, such as the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Tab 2, violate five of Apple’s patents, including the Siri voice and slide-to-unlock features. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has already sided with Apple on one of the patents, the auto-complete text feature, so that claim will just boil down to damages.\n\n‘A lot of money’\n\nAs with the first trial, Apple’s pursuit of Samsung and claims of patent infringement are well behind the South Korean company’s release of even newer product lines. In fact, Samsung is expected to release its Galaxy S5 smartphone sometime in April, just as the jury continues to hear evidence of copying in older Galaxy smartphones that will soon be near-obsolete on the U.S. market.\n\nLegal experts say that continues to diminish the impact of Apple’s legal assault on Samsung, particularly because the company was unable to obtain a permanent injunction after the first trial to remove dozens of older Samsung smartphones and tablets from the American market.\n\n“This case does point up the fact that technology and the law move at very different speeds,” said Mark Lemley, a Stanford University tech law scholar. “As a result, I think this trial, like the last one, will be about money — a lot of money by the standards of us ordinary mortals, but not nearly enough to make or break Apple or Samsung.”\n\nTo Apple, however, the case against Samsung continues to be about trying to punish what it considers unrepentant copying of technology, this time in signature favorites such as the iPhone 5, iPad mini and even the MacBook Pro. Apple officials declined comment on the trial, as did Samsung’s lawyers.\n\nApple will present many of the same witnesses as the first trial, but many of the revelations about the secretive inner workings of developing iPad and iPhone technology will not carry the same sizzle. Yet the theme will be the same — that Apple engineers spent years creating unprecedented breakthroughs in phones and tablets that Samsung simply copied, stealing market share in the process.\n\nFor Samsung, meanwhile, the trial will be another opportunity to cast Apple as a company trying to stifle competition in the supercharged smartphone and tablet markets. Apple and Samsung have solidified their positions at the top of the heap in those products worldwide, and market watchers say that has only stabilized as the legal battle has unfolded.\n\nAndroid developments\n\nIn this trial, Apple’s parallel feud with Google and its Android operating system will perhaps play more of a central role than the first trial. To many in the industry, Apple’s patent fight with Samsung has always been as much about the late Steve Jobs’ grievance with what he considered Android’s duplication of Apple technology (he once promised “Thermonuclear War” with Google); Samsung until recently has relied heavily on Android in its smartphones and tablets.\n\nSamsung’s witness list includes several Google executives who are expected to testify about the Mountain View search giant’s Android developments, presumably to rebut Apple’s patent claims, according to court papers.\n\nThe trial, expected to last until May, will likely not be the last word in the patent spat. Samsung already has appealed the first jury verdict, and Apple has appealed Judge Koh’s refusal to block the sales of Samsung products that violated its patents.\n\n“Apple’s failure to win an injunction in the first case tends to lower the stakes this time around,” said Brian Love, a Santa Clara University law professor. “A ban on the sale of a flagship phone, on the other hand, is the kind of blow that Samsung might find more difficult to absorb.\n\n“I continue to be amazed that this legal battle has persisted for so long,” Love added.\n\nHoward Mintz covers legal affairs.

Yesterday we presented a video that Samsung doesn\'t want the jurors to see from the Federal Judicial Center, as it all but screams out that Apple is a leading US inventor . In a trial where Apple is seeking more than $2 billion in damages for copying features of its iPhone, the stakes are higher than they were in the first trial. So much so that Google will be making its first appearance in the US courtroom battle between the smartphone rivals in the hopes of tipping the US jury\'s perspective of the trail being about the US vs. Korea.\n\nThe latest fixture in the long-running patent fight will see the US and South Korean technology companies go head-to-head before a jury in the same courtroom in San Jose, California, that awarded $1bn in damages against Samsung in 2012.\n\nMany of the companies\' arguments will probably be repeated despite the different patents and smartphones at issue, with several of the same experts and witnesses presenting evidence, including Apple\'s marketing Chief Phil Schiller.\n\nHowever, in a departure from the previous case, Samsung will also call on the engineers behind Google\'s Android operating system, used by it most popular smartphones.\n\nThough Google, which does not generate any revenue directly from Android, is not a defendant, Samsung\'s legal team hopes that bringing another Silicon Valley company to aid its defence will reduce a perceived ""home turf"" advantage for Apple.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, ""Google executives, including Hiroshi Lockheimer, vice-president of engineering for Android, are expected to describe how they created the software that powered more than three quarters of all smartphones sold last year, independently of Apple\'s iPhone development.\n\nSamsung\'s legal tactic mimics Apple\'s lyrical retelling of the \'revolutionary\' iPhone\'s creation by its late founder Steve Jobs at the 2012 trial.""\n\nThis time, Apple\'s case hangs on five utility patents covering narrow software features that they hope will give a taste of the much wider copying by Samsung it alleges.\n\nThese include the iPhone\'s automatic correction of mistyped words, the slider that unlocks the home screen and the ""universal search"" that allows a user to look for content on the device and the internet simultaneously, sometimes using the Siri voice-activated assistant.\n\nThe Financial Times further notes that ""Devices Apple accuses of infringing these patents include Samsung\'s best-selling but ageing Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Nexus smartphones, the latter device having been developed largely to Google\'s specifications.""\n\nThe Financial Times adds that ""In a counter suit, Samsung is asserting just two utility patents, which cover wireless video transmission it argues is vital to Apple\'s FaceTime feature and a method for organising digital photos.\n\nApple is asking for between $33 and $40 for every phone sold that infringed its five patents since 2011, which it claims number in the tens of millions."" On this point, patent expert Florian Mueller thinks that Apple has lost their mind if they think that Samsung will ever agree to that royalty figure. Yet Apple will strongly argue that it is a fair representation.\n\nFor more on this, see the Financial Time\'s report.\n\nAbout Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.', 'The next round in the Apple-Samsung patent infringement war begins this week.\nIn a trial where Apple is seeking more than $2 billion in damages for copying features of its iPhone, the stakes are higher than they were in the first trial.\nSamsung\'s legal tactic mimics Apple\'s lyrical retelling of the \'revolutionary\' iPhone\'s creation by its late founder Steve Jobs at the 2012 trial.""\nFor more on this, see the Financial Time\'s report.\nAbout Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.']"

The apps will let you create, edit and view Word, Powerpoint and Excel documents without a fee.\n\nTo me, this news had the same effect of Apple announcing triumphantly that songs by The Beatles have arrived in iTunes, because if you were a Beatles fan, you would already have bought their CDs, and ripped them to iTunes.\n\niPad users who only want to read Word, Excel or Powerpoint files already have dozens of options that let them do that for free.\n\nIn fact, there are also many apps that let you create and edit these documents for free, including Apple’s Pages, Numbers and Keynote. Sure, these aren’t nearly as powerful as Microsoft Office, which will likely offer better roundtrip editing compatibility, but they’re good enough for anyone who edits documents occasionally.\n\nThere are also others like Microsoft’s own OneNote, a note-taking app, offered free for the PC, Mac, iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices. While not exactly a word processor, OneNote offers rich text editing for notes that can be synced across devices, much like how Office on iPad, iPhone and Android works.\n\nOther options include the free QuickOffice from Google, Smart Office 2 (S$12.98) and Documents To Go Premium (S$21.98).\n\nMaybe Microsoft will change its tune one day, as it did with OneNote. It initially allowed users to create up to 2,000 notes, unless they purchased the app. Today, OneNote is completely free.\n\nMicrosoft doesn’t need to offer Office for free. It shouldn’t. But perhaps the software giant, famous for its confusing, multiple editions for Office and Windows products, should consider offering Home and Business editions – a one-time purchase for the Home edition and a subscription fee for the Business edition.', 'It should come as no surprise that Microsoft’s Office for iPad apps topped the App Store charts shortly after their debut last week.\nClearly, there is a demand for Microsoft’s own Office apps that let you create documents, spreadsheets and presentations – even among folks who have been using third-party apps on tablets and smartphones.\nThe apps will let you create, edit and view Word, Powerpoint and Excel documents without a fee.\nSure, these aren’t nearly as powerful as Microsoft Office, which will likely offer better roundtrip editing compatibility, but they’re good enough for anyone who edits documents occasionally.\nMicrosoft doesn’t need to offer Office for free.']"

The company had previously hoarded Office for its own Windows-based tablet system, a conservative approach designed to protect the operating system that Microsoft has long considered its crown jewel.\n\nPutting out Office for iPad is a clear sign that Microsoft is finally liberating itself from long-held dogma and embracing new ideas. That change in strategy means Microsoft customers will finally be able to choose freely among hardware platforms, that Office users will be able to share data more readily between home and office, and that iPad owners can tap an even wider and more powerful collection of apps. Microsoft, meanwhile, finally has a fighting chance in the battle for the future of computing.\n\n""The Office team is finally being allowed to compete on all platforms instead of paying the strategy tax."" —Joel SpolskyUntil now, Microsoft has guarded Windows like a treasure hoard – a conservatism that put Microsoft\'s other businesses at a disadvantage in emerging sectors where Windows does not dominate.\n\n""Microsoft under [CEOs Bill] Gates and [Steve] Ballmer was always famous for the \'strategy tax\' – handicapping Office if necessary to promote Windows, and even handicapping Internet Explorer\'s editing capabilities to promote Office,"" says Joel Spolsky, a New York software entrepreneur who designed the macro language for Excel before leaving Microsoft in the late 1990s. ""This sounds like the Office team is finally being allowed to compete on all platforms instead of paying the strategy tax to bolster Windows sales.""\n\nDeciding what to do with the long-rumored Office for iPad was Nadella\'s first test, one that addressees the questions everyone asked when he was appointed: What changes would he be willing to make? How much would he sacrifice short-term goals for long-term relevance? Microsoft has never been good at sacrificing the former for the latter. But Nadella has shown signs of willingness in his career.\n\nHe made Microsoft\'s cloud division an unexpected success; no one expected the buttoned-down company to thrive in the world of online service platforms, where open standards and interoperability are everything. But Nadella learned to work closely with rival companies including, reportedly, Apple, which is said to run much of its iCloud service on Microsoft\'s Azure platform. Meanwhile, the hippie internet ideals of interop and openness seem to have stuck with the executive in his new job overseeing all of Microsoft.\n\nThis new mode of thinking was apparent in Microsoft\'s reported move away from Windows licensing fees. A spate of news accounts have Microsoft planning to discount and in many cases give away for free copies of Windows. The idea is that Microsoft can make up the lost revenue selling services like online storage and software rental. It seems that revenue from Windows, once jealously guarded, will now be sacrificed.\n\nIf these moves seem like they\'re part of a grand plan toward inclusiveness, that\'s because such a plan exists – at least when it comes to Office.\n\n""Our commitment going forward is to make sure we drive Office 365 everywhere – across the web, across all phones, across all tablets,"" CEO Nadella said at the launch event for iPad Office. ""We\'re taking great focus and great care to make sure Office on every device shines through.""\n\nExcel for iPad. Image: Microsoft\n\nA Return to Roots —————–\n\nMicrosoft\'s new strategy echoes Google\'s strategy of using its operating systems, Android and Chrome OS, as loss leaders for sales of advertising and online apps.\n\nBut this is also a return to Microsoft\'s roots. Back before it came to dominate the personal computer industry in the mid 1990s, Microsoft was an early and zealous adopter of systems that competed with its own operating systems, including Apple\'s Macintosh. Indeed, graphical versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel debuted on the Mac years before they were available on Windows.\n\nDominating the desktop seemed to make Microsoft more conservative, and the company was slow to convert its software to the web, despite the rise of web-based productivity software like Google Apps, and was also slow to embrace mobile devices, holding back Office for its own laggard tablet system, which launched in 2012, years after the iPad won the market.\n\nNow Microsoft finds itself backed into a corner. By trying to use its apps to protect its operating system, it destroyed the relevance of both. In the world of mobile devices – a category that already overshadows PCs – Microsoft\'s selling virtually no operating systems even as Office has been withheld from the only app markets that matter, those run by Apple and Google. Officially speaking, Microsoft claims it held back Office for iPad not for strategic reasons but to make it work better, to integrate better with Microsoft\'s developer interfaces and web services.\n\nIn the end, it might not matter why Microsoft is late to the iOS party. With iOS apps like Evernote, Mailbox, and Keynote occupying niches that used to belong to Word, Outlook, and PowerPoint, the question is whether these moves come too late to shift woeful trends in mobile.\n\n""The world has changed,"" Spolsky says. ""Word and Excel are no longer the killer applications that people need to buy a computer. Honestly there\'s very little word processing going on on tablets.""', 'Finally, Microsoft is opening itself up to the real world – and to some free love.\nAlmost four years to the day after the release of the first iPad, Microsoft deigned to put out a version of its flagship software package, the Office productivity suite, for the Apple tablet.\nPutting out Office for iPad is a clear sign that Microsoft is finally liberating itself from long-held dogma and embracing new ideas.\n""Our commitment going forward is to make sure we drive Office 365 everywhere – across the web, across all phones, across all tablets,"" CEO Nadella said at the launch event for iPad Office.\nIndeed, graphical versions of Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel debuted on the Mac years before they were available on Windows.']"

But I would not write off Microsoft’s own tablet initiatives as yet. Here’s why.\n\nCompanies increasingly adopt BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies because the younger generation of workers love to do things their way — and often, that means using a touchscreen tablet or smartphone. In the short run, this means that software-centric companies such as Microsoft have to make their offerings tailored for the “form factor” — as it is called.\n\nHowever, look hard, and you will find that the real deal is the touchscreen — not Apple or its iOS platform as such. Fact is that Apple stole a march by combing the touchscreen with tens of thousands of apps for both iPhone and iPad with an “ecosystem” that addressed many more needs (not counting its famous failure in Maps).\n\nMicrosoft is catching up from behind, as Nadella candidly admitted. Google’s own Andorid has also been ahead of Microsoft. But the match is wide open, as they say in cricket, because only the first innings — which we may call the Device Phase — has been played.\n\nThe second innings belongs to Cloud Phase and it has just begun. Now consider the idea that Microsoft is a player not only in the “personal cloud” just like Apple, but also could emerge stronger in the “enterprise cloud” in offering software on the Net for small and medium businesses.\n\nWindows devices are getting better and better, and the developers are busy with apps that match Microsoft requirement. Now, I can easily imagine Microsoft offering bundled touchscreen devices of its own (or its key partners that go back to the PC days). Increasingly, the software matters more once the touchscreen has been made mainstream.\n\nIn this new phase, the business-friendly software offered at right prices in corporate packages may lead to a big world (Read: Outside US) available for Microsoft to conquer.\n\nLast weekend, I saw ads for a value-for-money Windows tablet by Asus, as though to confirm my hunch.', 'At one level, it was an acceptance of the inevitable for Microsoft as Apple certainly stole the show (and continues to) with its tablet PC.\nCompanies increasingly adopt BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies because the younger generation of workers love to do things their way — and often, that means using a touchscreen tablet or smartphone.\nThe second innings belongs to Cloud Phase and it has just begun.\nNow, I can easily imagine Microsoft offering bundled touchscreen devices of its own (or its key partners that go back to the PC days).\nLast weekend, I saw ads for a value-for-money Windows tablet by Asus, as though to confirm my hunch.']"
68461,http://www.ubergizmo.com/2014/03/possible-to-use-office-for-ipad-without-office-365-subscription/,technology,"['Earlier this week Microsoft finally launched Office for iPad. The popular productivity suite, made up of Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps, has landed on Apple’s tablet absolutely free, but there is a caveat. Office for iPad apps can be used for reading, viewing and presentation only. If users want the full editing and composing power, they need an Office 365 subscription. However, a loophole left open by Microsoft makes it possible to use Office for iPad without Office 365 subscription.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAn Office 365 subscription gives subscribers the ability to install Office on up to five PCs and Macs, as well as on up to five tablets. The loophole makes it possible to install Office apps on virtually limitless iPads, Microsoft isn’t strictly enforcing the five tablet limit. The loophole is easy to exploit.

68462,http://www.techtimes.com/articles/4937/20140330/microsoft-announces-office-for-ipad-here-are-the-3-best-free-alternatives.htm,technology,"[""Close\n\nMicrosoft certainly took its time releasing Office for iPad. Now that the apps are finally here, the most common sensation - other than irritation about the high price of fully functional Office apps - is disappointment. The ship has sailed, Microsoft. No one wants Office on their iPad anymore and if they do, it's probably because they are already suckered into an Office 365 subscription.\n\nThere are bigger and better alternatives to Office in the App store. All of them are cheaper than the requisite $6.99 or $9.99 a month Office 365 subscription you need in order to do literally anything to your documents on your iPad and some of them are even free. Yes, I said free.\n\niWork\n\nThe most obvious alternative to Microsoft Office, is obviously Apple's iWork app suite. When Apple launched the iPad Air and iPad Mini with retina display last year, it announced that the entire iWork app suite would come preinstalled, with full functionality on every new iPad. Apple iWork includes Pages, Numbers, Keynote, iPhoto, Garage Band, iCloud and iMovie. These apps are effectively the equivalent of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneDrive and then some. The iWork suite includes apps that Microsoft Office doesn't even have and it's free on new iPads. If you have an older iPad, you pay $40 for the whole suite, but you pay that price only once - not every month.\n\nJust in case that's not all you need to know to be convinced, here's some more food for thought. You can edit, export and store any document you create in an iWork app and save it to iCloud or anywhere you want for free. There are no hidden fees, no subscriptions and you still find almost the exact same functionality. You can edit and create photos, movies, documents, spreadsheets and more using iWork, just as you would with Office.\n\nThe Microsoft Office app suite when paired with Office 365 Premium for $9.99 a month will give you the ability to share the software on five PCs or Macs in addition to five iPads or Windows tablets, so depending on how much you and your family use the Office app suite, it could potentially be worth your while. However, if you just use Word, PowerPoint and Excel for school and basic work, you really do not need to pay $9.99 a month to use Office when you can do everything you need to do on iWork.\n\nGoogle Drive\n\nGoogle Drive is another excellent alternative to Microsoft Office, simply because its free and readily available on iOS. Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations and Forms are all contained in one app and you get 15 GB of cloud storage for all of your documents free. If you manage to use all that storage up, Google's newly lowered cloud storage prices should keep you happy. After all, you can get 100GB of cloud storage for only $1.99 each month, which beats the hell out of Microsoft's price of $6.99 or $9.99 for Office 365.\n\nThe other great part about Google Drive is that since its in the cloud, it doesn't take up space on your iPad. It all goes into the cloud, where it is easily shared with collaborators, who can also edit the document with you and track changes. Google Drive is also quite universal and can be exported, saved offline and shared in large groups. All the documents automatically download in Office document format, too, so there are no compatibility issues when you email your documents to someone else.\n\nQuickOffice\n\nYet another great Microsoft Office alternative for iPad, QuickOffice, also comes from Google. Much like Drive, it allows you to edit, share, collaborate and create documents. The app includes Sheets, Docs and Slides, which in essence are Excel, Word and PowerPoint for free. In QuickOffice, you can access all the files you have saved in Google Drive, edit them, share them and email them to others. The app also allows you to open and edit PDFs. It is also free.\n\nOthers\n\nEvernote, Quip, SwiftKey and other note-taking apps are also free for iPad. These apps are decent replacements for Word, but won't cover you if you need PowerPoint or Excel. Still, most people just want Word on their iPads anyways with the occasional use of Excel or PowerPoint, so any of these note-taking apps when used in conjunction with Google Drive or iWork should more than fulfill your needs.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

It’s been a long awaited and well overdue release, but the software company and Cupertino, California-based corporation have delivered something enterprise users, students and everyday consumers can rely on.\n\n“Microsoft is focused on delivering the cloud for everyone, on every device. It’s a unique approach that centers on people — enabling the devices you love, work with the services you love, and in a way that works for IT and developers,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a press statement.\n\nOffice software allows users to create and edit documents, work with spreadsheets and design presentations via its Word, Excel, and PowerPoint programs. Similar to Office for iPhone, the iPad version will employ Microsoft’s Office 365 subscription for creating and editing content, but users looking to simply read and present content can do so for free with the app. Last year, Microsoft shifted to a subscription model for Office with Office Home Premium, which is priced at $9.99 a month, $99.99 a year.\n\nMobile Office apps have been available for iPhone and Android smartphones, with a mandatory Office 365 subscription. While Office for iPhone included basic editing, the iPad version allows for more features.\n\nOffice on iPad is “a beautiful set of applications,” said Nadella at the Thursday morning press event, adding that the company is “taking great care to make sure that Office on every device shines through.”\n\nBut is the release a little too late for users who have gotten used to living without the program on iPad? We turned to Twitter to see what users had to say:\n\n#OfficeForiPad app has freemium business model; Office 365 subscribers have full capabilities now. — The TZA (@TatianaKing) March 27, 2014\n\nEmotionally, I want Office for iPad to be a standalone product.

""How do I manage that? How will I deal with a BYOD world? But I think next week is more about Windows. I\'m fully expecting Windows news [about Office] not too far in the future.""\n\nThat near-future will be as soon as this week, when Microsoft hosts the Build developers conference in San Francisco April 2-4, said Ross Rubin, an independent analyst at Reticle Research.\n\n""Clearly, Nadella gave just a piece of the overall strategy today,"" Rubin said on Thursday. ""The balance is between supporting customers not on Microsoft\'s platforms, supporting customers on Windows on other OEMs\' devices, and supporting customers on Microsoft\'s own devices. Today we got a taste of how Microsoft is embracing the first. We\'ll get how they address the latter groups at Build.""\n\nAfter last week\'s news conference, which was webcast -- both Miller and Rubin watched that webcast -- and off-camera, Nadella confirmed that Microsoft would expand on Office on Windows at the developers conference, according to Geekwire.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nadella did not promise that Microsoft would launch a Windows 8.1-specific version of Office then, one that would also be a touch-first suite and run on that operating system\'s ""Modern,"" née ""Metro"" user interface (UI). ""You\'ll see us talk even more about it next week, in terms of what innovation we are doing on that platform,"" Nadella told Geekwire.\n\nNadella hinted at the same in a blog he authored last week. ""We\'re a few days away from Build, our developer conference, where next week we\'ll share where we\'re going with key platforms like Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox and Azure,"" he wrote.\n\nThe unveiling order of a touch-enabled Office -- first for iPad, Microsoft\'s tablet rival -- was a departure from previous company statements. Last October, then-CEO Steve Ballmer told an audience at a Gartner-hosted symposium that Office for iPad would ship, but only after something similar had launched for Windows 8.1.\n\nAs recently as a week before Microsoft trotted out Office for iPad, some experts were skeptical, rumors notwithstanding, that the company would launch on a competitor\'s platform before it did on its own. And for good reason.\n\n""You\'d better bet that if they [do unveil] Office for the iPad, they give a lot of details on Office for Metro,"" said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, in a March 19 interview. ""It would be absolutely horrible if they didn\'t. Microsoft has drilled in developers\' heads that anything other than Windows is bad.""\n\nTo Moorhead and others, Microsoft risked fracturing already-strained relationships with developers by promoting apps on a non-Windows OS.\n\nBut by Thursday, Moorhead and other analysts were singing a different tune, applauding Microsoft for demonstrating that it was serious about its devices and services strategy, or as Nadella has put it, a ""mobile-first, cloud-first"" strategy -- even if that meant discarding the ""Windows-first"" philosophy it\'s adhered to for decades.\n\n""This was the proof point of delivering on the devices and services strategy,"" Moorhead said last week.\n\nMicrosoft will kick off Build April 2 with a keynote address scheduled to run from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. PT (11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. ET). As at past Build conferences, Microsoft will live stream the keynote from its Channel 9 website and the conference\'s own page.

68477,http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/microsoft-office-for-ipad-app-boosts-productivity-and-brings-simplicity-to-apples-tablet-line-up-220706.html,technology,"[""hidden\n\nBy Bree Fowler/Associated Press\n\nNew York: Microsoft Office fans who've spent the last nine months using the software's suite of apps on their tiny smartphone screens are probably thrilled that they can finally create and update documents on the iPad's significantly bigger display surface.\n\nThe new version of Office for Apple's tablet is not likely to be a big deal for anyone else. While the apps are beautiful, intuitive and include many familiar functions from the popular desktop version of Office, typing and maneuvering the cursor within documents remains awkward and inefficient.\n\nMicrosoft released Office for the iPad on Thursday; nearly four years after Apple launched the groundbreaking tablet. It includes the Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps that will be familiar to both business and everyday people.\n\nUp until now, Office users had to make due with a very basic version designed for smartphones that first launched in June 2013. Competitors like Apple and Google also created similar software for the iPad, but those apps have very basic features and don't always mesh perfectly with Microsoft documents.\n\nMicrosoft's new apps are free, but you need an annual subscription to Microsoft's Office 365, which costs between $70 and $100 depending on the version, to do more than just read documents.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, the trio of apps occupied the top three spots on the App Store's real time list of most downloaded free apps. Honestly, the free versions may meet the needs of a lot of people, because displaying documents is one of the most useful functions of the apps.\n\nPulling up documents is quick and easy, especially if they're stored on a user's OneDrive account, which comes with 20 gigabytes of cloud storage space as part of the Office 365 subscription.\n\nYou can shrink or enlarge the type to fit as much or as little of it as you like on your screen. I could fit my entire one-page resume, which is largely written in an eight-point font, on the iPad's screen and still easily read it.\n\nBut the iPad Air's super-clear retina display probably helped. And it's worth mentioning that I don't wear glasses. People with impaired vision might have a tougher time. Either way, it's still a big upgrade from looking at the same document on an iPhone screen.\n\nExcel spreadsheets, especially the large ones I viewed, required a little more pinching and stretching to view, because of their larger size, but were still fairly easy to scroll through.\n\nFor people who want to take notes or presentation materials into a meeting without dragging along a stack of printouts or a laptop, this is going to be really handy. And if you use OneDrive, it's nice to know you can always have access to your files on a relatively compact and lightweight device.\n\nUnfortunately, other cloud-based services like Dropbox aren't compatible. But is it worth the effort to try to create or edit Office documents on an iPad?\n\nRather than stripping down Office to a super-basic version, like it did with the smartphone software, Microsoft created a version of Office that's customised for the tablet user and includes many of the bells and whistles of the desktop version.\n\nThe app is relatively easy to use and its layout is clean and simple. Word's toolbar at the top lets you do things like change the typeface of fonts and size, highlight text and customize margins and columns. You can also insert page breaks and pictures from your iPad's camera roll or photo stream. There's also a nice selection of compatible fonts to choose from —even Wingdings, if you like that sort of thing.\n\nIn order to cut and paste and make other changes to text in Word, you have to tap twice on the area you want to update, which brings up a set of scrolling bars, much like in other iOS applications.

Microsoft deserves kudos, and its recent stock price appreciation, for taking the leap. However, some analysts believe that bringing Office to iPads will have a positive impact near-term, but destroy what little momentum Microsoft Surface tablets have enjoyed. The naysayers may be right, but let\'s not write off Microsoft\'s tablet ambitions quite yet.\n\nA few specs\n\nAccording to research firm Gartner, of the various device types -- PCs, tablets, mobile phones, and ""other"" which includes devices like clamshells -- tablets are expected to see the highest rate of sales growth in 2014. With an expected jump in tablets sold of 38.6% compared to 2013, there are opportunities for upstart tablet makers like Microsoft to make some headway.\n\nGartner\'s research also suggests 2014 will be the year that tablet sales nearly catch up to PCs, 270.7 million to 277.7 million, respectively. By 2015, the war between PCs and tablets will officially be over, with tablets rising out of the ashes to emerge as the clear-cut winner.\n\nThe critical question for Microsoft\'s tablet ambitions is what can it do to grab a piece of the market\'s fast growing pie? The data from Gartner offers up some intriguing ideas for Nadella and his devices and services team to consider.\n\nA few considerations\n\nLike most things, Microsoft\'s recent tablet sales success should be put in context. Though Microsoft ended 2013 with more than double the previous year\'s tablet market share and nearly four times the number of tablets sold, there\'s a bit more to the story. For one thing, Microsoft\'s tablet market share as measured by OS sales of 2.1%, compared with Apple\'s 36% is paltry. Microsoft\'s 4 million tablets sold doesn\'t exactly stack up well to Apple\'s 70.4 million units, either.\n\nBut here\'s where Gartner\'s research comes into play. The growth in tablets, as with most mobile devices including smartphones, will come from markets outside North America. Domestically, Apple dominates the tablet market, but as Gartner stated, ""iOS tablet growth has slowed in North America and Apple will need to reinvigorate its replacement cycle.""\n\nIf Gartner\'s right, emerging markets are where the opportunities lie to grow tablet share, and Microsoft has a couple of things going for it in that regard. When its deal to bring Nokia\'s devices and services unit in-house is (finally) completed, Microsoft will also gain Nokia\'s strong presence in several key, growth markets. Nokia is a well-known quantity in Asia, Africa, and other emerging regions, and that should give Microsoft a foot in the door as it makes the transition.\n\nAlso, Microsoft is in the enviable position -- as its Office for iOS and recent cloud deal in China will attest -- of having time to grow tablet market share. Microsoft\'s strong financial position could give it the room it needs to shave margins a bit to better position Surface as a legitimate, lower cost alternative for financially strapped emerging market consumers. For folks like Apple that rely so heavily on product sales and steadfastly refuse to change, a saturated high-end tablet market with no entry-level or mid-level alternatives will become a problem.\n\nFinal Foolish thoughts\n\nMicrosoft\'s recent accomplishments: namely, rapid growth in cloud revenues, the boost from making Office available to iOS users, and optimism surrounding its new CEO, are just a few reasons Microsoft stock has been on such a nice run of late. But let\'s not entirely give up on Surface yet. It\'s an uphill climb, to be sure, but Nadella and Microsoft might just pleasantly surprise us -- again.', 'The naysayers may be right, but let\'s not write off Microsoft\'s tablet ambitions quite yet.\nThe critical question for Microsoft\'s tablet ambitions is what can it do to grab a piece of the market\'s fast growing pie?\nA few considerationsLike most things, Microsoft\'s recent tablet sales success should be put in context.\nFor one thing, Microsoft\'s tablet market share as measured by OS sales of 2.1%, compared with Apple\'s 36% is paltry.\nDomestically, Apple dominates the tablet market, but as Gartner stated, ""iOS tablet growth has slowed in North America and Apple will need to reinvigorate its replacement cycle.""']"

Early on in the week there was the case of a 12-year-old girl who wanted nothing more than an iPad Mini. Microsoft stepped in and managed to convince her that the Surface 2 was the way ahead. Way to spin! But this was not the big Microsoft-iPad news. In a move that many saw as almost sacrilegious -- but one that was welcomed by just about the same number -- Microsoft Office, finally, made its way onto iPad. This wasn\'t the only release from Microsoft this week -- the source code for early versions of MS-DOS and Word for Windows was made publicly available. Having faced criticism for the way it approached a recent investigation, Microsoft pledged that it would no longer read customer emails during the course of an investigation without getting law enforcement involved.\n\nWindows XP may be in its death throes, but this isn\'t going to stop people from using it. To help keep these hardy fellows safe, Malwarebytes announced that it would keep its users protected for life. It\'s not just XP that Microsoft is lowering into the grave, Office 2003 also finds itself six feet under. As the door on XP closes, another one opens -- or closes, depending on how you look at it. The purchase of Nokia\'s Devices and Services division is due to close in April after initially facing some delays.\n\nWhile Joe bemoaned the DRM crippling of his music collection, fears were mounting that changes to tax laws in the UK and Europe could lead to an increase in the cost of digital downloads. But while the cost of apps and MP3s might be on the up, the cost of life in the cloud is dropping -- hooray!\n\nThis weekend sees the first gay marriages taking place in the UK, but in the world of software developers boycotted Firefox after it was suggested that the new CEO is opposed to same-sex nuptials. Security was breached at Basecamp when a huge DDoS blocked access to the site which found itself held to ransom by the attackers.\n\nHTC took the wraps off the latest additions to the One range -- the HTC One (M8), and Mihaita felt the accompanying ad was a little cocky. Odd happenings in South Korea saw the Galaxy S5 being sold by mobile operators two weeks ahead of the official launch. To help young people save up the money needed to invest in a new handset, Spotify introduced a new lower pricing structure for students. Facebook, on the other hand was throwing cash around like it was going out of fashion, chucking $2 billion on virtual reality startup Oculus VR.\n\nThis was an interesting week for wearable tech. I previously talked about (ok, moaned about) the pointlessness of most wearable tech, inadvertently pre-empting Google\'s defense of Google Glass. In sticking up for a product that hasn’t even launched yet, it did feel as though Google was suffering from a case of ""the lady doth protest too much"", but a few days later it all became clear as the company announced it was joining forces with the firm behind Ray-Ban. It\'s almost as though Google has been laying the groundwork... but then I am a big cynic! But as if to prove it\'s not just me who likes to view things slightly skeptically, Alan suggested that Apple has already lost the wearable race to Android.\n\nMice reviews don’t come around all that frequently these days, but then you turn your back for a little while and two come along at once. Alan took a look at the Rapoo T120P Touch Mouse complete with its wheel-less scrolling zone featuring haptic feedback. At the rather less fancy end of the spectrum, I looked at the Microsoft Wireless Mobile 1850 Mouse, coming to the conclusion that it was very much what you would expect from a low-cost Microsoft mouse -- cheap, cheerful, effective.\n\nOne of the odder stories of the week was that Kim Dotcom -- yes, him -- is embarking on a political career, with a manifesto that focuses mainly on freedom online. There is no hope for humanity. The policies may be of interest to those in Turkey who have found that both Twitter and YouTube have been blocked. Some interesting changes to the law in the UK mean that CD and DVD ripping will soon be legal.\n\nSlipping into sarcasm mode, I revelled in the fact that a new viewing option in Gmail makes ""promotional emails"" more prominent. Rejoice, one and all!\n\nGazing into my crystal ball I can foresee another hectic week ahead. I\'m off to have a lie down in preparation.\n\nImage Credit: vinz89 / Shutterstock', ""Microsoft has flirted with Apple's iPad on a couple of occasions this week.\nEarly on in the week there was the case of a 12-year-old girl who wanted nothing more than an iPad Mini.\nThis wasn't the only release from Microsoft this week -- the source code for early versions of MS-DOS and Word for Windows was made publicly available.\nIt's not just XP that Microsoft is lowering into the grave, Office 2003 also finds itself six feet under.\nI previously talked about (ok, moaned about) the pointlessness of most wearable tech, inadvertently pre-empting Google's defense of Google Glass.""]"

The entire tablet market is expected to undergo a significant change following the launch of a bigger iPhone in the third quarter, and a larger tablet, probably in the fourth quarter. The devices will have all the functionality of a notebook including Office.\n\nOverall, the analyst believes that Office for iPad will be a “mild positive for units,” and the new products will bring more real “excitement” for Apple Inc.

The app is freely downloadable, but a subscription is required for users to create or edit documents. In must be noted that executives demoed none of the software on Windows machines.\n\nPositive change from Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Office for iPad has been made available to iPad users from Thursday. The latest move is a positive deviation from Microsoft’s previous Windows focused policies. Previously, it has been noticed that the software giant was reluctant to move away from its signature PC operating system.\n\nIn the latest move from Microsoft, strategy is more important than technology. Office for iPad marks the growing efforts by the software company to transform into a leading services company across multiple platforms. The strategy is certainly at the expense of Windows and its own Surface tablet, but it’s worth it.\n\nAnalysts believe that by not having an Office version for iPad, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost billions of dollars in revenue.

You look at what users do on a tablet, Office general manager Julia White told TechRadar Pro at the launch.\n\n""We looked and said what are people doing in that environment and let\'s take that as a starting point; let\'s put the right amount of capabilities in, and then add from there what makes sense.""\n\nBut this is definitely just the beginning, she emphasized. ""This is just our v1, we\'re just getting started. We\'re going to make these apps richer based on what people are doing. As we get user feedback and we see what people are doing, we will update in the right ways; we\'ll get feedback about what people are doing most and what people want more of, and then we can rev the apps quickly. What we picked was the base; much more than you have on the phone, not everything you have on the PC or Mac but somewhere in between. It\'s what people are mostly doing on those devices. And we were also really thoughtful about making it a great touch experience.""\n\nThe key is matching the way you work on an iPad, Office Product Management Director Michael Atalla explained. ""When you\'re picking up an iPad it\'s because you\'re picking up your work; precision control designed PowerPoints are not going to start on iPad necessarily, they\'re going to start on Windows or a Mac with a keyboard and mouse where you have that control and you\'re going to move to an iPad when you\'re ready to tweak and edit.""\n\nThat\'s why when you open a document you\'ve worked on elsewhere, Office for iPad automatically takes you to the place you were editing last; the assumption is that you want to carry on where you left off.\n\nThe more cloud tools, the merrier\n\nThe price of Office for iPad is about striking a balance between letting you get your documents everywhere when you want to carry on working and giving you a reason to pay for Office 365, White explained. ""It\'s so important that people don\'t lose information [when they change devices] so we want to make sure everyone can have a taste of what Office is good for and why people love it. But we also want to add value for Office 365 subscribers.\n\n""So we felt that was the right balance. I can read all of my files, consume my content, I can present my content for free. But any manipulation of it, if I want to change words or do formatting, I need the subscription. Or if I want to start a new word or PowerPoint or Excel file in iPad, I need the subscription for that.""\n\nWe asked White how quickly to expect new versions of Office for iPad and it sounds like pretty soon. ""In Office 365, we\'ve been doing updates weekly,"" she pointed out. ""We\'re going to watch really closely and see how people are using these apps and you should expect us to iterate very really fast. Especially as it\'s a v1 so we\'ll be learning fast and iterating fast.""\n\nIs Office late or just right?\n\nThere have been rumours for a long time about Office for iPad.

Mars will not have any impact due to the close approach of the comet, but the dust from the comet is likely to have some effect on the Red Planet.\n\nThe comet, called as Sliding Spring, is surrounded by a dust cloud, which measures over 12,000 miles.

After processing the image, it became evident that two streams of dust were jutting off the comet in opposite directions.\n\nThe information will help astronomers figure out the movement of the comet and its cloud of dust.

The comet, on a once-in-a-million-year swing around the sun, currently is slated to pass within 82,460 miles of the red planet – roughly a third of the distance between the Earth and moon.\n\nThe cometary flyby comes with equal doses of excitement and trepidation. It represents a rare opportunity to observe a comet at close quarters. But the dust the comet spews could represent a potentially serious risk to the small flotilla of craft orbiting Mars on Oct. 14, the day of closest encounter.\n\n""This is a first-time comet; we haven\'t seen it before,"" says Richard Zurek, chief scientist for the Mars Program Office at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ""This is a very exciting opportunity. But it is one of those things where you go: Oh, this is great. And then you go: Wait a minute; do I need to worry about this comet?""\n\nScientists and engineers are now in the process of trying to figure out how much trepidation should accompany the excitement and how to minimize risks to the orbiters from dust the comet will shed.\n\nThe team is especially interested in dust particles larger than about 100 microns – the average diameter of a human hair. The comet will be approaching nearly head-on as seen from Mars, so the velocity of the particles reaching the planet will be much higher than they would be if the two objects were moving in the same general direction.\n\nEven hair-thin dust particles can put the hurt on delicate instruments when the particles and spacecraft meet at 125,000 miles an hour.\n\nHelp in assessing that risk is coming from the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nOn Thursday, astronomers using the orbiting observatory released images showing two jets of dust and gas erupting from the nucleus. These features allow astronomers to figure out where the nucleus\'s poles are and the direction of the nucleus\'s axis as it rotates. Combined with observations from late January, these latest images also allow researchers to estimate the how fast dust particles are traveling as they leave the nucleus.\n\nThree independent modeling teams are using the information to determine where those particles are likely to be during closest approach, Dr. Zurek says.\n\nAlthough the teams are converging on an answer, ""they aren\'t quite there yet,"" he says. The teams are expected to have their best estimates available by mid-April.\n\nAs for NASA\'s Mars rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity, the atmosphere of Mars is thick enough to incinerate the dust before it reaches the surface.\n\nIn the meantime, researchers are laying the groundwork for their comet-flyby observing campaign.\n\nAlthough spacecraft from Europe, the US, and India are expected to be orbiting Mars at the time, some of the most exciting science may come from NASA\'s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The craft carries a high-resolution camera that will allow it to identify features as small as 500 feet across on a comet nucleus that could be more than half a mile across. It should be able to identify active areas on the nucleus\'s surface and, through images taken before and after flyby, give researchers a better estimate of the nucleus\'s rotation.\n\nIn addition, visible and infrared observations of the dusty halo around the nucleus, as well as of the comet\'s tail, is expected to yield information on the size of the dust particles.\n\nThe team also will be studying the effect the arriving particles could have on the depth of the atmosphere as the upper atmosphere absorbs the heat from the passage of dust as it burns up.\n\nPreliminary estimates suggest that the dust will take about 90 minutes to arrive at the planet after the comet\'s closest approach – the amount of time the orbiters will have to reach the sheltered skies behind the planet, if the estimates of dust emissions point to an unacceptable risk of damage.\n\nPlanners are looking at ways to slowly change spacecraft orbits so that they can make the observations scientists would like to make and still allow the craft to remain on the dust-free side of the planet during the height of the meteor shower, explains Soren Madsen, the Mars Exploration Program\'s chief engineer.\n\n""We\'re basically hiding the orbiters behind Mars,"" he says. ""Since all of the dust is coming from one direction, there will be a dust shadow.""\n\nIn addition, planners are exploring ways to reorient the craft to shield sensitive instruments or solar panels from excessive pummeling from the dust.\n\nSince NASA\'s Deep Space Network is the lynchpin for communications with the orbiters, planners also are trying to figure out how to manage communications with up to five orbiters, all of which will be seeking safe haven behind the red planet.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

But the maneuvers would be fuel intensive at that late date.\n\n""The earlier we initiate the maneuvers, the cheaper they are in terms of fuel,"" Mr. Madsen says. The team aims to have a risk reduction plan in place by late June so that controllers can begin tweaking orbits in late July.', ""But the dust the comet spews could represent a potentially serious risk to the small flotilla of craft orbiting Mars on Oct. 14, the day of closest encounter.\nThe team is especially interested in dust particles larger than about 100 microns – the average diameter of a human hair.\nEven hair-thin dust particles can put the hurt on delicate instruments when the particles and spacecraft meet at 125,000 miles an hour.\nAs for NASA's Mars rovers, Opportunity and Curiosity, the atmosphere of Mars is thick enough to incinerate the dust before it reaches the surface.\nAlthough spacecraft from Europe, the US, and India are expected to be orbiting Mars at the time, some of the most exciting science may come from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.""]"

These tails appear to sprout from opposite sides of Siding Spring.\n\nComets are large, dirty snowballs, composed of frozen carbon dioxide and water ice, mixed with dust and rock. Billions of these objects exist in the outer solar system, making up the Oort cloud. Occasionally, two comets will collide, sending one or both members plunging toward the Sun. Some collide with our companion star and others fall apart on their first trip around the Sun, as Comet ISON did at the end of 2013. A few fall into steady orbits and make regular trips around the solar system.\n\nAs comets approach the Sun, they warm and ice begins to turn into gas which leaves the nucleus, or main body of the comet.

Li (Planetary Science Institute). The image on the left, captured March 11 by NASA\'s Hubble Space Telescope, shows comet C/2013 A1, also called Siding Spring, at a distance of 353 million miles from Earth. Hubble can\'t see Siding Spring\'s icy nucleus because of its diminutive size. The nucleus is surrounded by a glowing dust cloud, or COMA, that measures roughly 19,000 kilometres (12,000 miles) across. The right image shows the comet after image processing techniques were applied to remove the hazy glow of the coma revealing what appear to be two jets of dust coming off the location of the nucleus in opposite directions. This observation should allow astronomers to measure the direction of the nucleus’s pole, and axis of rotation. Hubble also observed Siding Spring on January 21 as Earth was crossing its orbital plane, which is the path the comet takes as it orbits the sun. This positioning of the two bodies allowed astronomers to determine the speed of the dust coming off the nucleus.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope photographed Comet Siding Spring on March 11, 2014. Hubble resolves two jets of dust coming from the solid icy nucleus. This is the enhanced image captured by the telescope\'s Wide Field Camera 3. Image: NASA, ESA, and J.-Y. Li (Planetary Science Institute). ""This is critical information that we need to determine whether, and to what degree, dust grains in the coma of the comet will impact Mars and spacecraft in the vicinity of Mars,"" said Jian-Yang Li of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona. Discovered in January 2013 by Robert H. McNaught at Siding Spring Observatory, the comet is falling toward the sun along a roughly 1 million year orbit and is now within the radius of Jupiter\'s orbit. The comet will make its closest approach to our sun on October 25, at a distance of 209 million kilometres (130 million miles) – well outside of Earth\'s orbit. The comet is not expected to become bright enough to be seen by the naked eye.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope pre-processed image of Comet Siding Spring. Image: NASA, ESA, and J.-Y. Li (Planetary Science Institute). The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency. NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland., manages the telescope. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore conducts Hubble science operations. STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., in Washington.', ""The image on the left, captured March 11 by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, shows comet C/2013 A1, also called Siding Spring, at a distance of 353 million miles from Earth.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope photographed Comet Siding Spring on March 11, 2014.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope pre-processed image of Comet Siding Spring.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and the European Space Agency.\nThe Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore conducts Hubble science operations.""]"

As well as the electric blue ram pressure stripping streaks seen emanating from ESO 137-001, a giant gas stream can be seen extending towards the bottom of the frame, only visible in the X-ray part of the spectrum. NASA, ESA, CXC\n\nNASA\'s Hubble Space Telescope has once again shown itself to be a crack investigator, recently capturing a distant spiral galaxy in the process of spilling its cosmic guts.\n\nThe new Hubble images reveal the deadly passage of ESO 137-001 through a region of gas inside of a cluster of galaxies, with opposing forces causing the spiral to leave a large portion of its innards trailing behind. ""This cluster is violently ripping the spiral\'s entrails out into space, leaving bright blue streaks as telltale clues to this cosmic crime,"" Hubble telescope officials wrote in an image description. Scientists describe the galaxy mayhem in a video of galaxy ESO 137-001 featuring the Hubble views.\n\nLocated in the southern triangle, ESO 137-001 is a spiral galaxy traveling at nearly 4.5 million mph (7.2 million km/h) through the Norma cluster. As it plows its way through the superheated gas around it, ESO 137-001 experiences a process known as ram pressure stripping, which is akin to the drag swimmers feel as they pass through the water.\n\nJust as a fast-moving swimmer and a too-loose suit can result in disaster at the beach, ram pressure stripping can leave its mark on galaxies. Though gravity keeps the galaxy\'s stars contained, the motion strips away much of the its interior gas, shown in the intense blue streaks that shine brightly in ultraviolet light.\n\nAlthough the stripped gas then becomes a center of star formation, the galaxy itself will suffer; very little is left behind to fuel the future birth of stars within the spiral.\n\nGas isn\'t the only element taken from the fast-moving galaxy. Though ESO 137-001 holds on to most of its dust, some is captured by the gas of the cluster, showing its displacement in brown streaks.\n\nThe secrets of the distant spiral have been particularly challenging to probe, as ESO 137-001 lies close to the plane of the Milky Way galaxy and is partially obscured by the dust of our own galaxy. Hubble\'s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) proved an excellent sleuth, capable of peering through the region.\n\nImages of stripped galaxies help scientists gain a better understanding of galactic evolution, particularly the future of bodies pressing through the heart of a galactic cluster.\n\nThe fate of ESO 137-001 is particularly interesting since its parent cluster resides near the center of the Great Attractor, a massive region of space that pulls entire galaxy clusters. Only 200 million light-years away, the Milky Way won\'t escape its reach; our galaxy and its parent cluster are both being pulled slowly toward this dense region.\n\nFollow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook or Google+.

Two eaglets have recently hatched next to one other egg in a bald eagle nest, with all of this action currently being captured via a Live Stream.\n\nThe first bald eagle chick hatched on Friday after 37 days of incubation. This is slightly longer than the average 35-day incubation period for eagle eggs, according to NBC News.\n\nThrough the videos, viewers found that one night, the mother eagle chased away a raccoon that tried to raid the nest.

Fortunately, none of the eggs were harmed.\n\nThe first egg was laid Feb. 19, the second Feb. 22 and the third, Feb. 25, according to Philly.com.\n\nHowever, the future lives for these birds depend on numerous factors, according to state Game Commission officer Gary Fujak.

The first eagle egg hatched on Friday, and the second egg hatched on Sunday. A third eagle egg will likely hatch within the next 48 to 72 hours, according to experts at the National Aviary.\n\nThe bald eagle has been absent from Pittsburgh for about 250 years. Local newspaper, the Tribune Reviewhas a live webcam feed on the eagle nest at all times to catch the action. The Pittsburgh-PostGazette has the same live feed on the bald eagle nest and a special page on their website dedicated to eagle facts and information.\n\nThe bald eagle nest camera is one of three bird cameras that the National Aviary supports and promotes in the Pittsburgh area. The other two nests they help watch are inhabited by peregrine falcons.\n\nThe return of the bald eagle to Pittsburgh has been called a “watershed event for bird conservation and environmental remediation” by the National Aviary. Some factors that have contributed to not one single eagle nesting in the area in almost three hundred years include pollution, pesticides, lost habitat, and persecution.\n\nIn 2011, a bald eagle pair built a nest and raised young eagles on private land, but the more recent eagle nest is visible to the public and located in an area called Hays. The eagles already raised one young one bald eagle last year, and then built a new nest this past fall in a different tree.\n\nIn late 2013, a bald eagle nest camera was installed. It has since been a popular place for the eagle experts and enthusiasts, as well as the general public, to watch the lives of the bald eagle couple and their young unfold. Almost 1 million people have viewed the bald eagle camera feed so far.\n\nThe bald eagle is a bird of prey that is the national bird of the United States, and a symbol often associated more generally with the U.S. They are found throughout North America, but about half of the world’s 70,000 bald eagles live in Alaska. Part of what allows them to flourish in that region is the abundance of salmon, as living or dead fish is a staple food for the bald eagle, which is a sea bird.\n\nThe presence of the eagles in Hays, Pittsburgh are seen as a sign that the environmental health of the area is improving. The Monogahela River, where the eagles are nesting, was once almost bereft of fish. Today, it holds 67 species of fish, which means plenty of bald eagle food.', 'A live camera feed has captured two bald eagle eggs hatching in the Pittsburgh area.\nThe Pittsburgh-PostGazette has the same live feed on the bald eagle nest and a special page on their website dedicated to eagle facts and information.\nThe bald eagle nest camera is one of three bird cameras that the National Aviary supports and promotes in the Pittsburgh area.\nIn late 2013, a bald eagle nest camera was installed.\nAlmost 1 million people have viewed the bald eagle camera feed so far.']"
