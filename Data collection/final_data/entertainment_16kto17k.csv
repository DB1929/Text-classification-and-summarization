The posted speed limit on the Santa Clarita, California, office park road was 45 mph.\n\nThe sheriff’s conclusion is no surprise, since the coroner’s report previously estimated the car was speeding at 100 mph. But the investigative report does clear up some questions that have lingered about how Walker died.\n\nWalker, 40, and friend Roger Rodas, 38, had no drugs or alcohol in their blood. Both men were wearing seat belts. The airbags deployed as they should have when the car clipped a light pole and several trees, investigators said.\n\nNothing mechanical went wrong to cause their Porsche to leave the wide road. Investigators found “no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision,” the report said. Experts from Porsche and Michelin were consulted.\n\nThe car did have “an aftermarket exhaust system” that helped it go faster, the report said. The tires on the car, which was mostly displayed in a showroom and rarely driven, were more than nine years old.\n\nOne early theory — considering the nature of Walker’s movies — that he and Rodas could have been racing another car was not supported, the report said.\n\n“No eyewitness contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department to say there was a second vehicle and there is no evidence to indicate there was a second car involved in the collision,” it said. Video recorded by several security cameras on nearby buildings “helped skilled investigators to determine the cause of the collision and that no speed contest was taking place.”\n\nThe Los Angeles County coroner’s office released a 15-page report in January that concluded the two men apparently did not live long after the crash.\n\nWalker and Rodas, racing team partners, left a charity event at a car shop co-owned by the men to take a ride in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street.\n\nThe autopsy revealed “scant soot” in Walker’s trachea, suggesting his life ended before the smoke and fire engulfed the car.\n\nThe actor’s body was badly burned “and in a pugilistic stance. His right wrist was fractured and his left arm was fractured,” the report said. Rodas was also described as in “a pugilistic” — or defensive — position.\n\nWalker suffered fractures of his left jawbone, collarbone, pelvis, ribs and spine, the report said.\n\nRodas “rapidly died of severe blunt head, neck and chest trauma,” the report said.\n\nWalker’s death came during a Thanksgiving break in filming of “Fast and Furious 7,” forcing a halt in the production. Universal Studios eventually decided that the movie would be completed using scenes already filmed by Walker, but the release will be delayed from this summer until April 10, 2015.

County Sheriff’s Department investigation has found.\n\nBy using road marks left by the vehicle, investigators determined that the Porsche’s speed was 80.59 mph to 93.97 mph. That would mean that the red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, driven by Walker’s friend Roger Rodas, was traveling about twice the 45 mph limit on Hercules Street when it crashed Nov. 30.\n\n“Investigators determined the cause of the fatal solo-vehicle collision was unsafe speed for the roadway conditions,” sheriff’s Cmdr. Mike Parker said.\n\nSheriff’s and California Highway Patrol crash experts found no evidence of any car system failures. But at least two of the tires were more than nine years old; Porsche recommends that tires be replaced after four years. As a result, CHP investigators wrote that “the driveability and handling characteristics” of the car “may have been compromised.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigators also noted that the Porsche’s horsepower had been boosted by an aftermarket exhaust system.\n\nAn earlier L.A. County coroner’s report had pegged the speed at more than 100 mph, but the traffic analysis determined that it was a bit slower. That analysis was based on markings the vehicle left known as yaw marks, which occur when a driver steers sharply.\n\nAccording to investigators, the Porsche took the sweeping right turn, veered, then hit the opposite curb, sending the car into a tree and then a light pole with tremendous force. The car spun and hit another tree on the vehicle’s passenger side, then split into two pieces and caught fire.\n\nWalker, 40, and Rodas, 38, a veteran race car driver, were killed almost instantly, succumbing to multiple traumatic injuries and the fire. Their bodies were found braced for impact in a “pugilistic” stance, according to the coroner’s report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigators spent months examining videos, interviewing witnesses and working with experts from Porsche in Germany and tire manufacturer Michelin to determine the cause of the crash. According to sheriff’s and CHP reports, no useful electronic data was retrieved from the car’s computers.\n\nAfter reviewing footage from numerous security cameras in the business park and talking to several witnesses, investigators found no evidence that the Porsche was racing another vehicle, according to the report. The four-lane road is part of a business park loop in Rye Canyon near a car company owned by Rodas and Walker.\n\n“No witnesses have reported seeing a second vehicle,” Parker said.\n\nAfter the 2001 premiere of “The Fast and the Furious,” Walker had become the face of the Southern California car culture. While the movie spawned a billion-dollar franchise, Walker kept his street credibility by driving a Nissan Skyline GT-R, appearing at events and investing in an auto racing business with Rodas, who was also his financial advisor.

Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play Johnny Storm (a.k.a. The Human Torch) in Fantastic Four (2005), 20th Century Fox’s long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance.\n\nSamuel L Jackson as Nick Fury\n\nJackson co-headlined 2005’s crime comedy The Man alongside Eugene Levy and 2006’s Joe Roth mystery Freedomland with Julianne Moore and Edie Falco, but his most hotly-anticipated release at the time of this writing is August 2006’s Snakes on a Plane, a by-the-throat thriller about an assassin who unleashes a crate full of vipers onto a aircraft full of innocent (and understandably terrified) civilians. Produced by New Line Cinema on a somewhat low budget, the film continues to draw widespread buzz that anticipates cult status.\n\nJackson would spend the ensuing years appearing in a number of films, like Home of the Brave, Resurrecting the Champ, Lakeview Terrace, Django Unchained, and the Marvel superhero franchise films like Thor, Iron Man, and The Avengers, playing superhero wrangler Nick Fury.\n\nHayley Atwell as Peggy Carter\n\nBritish actress Hayley Atwell rode to fame on the crest of her role as the female lead in Woody Allen‘s resonantly English, crime-themed black comedy Cassandra’s Dream (2007), then signed for another prestigious assignment — the lead in Julian Jarrold‘s period drama Brideshead Revisited (2008), adapted from the seminal novel by Evelyn Waugh. She tried her hand at period drama again with The Duchess, before switching gears with a role in the 2009 remake of The Prisoner for TV.\n\nIn 2011 she landed her most high-profile success to that point playing the love interest of Steve Rogers in Captain America: The First Avenger.\n\nSebastian Stan as Bucky Branes\n\nActor Sebastian Stan studied drama at Rutgers University before beginning his professional acting career, making minor appearances on TV shows like Law & Order.

He’s more than tasty in a fight, wields a mean shield, and he looks damn good in that superhero onesie.\n\nThe first Capt. A movie was more than willing to send up the cornball patriotism/propaganda origin story of how seven stone weakling Rogers was turned into a Nazi-killing machine. And it did it with real chutzpah before morphing into a more run-of-the mill actioner.\n\nIt was an enjoyable romp but Marvel, the brand who have given us Iron Man and Avengers in recent years, have quickly become the home of excellence in the supermarket market and the second Captain America movie was always going to have to be something special. The Russo brothers hold their nerve brilliantly here in a movie that rips along at a ferocious pace with a plot that’s more paranoid conspiracy thriller than mere superhero flick.\n\nWhen we meet him again, Steve Rogers, played with a cool amusement by Chris Evans, is still a man out of time but he’s also a man deeply conflicted by his role in a modern world where America seems willing to sacrifice the cherished ideals of the Founding Fathers in the pursuit of global security. Corrupt politicians and compromised colonels roll around Washington in an age where the certainties of Rogers’ past are long gone. Dark forces are moving quickly and from the unlikeliest of quarters.\n\nA skilfully-handled retaking of a hi-jacked ship is the curtain raiser here but it’s actually a ruse so that Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson back and still rocking that cat suit) can retrieve some vital tech for a shadowy S.H.I.E.L.D. super weapon that will rid the world of evil doers (and potential evil doers) once and for all.\n\nAfter our hero goes through a personal crisis of Edward Snowden-like proportions, Captain America: The Winter Soldier plays a lot like a political thriller from 1975. The Russo brothers make neat visual references and in-jokes - the Watergate building is in shot several times, there is a nod to the brainwashing scene from The Manchurian Candidate, and the casting of Robert Redford (star of All The President’s Men and Three Days of The Condor) as suave S.H.I.E.L.D. head honcho is a real coup.\n\nThe only real let down here is The Winter Soldier himself. He’s the cyborg creation of the dread HYDRA, the very flipside of Captain America’s decency and valour but The Winter Solider is more like an emo having a strop. He’s a bad guy with a metal arm, very little screen presence, and a hidden identity that will come as little or no surprise to students of Marvel.\n\nAnthony Mackie is smart and agile as Sam Wilson aka The Falcon and he is the centre of many of the exhilarating airborne battles here. This is great, great fun but great, great fun with a whip smart plot, bone-crunching fights, and a sparkling, twisty script - one day all superhero flicks will be made with the same verve and style.\n\nAlan Corr', 'Captain America takes on his biggest enemy yet - the US military-industrial complex - in this rip-roaring follow-up.\nIt was an enjoyable romp but Marvel, the brand who have given us Iron Man and Avengers in recent years, have quickly become the home of excellence in the supermarket market and the second Captain America movie was always going to have to be something special.\nAfter our hero goes through a personal crisis of Edward Snowden-like proportions, Captain America: The Winter Soldier plays a lot like a political thriller from 1975.\nThe only real let down here is The Winter Soldier himself.\nThis is great, great fun but great, great fun with a whip smart plot, bone-crunching fights, and a sparkling, twisty script - one day all superhero flicks will be made with the same verve and style.']"

Since bringing Iron Man to the big screen in 2008 as its first cinematic venture, the comic book giant has gone on to launch a hatful of movies in the Avengers universe.\n\nIt’s spawned spin-offs, sequels and sequels to spin-offs, and with hints of a slate stretching through to 2021 there are no signs of slowing. And if they keep putting out movies of this calibre, there’s every possibility they’ll continue beyond this.\n\nEven if the first Captain America film was a bit rubbish.\n\nSince that movie, thankfully, Marvel seems to have perfected its formula to serve up a scintillating balance of thrilling action, absorbing storyline, eye-rolling humour and well-drawn characters for the sequel.\n\nWhere in the first, the action mostly takes place during the Second World War, the follow-up shifts to the present day, with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the former US army officer enhanced to ‘super soldier’ status by the American government, adjusting to life in the 21st century after 70 years on ice.\n\nHistory, though, comes back to bite him in the form of a new threat – a dark and deadly assassin known as The Winter Soldier. But unable to trust even S.H.I.E.L.D, it seems Captain America must figure out a way to survive – and save the world – alone.\n\nHe’s not quite alone, of course. Of the handful of people he can trust, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) is one – and she duly lends her assistance.\n\nWith her ‘Black Widow’ alter ego, Romanoff is proof that supporting characters in ‘dumb’ Hollywood blockbusters can have a personality – this character is quite possibly the most complex and rounded female character ever to appear in a Marvel movie.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nEvidence perhaps of directing duo Anthony and Joe Russo’s television roots, where peripheral characters are frequently more believable and ‘real’.\n\nThe television parallel can also be drawn when understanding the franchise’s enduring appeal and overall consistence in quality. Just as contemporary long-running TV series sustain both these things – think Breaking Bad, The Wire and Lost for starters – so the Marvel movies also hold up. And like a TV show, each film is interconnected – like episodes of a series – to create one, richly woven mega-story to inspire a fervent following.\n\nThough it may chiefly draw its audience from comic book aficionados and action fans, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is committed to pleasing all. On top of an involving plot and fun script, casting is top drawer (Robert Redford, Jenny Agutter and Toby Jones all have roles), action is pulse-quickening and it’s packed with surprises.

But since the country became the world’s second-largest film market in 2012, Hollywood’s stars are paying it more attention, especially those promoting blockbuster superhero films loaded with 3-D and special effects . Robert Downey Jr. visited Beijing to promote “Iron Man 3” last spring, and Tom Hiddleston stopped by in October ahead of the release of “Thor: The Dark World.”\n\nThough it’s hard to say for certain whether the stars’ appearances make a difference, the trips do seem to be helping. “Iron Man 3” was China’s second highest-grossing film last year, raking in 755.2 million yuan ($121.6 million), while China was “Thor’s” top overseas market, bringing in $55.3 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n“Hollywood pays attention to where business is growing,” said Matthew Tolmach, co-producer of “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” and former production chief at Columbia Pictures. “It is a big market and there’s a lot money to be made with a Chinese release.”\n\nHe also said it’s important for stars to come and interact with their Chinese fans.\n\n“The value of coming to a territory and sitting with people who actually work and live there is actually about showing respect,” he said. “We don’t just assume that people in China are going to come to the movie. We come to you to tell you why we think it is great.”\n\nChina was the top overseas market for the first installment of “The Amazing Spider-Man” when it was released in September 2012, bringing in more than $48.8 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n“It is the right time,” said Avi Arad, co-producer of “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” and former chairman and CEO of Marvel Studios who is also working on a new superhero movie about China’s Terra-Cotta Warriors with Beijing-based Seven Stars Film Studios. “We would be idiots not to come and make sure we are part of it.”\n\nBut big-name Hollywood actors and mind-blowing special effects don’t always guarantee a big win for Hollywood movies in Chinese theaters. Last year, authorities pulled Quentin Tarantino\'s ""Django Unchained"" from movie screens, just moments after the film was released. Speculation spread rapidly online that concerns over scenes featuring nudity might have been the culprit. The China Film Group said the film was pulled due to a “technical reason.”\n\n“Captain America” premiers in Chinese theaters on April 4 while “Spider-Man 2” debuts May 4—both at the same the movies are released in the U.S.\n\n-- Lilian Lin.

Great film characters with superpowers are born from a film that’s grounded enough so the audience can relate, surprising enough so the audience is curious and clever enough to keep them guessing. The new Captain America sequel, entitled “The Winter Soldier” just about gets it right and it was a lot of fun to watch\n\nChris Evans again takes on the role Steve Rogers aka Captain America, with an ease and charisma that keeps me comforted in the knowledge that he won’t be replaced anytime soon, a la Hulk. Taking place post the terrific Avengers Assembled malarkey, we see the Cap in the thoroughly modern world of Washington DC. The setting is taken full advantage of with sweeping shots of the Lincoln Memorial opening the film as Rogers laps the scene with his superhuman speed and Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie, does one lap with his regular human speed. Friendship kindles but our idyllic views are chipped away at as we realize that Rogers is now working, with all his kick-buttery, for S.H.I.E.L.D and not all is as it seems… Revelations are revealed and it turns out his old (very old, well, dead) friends are the founders of the not-at-all corrupt law-enforcement and spy agency itself, amongst other things that would be a shame to give away.\n\nSaying that, I hope people don’t Google the movie too much before they see it, as one of the biggest twists in the film, cleverly directed and edited to keep you a comfortable in a “it’s just another brainwashed baddie” temperament until the last moment, is an absolute winner. It’s no M Night Shamalan, and those who are into the comics will already know, but to us outsiders, it’s a blinder.\n\nAnthony Mackie is my highlight of the film, portraying the first black superhero, Falcon, with charm and being one of the only good guys, other than the Cap himself, that you are sure is actually good. We are less sure about Samuel L Jackson’s Nick Fury but absolutely sure that throwing him solo and headfirst into some machine gun ambush action was a great call. Nick Fury seemed to have a label of a talker rather than a doer most of the time in the now lengthy 9 film franchise and it was great to see him outwit the baddies with his own skills, rather than relying on the strength of his Avengers. Scarlett Johansson is also on solid sidekick duties as the Black Widow, this time with a very 90’s straightened hairdo that I’m not sure will catch on… Her past is alluded to as the source of her heroism and her controversy, again, which might be a little of a disappointment to fans who will want to see more of this complicated temptress… though this seems pretty rectified during the climax of the film during very Iron Man–esque press conference.\n\nThe success of this film is probably down to getting the Russo brothers, Jon and Anthony, of Arrested Development success, on board. After Joss Whedon’s Avengers Assembled, it’s clear that quirky directors do great work with quirky material, which is exactly what watching heroes with superpowers throwing punches and quipping for an hour and a half is – however mainstream it’s come to be. Getting the franchise back to the geeks that buy the comics and are part of the cult followings of Buffy and Arrested Development is exactly what I’d like to see. Please. Thor 2 hurt me a bit, however great bits of it were.\n\nCaptain America: Winter Soldier is bound to be a stone cold killer in the box office – see what I did there.', 'Captain America – Winter Soldier ReviewFinding the right balance in a superhero film, with a mingling of classic comic book caper, fully blown, ridiculously athletic battles and satirical asides that highlight the ridiculousness of it all, is somewhat rare.\nGreat film characters with superpowers are born from a film that’s grounded enough so the audience can relate, surprising enough so the audience is curious and clever enough to keep them guessing.\nThe new Captain America sequel, entitled “The Winter Soldier” just about gets it right and it was a lot of fun to watchChris Evans again takes on the role Steve Rogers aka Captain America, with an ease and charisma that keeps me comforted in the knowledge that he won’t be replaced anytime soon, a la Hulk.\nTaking place post the terrific Avengers Assembled malarkey, we see the Cap in the thoroughly modern world of Washington DC.\nCaptain America: Winter Soldier is bound to be a stone cold killer in the box office – see what I did there.']"

There’s another movie to do, there’s another acting job.

He has already completed one film as a director, an intimate love story filmed in just 19 days tentatively called 1:30 Train starring Evans as a street musician who befriends a young woman (Alice Eve) after missing a train at Grand Central Station. But Evans doesn’t feel any negativity about his time as a superhero and in fact credits the Marvel universe for the opportunities now coming his way. “Without these movies, I wouldn’t be directing,” he told Variety. “They gave me enough overseas recognition to greenlight a movie. And if I’m speaking extremely candidly, it’s going to continue to do that for as long as the Marvel contract runs.”\n\nMarvel’s original contract was for nine films, and knowing he wouldn’t be able to take a break during that time scared Evans. After it was reduced to six movies and an encouraging call from Robert Downey Jr., a.k.a. Iron Man, Evans signed on. Evans wasn’t even one of the first choices to play the patriotic pioneer, because he had already played a superhero before in the original Fantastic Four film, a movie that launched his fame to international levels and made the simple things in life hard. “The problem is, you’re either worried you’re going to be recognized or you’re thankful you’re not. It’s always there. I miss that not being in my head.”\n\nSo how serious is Evans about all of this? “For all I know, in five years, I might say, ‘Sh–, I miss acting.’ Right now, I just want to get behind the camera and make movies.”\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier opens in theaters April 4.', 'Image zoom The Chosunilbo JNS/Multi-Bits/Getty ImagesJust because Chris Evans is a movie star doesn’t mean that’s all he wants to be.\nIn an interview with Variety, the Captain America star said he will only continue to act under Marvel contract and then wants to get behind the camera and start to direct.\n“I can’t see myself pursuing acting strictly outside of what I’m contractually obligated to do,” Evans said.\nBut Evans doesn’t feel any negativity about his time as a superhero and in fact credits the Marvel universe for the opportunities now coming his way.\n“The problem is, you’re either worried you’re going to be recognized or you’re thankful you’re not.']"

It went on to take in $176 million domestically and another $194 million from overseas.\n\nThat was pre-“Avengers,” though — and that 2012 film’s $1.5 billion global haul greatly changed the game for all subsequent films in Marvel’s cinematic universe.\n\nAlso read: ‘Noah’ Opens as Strong No. 1 at Box Office in Mexico, Korea\n\n“Iron Man 3” and “Dark World” played more like follow-ups to Joss Whedon‘s team-up film than their originals. “Iron Man 3,” the first Marvel movie after “The Avengers,” nearly doubled the $623 million worldwide haul of “Iron Man 2” with $1.21 billion. And last November, the Thor sequel brought in $644 globally, compared to the $449 million that Kenneth Brannagh’s original film took in.\n\nChris Evans returns as the red-white-and-blue crusader Steve Rogers in “Winter Soldier,” which carries a $170 million production budget. Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford co-star. The screenwriters are Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (“Thor: The Dark World”), working from a story by comic book writer Ed Brubaker, and the directors are Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, taking over for Joe Johnston.\n\nThe plot features Rogers struggling to embrace his role in the modern world, while battling the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. Given that story line, it will be interesting to see how it plays in Russia, where it opens on April 3 — particularly given the recent tension between the U.S. and Russia over Crimea.\n\nAlso read: ‘Captain America: The Winter Soldier’ Review: Superheroic, Yes, But Smart and Subversive Too\n\nThe film is quickly making headlines around the globe, as its stars build buzz attending red-carpet premieres last week in London and Paris — all ahead of a stop in China.\n\nReviews are also in “Winter Soldier’s” box-office favor; they’ve have been especially strong for a superhero movie. And there is still room to grow.\n\nBut both Disney and the industry are keeping an eye on how the film plays in European markets. “Captain America: The First Avenger” did just OK in Europe. The leading market was the U.K., where it brought in $14.7 million, followed by France ($10.2 million), Italy ($8.6 million) and Spain ($7.7 million).\n\n“The first film was pretty soft in Europe,” said Bruce Nash, founder of box office tracking service The Numbers. “I think it will do much better than that this time around, thanks to ‘The Avengers,’ but my benchmark would be for an opening around $10 million in the U.K.”\n\n“First Avenger’s” biggest foreign markets proved to be in Latin America. It brought in $20.6 million from Brazil and $20.2 million from Mexico. The bulk of the rollouts for those markets will come on April 4, the same weekend that “The Winter Soldier” opens in China and Russia.\n\nSee also: ‘Captain America 2’ Clip: Chris Evans Gets His First Taste of ‘The Winter Soldier’ (Video)\n\nAnother aspect of the “Avengers” effect? The Marvel blockbuster seems to be offsetting any worries that foreign exhibitors’ might have about an anti-American backlash.\n\nWhen the original came out, Paramount gave overseas distributors the option of calling it “The First Avenger,” rather than “Captain America: The First Avenger.” Only three countries — Russia, Ukraine and South Korea — opted to go with the shorter handle.\n\nDisney’s Hollis said he didn’t have any concerns about that.\n\n“Our regional teams know their markets best, so we defer to their expertise when it comes to titling our films for international territories,” he said.', '“Captain America: The Winter Soldier” storms the box office starting Wednesday, when Disney rolls out out its third post-“Avengers” Marvel superhero sequel across much of Europe.\n“Captain America,” distributed by Paramount and produced for $140 million, opened to an impressive $65 million in North America.\n“Captain America: The First Avenger” did just OK in Europe.\nThe bulk of the rollouts for those markets will come on April 4, the same weekend that “The Winter Soldier” opens in China and Russia.\nSee also: ‘Captain America 2’ Clip: Chris Evans Gets His First Taste of ‘The Winter Soldier’ (Video)Another aspect of the “Avengers” effect?']"

But that doesn’t mean he will be leaving Hollywood, or that you won’t be seeing him in films for the next few years.\n\nThe actor best known as Captain America spent his winter directing his first film, 1:30 Train, a relatively intimate and inexpensive film by Hollywood standards (production costs came in around $3 million). Evans spoke with Variety about his passion for directing, and why he will remain an actor at least through 2017.\n\n“I’ve known for a while I wanted to direct,” Evans said. “But [time] never really opens up.

He has fulfilled three of the films in his six-film contract so far: Captain America, The Avengers and Captain America: Winter Soldier. He will soon be filming The Avengers: Age of Ultron, which leaves two films left on his contract.\n\nDespite his rush to change career paths, the actor understands what Marvel has done for him, and seems to have nothing but thanks for the company.\n\n“Without these movies, I wouldn’t be directing,” he said. “They gave me enough overseas recognition to greenlight a movie.”\n\n1:30 Train stars Alice Eve alongside Evans, and is a love story shot in only 19 days. The actor did admit that his hope to leave acting is not set in stone.\n\n“For all I know, in five years, I might say, ‘I miss acting,'” he said. But, he added, “Right now, I just want to get behind the camera and make movies.”\n\nThe Avengers: Age of Ultron is due in theaters May 1, 2015."", ""Chris Evans may be the perfect Captain America, but fame and fortune has taught him he’d rather be any place other than in front of the camera.\nEvans spoke with Variety about his passion for directing, and why he will remain an actor at least through 2017.\n'”When Evans signed on as Captain America, it was the role of a lifetime for most actors.\n“If I’m acting at all, it’s going to be under Marvel contract, or I’m going to be directing,” he explained to Variety.\nHe has fulfilled three of the films in his six-film contract so far: Captain America, The Avengers and Captain America: Winter Soldier.""]"

The actor, best known for his role as “Captain America,” has said to Variety that he will retire from acting at the end of his contract with Marvel. What will he go on to do? He’ll direct.\n\nEvans has recently shot a New York-based drama called “1:30 Train” starring himself and Alice Eve. Since he seems to be very committed to directing, it’s safe to expect a type of Ben Affleck career turnaround for him, so it’s a little exciting to see where this new avenue will take him. But what about the Cap? What will Marvel do to take care of this eventual problem?\n\nEvans could probably care less about the problems Marvel will have, since he has said before how he had avoided taking the role of Captain America for a long time. “The problem was initially, it was a nine-movie contract,” he said. “And they said, if these movies take off and do very well, and my life changes and I don’t respond well, I don’t have the opportunity to say, listen, I need an [f——] break. That just scared me.” Evans also expressed to Variety some sadness or irritation when he said, “No one sees my good little movies, man,” referencing some of the other films he’s been in recently. CinemaBlend makes explicit mention of films, “Snowpiercer,” and “Puncture,” while Variety also mentions “Sunshine,” films that have great acting on the part of Evans, but no real inroads toward Evan’s fanbase.\n\nSo what kind of films do you think we can expect from Evans?

46087,http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/chris-evans-marvel-contract-quit-acting/,entertainment,"['The Marvel cinematic universe has become one of the biggest, most popular, and most lucrative film franchises around, and while that is great for all involved, Captain America himself is starting to feel the weight of being a part of it. After all, starring in big budget superhero movies not only runs the risk of defining one’s acting career, but it’s also a lot of work. Filming, as well as doing any necessary reshoots or ADR recording, takes about six months, followed by extensive press commitments surrounding each and every release. And considering how productive Marvel Studios is, and how quickly they start working on new properties, I imagine that going from film to film would feel a bit endless.\n\nWhile many of the Marvel stars have found success and other acting jobs outside of the MCU, it’s hard for them to move forward with their careers when they’re tied to not only their own franchises, but Avengers sequels as well.\n\nChris Evans recently spoke with Variety about his contractual obligations to don the star spangled suit of the first Avenger, and discussed how daunting Marvel’s long contracts can be:\n\n“Initially, it was a nine-movie contract. And they said, if these movies take off and do very well, and my life changes and I don’t respond well, I don’t have the opportunity to say, listen, I need a f–king break. That just scared me. They called back and they tweaked the deal. It went from nine [films] to six. I said no again. My family was even going, ‘Are you sure you’re making the right decisions?’ It started to feel like maybe this is what I’m supposed to do.”\n\nEvans is now halfway through that six-film contract, not counting the upcoming release of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. After that film he’ll have two more to go: the recently announced Captain America 3 and, most likely, the third Avengers film. After that, my guess is the actor won’t return for any future outings (like Robert Downey Jr. is doing with the two Avengers sequels following his original four-film obligation). As far as where that may leave the MCU, we recently learned that Sebastian Stan has signed on for nine movies, meaning he could very well take over as the new Captain America when Evans vacates the role.\n\nAs for Evans’ career post-Marvel, he’s looking to leave acting behind and step behind the camera. He recently directed his first feature, 1:30 Train, and thanks his tenure at Marvel for that particular opportunity, saying:\n\n“I’ve known for a while I wanted to direct. But (time) never really opens up. There’s another movie to do, there’s another acting job. It just got to a point where I was like, you know what — I have to do this. Without these movies, I wouldn’t be directing. They gave me enough overseas recognition to greenlight a movie. And if I’m speaking extremely candidly, it’s going to continue to do that for as long as the Marvel contract runs. If I’m acting at all, it’s going to be under Marvel contract, or I’m going to be directing. I can’t see myself pursuing acting strictly outside of what I’m contractually obligated to do.”\n\nEvans has done a great job in the role of Captain America so far, and let’s not forget that he even played Johnny Storm in two Fantastic Four films. So, it’s understandable that he’s beginning to grow a little tired of wearing the tights and being obligated to throw his shield around every couple of years.\n\nTell us, what do you think of what Evans had to say? Will you be sad to see him go, or will you be ready to see a new Captain America by the time his contract is up?

That is why the sequel “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is the real beginning of Captain America’s modern adventures—with all the problems that come with it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDirected by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, “The Winter Soldier” occurs immediately after the events of 2012’s “Marvel’s The Avengers,” with Rogers now serving to deal with international trouble spots as an operative of the global peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division).\n\nBut something about the group’s aggressive stance bothers Rogers. “This isn’t freedom, this is fear,” he tells S.H.I.E.L.D.’s director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Later on, S.H.I.E.L.D. officer Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) warns Rogers: “To build a better world sometimes means tearing the old one down—and that makes enemies.”\n\nRogers finds out that something is rotten in the organization and becomes a man on the run, aided only by fellow agent Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and friend Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), also known as the wing-wearing Falcon. But Rogers’ attempt to uncover the truth is jarred by constant attempts made on his life by a shadowy assassin known only as the Winter Soldier.\n\nEye-popping\n\n“The First Avenger” was fleshed out in bright flag-waving colors and a broader story tone. “The Winter Soldier” is definitely different, revealed in shades of gray and a more focused manner. Though it has one eye-popping action scene after another, “The Winter Soldier” is much more a spy thriller than a superhero movie, with a tension-filled plot full of twists. Though the Russos may seem a strange choice to direct this film (they have a background heavy in sitcom TV, particularly “Community”), they handle “The Winter Soldier” confidently and urgently, bringing a real-world alacrity to the proceedings. Heavily influenced by the Ed Brubaker comic book run of the same title, “The Winter Soldier” puts an emphasis on the “soldier” part with a strong military conspiracy flavor. Captain America is certainly put to the test.\n\nWhile he was basically a cartoon character in “The First Avenger,” Evans turns Captain America into a real person in “The Winter Soldier,” a lonely man out of time, full of doubt and mistrust. Evans inhabits the role with greater precision. Mackie (most memorable in “The Hurt Locker”) brings a badass quality to Wilson, while Johansson does her best turn as the Black Widow so far, an argument that she deserves a movie of her own.\n\nJackson is still patently Jackson as über-secret agent Nick Fury. Redford’s Pierce is a great character, and the veteran actor brings gravitas to what could easily have been a cardboard cutout. It is Redford’s performance that grabs you in the end.\n\nLayers\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMarvel is clearly confident that Captain America is ready for stardom in the modern era, as the studio has already green-lit a third “Captain America” for 2016. It seems clear everyone already knew that going into this film’s production.\n\n“The Winter Soldier” is a study in deception, with the film itself told in layers—but with really kinetic fight scenes. Warning: Watch the film up to the very end of the credits so you don’t miss anything. Don’t expect the snappy repartee and the out-of-this world sci-fi of “The Avengers.” This is spy-versus-spy combat with the highest stakes, intriguing up to the very end, changing the Marvel movie status quo forever.\n\nWith its top-notch storytelling and spectacular action, “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is superior to the first film, a grim and shadowy battle for what we believe in and what we stand for. “Marvel’s The Avenger” aside, it is Marvel’s best—and most serious—movie yet.\n\n(Distributed by Disney, Marvel Studios’ “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” opens in cinemas today.)\n\nRead Next\n\nLATEST STORIES\n\nMOST READ\n\nFollow @ruelsdevera on Twitter', 'That is why the sequel “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” is the real beginning of Captain America’s modern adventures—with all the problems that come with it.\n“The Winter Soldier” is definitely different, revealed in shades of gray and a more focused manner.\nLayersADVERTISEMENTMarvel is clearly confident that Captain America is ready for stardom in the modern era, as the studio has already green-lit a third “Captain America” for 2016.\n“The Winter Soldier” is a study in deception, with the film itself told in layers—but with really kinetic fight scenes.\n(Distributed by Disney, Marvel Studios’ “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” opens in cinemas today.)']"

Jackson has had a magnificent career so far, appearing in diverse pictures, from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars to Snakes on a Plane.\n\nRecently, however, he has been prolific in the Marvel universe, appearing as Nick Fury in six superhero films since 2008 (the first being a post-credits sequence in Iron Man). Many of his Marvel outings, save for perhaps Avengers Assemble, have offered him nothing more than cameos, albeit very entertaining ones, rather than main roles.\n\n, however, offers him even greater screen time and a chance for some more dramatic meat to chew on.\n\nSo did this affect the experience on this picture compared to his others during his time working with Marvel?\n\n“I approach all of it the same way”, he says, talking in a surprisingly calm and slow tone compared to the one we are used to hearing onscreen.\n\n“You show up, you look at the relationships, what’s going on, take it all serious, and still have as much fun as you can inside of it”.\n\nIt certainly looks like he had fun making the film and Captain America: The Winter Soldier certainly shows him getting a more dynamic range of scenes, from emotional, character-driven moments to scenes of intense threat and action.\n\n“I’m really glad we saw more of Nick and what happens to him, and how he reacts to situations. As usual, he’s always trying to be three steps ahead and all of a sudden when he finds out he’s been used in another kind of way, incumbent upon him to find out why, and use all the tools that he has at his disposal. As usual, a lot of it has to do with subterfuge and diversion, even down to fooling and hurting his most trusted compatriot [Black Widow, as played by Scarlett Johansson].”\n\nJohansson’s character first appeared with Nick Fury in 2010’s Iron Man 2 and impressed audiences with their great chemistry.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier develops that relationship further, though apparently some of it may have been left on the cutting-room floor: “We actually shot a scene that’s explained, where we have that moment, but I’ve been told it slows the film down in a significant way, and they didn’t want to slow it down”.\n\nSo, is there any hope for fans who want to see an apparently moving and important scene between Nick and Black Widow? Jackson offers some reassurance: “When you get the DVD and you click on my face, there is a hidden feature that will allow you to access that scene and you’ll be able to see more of what that means between he and Black Widow.""\n\nThe movie also offers audiences the chance to see Nick Fury going about his day-to-day work in a more normal setting. At the start of the movie, the world is (generally) at peace (peaceful as in New York or Greenwich is not currently being destroyed by aliens) and we get to see Fury go about his day-to-day work. “It was a real joy to be able to go into Nick’s workplace and to find out who he is in depth in certain ways. And to expose some of the stuff through conversations that Robert Redford [as Alexander Pierce] and I had in the film”.\n\nThe character of Nick Fury will return in further Marvel adventures, including Avengers: Age of Ultron next year. There have been talks about a Nick Fury movie, though the actor has dismissed these as just speculation. Time will tell. For now, there is more than enough to enjoy of Jacksons’s wit and gruff charm in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is released in UK cinemas on 26 March by Walt Disney Studios.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier', 'Samuel L.

I just like the fact he’s in this fantastic world. He is this sort of ordinary guy that has the personality that can make extraordinary people bend to his will,” he said.\n\nHe joked wearing the eye patch was a hindrance when it came to learning his lines, saying: “I have to turn my head further but the interesting thing about the patch that I didn’t discover until the first Captain America was when I, all of a sudden, had dialogue because I never had many lines to say.\n\n“I would learn it the night before when I got to work, and I could only see half the page when I put the patch on.

It’s unclear exactly how much of his performance was shot, but the film was said to be more than halfway complete when production was halted.\n\nSince Walker’s death in November 2013, the question of how the Fast and Furious franchise would proceed has consumed the production and forced all work to stop. Following Walker’s death, the studio was said to be considering several options, including one that would have completely scrapped what had already been filmed and started over from scratch. The studio could have recouped its losses via insurance and then begun work on a new version of the film that either removed or minimized Walker’s involvement, but ultimately the filmmakers elected to incorporate what was already shot and supplement it with CGI and body doubles.\n\nAccording to the production, the studio has hired four actors with similar physiques to Walker’s. These four actors will step in for him, with the late actor’s face and voice to be added in post-production. There will likely be some serious rewrites involved as well, but the majority of Walker’s work on the film will survive. Following the news of his death, the film’s release was postponed from summer 2014 to April 10, 2015, which should give the production team ample time to fine-tune the finished product and make sure it comes across as respectfully handled.\n\nAs for the franchise, an eighth, ninth, and even tenth film have been discussed, with several of the cast – including Walker and Vin Diesel – signing on for at least two more films following this one. The franchise will almost certainly carry on (assuming the seventh film is a success), but the story will need to change to factor in Walker’s – and his character, Brian O’Conner’s – absence.\n\nDespite Walker’s death, the main points of the plot remain the same and carry on the story that was set up all the way back in 2006’s Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift, the third film in the series and a prequel to the two that preceded it. The fourth through sixth films were then positioned to take place before the events in Tokyo Drift, which saw the character of Han (Sung Kang) die. The seventh movie will get the chronology back on track, taking place after all of those events. That also means the character of Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), the star of Tokyo Drift, will return for this film and possibly two others, according to his contract.\n\nEditors' Recommendations"", 'Filming on Fast & Furious 7 has now resumed, and the late Paul Walker will appear thanks in part to body doubles and CGI, according to NY Daily News.\nSince Walker’s death in November 2013, the question of how the Fast and Furious franchise would proceed has consumed the production and forced all work to stop.\nFollowing Walker’s death, the studio was said to be considering several options, including one that would have completely scrapped what had already been filmed and started over from scratch.\nAccording to the production, the studio has hired four actors with similar physiques to Walker’s.\nThere will likely be some serious rewrites involved as well, but the majority of Walker’s work on the film will survive.']"

46117,http://www.totalfilm.com/news/fast-furious-7-to-complete-paul-walker-scenes-with-cgi-and-body-doubles,entertainment,"[""The franchise still has va-va-vroom...\n\nBy rights, Fast & Furious 7 should be spluttering on empty. Few franchises ever reach such a number, and those that do hardly serve up memorable movies; go on, try naming the full titles of the seventh entries in the Friday The 13th, Halloween, Hellraiser and, er, Air Bud series. Factor in a new driver behind the wheel – Justin Lin, director of F&F 3-6, is replaced by The Conjuring's James Wan, who of course has form with the Saw franchise, another 7-upper – and you might expect the series to stall. Then consider the tragic death of star Paul Walker midway through the shoot and it's a miracle that F&F7 even trundled off the starting grid.\n\nSo it's great to report that Wan has fashioned a nitro-fuelled thrill-ride that forms a fitting tribute to its blue-eyed bro. 'For Paul' reads the dedication, and so fast, furious, ginormous, crazed, maxed-out and heart-on-sleeve emotional is this gloriously ludicrous instalment that it's impossible to see where an eighth could go.\n\nThe action picks up precisely where Fast & Furious 6 left off. That outing’s big bad, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), is comatose in hospital, and his perma-frowning older brother Deckard (Jason Statham) is out for a hot plate of revenge. After tussling with Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) at his DSS offices in LA – a normal movie’s entire budget is blown on throwing the pair through plate glass windows – Deckard heads to Tokyo to kill Han (Sung Kang) and return the franchise to a present that leads off from the third chapter, Tokyo Drift (parts 4, 5 and 6 were effectively flashbacks).\n\nLooks like Dom (Diesel) and his ‘family’ (Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris) will be picked off one by one unless they agree to work for shadowy government man Petty (Kurt Russell) to retrieve computer genius Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel, who rivals Blackhat’s Chris Hemsworth in the ‘unfeasibly beautiful hacker’ stakes) from the evil clutches of terrorist Jakande (Djimon Hounsou). Why? She’s created a tracking device, God’s Eye, that will… Oh, who cares? All that really matters is that the gang ricochet between Tokyo, the Dominican Republic, Azerbaijan, Abu Dhabi and LA while The Stath, clenched from head to toe, turns up repeatedly like some constipated Terminator.\n\nGiven the rewrites and schedule juggles necessitated by the production’s shutdown, it’s inevitable that the plot is lumpy and the film ill-balanced – having Hobbs disappear for the entire midsection leaves a Rock-sized hole in the screen. There are other niggles, too. Or rather seismic grumbles – ‘niggles’ is too small a word when discussing a picture where a bunch of muscle cars skydiving out of a plane to thump onto a precarious mountain road for a pedal-to-metal, bullet-torn, 20-minute (!) chase is one of the less outrageous set-pieces.\n\nAnd so we have Ong-Bak’s Tony Jaa woefully underused as a fists-of-fury henchmen, while the decision to rob his brutality of its beauty with a barrage of cuts is indicative of Wan’s set-piece stylings as a whole. No doubt action-maestro George Miller will bring greater fluency and coherence to the vehicular carnage of Mad Max: Fury Road, but Wan’s up-close-and-personal, down-'n'-dirty methods (let’s call it the ‘messy-flurry’ technique) at least bring immediacy to the CGI-heavy sequences – they feel as raw and dangerous as a post-pub brawl in a piss-reeking alley.\n\nChances are, by the end of F&F7 you’ll feel like you were standing between Diesel and Statham as they went at each other with giant car wrenches (yes, this really happens, for quite some time). It’s the job of each movie in this franchise to be more fast and furious than the one before, and here the relentless spectacle offers a car leaping between skyscrapers, Walker running along the top of a bus as it teeters off a cliff (The Wages Of Fear didn’t have that) and a night-time chase and conflagration in LA that involves a chopper, a drone, multiple automobiles and Statham surviving a multi-storey car park landing on top of him. Make no mistake, we’re in superhero territory now, with Dom and his crew just about ready to hand the Avengers their asses.\n\nAnd then there’s Walker, his passing bringing real emotion to the extravagant proceedings. With his filming completed via body doubles (including his brothers, Caleb and Cody) and digital trickery, his physical presence, as well as his spirit, haunts the movie throughout, and the fond farewell is beautifully handled. Suddenly all of Dom’s platitudes about family make meaningful sense, and any blokes who have strutted to the cinema for hot-rods, bikinis and heavy-metal destruction will likely find themselves cursing the something in their eye as they exit into the lobby lights."", ""The franchise still has va-va-vroom...By rights, Fast & Furious 7 should be spluttering on empty.\nThen consider the tragic death of star Paul Walker midway through the shoot and it's a miracle that F&F7 even trundled off the starting grid.\nSo it's great to report that Wan has fashioned a nitro-fuelled thrill-ride that forms a fitting tribute to its blue-eyed bro.\n'For Paul' reads the dedication, and so fast, furious, ginormous, crazed, maxed-out and heart-on-sleeve emotional is this gloriously ludicrous instalment that it's impossible to see where an eighth could go.\nThe action picks up precisely where Fast & Furious 6 left off.""]"
46118,http://blogs.houstonpress.com/artattack/2014/03/movies_with_recently_deceased.php,entertainment,"['Last week, the second trailer for the soon-to-be released film Brick Mansions hit the intertubes. It appears to be your typical cop/revenge action flick, probably a lot of mindless fun. What the big to do about this generic film is that it stars the late Paul Walker. Walker, of Fast and the Furious fame, was tragically killed in a car accident this past November.\n\nIn addition to Mansions, it was also just announced that the seventh incarnation of the Fast/Furious movies would be released in 2015, also with Walker. The parts that they were unable to film before his death will be completed with CGI and a stand-in. That movie will wind up coming out two years after the actor\'s passing.\n\nWalker is not the only actor no longer with us that have movies coming out soon. In November of this year one of the most anticipated films of the year, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, will be released. Philip Seymour Hoffman, who overdosed on a concoction of hard drugs and alcohol will return to his role as Plutarch Heavensbee. According to the film\'s production company, Lion\'s Gate, Hoffman had already completed scenes before his death in February of this year. Nothing has been said about the second part of the film, which is due to be released in 2015. People are already commenting on how emotional it will be to see the movie with Hoffman, who many fans and colleagues consider one of the greatest actors of his generation.\n\n""Emotional"" is also the word that writer/producer Joe Colleran recently used to describe the editing process of his new movie Something Wicked. Reason being that it stars the late actress Brittany Murphy who died of rather bizarre occurrences almost five years ago. Her movie is to receive a limited release next week.\n\nI don\'t know about you, but watching recently dead actors on screen has always felt very strange to me, but also kind of wonderful in a way.\n\nThe release of a movie that unfortunately lost one of its actors along the way is nothing new. Clark Gable died just months before the release of the film The Misfits, which, coincidentally, was also the last movie to star Marilyn Monroe. Spencer Tracy was not alive to see one of his best roles in Guess Who\'s Coming to Dinner (luckily he also wasn\'t alive to see the remake with Ashton Kutcher). James Dean died a month before his behemoth film Rebel Without a Cause, as well as Giant. And Dean wasn\'t alive to get excited over his Oscar nominations for East of Eden and Giant; although Dean probably would have played it off cool anyway.\n\nIn more recent times, Brandon Lee\'s death and its subsequent impact on Goths everywhere was big news; the actor died during the filming of The Crow. We also lost Tupac, Aaliyah, Chris Farley and Bernie Mac, among others just before their films were released in theaters. Heath Ledger\'s death, the release of Batman and his Oscar win probably marks the most memorable of these deaths.\n\nRegardless of the growing number, there is something kind of icky about it, but there is also something kind of beautiful. Speaking from experience, if you\'ve ever lost someone close to you prematurely, your initial desire is to remember only the good things. But quickly, the stuff about the person that you never knew comes out, some of which casts a negative shadow over the good memories that you had. People feel like they have to tell you everything that this person ever did or said, and a lot of it they probably had no intention of you ever finding out.\n\nI imagine this is the case with some of these actors, many of whom died in drug-related incidents. They say Hoffman led an entirely secret life. And rumors about the world that Ledger was a part of were shocking. After an actor passes, people come out of the woodwork to over-share what went on behind closed doors. This places the fans in an odd position between reverence and disdain. We prefer not knowing that our beloved Brandt from The Big Lebowski died amongst piles of heroine that he very much planned on doing. We don\'t want to know that he had his demons; it\'s disappointing and inconvenient for us.\n\nBut when an actor passes and then releases something wholly new, we are allowed to fall in love with him again and remember what it was that we were so attracted to in the first place: his talent. And for the actors, despite the fact that they are not there to bear witness, it\'s nice that after all the hoopla, they are doing what they love, even in the afterlife.\n\nIt might be uncomfortable to see Paul Walker drag race on the big screen, especially given the manner in which he died (car crash), but it will also be a homage to a man who entertained so many. It will be weird to see Brittany Murphy alive again in theaters, but what a nice way for her to have a comeback. Eternally, these actors are still stars.', ""Last week, the second trailer for the soon-to-be released film Brick Mansions hit the intertubes.\nThe parts that they were unable to film before his death will be completed with CGI and a stand-in.\nI don't know about you, but watching recently dead actors on screen has always felt very strange to me, but also kind of wonderful in a way.\nThe release of a movie that unfortunately lost one of its actors along the way is nothing new.\nI imagine this is the case with some of these actors, many of whom died in drug-related incidents.""]"

Just as we heard that The Hunger Games: Mockingjay would need to partially recreate the late Philip Seymour Hoffman to finish some scenes that had yet to be completed, a source has told New York Daily News that some actors have been hired to act as body doubles, and visual effects will be used to superimpose Walker\'s face over them along with Walker\'s previously recorded lines.\n\nThe source says, ""They have hired four actors with bodies very similar to Paul’s physique and they will be used for movement and as a base. Paul’s face and voice will be used on top using CGI.” Now before anyone gets bent out of shape, it seems pretty clear that this combination of body doubles and visual effects will likely only be used to complete the scenes that had already been shot, rather than shooting new stuff. Otherwise, someone would have to impersonate Walker\'s voice as well. So this method is probably being used to finish different angles of some sequences that were already in production.\n\nThe film is picking up shooting with six to eight weeks left of production in Atlanta, and the sequel has already been pushed backed to a release on April 10th, 2015 to allow enough time for the reworked film to be finished. Though we know how production will handle Walker\'s death, we\'re still not sure how his absence will effect the story. One rumor said Walker\'s character would simply be retired rather than morbidly being killed off, but that\'s still going to be tough to explain unless they just use Jordana Brewster and their new baby as a reason for him to finally walk away.

One early report indicated that the studio was thinking of scrapping the movie entirely and starting over. Another suggested that Walker’s younger brother Cody Walker could be used as a stand-in.\n\nUltimately, the filmmakers decided to retire, rather than kill off, Brian O’Conner. The script was revised so that previously shot footage could still be used, while new scenes would explain O’Conner’s new direction. But all the frantic rewriting and careful editing in the world can’t magically conjure up an actor who wasn’t there, so CGI and body doubles will be used to fill in some of the gaps.\n\nHow that approach will work in the film remains to be seen. Other movies have pulled it off successfully, but the task will be made extra tricky by the fact that Walker still had a lot of key scenes left to shoot.

He had been half-way through filming on the highly anticipated Fast & Furious 7, and lovers of that franchise wondered how the studio would handle the catastrophic event. Rumours swirled, with some commentators even speculating that the project might shelved – leaving the future of the film series in jeopardy. Those rumours can be cleared up now, however, since it is clear that Universal plan to complete the film and “retire” Walker’s character – allowing the franchise to continue.\n\nAin’t It Cool News highlighted the confirmations from production sources, that found their way to The Hollywood Reporter and the New York Daily News. It seems that Universal have found a way to achieve their preferred aim – to tweak the film in such a way as to allow the character of Brian O’Connor (Walker) to still appear, while allowing the franchise to continue into the future. To facilitate this, they have apparently hired four actors of similar physical build to the late Paul Walker, with a view to completing his newly revised scenes. Walker’s face and voice will then be applied to those actors in post-production. This will give the filmmakers – director James Wan and writer Chris Morgan – the chance to “retire” him in a way that honours the franchise veteran, and satisfies fans at the same time.\n\nWalker’s character is an integral part of the Fast And Furious franchise, his character having appeared in all of the films, except the third (Tokyo Drift). Fans were understandably nervous about the prospect of proceeding without him, while executives must have been nervous about not – given the huge commercial success of the multi-billion dollar series.

Aloe Blacc assisted Team Adam; The Band Perry helped Team Blake; Blake’s wife, Miranda Lambert, worked with Team Shakira; and Jill Scott advised Usher’s crew.\n\nHere’s what happened during the two-hour episode:\n\nTeam Adam’s Austin Ellis and Josh Kaufman were assigned Pharrell Williams’ ubiquitous hit, “Happy.” Shakira said it was one of the best battles of the season, in part because both men managed to win the audience over. Adam added that Austin and Josh were equals as singers. He named Josh the winner. Austin was not stolen by another coach, so he was eliminated.\n\nUp next were Audra McLaughlin and the duo Alaska and Madi, from Blake’s team. They tackled “When Will I Be Loved,” originally recorded by The Everly Brothers and later covered by Linda Ronstadt. Shakira thought both artists were a little “over the top” at times. Blake agonized over the decision, but ultimately picked Audra. Adam desperately wanted to add Alaska and Madi to his team, but he used his two allotted steals last week.\n\nTwo of Shakira’s artists, Deja Hall and Music Box, sang The Bangles hit “Eternal Flame.”\n\nReferring to Deja, Shakira said youth has its pros and cons. She mentioned Deja’s lack of experience, but added that the 16-year-old has an angelic voice. She declared Deja to be the winner, after which Usher swooped in and stole Music Box. He told Music Box she has a lot of untapped potential.\n\nUsher paired Madilyn Paige with Tanner James. The two performed “Everything Has Changed,” Taylor Swift’s collaboration with Ed Sheeran.\n\nAdam joked it was “cute overload,” like watching a pair of puppies in the field. Shakira agreed, saying it was sweet yet believable. Usher detected both playfulness and an aggressive nature within Madilyn, whom he named the winner. Tanner was not saved.\n\nJosh Murley and Dawn & Hawkes, of Team Adam, joined forces on “Stuck in the Middle with You,” by Gerry Rafferty’s band Stealers Wheel. Blake said it was good, but there weren’t any standout moments. Shakira said she doesn’t drink, but the two acts made her want to have a beer. She added that she’d never heard the song before but she liked it. Dawn & Hawkes won the battle, but Josh was saved by Shakira.\n\nThe final battle of the night featured two of Usher’s artists, Tess Boyer and Bria Kelly. They belted out Janis Joplin’s “Piece of My Heart.” Shakira felt they were evenly matched. Blake believed Tess was the stronger performer, but Usher went with Bria. At the urging of Adam and Shakira, Blake stole Tess.\n\nThe battle rounds conclude tonight at 8 p.m. Eastern time on NBC.', 'The second week of battle rounds began on “The Voice” Monday night as more teammates were paired up for duets in front of Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Shakira and Usher.\nEach duet ended with one winner and one artist hoping that a competing coach would steal him or her.\nAloe Blacc assisted Team Adam; The Band Perry helped Team Blake; Blake’s wife, Miranda Lambert, worked with Team Shakira; and Jill Scott advised Usher’s crew.\nJosh Murley and Dawn & Hawkes, of Team Adam, joined forces on “Stuck in the Middle with You,” by Gerry Rafferty’s band Stealers Wheel.\nAt the urging of Adam and Shakira, Blake stole Tess.']"

Not only did she sound like a star — she shined bright like one, too, in her sequin top!\n\nBlake also kept Ryan Whyte Maloney on his team, sending home country legacy, Cali Tucker.\n\nShakira stuck with badass chick Kristen Merlin, sending home country California native and country singer Lindsay Bruce.\n\nAdam sent home Joshua Howard, saving standout Christina Grimmie, and we are so not surprised! She is one of our four female frontrunners, after all (all four ladies have made it through the battle rounds, as of tonight).\n\nWe only wish we could have seen Christina‘s full battle round tonight — maybe the producers decided the breeze through her battle since she got so much screen time in the season premiere, and is a shoe-in for the entire competition.\n\nUsher Goes In For The Steal\n\nThe final battle of the night welcomed Cierra Mickens, who wowed the judges with her “Crazy” blind audition, and equally as impressive Emily B into the spotlight. The ladies took away the night with Sara Bareilles’ “Brave” ballad. “That’s a bold, dare I say, brave, choice,” said Adam. Blake opted for Emily, while Usher wanted to “split it” between both ladies (spoiler alert: Usher is the only coach with a steal left).\n\nShakira was faced with a tough decision, but she ended up choosing Emily. “You both have amazing voices,” Shakira admitted.\n\nSo amazing that Usher stole Cierra! Take that, Shakira! “There’s something that I see in Cierra that I want the world to be a part of,” said Usher. What a proud coach!\n\nHollywoodLifers, who was your favorite singer of the night?

Adam paid tribute to them both for venturing outside their comfort zones but chose Sam as the winner, citing the ""trouble and power and emotion"" in her voice.\n\nAnd a Team Blake pairing of pop-rock belter Kaleigh Glanton and throwback crooner Noah Lis on a Michael Buble\'s ""Everything"" may have seemed heavily weighted in Noah\'s favor, given his Buble-style smooth sound and the way his eyes lit up when their coach told them their assignment. But Kaleigh\'s discomfort the song pushed her toward an impressive performance. Usher picked Noah the bout\'s winner, even as he decried Noah\'s performance as ""too lounge"" and ""a bit much,"" but Blake handed the battle victory to Kaleigh.\n\nNo save came for Noah, nor did one for three other pairings shown in a brief montage Tuesday.

In fact, my computer froze about five minutes from the end of the episode and I lost all my notes, and when I re-watched Battle Buble, I honestly couldn\'t remember who won ... even though I\'d just watched it half an hour ago.\n\nTEAM ADAM\n\nCountry-singing stay-at-home mom Cary Laine of Citronelle, Ala., vs. quirky nanny and possibly reluctant librarian Sam Behymer of Morgan Mill, Texas, ""Give Me Love,"" Ed Sheeran: I had Cary pegged as a country power belter, but she shows a lot of subtlety and even matches Sam\'s almost-yodels. Blake says they nicely captured the mood of the song, but also thinks they both had pitchy moments. Usher and Blake both say it\'s just a matter of taste for Adam. Shakira seems to be plumping for Sam\'s unique sound, but she also says Cary is strong. Adam picks Sam because she spoke to him in the moment.\n\nTEAM BLAKE\n\nClassical guitarist-turned-singer Kaleigh Glanton of Wichita, Ks., vs. crooner Noah Lis of Palmer, Mass., ""Everything,"" Michael Buble: Kaleigh puts up a brave face but this isn\'t her jam. She offers an interesting gloss on the song, though, while Noah somewhat restrains his riffs and offers up a smooth rendition, but not terribly memorable. Usher complains that Noah\'s performance started off a little too ""lounge,"" but it got better as it went on, and he would actually give the battle to Noah. Adam thinks the two were very evenly matched, but he gives Kaleigh the edge. ""There\'s that one thing Kaleigh can do that you can\'t teach people,"" Blake says, ""The notes that she thinks of to sing, not just that she can sing them, but the fact that she thinks of those places to go in her vocal."" So he picks Kaleigh.\n\nTEAM SHAKIRA\n\nGospel-raised singer Cierra Mickens of Eagle River, Alaska, vs. session singer/brain surgery survivor Emily B. of Twin Falls, Id., ""Brave,"" Sara Bareilles. I adore Cierra\'s rich tone and confidence, but I thought Emily matched her move for move tonight. Adam says both of the women fell out of rhythm at points, but he called Cierra\'s last note ""perfect,"" and wants to see her continue. Blake says Emily had her own major moment just before Cierra\'s, and he picks Emily. Usher stays mum, because he\'s picking up Shakira\'s reject. Shakira says she admired Cierra\'s ""rounded"" voice but enjoys Emily\'s determination, both in life and on stage. She picks\n\nEmily\n\n, but Usher uses his final steal to take\n\nCierra\n\n— although he cruelly waits until she\'s almost off the stage.\n\nWe only get a peek at the three other battles: Blake chooses folk rocker sanitation worker Ryan Whyte Maloney over country legacy Cali Tucker (niece of Tanya); Adam moves Marlton\'s YouTube singer Christina Grimmie ahead over Joshua Howard; and Shakira prefers country singer-with-a-platinum-crewcut Kristen Merlin to Lindsay Bruce, the one whose uncle\'s death in 9/11 proved a boon to her songwriting.

The reality show features aspiring singers from across the country competing for the chance to win a recording contract. It’s an adaptation of the Dutch show “The Voice of Holland.”\n\nInstead of judges, the show employs a panel of four celebrity coaches who select contestants to participate on their team for the season. The coaches then guide their acts to win the competition. The original coaches consisted of Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green. Aguilera and Green were replaced by Shakira and Usher in Season 4, before both returned for 5. Shakira and Usher then returned for Season 6, but left before Season 7. Pharrell Williams replaced Green in Season 7, while Gwen Stefani replaced Aguilera that same season due to her pregnancy. Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys joined the show for Season 11, replacing Aguilera. Stefani then returned for Season 12, alongside Keys, Levine and Shelton. It was later announced that Cyrus will be back for Season 13, and she’ll be joined by new coach Jennifer Hudson. The show was recently renewed for a fourteenth season, during which Kelly Clarkson will join the panel. Carson Daly has hosted the series since its debut.\n\nThe show also features a number of famous guest advisors who help one of the coaches mentor their team. Past celebrity participants have included Celine Dion, Cher, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Garth Brooks, Diddy, Selena Gomez, and many more.\n\nThe contestant selection process begins with “Blind Auditions,” during which the coaches will listen to an artist sing while their chair is facing the audience. If the coach is interested in having the contestant join their team, they push a button, which turns their chair toward the singer. In the “Battle Rounds” and “Knockout Rounds,” each coach pairs a member of his or her team to perform together, then chooses one of them to advance to the next stage. Viewers at home are then invited to vote each week on the top 12 contestants who make the finals until one winner is chosen.\n\nThe winners of the eleven seasons so far are Javier Colon (Season 1), Jermaine Paul (Season 2), Cassadee Pope (Season 3), Danielle Bradbery (Season 4), Tessanne Chin (Season 5), Josh Kaufman (Season 6), Craig Wayne Boyd (Season 7), Sawyer Fredericks (Season 8), Jordan Smith (Season 9), Alisan Porter (Season 10) and Sundance Head (Season 11).\n\nThe show has spawned two live tours, which featured two finalists from each team performing at venues across the country. A video game based on the series, titled “The Voice: I Want You,” was released in 2014 and allows players to perform songs from the show into a microphone. A British version of the show, dubbed “The Voice UK,” began airing on the BBC in March 2012.', '“The Voice” is a singing competition series that premiered on NBC in April 2011.\nIt’s an adaptation of the Dutch show “The Voice of Holland.”Instead of judges, the show employs a panel of four celebrity coaches who select contestants to participate on their team for the season.\nPharrell Williams replaced Green in Season 7, while Gwen Stefani replaced Aguilera that same season due to her pregnancy.\nA video game based on the series, titled “The Voice: I Want You,” was released in 2014 and allows players to perform songs from the show into a microphone.\nA British version of the show, dubbed “The Voice UK,” began airing on the BBC in March 2012.']"

So far, this round has been occasionally flat, with only a few artists really standing out and making a name for themselves. That’s sort of a bummer, given that we have seen some artists really come into their own during this. (Amanda Brown is one of the best examples of that.)\n\nCary Laine vs. Sam Behymer, “Give Me Love” (Adam Levine) – This was really all about style vs. substance. Sam had a much more unique style than Cary, and that is probably why we saw her coach choose her to the next round over a stronger overall voice. Adam has shown with Melanie Martinez and others that he really loves the unique voices. Adam picks Sam.\n\nKaleigh Glanton vs. Noah Lis, “Everything” (Blake Shelton) – Wasn’t this sweet? The problem is that there wasn’t a lot of substance to really back up either one of these two artists. They were good but not great singers, and while Kaleigh was the pretty obvious winner, that’s not saying that she is a threat to go really deep in this competition. Blake picks Kaleigh.\n\nCierra Mickens vs. Emily B., “Brave” (Shakira) – There wasn’t too much drama; we knew that someone in Usher still had a steal left, and had to use it. But for this battle? This isn’t the way that we would have closed the show with. We’d rather see a longer segment on Christina Grimmie, who performed in a montage in advanced. The were both solid and we love the song, but nothing in here rang as “special.” Usher picks up Cierra after Shakira chooses Emily.

Please stop reading here if you do not want to know what happened!\n\nTeam Adam: Austin Ellis vs. Josh Kaufman: ” Happy” by Pharrell\n\nBoth of the soul singers sang the pop hit after being coached by Adam and Aloe Blacc. Austin sang the song with enthusiasm, but Josh had the more polished singing voice.\n\nThe Coaches Thought: Blake said they were both great, but would choose Austin. Usher said Austin had talent, but Josh performed better. Shakira said it was one of the best battles, but they both won her over. Adam said both men had infectious energy, but ultimately chose Josh as the winner of the battle rounds. Austin went home, but said he appreciated the opportunity.\n\nTeam Blake: Alaska & Madi vs. Audra McLaughlin: “When Will I Be Loved” by the Everly Brothers\n\nThe Band Perry coached the singing team and the newcomer with the classic country song. The duo sang in perfect harmony, while Audra held her own in the battle rounds.\n\nThe Coaches Thought: Usher said they were all phenomenal. Shakira thought they were terrific, but they projected and sang a little too forcefully. Adam said they were all powerful, but Alaska & Madi had the edge. Blake said it was a tough decision, but chose Audra as the winner of the battle rounds. Alaska & Madi went home, but said thank you to their fellow Oklahoman, Blake Shelton.\n\nTeam Shakira: Deja Hall vs. Music Box: ” Eternal Flame” by the Bangles\n\nMiranda Lambert and Shakira helped the soulful women sing the 80’s ballad by telling them to think of their loved ones. The teenage Deja held her own against the veteran Music Box.\n\nThe Coaches Thought: Adam said Deja sounded so good to be such a young singer. Blake said Deja had a powerful voice, but Music had a unique sound. Usher said Deja was good, but needed more direction and said they both would go far. Shakira said both were great. Music Box was unique, but needed to be vulnerable. She ultimately chose Deja as the winner of the battle rounds because of her vulnerability. Usher stole Music Box and gave her new life in the battle rounds.\n\nTeam Usher: Madilyn Paige vs. Tanner Paige: ” Everything Has Changed” by Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran\n\nJill Scott and Usher helped the Utah teenagers sing the youthful love song. They advised the teens to be more emotional. They sang the ballad in sweet harmony.\n\nThe Coaches Thought: Adam said the performance was ” cute overload” and very sincere. Shakira said the performance was charismatic. Blake said they were both adorable. Usher said they both executed the song well, but chose Madilyn as the winner of the battle rounds. Tanner was eliminated from The Voice, but thanked Usher for working with him.\n\nTeam Adam: Dawn & Hawkes vs. Josh Murley : ”Stuck in the Middle with You” by Stealer’s Wheel\n\nAloe Blacc and Adam helped the duo and the bar singer sing the 70’s classic rock song. They all sang the song with a relaxed energy.\n\nThe Coaches Thought: Blake thought they gave a solid performance. Usher said they were good, but their individuality was lost. Shakira said it was a feel-good performance. Adam said they were excellent, and chose Dawn & Hawkes as the winner of the battle rounds. Josh was stolen by Shakira just as he left the stage.\n\nTeam Usher: Bria Kelly vs Tess Boyer: ” Take Another Piece of My Heart” by Janis Joplin\n\nThe women battled on the classic rock song with guidance from Jill Scott. They encouraged the singers to be more vulnerable while singing. The women forcefully sang the bluesy rock song.\n\nThe Coaches Thought: Shakira said they were awesome and they were equally matched. Adam said he was fans of them both, but Bria was amazing. Blake said Tess was a surprise great performance. Usher said they were both excellent, and chose Bria as the winner of the battle rounds. Tess was stolen by Blake in the end.\n\nJoin us tomorrow on Gossip & Gab for our The Voice 2014 Season 6 Live Recap of The Voice Season 6 Battle Rounds!

No more Knockout Rounds on The Voice 2014, but the artists will all compete in another round of battles, but this time Coldplay lead singer Chris Martin will serve as a mentor for all of the teams! Before that happens, we need to complete these teams on The Voice USA 2014 and that can only be done with the six remaining battles tonight! Check them out with us during our The Voice USA 2014 Recap and see who got eliminated on The Voice USA 2014 tonight!\n\nLast night on The Voice Season 6, the coaches put together some more amazing battles, including the battle between Madilyn Paige and Tanner James for Team Usher! The problem with these battles is that you like both of the artists, so you don’t want to see either of them go home! Unfortunately, one of them has to be named the winner and one has to go home, unless the other coaches decide to steal them away, which three artists were stolen last night!\n\n\n\nThe fun and the battles begin soon, so follow along with our recap below and see the videos of the Battle Rounds when available from NBC!\n\nWARNING: THE VOICE USA 2014 SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nThe following post contains videos from tonight’s episode of The Voice 2014 Season 6 Battle Rounds.

Now we enter the final night of the battles, so let’s do this!\n\nTeam Adam: Cary Laine vs. Sam Behymer\n\nSong: “Give Me Love” by Ed Sheeran\n\nCary was a four-chair turnaround and the country singer shocked many when picking Adam Levine as her coach. Sam came to The Voice to prove to her parents she can do this singing thing and not be a nanny any more. Adam said he gave them this song because it tests both of them and is not anything they are used to. Aloe Blacc said that Cary has a great voice, but needs to feel the song too. Sam does have a very unique sounding voice and I like it, but then Cary has a great country voice and has that Miranda Lambert look to her. She is louder and more vocal, but I think Adam is going to go with Sam.\n\nWinner: Sam Behymer and no steals for Cary, so she goes home!\n\nTeam Blake: Kaleigh Glanton vs. Noah Lis\n\nSong: “Everything” by Michael Buble\n\nKaleigh has been in a singing duet wit her father since she was a child, but she is hoping The Voice USA 2014 would be her chance to start a solo career. Noah is that crooner that could do well on the show. Blake feels this song is in the wheelhouse for Noah, but Kaleigh could shine on this song too. During rehearsals, Kaleigh is bringing out some embellishments and has Noah afraid, even though he loves the song choice. They both sing it well and cute to watch them play it up. Cute battle, but it is more of a song for Noah, so who knows. Carson Daly said it was the nicest battle ever!\n\nWinner: Kaleigh Glanton and no steals for Noah, so he is eliminated on The Voice USA 2014 tonight!\n\nWe get some quick results on The Voice Season 6:\n\nTeam Blake – Ryan Whyte Maloney beat Cali Tucker; no steals\n\nbeat no steals\n\nTeam Adam – Christina Grimmie beat Joshua Howard; no steals\n\nbeat no steals\n\nTeam Shakira – Kristen Merlin beat Lindsay Bruce; no steals\n\nTeam Shakira: Cierra Mickens vs. Emily B.\n\nSong: “Brave” by Sara Bareilles\n\nThis is the final battle of the night and season, so this has to be the time Usher uses the last steal, right? Shakira said she put them together because they both have soulful voices and range. Miranda Lambert said this is where their artistic side comes out and taking a song from someone else and making it their own. They both have such strong voices. Emily B. has a similar way of singing like Sara Bareilles, but Cierra is strong in her own way and I’d got with her.\n\nWinner: Emily B. and we all know that Usher has that steal left, so he gladly hits that button and Cierra joins Team Usher!\n\nWhat do you think of the results on The Voice USA 2014 tonight?\n\nJoin us tonight on Reality Rewind for our The Voice USA 2014 Recap.

46233,http://www.realitywanted.com/newsitem/6832-the-voice-ready-to-rumble-again,entertainment,"['Posted on 03/25/2014 by Elizabeth in The Voice and General News\n\nBy Deja Lee\n\nTeam members Austin and Josh opened up the night with Pharrell\'s super smooth hit ""Happy."" Austin\'s daring grizzly voice and confident style was, unfortunately, no match to Josh\'s velvety warm tone. He may need to work on bonding with the audience, but he had the all the right notes to slide into home base on team Adam.\n\n\n\nBlake paired Audrea with singing duo Maddie and Alaska. It always makes me a bit nervous to see solo artists battle against duos. It just seems unfair because when the power of harmony hits the audience, it hits hard. Despite this advantage, no duo has beat a solo artist in the battle rounds yet.\n\n\n\nThese three girls were given a country song called ""When Will I be loved"". The ladies sang their hearts out which, personally, I found a little exhausting. There was a constant continuation of belted notes throughout the entire performance, but I can\'t say it was a bad one. Certainly the judges had their hands full in deciding who to choose for team Blake. Maddie and Alaska were great but it was Audrea who he chose to stick around.\n\n\n\nShakira\'s group was next. The talented 16-year-old Deja Hall had the challenge of facing Iyesha Brooks who they refer to as ""Music Box."" Well Ms. Brooks does live up to her name! Her distinct sound won her a steal from team Usher. This was Usher\'s first steal out of all the battles. He obviously heard something special from Music Box. I\'m sure the viewers at home did too.\n\n\n\nNext more young talent takes the stage. 15-year-old Madilyn, and 19-year-old Tanner both come from the same high school in Utah, but never met until The Voice. What are the odds that they would come from the same town, go on the same show during the same season, and get picked at the same time by the same coach?! It sounds like destiny to me.\n\n\n\nMadilyn and Tanner were matched up to sing a love song by Taylor Swift, ""Everything has Changed"". Tanner had the ladies screaming for his buttery voice and heart throb features. It was a strong battle, but in the end Madilyn was the one who kept her spot on team Usher.\n\n\n\nAdam bought something exciting to the stage when he had Dawn n Hawkes sing ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" against Josh. Josh had a hard time not looking like a third wheel against Dawn n Hawkes. The couple seems to harmonize and blend so well together. But why shouldn\'t they? After all, they are married.\n\n\n\nJosh put up a great fight, as his voice sounded awesome in the song, but unfortunately Dawn n Hawkes were too irresistible and stuck with team Adam. Josh was lucky enough to get a steal from Shakira just at the last minute as he was walking away. A moment of shock and true elation for Josh.\n\n\n\nAs for the final performance of the night, Usher chose Tess and Bria to battle each other to one of my favorite soul songs, ""Piece of my Heart"" by Janis Joplin. 18-year-old Bria, already has a rock-like grit and persona for this song. Tess on the other hand, is a pop singing cheerleader. She had to find it in herself to let go of her pageant queen image and really preform this passionate, grungy song.\n\n\n\nIt seemed difficult at first, but once she got on stage she was mind-blowing! She effortlessly sung the song whilst still being able to keep all the soul in it. Bria did what was expected of her, but that\'s not to undermine her performance. She was equally amazing and truly connected with the song, which is why Usher picked her to stay on his team.\n\n\n\nTess sure did give Bria a run for her money. Blake noticed this and picked her up for the steal immediately. I can see Tess becoming another one of those threats in this competition. Just remember I saw it first. Tonight night they will be finishing up the last of the battle rounds so be ready!\n\nPhoto courtesy of NBC', ""Austin's daring grizzly voice and confident style was, unfortunately, no match to Josh's velvety warm tone.\nHer distinct sound won her a steal from team Usher.\n15-year-old Madilyn, and 19-year-old Tanner both come from the same high school in Utah, but never met until The Voice.\nIt was a strong battle, but in the end Madilyn was the one who kept her spot on team Usher.\nTonight night they will be finishing up the last of the battle rounds so be ready!""]"

But when you put Blake Shelton in a song, it’s certainly going to lean a little country.\n\nSo since this new Shakira song called “Medicine” has some nice guest vocals from Shelton, I’m going to agree with her that it is country. But country enough for country radio? Maybe not.\n\nBut it has a pretty Lady Antebellum-like arrangement. And the lyrics are right up my alley. It has what I think is some kind of passionate love-gone-wrong theme about how she’s an expert at complicating things and makes the war seem like such an easy game. Ultimately, she is the white flag that makes him surrender.\n\nThen the chorus goes like this:\n\nI don’t reach for the bottle of whiskey\n\nStraight on the rocks\n\nBut you won’t see me popping the pills\n\n’Cause if I want the pain to go away\n\nIn a second make it fade\n\nYou’re the only thing that will\n\nYou’re my medicine, medicine\n\nMy medicine, medicine, my medicine\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo.com , Shelton said he heard about “Medicine” when he and Shakira returned for the new season of The Voice.\n\n“When she came back to start filming this season, she told me she’d written this song with Hillary Lindsey and Mark Wright,” he said. “She sent it over and said, ’Would you be interested in singing on this thing with me?’ I listened to the song, and it was amazing. I immediately wrote back and I said, ’Man, you wrote the song that’s the style you like,’ which is that kind of mid-tempo, driving thing that Lady A does.\n\n“She definitely made it Shakira, though. So I was honored that she asked me to come and sing on it.”\n\nThis is not the first time the two judges from The Voice have come together on a song. Last year, they did Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” on the show. And Shakira reportedly loved it so much, she set her sights on writing with Shelton’s wife Miranda Lambert. That hasn’t happened yet, though. Maybe for her next album.', 'With country music’s definition getting wider every day, it’s hard to say what is undeniably country and what is not country.\nBut when you put Blake Shelton in a song, it’s certainly going to lean a little country.\nSo since this new Shakira song called “Medicine” has some nice guest vocals from Shelton, I’m going to agree with her that it is country.\nBut country enough for country radio?\nAnd Shakira reportedly loved it so much, she set her sights on writing with Shelton’s wife Miranda Lambert.']"

Both delivered dynamic work during Pharrell Williams’ Happy although neither sported a Mounties-like hat like Williams. Ellis was more powerful but Usher, Shakira and Blake Shelton sided towards Kaufman. Levine thought Kaufman one-upped Ellis this time as well.\n\nThe spotlight on Shakira’s team had Music Box (thankfully an alias) versus Deja Hall. The song, The Bangles’ Eternal Flame, sounded more like enduring pain during rehearsals with both contestants butchering their way through the hit. Onstage, Hall, 16, exuded more presence than Box who tried to turn it into a diva-esque ballad.\n\nLevine loved Hall’s power at such a tender age while Shelton thought Music Box was better. Shakira lauded both before picking Hall. Usher quickly stole Music Box, leaving the singer and her son (Boom Box?) extremely grateful.\n\nOne of the strangest battles was from Shelton’s stable, namely Audra McLaughlin against the duo of Alaska and Madi. After working out the kinks for Linda Ronstadt’s version of The Everly Brothers’ When Will I Be Loved, the duo and McLaughlin had their ups and downs when it mattered most. Shakira and Usher were undecided as neither truly stood out. Shelton, looking torn, decided McLaughlin won the battle over some over-the-top harmonies by the duo.\n\nLevine also had a threesome of sorts with Dawn and Hawkes against Josh Murley. Murley looked like a third wheel initially on Stealers Wheel’s Stuck In The Middle With You. Onstage the trio gelled instantly with Dawn and Hawkes oozing synergy. Murley held his own though, leaving Levine in a bind. Levine – who loved the duo’s audition – stuck with Dawn and Hawkes. As for Murley, he was about to exit before Shakira stole him at the very last moment.\n\nThe sweetest pairing was the diminutive Madilyn Paige against the lanky Tanner James. The two youngsters – both from Utah and from the same school – never met before joining Team Usher. However they found chemistry in rehearsals, nailing Taylor Swift’s Everything Has Changed.\n\nPaige and James delivered the sugary ballad fantastically and resulting in a case “cute overload” as Levine dubbed it. Shakira said both were “amazing” and thought it was “sweet.” Usher felt the execution was great from both yet decided Paige had a slight edge over James in the “Romeo and Juliet” battle.\n\nFinally Bria Kelly and Tess Boyer let loose on Janis Joplin’s Piece Of My Heart. The practice session had Usher urging Boyer to get lost in the tune and lose the former NFL cheerleader mindset. Onstage both gave as well as they took with Kelly, 18, definitely oozing more confidence.\n\nAfterwards Usher said he truly needed to feel Kelly’s performance which he did in choosing her. Boyer’s sad tears turned into happy tears once Shelton stole her.', 'Ellis was more powerful but Usher, Shakira and Blake Shelton sided towards Kaufman.\nLevine thought Kaufman one-upped Ellis this time as well.\nLevine loved Hall’s power at such a tender age while Shelton thought Music Box was better.\nThe two youngsters – both from Utah and from the same school – never met before joining Team Usher.\nBoyer’s sad tears turned into happy tears once Shelton stole her.']"

The clock is ticking, so here\'s everything you need to know about 24: Live Another Day.\n\nWhen is Jack back?\n\n\n\n24: Live Another Day will get its world premiere on US network Fox on Monday, May 5 - launching with a double-bill. The remaining 10 episodes will then air over subsequent weeks on Mondays at 9/8c.\n\nSky1 - the show\'s UK home back in the day - has confirmed that it will also air the new limited series, though hasn\'t firmed up an air-date yet, other than to reassure Bauer\'s Brit fans that they\'ll also get to see the new episodes at some point in May.\n\nBut wait, isn\'t Jack a fugitive now?\n\n\n\nYes, for those of you who don\'t recall how 24 originally ended its run in 2010, Kiefer Sutherland\'s government agent Bauer came into conflict with both the US and Russian governments. There was fault on both sides, but ultimately Jack was forced to flee his home country and go on the run.\n\nLive Another Day sees the ex-CTU operative rock up in London, but, as Bauer\'s bad luck would have it, the US President - his old sparring partner James Heller - is also visiting England\'s capital and it\'s not long before Jack uncovers a plot to assassinate the Commander-in-Chief on foreign soil.\n\nWho else from the classic series is on board?\n\n\n\nAlong with Sutherland and William Devane as Heller, Live Another Day will also reintroduce Kim Raver as Audrey - Heller\'s daughter and Jack\'s old love interest, last seen in a near-comatose state in season 6 after being kidnapped and tortured by Chinese agents.\n\nAudrey\'s doing considerably better now, having landed herself a husband, who\'s also her father\'s Chief of Staff - relationships are never straightforward in the 24 universe.\n\nThe final returnee is, of course, Chloe O\'Brian - Mary Lynn Rajskub\'s snarky hacker who was first introduced to 24 in its third season and has since become as indispensable to the show as Bauer himself.\n\nChloe, it seems, has been on a reverse trajectory to Audrey. She\'s ""damaged"", having lost her young son in mysterious circumstances, has turned against the government she once served and is expressing her new world view via a punky new look that\'s got more than a little of the Lisbeth Salander about it.\n\nThat\'s apparently your lot for returnees. Trusty old Aaron Pierce (Glenn Morshower) will likely be absent, as will Carlos Bernard\'s Tony Almeida, so no huskily-whispered Alrights or Yahs for 24 fans this time round.\n\nWho are the new guys?\n\n\n\nFilling out the cast list for 24: Live Another Day is an impressive roster of stars including Yvonne Strahovski, Benjamin Bratt, Tate Donovan, Michelle Fairley, Colin Salmon and - incredibly - Stephen Fry.\n\nChuck star Strahovski is Kate Morgan, a CIA agent based in London who is tasked with capturing Jack, while Bratt is her clean-cut boss Steve Navarro.\n\nDamages actor Donovan plays Audrey\'s new beau Mark Boudreau, while recent Game of Thrones departee Fairley has been cast as Margot, the widow of a notorious terrorist.\n\nSalmon could cause trouble for Jack as the fierce, uncompromising General Coburn, while national treasure Fry is the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Did we mention how incredible Fry\'s casting is?\n\nIs this a final farewell to Jack Bauer?\n\n\n\nPerhaps not. It would be a tragedy to lose Jack again having only just got him back and, with Live Another Day sure to hit big on both sides of the Atlantic, further 24 outings seem like a near certainty - though what form the show\'s third coming would take is less certain.\n\nHoward Gordon, exec producer on the original show and the revival, has claimed that a second limited series - likely spanning another 12 episodes - is the most likely option. The show\'s star though is still pushing for Jack to make the leap to the big screen.\n\n""There\'s always an opportunity to do that,"" Sutherland said of the much-discussed 24 movie earlier this year - bless \'im, Kiefer will still be pitching that feature film when\'s Jack\'s pursuing terrorists with the aid of a walking stick and replacement hip.\n\n24: Live Another Day to be preceded by comic book\n\nWatch the trailer for 24: Live Another Day below:\n\nAre you as pumped as we are for the new 24?

In this retooled miniseries version of the original show, we\'re only getting 12 episodes instead of 24, thereby breaking the oft-restrictive real-time rules that first helped distinguish the 24 TV series. So to the contrary, for the first time ever, every second does NOT count in this show.\n\nWhat DOES count is Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), and he\'s back along with Chloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub). At this point in a show whose characters and mythos has grown well beyond its core concept, having the characters we know and love back in the thrill of espionage and battle is pretty much all you need.\n\n...And it\'s a good thing, because much of what is actually shown in the promo looks like someone replaying one of their early-season 24 DVDs for a minute-long montage, with all the workplace/family drama fluff cut out. That could be exactly what we\'re getting with 24: Live Another Day: vintage Jack Bauer lean cut, as opposed to the later, bloated, ""Super Jack"" seasons when the character arguably became a victim of his own hype. That\'s nice to see, for sure, but is it a compelling enough reason for a multitude of viewers to tune in for 12 episodes - especially if they don\'t immediately get that warm, fuzzy, Jack Bauer feeling held sacred in their nostalgia?\n\nAs always with these revival events, there\'s the risk that people won\'t be happy even if they get what they want (again). It seems like serial killers are at the center of a lot of action/thriller shows these days (just note how The Following now occupies that old 24 Monday night slot), while the espionage sub-genre has gotten a cerebral and stylistic upgrade thanks to shows like Homeland. And while Jack Bauer is iconic, Sutherland is not the same level of heavyweight as, say, James Spader on The Blacklist - a hit show where a character that Jack Bauer would\'ve water boarded in the early 2000s is now the biggest draw.\n\nI probably sound more morose than I want to (I\'m happy, I swear - Jack is Back!), but nothing seen in this trailer has me champing at the bit. It all feels slightly dated, honestly - down to the line Jack says about how the plot is bigger than just President James Heller (returning cast member William Devane). You could lift that same line out of seasons 1, 2, 5, of the show.\n\nFinally, I love how the evil plot seems to revolve around the idea of basically restarting the Revolutionary War by having a US president assassinated in England. Seriously bro, those hostilities have been percolating ever since 1783; one powder keg, dead pres, or spilled barrel of tea will unhinge the entire world - unless Jack Bauer can stop it.\n\nPlenty of familiar faces are returning – Chloe O’Brien (Mary Lynn Rajskub), Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) James Heller (William Devane) – but new faces are joining in on the high-octane fun, too: Yvonne Strahovski (Dexter), Giles Matthey (Jobs), Gbenga Akinnagbe (The Wire), Michael Wincott (The Crow) and Michelle Fairley (Game of Thrones).\n\n__________________________________________\n\n__________________________________________\n\n24: Live Another Day premieres on Monday, May 5, 2014 at 8pm EST on Fox.\n\nSource: Fox\n\n336 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied', '336 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link CopiedThe title of this latest promo for 24: Live Another Day is ""Every Second Counts"" - but that\'s not necessarily true.\nWhat DOES count is Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), and he\'s back along with Chloe (Mary Lynn Rajskub).\nThat could be exactly what we\'re getting with 24: Live Another Day: vintage Jack Bauer lean cut, as opposed to the later, bloated, ""Super Jack"" seasons when the character arguably became a victim of his own hype.\nSeriously bro, those hostilities have been percolating ever since 1783; one powder keg, dead pres, or spilled barrel of tea will unhinge the entire world - unless Jack Bauer can stop it.\n____________________________________________________________________________________24: Live Another Day premieres on Monday, May 5, 2014 at 8pm EST on Fox.']"

Mandy Blows Up The Plane (Season 1, Episode 1)\n\nWe're now just 6 weeks away from the long-awaited return of Jack Bauer to our screens for the London-set mini-series 24: Live Another Day. It's been almost 4 years since Kiefer Sutherland last played the part in Season 8's thrilling finale, and given the character's popularity, it's no surprise that he's come surging back to TV so soon. So, what better time to relive those classic moments, the scenes which cemented 24 in the canon of must-see TV shows forever more? We're talking about the kills (in fact, a lot of kills), the shocking twists, and on occasion, the ridiculous writing decisions that fans didn't quite buy into but which nevertheless came to define the show, especially in its less-acclaimed later years. Still, even a bad episode of 24 is better than 99% of serialised dreck on Fox, so it's time to look back with a fond eye on the countless hours of joy, sadness, thrills and outright insanity that the Jack Bauer Power Hour has brought us over the years. And of course, 24 slots isn't nearly enough to do full justice to 24's narrative might, so if we've missed off any of your favourite moments, be sure to let us know in the comments below!Mia Kirshner's Mandy quickly became a fan favourite character after her sexy and explosive entrance in the first three episodes of 24.

The moment that Mandy bails out of the plane seconds before it explodes made audiences sure from the outset that this show wasn't screwing around, especially considering that 9/11 had happened just two months before the episode aired.

There were some great records to be found. But behind closed doors, the label did not see my father as fitting in with what they were doing at the time. I think their attitude was largely that was he was done. There weren\'t going to be any more hits from him. There was just such a limited vision in the business at the time about my father and those around him. Because they deemed that he didn\'t fall in with what was happening, he just wasn\'t on the radar of the powers that be.""\n\n""In speaking with the people at Sony Legacy, I think we all agree that some of the predecessors at the label made a mistake choosing to shelve these recordings,"" John Carter Cash tells HuffPost Canada Music.\n\nOriginally recorded at Nashville’s Columbia Studios in 1981 and at 1111 Sound Studios in 1984, the original sessions were produced by Billy Sherrill, whom many consider to be the architect of the ""countrypolitan"" sound. What\'s most striking about the songs on ""Out Among The Stars"" is that they don\'t sound the least bit dated despite now being more than 30 years old\n\nSo imagine the surprise felt by John Carter Cash, the only son of Johnny Cash and his second wife June Carter Cash, when he was pouring through his father\'s archives and came across a series of unreleased recordings from this unheralded period of Cash\'s career. So he assembled 12 of these never-before-heard songs to make the ""new"" Johnny Cash album Out Among The Stars "".\n\nIn the final decade of his life, Johnny Cash released some of the most passionate, acclaimed work of his career via Rick Rubin\'s American Recordings label starting in 1994. It\'s almost hard to believe that in the 1980s, many in the country music establishment saw Johnny Cash as a has-been whose best work was behind him.\n\nThere\'s arguably no name more synonymous with country music than Johnny Cash. Throughout the five decades of his career, it seemed everyone could identify with him. Country, rock, folk and punk fans all equally loved the ""Man In Black."" His music transcended genres, his influence upon the world unquestionable.\n\nThe recordings found on ""Out Among The Stars"" first surfaced in 2012 when John Carter Cash, along with people from his father\'s former record label were cataloging the extensive musical archives left behind by his parents.\n\nCarter Cash says that they originally came across 16 tracks that had been previously unreleased but opted to use the 12 songs that they felt formed the most cohesive body of work.\n\n""All of the elements that were common throughout my father\'s career and life were to be found on these 12 songs: his humour, his faith and his love for my mother.""\n\nInitially, some of the songs found on ""Out Among The Stars"" were in various states of completion. Some of the songs recorded by Johnny Cash’s band at the time -- a young Marty Stuart on guitar and mandolin, Jerry Kennedy on guitar, Pete Drake (steel guitar), Henry Strzelecki (bass) and Hargus “Pig” Robbins on piano -- were missing solos or other parts deemed vital to the song.\n\nAlong with co-producer and archivist Steve Berkowitz, John Carter Cash enlisted Marty Stuart, Buddy Miller and his stepsister, Carlene Carter to help fill in those missing parts.\n\nCarter Cash admits having approached the need for overdubbing ""new"" parts with extreme caution.\n\n""Mr. Sherrill is not interested in being a part of the music business these days and so we pressed on and did the best that we felt that we could within our hearts. We wanted to pay respect to Billy and not go back and fix things that didn\'t need to be touched up. The band he had backing my father was amazing. They were all such great players.\n\n""Our intention was to make the touch-ups that we were making a seamless thing to the listener. We know that we have done well when people say that they cannot necessarily tell what was recorded then versus what was recorded in the last couple of years.""\n\nAn especially touching moment on ""Out Among The Stars"" comes via the song ""Baby Ride Easy,"" a duet between Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter. A classic Cash-Carter duet in the same vein as their earlier hits like ""Jackson,"" what is especially notable about the song, aside from the duo regularly trading off lead vocal duties, is the happiness that permeates their respective vocal tracks.\n\n""That song is such a vibrant, feverish song. It is one of the songs that grabs me the most because it reminds me of the good times that my parents shared. They were very much in love throughout their marriage. You can hear that in the song. They even had the vision that the song could have been a big hit for them. Sadly, the record companies weren\'t interested in that at the time.”\n\nAdmitting that there is more in the way of unreleased material in his father\'s archives, including numerous tracks from his prolific time at American Recordings, John Carter Cash looks forward to sharing more music from his legendary father in the future.\n\n""There will definitely be more music coming but it has to be the right time and has say something unique,"" he says. ""We want to preserve the integrity to my father\'s work and career, first and foremost.""\n\n""At the end of the day, it is just such a joy to be able to share these songs with everyone. It is a chance for people to hear the music of my father at a particular snapshot of his life. I want people to know more about the person that I remember so dearly.""', 'So he assembled 12 of these never-before-heard songs to make the ""new"" Johnny Cash album Out Among The Stars "".\nThere\'s arguably no name more synonymous with country music than Johnny Cash.\nAlong with co-producer and archivist Steve Berkowitz, John Carter Cash enlisted Marty Stuart, Buddy Miller and his stepsister, Carlene Carter to help fill in those missing parts.\nCarter Cash admits having approached the need for overdubbing ""new"" parts with extreme caution.\nAn especially touching moment on ""Out Among The Stars"" comes via the song ""Baby Ride Easy,"" a duet between Johnny Cash and his wife June Carter.']"

After they both died in 2003, the job fell to him to sift through the family vault across town. Among the things he discovered was a lost album, recorded in the early \'80s by hotshot producer Billy Sherrill.\n\n""It\'s like finding an old Van Gogh in your closet,"" John says. ""What do you do?\n\nA lost masterpiece makes for a pretty good story. But that\'s not how guitarist Marty Stuart recalls the recording sessions, which came at a low point in Johnny Cash\'s popularity: ""Pretty good songs, pretty good performances but no magic,"" Stuart says.\n\nThe big names were starting to sing over orchestras instead of fiddles and six-strings. Cash\'s sound had evolved, but not that much. Shortly after making these forgotten recordings, he was famously dropped from Columbia Records.\n\nSo John Carter Cash a producer in his own right invited Stuart and other musicians out to the cabin studio to give it another go.\n\n""When I listened to myself, I found there was profound room for improvement,"" Stuart says with a laugh. ""That boy needed some work.""\n\nFor this album, titled Out Among The Stars, Stuart laid down new guitar solos. Dobro master Jerry Douglas came in to add some background twang. Carlene Carter one of June\'s daughters from her previous marriage even sang a third part on a duet called ""Baby Ride Easy.""\n\nWhile known for their duets, Johnny and June were also famous for their rocky relationship. Cash\'s career may have been foundering at this point, but John Carter says his parents were happy.\n\n""At this period of their life, they were focused and together. They were very much in love. Right before this, they were very close to splitting up,"" he says.\n\nWhen Johnny Cash recorded these songs, he\'d just come out of rehab; he wrote the last track, ""Came to Believe,"" while there. But even the songs on darker subjects have a lightheartedness about them. One, ""I Drove Her Out of My Mind,"" describes a suicide by driving off Tennessee\'s Lookout Mountain.\n\n""Its comedic,"" John says. ""He\'s laughing and making jokes about how the car dealer is going to feel after he commits suicide in the vehicle without paying for it.""\n\nNo one\'s expecting a chart-topper from this previously unreleased music. But John Carter Cash does hope to reshape a bit of his father\'s tortured legacy, away from the ""Cocaine Blues"" and toward the upbeat.\n\n""He was a man of a lot of laughter,"" he says. ""Why not let the light endure? Yes, this cool image whatever brings people in, and it\'s part of who he was. I still haven\'t figured everything out about my dad, and I probably never will.

The inspection also focused on the Porsche\'s history, safety recalls, and repair records.\n\n\n\nThe mechanical examination revealed no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision. ""During the examination, it was determined that an aftermarket exhaust system had been installed which would have increased the engine\'s horsepower,"" said Commander Parker. The tires on the car were more than nine years old.\n\n\n\nThere is evidence that seatbelts were worn by both Mr. Rodas and Walker and that the airbags deployed for both the driver and passenger. ""Toxicology tests on both men revealed that neither had used any alcohol or drugs,"" said Commander Parker.\n\n\n\nThe traffic collision happened at about 3:26PM on Saturday, November 30, 2013, at Hercules St. at Kelly Johnson Pkwy, which is very near the business park at the 28300 block of Rye Canyon Loop, Valencia, in the city of Santa Clarita. The posted speed limit in the area of the collision is 45 MPH.\n\n\n\nNo eyewitness contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff\'s Department to say there was a second vehicle and there is no evidence to indicate there was a second car involved in the collision. Investigators sought out eyewitnesses to what happened just prior to the collision, as well as to the collision itself. Security videos and photos from local businesses along with other evidence helped skilled investigators to determine the cause of the collision and that no speed contest was taking place.\n\n\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff\'s traffic investigators documented the scene extensively after the collision. This included writing a traffic report, photographing the scene, determining the collision\'s area of impact and point of rest, measuring skid marks and location of debris, gathering physical evidence such as debris and the on-board car computer data, and examining the car itself to look for such evidence such as paint transfer to help determine whether or not it had impacted other objects or cars.\n\n\n\nLA Sheriff\'s investigators also consulted with experts from the Porsche and Michelin Corporations as part of the investigation.\n\n\n\nThe opinion of the Los Angeles County Coroner - Medical Examiner is that Mr. Rodas ""died of multiple traumatic injuries. The manner of death is accident."" The opinion of the Los Angeles County Coroner - Medical Examiner is that the cause of death of Mr. Walker is ""combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries.

Image via Reach Out WorldWide.\n\nThe L.A. County Sheriff\'s Department has revealed that the accident that killed Paul Walker and Roger Rodas was caused by ""unsafe speed for the roadway conditions."" Data retrieved from the vehicle by Porsche, along with analysis of CCTV footage, led investigators to the conclusion that Rodas was driving between 80mph and 93mph when he lost control. Speculation at the time of the accident suggested a mechanical malfunction caused the GT to crash, but investigators have ruled that out. During consultation with Michelin, the tyre\'s manufacturer, it was found that the car\'s tyres were nine years old.That would suggest that the Carrera\'s tyres had never been changed since the car left the showroom. Although Rodas probably didn\'t wear them out through driving miles, natural degradation through exposure to the elements over that time period could have affected the tyre\'s structure. The loads it is exposed to while cornering at 93mph mean that a weak tyre potentially contributed to a loss of control. Analysis of the CCTV footage also confirmed that the pair were not racing another vehicle at the time of the crash.

The posted speed limit on the Santa Clarita, California, office park road was 45 mph.\n\nThe sheriff’s conclusion is no surprise, since the coroner’s report previously estimated the car was speeding at 100 mph. But the investigative report does clear up some questions that have lingered about how Walker died.\n\nWalker, 40, and friend Roger Rodas, 38, had no drugs or alcohol in their blood. Both men were wearing seat belts. The airbags deployed as they should have when the car clipped a light pole and several trees, investigators said.\n\nNothing mechanical went wrong to cause their Porsche to leave the wide road. Investigators found “no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision,” the report said. Experts from Porsche and Michelin were consulted.\n\nThe car did have “an aftermarket exhaust system” that helped it go faster, the report said. The tires on the car, which was mostly displayed in a showroom and rarely driven, were more than nine years old.\n\nOne early theory — considering the nature of Walker’s movies — that he and Rodas could have been racing another car was not supported, the report said.\n\n“No eyewitness contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department to say there was a second vehicle and there is no evidence to indicate there was a second car involved in the collision,” it said. Video recorded by several security cameras on nearby buildings “helped skilled investigators to determine the cause of the collision and that no speed contest was taking place.”\n\nThe Los Angeles County coroner’s office released a15-page report in January that concluded the two men apparently did not live long after the crash.\n\nWalker and Rodas, racing team partners, left a charity event at a car shop co-owned by the men to take a ride in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street.\n\nThe autopsy revealed “scant soot” in Walker’s trachea, suggesting his life ended before the smoke and fire engulfed the car.\n\nThe actor’s body was badly burned “and in a pugilistic stance. His right wrist was fractured and his left arm was fractured,” the report said. Rodas was also described as in “a pugilistic” — or defensive — position.\n\nWalker suffered fractures of his left jawbone, collarbone, pelvis, ribs and spine, the report said.\n\nRodas “rapidly died of severe blunt head, neck and chest trauma,” the report said.\n\nWalker’s death came during a Thanksgiving break in filming of “Fast and Furious 7,” forcing a halt in the production. Universal Studios eventually decided that the movie would be completed using scenes already filmed by Walker, but the release will be delayed from this summer until April 10, 2015.

Her second, W.E., fared no better. But Madonna’s quickly gotten over the criticism (she is Madonna, after all) and is now gearing up for her third film, Adé: A Love Story.\n\nThe romantic drama has some mildly interesting pedigree going for it, at least. It’s based on the debut novel by Rebecca Walker, daughter of The Color Purple author Alice Walker, and will be produced by Silver Linings Playbook‘s Bruce Cohen. Find out what it’s about — and why Madonna may actually be a pretty good fit for the material — after the jump.\n\nPublished last fall and based on Walker’s own experiences, Adé: A Love Story centers on a biracial American college student named Farida who is traveling abroad. While in Africa, she falls for Adé, a young Muslim man living off the coast of Kenya. The two make plans to marry, envisioning a simple life together. But war and disease intervene.\n\nThematically, it doesn’t sound so different from Madonna’s W.E., which tracked the dramatic romance between Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII. The book also, as THR points out, involves thought-provoking subjects that Madonna should feel comfortable with, like “sex, religion, race, lesbianism.”\n\nTrue, Adé: A Love Story could very well turn out to be a hot mess.

It needs to be disseminated, far and wide, long and short, pictures and words.\n\nThis can be far too much for a couple needing to administer so many other arrangements, such as pink or champagne for bridesmaids dresses and local strip club or four nights in Vegas for the bachelor party.\n\nThe W Hotel in New York understands this. It knows that if it\'s to satisfy the betrothed moderns, it must fulfill all their social needs.\n\nSo it has created the concept of the social media wedding concierge. This talented and much sought-after individual will, as the Huffington Post reports, take care of all the happy couple\'s needs. From the hotel\'s PR release, these include:\n\n""Live tweeting of the ceremony and reception; Instagram photos and videos and Vine videos; Curating a unique wedding #hashtag; Encouraging guests to utilize hashtag and handles as they post to social media; Set up and maintenance of Wedding Blog before and after the big day; Curating registry wish list and dream honeymoon Pinterest boards to inspire couple; Wedding social media recap for the couple - a Shutterfly book complete with social media highlights from the planning process and a collage of the best tweets and Instagrams sent during the wedding.""\n\nAt this point, you must have encountered your true ignorance.\n\nYou had no idea that a wedding required so many social aspects to be covered. You had no clue how much shame might rain down upon you, should you have failed to address each and every one of these issues.\n\nImagine if you had forgotten to be inspired by a dream honeymoon Pinterest board. Your wedding would have resembled nothing more than a Friday night piss-up.\n\nAnd if you had failed to create a Shutterfly book, you would be ostracized not only from your own subdivision or apartment building. It is likely that you would have been defriended by thousands of Facebookers overnight.\n\nThe W Hotel is there to save you from this plight, one that could involve you having to emigrate to remote parts.\n\nHow, then, could such a service not be worth the $3,000 that the hotel is requesting?\n\nThe W Hotels\' global social media strategist, Alyssa Kiefer, is confident that society will accept this.

For $3,000, the soon-to-be betrothed can hire a “social media wedding concierge” who will live-tweet their big day, create a wedding hashtag, set up a wedding blog, and even curate “registry wish list[s] and dream honeymoon Pinterest boards to inspire.”\n\nCommentary on the news, which emerged Tuesday, has for the most part reflected some version of this Huffington Post headline: “Please Do Not Pay Someone $3,000 to Live-Tweet Your Wedding.”\n\nBut Alyssa Kiefer, W Hotels’ global social media strategist, is unfazed. In an email (W Hotels declined to let me speak to her by phone, saying Kiefer was on vacation), she said the service–which doesn’t even have its own web page yet–is based on behavior guests have already exhibited, such as updating their Facebook statuses at the alter and asking how to get their weddings to trend on Twitter.\n\n“Perhaps a relative can’t make it from another country or you just want a modern day ‘scrapbook” of sorts,’” she notes. The service includes not only wedding-day support, but social media support at every step along the way, providing, for instance, “shots of the engagement photos, the cake tasting, finding the perfect dress, and everything in between.”\n\nYes, Kiefer has heard the criticism, but she doesn’t think that it will stand in the way of the program’s success.\n\n“To some, this may seem a bit over the top and we’re okay with that,” she says. “We’re sure couples balked at the idea of traditional wedding planners years ago and now you wouldn’t think of planning a wedding without one.”\n\nRegardless of whether a social media wedding concierge is necessary, she may have a point. The typical American wedding has transformed over the last 100 years from a small, private event hosted at home into an all-night production that in 2012, on average, exceeded the median income. In this context, it’s not particularly difficult to imagine the leap from where we are today to when a $3,000 social media concierge doesn’t seem absurd.

I've been working really hard to balance the two of them and to spend alone time with her but also alone time with him. My partner has been really understanding and has reassured me that it’s OK to skip a weekend with him ... but the thing is I want to see him and I want to see her. I just feel like I'm being pulled in so many directions. Meanwhile, I'm so tired. I also just want a damn weekend alone, but then I feel guilty if I take time to myself rather than seeing one of them or the other. How do I find a balancing act that works? How do I maintain a relationship with my long-distance partner while still giving my bff the quality time she needs?\n\nMy partner and I just started a long-distance relationship, and by long-distance I mean about four hours away.

So the weekends are the only time I get to see my partner. But my best friend is feeling neglected.\n\nLong-distance relationships can make you a special kind of tired. It's not just the scheduling and travel; you also have to be on when you get there. It's harder to sit on the couch and enjoy passive quality time with someone you love. You might feel pressure to make every minute count, no matter who you're with. Sometimes you have to be less of a friend or partner.\n\nIt'll help to accept this reality instead of pretending you can fix it. You're not going to be able to please everyone the way you used to – and that's OK. Your needs are different now.\n\nMy thought is that the BFF is going to have to accept less weekend time. You need those days for your boyfriend and, on occasion, for unwinding by yourself. It'll be possible to see her on some Saturdays and Sundays, but there will be no standing weekend date. That doesn't make you a bad friend; it just makes you a busy one. Over a lifetime, people get partners, have kids, move, etc. Best friends should be able to go with the flow. They should want you to thrive.\n\nLet your friend know you want to do see her as much as possible but that you hope she can be flexible. Then give yourself some time to get used to this new routine. In a few months, it might feel a little more natural for you and everyone else.\n\n– Meredith\n\nReaders?

Inside a converted Brooklyn armoury in late 2012, Aronofsky was shooting Noah on a massive vessel that matched the biblical dimensions of the boat, its rough beams lashed together and the hull sealed with pitch.\n\nIn every corner of the three-storey structure rested packs of ersatz animals - insects on one level, snakes and turtles in another corner and, around the bend, lions quite literally lying with lambs. ""Animals are fragile. Please do not touch,"" a sign warned visitors.\n\nIt took production designer Mark Friedberg\'s team four months to construct the interior ark set for Noah and much longer for special-effects gurus Industrial Light and Magic and Look Effects to create living, albeit digital, creatures that would walk, fly and slither, two by two, into the ark.\n\nYet those tasks were ultimately footnotes in the film\'s epic journey to the screen as Aronofsky and screenwriter Ari Handel laboured to expand a brief but revered story into a full-length movie, all without estranging their financial backers and the faithful, both of whom worried that Noah would be heretical.\n\nThe $US130 million ($140 million) production marks a departure not only for Aronofsky, whose previous films, including Black Swan and The Wrestler, were more modest undertakings but also for Hollywood itself, which in recent decades has exhibited negligible interest in overtly religious stories.\n\nIf Noah attracts a torrent of moviegoers, and early audience surveys here and abroad suggest it will, despite outrage from both Islamic states and the American Christian right, the film could bolster the prospects for the industry\'s unusually large religious slate, a roster that includes Heaven Is for Real, Exodus, Last Days in the Desert and Mary.\n\nBut first Aronofsky\'s movie has to prove its doubters wrong. ""Once people start seeing the film, believers and non-believers will all be able to have conversations about it that I believe will be interesting,"" Aronofsky said.\n\n""But you have to go into the film recognising that your expectations are going to be rattled.""\n\nNearly 15 years ago, as Aronofsky\'s experimental sci-fi story Pi was about to hit theatres, the filmmaker visited the Museum of Jurassic Technology in Culver City, California. Dedicated to the Earth\'s history, the fanciful and scientifically creative museum was displaying a small diorama based on Noah\'s ark.\n\nAronofsky easily could have walked past it but the exhibit caught his eye - and imagination.\n\n""It was a cool little sculpture,"" the 45-year-old Aronofsky recalled. ""And I said to myself \'It\'s strange that the biblical epic has been dead for 50 years\'. This was clearly a true genre with some of the biggest movies ever made. But at the time the Old Testament hadn\'t been touched in years.""\n\nSoon thereafter, he successfully pitched his flood idea to producer Lynda Obst but when a Jon Voight television miniseries called Noah\'s Ark came out - replete with an attack on the prophet from a Waterworld-like pirate ship - Aronofsky\'s Noah ran aground before he could even write it.\n\nBy 2003, after the filmmaker\'s Requiem for a Dream was completed, Aronofsky began working with screenwriter Handel (a college classmate and former neuroscientist) on a Noah script. But it was not until after the director\'s long-delayed The Fountain was released in 2006 that Aronofsky started taking the story around town.\n\nIt didn\'t start well. Noah briefly was set up at Universal but lost momentum when studio chief Stacey Snider departed and Universal\'s Evan Almighty, a $US175 million Steve Carell comedy set on an ark, bombed in 2007. When Aronofsky\'s Black Swan became a commercial hit with more than $US329 million in worldwide ticket sales and an Oscar win for actress Natalie Portman, Noah suddenly had fresh energy.\n\nIn early 2011 producer Arnon Milchan\'s Regency Enterprises agreed to share equally in financing the production with Paramount Pictures. Russell Crowe was cast as Noah, with Jennifer Connelly playing his wife Naameh, and Logan Lerman (Ham), Douglas Booth (Shem) and Leo McHugh Carroll (Japheth) as their sons.\n\nBut what story would the movie actually tell? From the start of his filmmaking career, Aronofsky had been drawn to obsessive, largely isolated people fighting forces both external and internal, demons real and imagined: Sean Gullette\'s tortured mathematician in Pi, Jared Leto\'s drug addict in Requiem for a Dream, Portman\'s mentally unstable ballerina in Black Swan and Mickey Rourke\'s past-his-prime athlete in The Wrestler.\n\nStory continues', ""It was easy to get lost on Darren Aronofsky's ark.\nBut first Aronofsky's movie has to prove its doubters wrong.\nBy 2003, after the filmmaker's Requiem for a Dream was completed, Aronofsky began working with screenwriter Handel (a college classmate and former neuroscientist) on a Noah script.\nWhen Aronofsky's Black Swan became a commercial hit with more than $US329 million in worldwide ticket sales and an Oscar win for actress Natalie Portman, Noah suddenly had fresh energy.\nRussell Crowe was cast as Noah, with Jennifer Connelly playing his wife Naameh, and Logan Lerman (Ham), Douglas Booth (Shem) and Leo McHugh Carroll (Japheth) as their sons.""]"

No cozy two-by-two images of beatific giraffes grace this “Noah.” Like any good artist, Aronofsky has avoided predictable, literalist retellings of beloved Sunday school stories, inserting new characters, bringing parenthetical figures to the fore and making one of history's most enduring and universal myths his very own.\n\nThe result is a movie that is clearly deeply respectful of its source material but also at times startlingly revisionist, a go-for-broke throwback to Hollywood biblical epics of yore that combines grandeur and grace, as well as a generous dollop of goofy overstatement. Aronofsky has made an ambitious, serious, even visionary motion picture.\n\nAppropriately enough, Aronofsky starts In the Beginning, and after a brief prologue revisiting Adam and Eve, original sin and the fatal rivalry between Cain and Abel, catches up with Noah as a boy who, by virtue of his lineage and an enchanted snakeskin bestowed on him by his father, is clearly destined for greater things. Conceived and staged like a conventional superhero origin story, “Noah” then finds the grown-up protagonist — played by a solemn, haunted-looking Russell Crowe — living in Canaan alongside his wife, Naameh (Jennifer Connelly), and their sons, Ham, Shem and eventually Japeth.\n\nFantastical sequences\n\nCanaan is a desolate world of arid deserts, ruthless tribal warfare and dead cities, but also supernatural wonders. When Noah begins to experience visions of the apocalyptic flood to come, Aronofsky choreographs them not as words-from-on-high messages from the divine, but as stylized, terrifying unconscious visions.\n\nFans of the filmmaker's work — from “Requiem for a Dream” and “The Fountain” to “Black Swan” — won't be surprised to learn that he's at his best with these fantastical, mystically inclined sequences. He's just as evocatively expressive with the most technically challenging set pieces of the story: the arduous construction of the enormous Ark (here produced according to Biblical proportions, down to the last cubit), the arrival of the animals and that annihilating flood, which Aronofsky stages as an awesome cascade of rainstorms, geysers and terrifying waves.\n\nAmidst such visual busyness, Crowe and Connelly deliver impressively grounded, powerful performances, with Crowe playing Noah first as a humble, divinely inspired servant and, eventually, as a wild-eyed zealot, and Connelly brimming with earthy rectitude as his far more steady-eyed wife. One of the most delightful reshufflings is a central role for Noah's ancient forebear, Methusela, played by Anthony Hopkins in a mischievous and altogether convincing turn as a white-haired figure of mystical, oracular wisdom.\n\nLike interpreters through the millennia, Aronofsky has taken Noah's journey sincerely to heart, processed it through his own singular visual and moral imagination and come up with a narrative that feels deeply personal, broadly mythical and cannily commercial all at the same time."", ""Old Testament fury has rarely come to such spectacularly fearsome life than in “Noah,” Darren Aronofsky's audacious adaptation of one of the Bible's best-known but still enigmatic chapters.\nAnyone familiar with the 500-year-old man and his ark may need to check some of their most cherished visualizations of him at the theater door.\nFantastical sequencesCanaan is a desolate world of arid deserts, ruthless tribal warfare and dead cities, but also supernatural wonders.\nWhen Noah begins to experience visions of the apocalyptic flood to come, Aronofsky choreographs them not as words-from-on-high messages from the divine, but as stylized, terrifying unconscious visions.\nAmidst such visual busyness, Crowe and Connelly deliver impressively grounded, powerful performances, with Crowe playing Noah first as a humble, divinely inspired servant and, eventually, as a wild-eyed zealot, and Connelly brimming with earthy rectitude as his far more steady-eyed wife.""]"

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nIn director Darren Aronofsky’s movie, out in U.S. and Canadian theaters on Friday, Watson plays Ila, the wife of Noah’s eldest son, Shem, who is played by Douglas Booth.\n\nThe film distributed by Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures stars Russell Crowe as the ark-building Noah and Jennifer Connelly as his wife, Naameh, in a dark, psychological reimagining of the Old Testament flood story.\n\nThree Arab countries have banned the Hollywood film on religious grounds even before its worldwide premiere and several others are expected to follow suit.\n\nOxfordshire, England-native Watson, 23, spoke to Reuters about how the “Harry Potter” films prepared her for the physically punishing role, the challenge of realistically portraying childbirth on screen and working with a cast of veteran actors.\n\nQ: “Noah” marks your return to large-scale spectacle films, do you approach your role any differently than you did while making the “Harry Potter” series?\n\nA: I remember being on set and Darren was saying, “Okay, the water is going to be cold, we’re probably going to be here for a full day, try and conserve your energy between takes, like keep warm and make sure you eat properly. This is going to be physically very demanding.” For a minute I felt very intimidated and then there’s something about having done those “Harry Potter” films and they were very physical. We did a lot of stuff in Scotland. It was freezing cold, filming at four in the morning, working crazy hours.\n\nIt’s kind of comforting in a way to know that in some senses, nothing will be as hard as that again, and I’m pretty prepared for most things people can throw at me, whether it be animals, water, stunts, CGI (computer-generated imagery), whatever it is. It was a very good school in a way and set me up very well for this kind of environment and this kind of pressure.\n\nQ: Did you do any reading on your character of Ila outside of the script?\n\nA: I actually didn’t do a lot of reading, but I did a lot a research because I become a mother in the story, and obviously have never given birth myself. That required quite a lot of careful thinking. Darren and I had this conversation where we both agreed that in so many films, women give birth and it looks like they’re barely breaking a sweat. We wanted it to feel very raw, very real and so I took it pretty seriously.\n\nQ: Did you talk to anybody about what it’s like to give birth?\n\nA: Any pregnant woman anywhere, I’d be like, “Can I talk to you? Can I talk to you about your experience?” I spoke to my own mother a lot, obviously, and then I watched a lot of YouTube videos of natural births, lots of documentaries, spoke to midwives, just any information I could get my hands on, really.\n\nQ: Ila is unable to conceive initially, but then is made fertile by a miracle. Was there anything in particular you tried to emphasize of her psyche?\n\nA: I guess just her self-doubt. ... Ila is barren, she can’t have children, and she doesn’t want to deprive her future husband of being able to have kids and to have a family. There’s this real wrestling match within her. She’s so in love with him and she kind of sacrifices her own happiness for his, and that struggle and self-doubt felt very relatable to me.\n\nQ: What attracted you to the role in the first place?\n\nA: I was a huge fan of Darren’s films. I loved “Requiem for a Dream.” “The Fountain” is one of my favorite movies of all-time, “The Wrestler,” “Black Swan.” So, you know, even before you read the script, you’re intrigued because his work speaks for itself, really.\n\nAnd then having read the script, I loved my role. She’s got such a huge heart. She’s very wise, very relatable, and then you hear about the cast, it’s like Russell Crowe and Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jennifer Connelly and Ray Winstone. And you realize that it’s the opportunity to work with people who really are at the top of their game.', 'LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - After spending a decade at the Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the “Harry Potter” film franchise, actress Emma Watson put her magical training to good use for her first big budget post-Potter role, in biblical action blockbuster “Noah.”Cast member Emma Watson attends the U.S. premiere of ""Noah"" in New York March 26, 2014.\nREUTERS/Andrew KellyIn director Darren Aronofsky’s movie, out in U.S. and Canadian theaters on Friday, Watson plays Ila, the wife of Noah’s eldest son, Shem, who is played by Douglas Booth.\nOxfordshire, England-native Watson, 23, spoke to Reuters about how the “Harry Potter” films prepared her for the physically punishing role, the challenge of realistically portraying childbirth on screen and working with a cast of veteran actors.\nQ: “Noah” marks your return to large-scale spectacle films, do you approach your role any differently than you did while making the “Harry Potter” series?\nThis is going to be physically very demanding.” For a minute I felt very intimidated and then there’s something about having done those “Harry Potter” films and they were very physical.']"

The message explains the film is only based on the story.\n\nEmma Watson plays Noah’s adopted daughter, and has decided to share her thoughts on faith, something she had to come to terms with before taking the role.\n\n“I already, before I did the movie, had a sense that I was someone that was more spiritual than specifically religious,” she explained to the U.K.’s Telegraph. “I had a sense that I believed in a higher power, but that I was more of a Universalist.

Even though Darren Aronofsky\'s 2006 fantasy ""The Fountain"" never gets the credit it deserves (after years in development, the film was a box office disappointment), its strong, spiritual overtones showed a side of the filmmaker that we\'d never seen before. Considering Aronofsky\'s previous release was 2010\'s brilliant, Polanski-esque thriller ""Black Swan"", it\'s not unreasonable to see parallels between the character of Noah and the director\'s own commitment to bringing such a massive, familiar story to the big screen. Given the recent popularity of so-called ""faith-based"" films, it\'ll be interesting to see if ""Noah"" can draw the kind of crowds films like it used to in the golden age of Hollywood. PG-13; 2 hr 18.\n\nSabotage: Arnold Schwarzenegger is slowly climbing his way back into making good movies. Both ""The Expendables"" and ""The Last Stand"" were beneath him, but last year\'s ""Escape Plan"" pairing with Sylvester Stallone was much better than anyone was expecting it to be. Under the supervision of ""End Of Watch"" director David Ayer, Schwarzenegger stars as the commander of a DEA task force whose members are being killed off one by one in what appears to be another in the long list of films influenced by Agatha Christie\'s ""And Then There Were None"" (one of the film\'s early titles, ""Ten"", may even have been a direct reference to ""Ten Little Indians"").

Released under Disney\'s Touchstone label due to its more mature (but not unsuitable) subject matter, ""The Wind Rises"" is a historic romance loosely based on the real-life story of Jiro Horikoshi, designer of Japanese fighter planes that were used in WWII. Miyazaki\'s stunning, hand-drawn visuals are just one of the many highlights to the emotionally gripping, epic-scale narrative that takes Jiro from daydreamer to world traveler in a short amount of time.

This is going to be physically very demanding."" For a minute I felt very intimidated and then there\'s something about having done those ""Harry Potter"" films and they were very physical. We did a lot of stuff in Scotland. It was freezing cold, filming at four in the morning, working crazy hours.\n\n\n\nDid you do any reading on your character of Ila outside of the script?\n\nEmma: I actually didn\'t do a lot of reading, but I did a lot a research because I become a mother in the story, and obviously have never given birth myself. That required quite a lot of careful thinking. Darren and I had this conversation where we both agreed that in so many films, women give birth and it looks like they\'re barely breaking a sweat. We wanted it to feel very raw, very real and so I took it pretty seriously.\n\n\n\nDid you talk to anybody about what it\'s like to give birth?\n\nEmma: Any pregnant woman anywhere, I\'d be like, ""Can I talk to you? Can I talk to you about your experience?"" I spoke to my own mother a lot, obviously, and then I watched a lot of YouTube videos of natural births, lots of documentaries, spoke to midwives, just any information I could get my hands on, really.\n\n\n\nIla is unable to conceive initially, but then is made fertile by a miracle. Was there anything in particular you tried to emphasize of her psyche?\n\nEmma: I guess just her self-doubt. ... Ila is barren, she can\'t have children, and she doesn\'t want to deprive her future husband of being able to have kids and to have a family. There\'s this real wrestling match within her. She\'s so in love with him and she kind of sacrifices her own happiness for his, and that struggle and self-doubt felt very relatable to me.

What was it like to have ""Noah"" put you back in big-budget territory?\n\nWatson: I think there\'s value in these bigger-scale projects because, obviously, they have this incredible scope. ... But then it\'s so lovely to work on a more intimate scale and do those kinds of films as well.\n\n\n\nAP: Did stepping into the world of ""Noah"" make you consider your own take on religion?\n\nWatson: I already had the sense that I was someone who was more spiritual than specifically religious. ... I\'m really interested in those things that are more far-reaching than culture, nationality, race, religion.\n\n\n\nAP: You\'ll get your degree in English lit from Brown in May.

This is going to be physically very demanding."" For a minute I felt very intimidated and then there\'s something about having done those ""Harry Potter"" films and they were very physical.

That required quite a lot of careful thinking. Darren and I had this conversation where we both agreed that in so many films, women give birth and it looks like they\'re barely breaking a sweat.

Was there anything in particular you tried to emphasize of her psyche?\n\n\n\nA: I guess just her self-doubt. ... Ila is barren, she can\'t have children, and she doesn\'t want to deprive her future husband of being able to have kids and to have a family. There\'s this real wrestling match within her. She\'s so in love with him and she kind of sacrifices her own happiness for his, and that struggle and self-doubt felt very relatable to me.\n\n\n\nQ: What attracted you to the role in the first place?\n\n\n\nA: I was a huge fan of Darren\'s films. I loved ""Requiem for a Dream."" ""The Fountain"" is one of my favourite movies of all-time, ""The Wrestler,"" ""Black Swan."" So, you know, even before you read the script, you\'re intrigued because his work speaks for itself, really.\n\n\n\nAnd then having read the script, I loved my role. She\'s got such a huge heart.

Charles Jenkins, Pastor at Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church, says “NOAH is a riveting blockbuster. Messages of righteousness, justice, mercy, sacrifice, honor, faithfulness, family, frustration, temptation, depravity, and grace shine through.” Rick Warren of Saddleback Church, on the other hand, blasted Aronofsky’s response to negative reception the film received during test screenings, citing his use of profanity directed toward “those who want Bible-based (entertainment).”\n\nAronofsky’s remarks identify exactly what type of movie Noah is intended to be. He referred to it as “the least biblical biblical movie ever made,” with the repetition suggesting that this is not just another Christian film doing its best to accurately retell a gospel story. As a director, Aronofsky has a history of creating artistic and interpretive films, including Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream, and Pi. Keeping in mind the director’s intentions for Noah, and remembering to avoid judgment of a movie prior to seeing it, there’s plenty to take away from this new blockbuster. Combining epic battle scenes comparable to Gladiator or Braveheart with biblical source material and a highly acclaimed director, Noah will certainly have its fans.

This is going to be physically very demanding.""For a minute I felt very intimidated and then there\'s something about having done those ""Harry Potter"" films and they were very physical. We did a lot of stuff in Scotland. It was freezing cold, filming at four in the morning, working crazy hours.It\'s kind of comforting in a way to know that in some senses, nothing will be as hard as that again, and I\'m pretty prepared for most things people can throw at me, whether it be animals, water, stunts, CGI (computer-generated imagery), whatever it is. It was a very good school in a way and set me up very well for this kind of environment and this kind of pressure.Q: Did you do any reading on your character of Ila outside of the script?A: I actually didn\'t do a lot of reading, but I did a lot a research because I become a mother in the story, and obviously have never given birth myself. That required quite a lot of careful thinking. Darren and I had this conversation where we both agreed that in so many films, women give birth and it looks like they\'re barely breaking a sweat. We wanted it to feel very raw, very real and so I took it pretty seriously.Q: Did you talk to anybody about what it\'s like to give birth?A: Any pregnant woman anywhere, I\'d be like, ""Can I talk to you? Can I talk to you about your experience?"" I spoke to my own mother a lot, obviously, and then I watched a lot of YouTube videos of natural births, lots of documentaries, spoke to midwives, just any information I could get my hands on, really.Q: Ila is unable to conceive initially, but then is made fertile by a miracle. Was there anything in particular you tried to emphasize of her psyche?A: I guess just her self-doubt. ... Ila is barren, she can\'t have children, and she doesn\'t want to deprive her future husband of being able to have kids and to have a family. There\'s this real wrestling match within her. She\'s so in love with him and she kind of sacrifices her own happiness for his, and that struggle and self-doubt felt very relatable to me.Q: What attracted you to the role in the first place?A: I was a huge fan of Darren\'s films. I loved ""Requiem for a Dream."" ""The Fountain"" is one of my favorite movies of all-time, ""The Wrestler,"" ""Black Swan."" So, you know, even before you read the script, you\'re intrigued because his work speaks for itself, really.And then having read the script, I loved my role. She\'s got such a huge heart.

""When you\'re doing Noah\'s ark, of course you\'re going to be dealing with animals - that\'s the whole story"", Aronofsky says. ""Immediately, it would be very questionable to start taking sentient creatures and sticking them on a set. It\'s kind of against the actual themes of the film.""\n\nThe director used CGI to tell the story of Noah\'s Ark instead [PETA]\n\nImmediately, it would be very questionable to start taking sentient creatures and sticking them on a set. It\'s kind of against the actual themes of the film Darren Aronofsky\n\nOne of the main reasons that Aronofsky chose to use computer-generated imagery instead of real-life creatures was because he had already experienced working with live primates on 2006 film \'The Fountain\', and he didn\'t enjoy it. ""I was pretty alarmed with the condition that they were being kept in"", he explains. The use of CGI also during post-production also saves an enormous amount of time and money, as he adds: ""You\'re gonna spend a lot more time on set dealing with a live animal.\n\nAronofsky believes that thanks to technology, there is no need to use real animals in films nowadays [PETA]\n\n""There\'s really no reason to do it anymore because the technology has arrived. You can pretty much bring anything to life."" As technology progresses – and as filmmakers learn about how animals suffer from deprivation and abuse in the entertainment industry – the use of digital effects to portray animals is certainly increasing.

After advance test screenings were shown, there were complaints from several Christian groups who believethat the film does not adhere strictly enough to the Old Testament verses.

So what we decided to do was to align Noah with that character arc and give Noah that understanding: He understands what man has done, he wants justice, and, over the course of the film, learns mercy. What’s nice about that is that is how I think Thomas Aquinas defined righteousness: a balance of justice and mercy.\n\nAri [Handel] and I always talked about it in terms of being a parent: If you are too just with a child you destroy them with strictness. If you’re too merciful you can spoil them. Finding that balance is what makes you a good parent. So that was an interesting character arc for us to see.\n\nMaybe what made Noah righteous was that he mirrored, in some sense, God’s own heart about what was happening.\n\nSure. That’s another way of looking at it. And we completely connected that. Because really, Noah just follows whatever God tells him to do. So that led us to believe that maybe they were aligned, emotionally, you know? And that paid off for us when you get to the end of the story and [Noah] gets drunk. That was a huge thing; they didn’t teach us that in CCD either, did they? What do we do with this? How do we connect this with this understanding? For me, it was obvious that it was connected to survivor’s guilt or some kind of guilt about doing something wrong.\n\nI mean, to get that drunk—and not just drunk, but it's the first mention of wine in the Bible, which is incredibly significant—but to get so drunk that you’re naked and have a falling out with your child and curse them. That, for some reason, was held onto. That’s part of the story that stayed in there for all time. That’s a huge clue to what this whole story is about.\n\nI know you and Ari spent a great deal of time doing research on the biblical texts for the film. Do I also remember reading somewhere that when you were younger you attended yeshiva for a time?\n\nOh, no. That’s an old thing in Wikipedia that’s not really true.\n\nI spent two days because it was a free room when I was in Israel [years ago] and somehow it got picked up that I was a yeshiva student. No. Far from it. I was a public-school kid in Brooklyn and I had a very, very basic Jewish education. It was more of a cultural thing than anything. Bagels and lox was my culture. But I’m more Brooklyn and New York than anything, in terms of who I am and what my identity is.\n\nSo when it comes to the biblical or theological study that you did for the film—\n\nI think it’s more interesting when you look at not just the biblical but the mythical that you get away from the arguments about history and accuracy and literalism. That’s a much weaker argument, and it’s a mistake.\n\nBecause when you think about Icarus, you don’t talk about the feathers and the wax and how the wax attached to his body and how is that physically possible that he could fly with feathers on his arms. No. You’re talking about how he flew too high and was filled with hubris and it destroyed him. That’s the message and that’s the power. That’s power to have that idea. But when you’re talking about a pre-diluvian world—a pre-flood world—where people are living for millennia and centuries, where there were no rainbows, where giants and angels walked on the planet, where the world was created in seven days, where people were naked and had no shame, you’re talking about a universe that is very, very different from what we understand. And to portray that as realistic is impossible. You have to enter the fantastical. The Leviathan in the sea. It’s a different understanding of the world, and that’s OK. That’s not dangerous."", 'And so it was so bad that He decides that He is going to destroy everything and destroy this creation.\nMaybe what made Noah righteous was that he mirrored, in some sense, God’s own heart about what was happening.\nAnd that paid off for us when you get to the end of the story and [Noah] gets drunk.\nYou’re talking about how he flew too high and was filled with hubris and it destroyed him.\nIt’s a different understanding of the world, and that’s OK.

The end is inevitable and, of course, not pretty.\n\nDirector Darren Aronofsky, best known for dark and unrelenting dramas such as the Oscar-nominated “Black Swan,” would have it no other way in the biblical epic “Noah,” which stars Russell Crowe and is set to be released in US and Canadian theaters, as well as several other countries, on Friday.\n\n“There’s something elemental about the water,” Aronofsky said. “Water has an incredible power to destroy and it also gives rebirth. It’s an amazing force. So, I’ve just always wondered why no one ever brought it to the big screen.”\n\nThe film distributed by Viacom Inc’s Paramount Pictures is the auteur director’s first big test of whether he can guide a big-budget spectacle to box office success.\n\nAnd the risk-taking Aronofsky, 45, is sure to unsettle some along the way as the film blends one of the best-known Old Testament tales with the trademark psychological torment to which he routinely submits protagonists.\n\n“We all have the Noah story inside of us since we were very young,” the director said, making the case for why his challenging film can have wide appeal. “It’s so deep, a part of not just Western culture, but everyone on the planet has heard of the Noah story. Even if it’s not part of your belief system, you have a flood story.”\n\nThe film also stars Jennifer Connelly as Noah’s wife, Naameh, Anthony Hopkins as Noah’s grandfather, Methuselah, and Emma Watson as Ila, the wife of Noah’s eldest son, Shem, who is portrayed by Douglas Booth.\n\nWhile faithful to the slim four chapters in the Bible, “Noah” also takes a detour into fantasy with the biblical Nephilim. Aronofsky explains the giant fallen angels made of rocks as a representation of a pre-flood Earth that was home to alternate possibilities of life.\n\n‘Wrestling with darkness’\n\nThe decision to include the fallen angels, called the “Watchers” in the film, is one of the reasons why “Noah” will be challenging, even for religious audiences, said Rebecca Cusey, an editor of the religious website Patheos.com and film critic.\n\n“This movie takes it more seriously than a lot of people who teach it in Sunday school. We have to admit that this story is really dark, and (it is) wrestling with the darkness and having different strains of theology.”\n\nParamount said “Noah” had a US$125 million (RM412 million) budget. The film is tracking to gross a respectable $41 million in its opening weekend domestically, according to Boxoffice.com.\n\nThe film also represents a string of bets Hollywood has made on Bible stories.\n\nStudio 20th Century Fox is set to release director Ridley Scott’s epic “Exodus” in time for Christmas, with Christian Bale as Moses. The studio also released “Son of God” last month, an adaptation of 2013’s successful “The Bible” TV miniseries.\n\nFor Anthony Hopkins, the revival of Biblical epics on the big screen speaks to the global economic and political upheaval since 2008 financial crisis.\n\n“Maybe it’s a resurgence of a desire for certainty in an uncertain world,” the Oscar-winning actor wondered, adding that biblical epics tend to give audiences hope in chaotic times.\n\nBut Bible stories also dovetail with the action films that make significant money for Hollywood studios, said Craig Detweiler, a professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.\n\nAfter all, “Noah” serves up plenty of action, special effects, blood and violence.\n\n“Perhaps Hollywood is reaching back to Old Testament stories because of the brawny nature of the conflicts,” said Detweiler, who has worked for studios as a consultant on religious topics.\n\n“It is the ultimate way to get teenage boys who otherwise would have no interest in this subject into one of our culture’s largest shaping stories,” he added. “It’s like a graphic novelisation of one of the most seminal texts in civilisation.” — Reuters"", ""Darren Aronofsky's film retelling of the story of Noah has faced panning from religious quarters, while getting somewhat decent reviews.\n“It’s so deep, a part of not just Western culture, but everyone on the planet has heard of the Noah story.\nWhile faithful to the slim four chapters in the Bible, “Noah” also takes a detour into fantasy with the biblical Nephilim.\nThe film is tracking to gross a respectable $41 million in its opening weekend domestically, according to Boxoffice.com.\nStudio 20th Century Fox is set to release director Ridley Scott’s epic “Exodus” in time for Christmas, with Christian Bale as Moses.""]"

Aronofsky “didn’t want traditional animals,” said visual effects supervisor Marc Chu. “This is not your father’s Noah story,” he added.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the PETA, Aronofsky explains that it would not make sense to make a film that is about saving animals, if they are being put in harm’s way on the film set. Aronofsky recalls his experience working with live primates in the making of, The Fountain. “I was pretty alarmed with the condition that they were being kept in,” he said.\n\n“When you’re doing Noah’s ark, of course you’re going to be dealing with animals—that’s the whole story,” Aronofsky said. “Immediately, it would be very questionable to start taking sentient creatures and sticking them on a set .… [I]t’s kind of against the actual themes of the film.” Ultimately, he concluded, “It’s undoubtedly a more realistic, truthful film … because we were able to create our own animal kingdom.”\n\nThanks to visionary directors like Aronofsky, and the use of advanced technology, the suffering of animals for film and television will soon be a thing of the past. Aronosky insists that adding digital animals in postproduction saves an enormous amount of time and money. “You’re gonna spend a lot more time on set dealing with a live animal,” he said. “There’s really no reason to do it anymore because the technology has arrived. … You can pretty much bring anything to life.”\n\nAccording to PETA, “[a]nimals used in film and television typically spend their lives in small cagesand are deprived of everything that is natural and important to them. Many are torn away from their mothers shortly after birth and subjected to abusive training methods, such as beatings, electric shocks, and food deprivation, to suppress their instinctive behavior. Once they grow old and are no longer useful to their trainers, they are usually cast off to seedy roadside zoos or other substandard facilities.”\n\nAlthough there are many reasons to see visionary filmmaker Aronofsky’s new film, Noah, such as its awe-inspiring visuals, epic story, and star-studded cast, which features Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson, and Anthony Hopkins, knowing that no animals were exploited, or harmed for the making of the film makes it all the more appealing.\n\nThe director’s decision has already earned him the inaugural Humane Filmmaker Award from activists at the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), who have officially given their support to the Noah film.\n\nCheck out Noah in theaters on March 28, and see the future of fimmaking!\n\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock"", 'Aronofsky “didn’t want traditional animals,” said visual effects supervisor Marc Chu.\nIn an exclusive interview with the PETA, Aronofsky explains that it would not make sense to make a film that is about saving animals, if they are being put in harm’s way on the film set.\nAronofsky recalls his experience working with live primates in the making of, The Fountain.\n“When you’re doing Noah’s ark, of course you’re going to be dealing with animals—that’s the whole story,” Aronofsky said.\nThe director’s decision has already earned him the inaugural Humane Filmmaker Award from activists at the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), who have officially given their support to the Noah film.']"

In addition, PETA US’ TV spot 98% Human – which uses cutting-edge technology to address the plight of great apes used for entertainment – won top honours in visual effects at the prestigious Cannes Lions festival, and the top ten advertising agencies in the US have signed PETA US’ Great Ape Pledge never to use live apes in their projects.\n\nThe editorial unit\n\nFor further information about animals in film and TV visit here.\n\nWatch Darren Aronofsky discuss CGI and animal safety in Noah here:', 'Darren Aronofsky reveals the secret to Noah’s realism in exclusive PETA US videoOscar-nominated director Darren Aronofsky points to digitally created animal characters as the future of filmmaking.\n“When you’re doing Noah’s ark, of course you’re going to be dealing with animals – that’s the whole story,” Aronofsky says.\nHe also points out that adding digital animals in post-production saves an enormous amount of time and money.\nAronofsky cites Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Avatar‘s successful use of digital imagery.\nWatch Darren Aronofsky discuss CGI and animal safety in Noah here:']"

Well your favourite actress, Emma Watson, is here to tell you how to look Bible on a budget thanks to the cheeky style tips she snagged whilst filming for Darren Aronofsky\'s latest epic, Noah.\n\n\n\nDuring The \'Noah\' Press Call, Emma Watson Revealed how She Honed Her Character\'s Bible Look.\n\nSpeaking at the recent press call for the movie, Emma made sure to answer the question on everyone\'s lips after seeing the English actress\' scenes in the film: how to get her look for less. ""[I was] a bit greasy, didn\'t shower too much,"" Watson revealed when MTV News asked her about her Noah look, in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the movie, Watson plays Ila, the wife of Noah\'s (Russell Crowe) firstborn son, Shem (Douglas Booth), who has to tick off surviving a supernatural deluge, battling armour-clad warriors and placating the wrath of the unseen Creator in addition to her usual list of subjugated biblical female chores. It may be surprising for some, but life for women back in 2500BC wasn\'t exactly The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills so Ila\'s personal styling would have had to reflect her daily toils.\n\nWatch The \'Noah\' Trailer:\n\n\n\nTo further her commitment to her character\'s bohemian festival vibe, Watson also revealed that she drank three month-old stagnant water, probably to develop an edgy cholera-contracted pallor. Apparently the director loved her dietary choice and told her ""use it for the scene"" when the 23 year-old actress complained of feeling a little too ill. We don\'t think Gwyneth Paltrow is stocking the water on GOOP yet but keep your eyes peeled for a new wave of stagnant brands hitting health shop shelves.\n\n""I actually had a bob at the time, and obviously that\'s not going to work for a biblical movie,"" Watson shared ""So we had to figure out how we were going to adapt that."" Working alongside American Hustle and Watchmen costume designer Michael Wilkinson and the film\'s makeup department, Watson went through multiple hairpieces to get her bob to work. But sadly, Watson\'s naturally sleek haircut wasn\'t meant to make it to film.\n\n\n\nThe Actress Revealed That Dreadlocks Were Key To Achieving Ila\'s Unwashed Look.\n\nLuckily someone had a brainwave and soon Emma was rocking a style that was both covetable and grotty. ""You could see that it didn\'t look very real because I had short hair,"" Watson continued. ""My hair and makeup artist was like, \'Why don\'t we just give you dreads?\'"" That lust-worthily grime-infested barnet you catch the Urban Outfitters models rocking next season?

Apparently that’s the hope. Judging by the way the world’s elite are flocking to Vatican City, you might think Pope Francis is sprinkling magic pixie dust, not holy water.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama will take his turn visiting the popular pontiff. Obama and an entourage of around 700 staffers, security folks and the White House traveling press corps, will descend on Rome for what may not be much more than a high-level photo op. While in Rome, the president will have a quick meet and greet with Italy’s ceremonial President Giorgio Napolitano, and he’s taking an exclusive private tour of the Coliseum. (Obama already met Italy’s new prime minister Matteo Renzi in The Netherlands at the Nuclear Security Summit earlier this week.)\n\nThe bilateral with the pope and whatever feel-good message comes out of it is the presumed purpose of Obama’s trip to Rome, which is part of a European tour. The two have a lot in common, not least of all the sheer number of magazine covers they have both graced, including Rolling Stone, Time, Forbes and The Advocate. They are also champions of social justice and have worked tirelessly for the poor, especially in their early careers.\n\nTheir differences, though, are far more striking, which makes their meeting tricky. Obama and Francis do not agree on a vast number of issues, including reproductive rights, gay marriage, women’s equality, or how best to help find peace in the world’s troubled regions. Pope Francis was able to draw hundreds of thousands to take part in a national day of peace for Syria last September, which was seen at the time as a direct response to threats by the United States to use force against Damascus. “May the noise of weapons cease!” Francis told the crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square. “War always marks the failure of peace, it is always a defeat for humanity.”\n\nBut with the pope enjoying an approval rating hovering around 88 percent in the United States, according to a CNN poll, it could prove well worth it for the president, whose own approval rating is just half that, at 44 percent according to the most recent Gallup poll, especially if Francis Fever is contagious.\n\n“It is just a photo op,” warns Jon O’Brien of Catholics for Choice, “first and foremost for a president who has been sagging in his popularity standing with someone who is as immensely popular with Catholics and non-Catholics around the world.”\n\nObama is not alone in making his pilgrimage to Rome. Since taking over the helm of the Holy See in March 2013, the pope has had a steady string of high-level Vatican-bound visitors. Vladimir Putin paid a call last November, during which he invited Francis to visit Russia. The two met for 30 minutes and reportedly discussed what Russia might do to help stem the bloodbath in Syria, then posed for photos. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a similar social call in early December, presenting the pope with the curious gift of his father’s history book on the Spanish Inquisition, again in front of the cameras. His visit also included a reciprocal invitation that the pope plans to follow up on in late May.\n\nThe Queen of England is scheduled to visit Francis next week in what will also be a highly anticipated grand opportunity for the Vatican photo pool.\n\nFrancis is, of course, the recipient of a dizzying number of invitations. U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner invited him to address Congress, which is predictable. But then there’s the mayor of Green Bay who is so serious about luring Francis to Wisconsin that he has created a website with an online petition dedicated to the cause.\n\nAccording to the Vatican press office, the pope hosts prime ministers, diplomats and special guests in private audiences several times a week. His predecessors kept a busy schedule, too, but requests for time with Francis are so numerous the Vatican has added additional staff to accommodate all the correspondence, which includes thousands of letters and post cards the pope receives every day.\n\nThe fan mail increased drastically when Francis started picking up the phone to call several people who sent him their numbers last summer. His weekly Wednesday audiences and Sunday blessings have drawn massive crowds of pilgrims and celebrities alike. Russell Crowe even attended his Wednesday audience last week, hoping to get the pontiff to endorse his biblical movie “Noah.”\n\nAlas for Crowe, no papal endorsement and no pixie dust came his way, but a whole lot of publicity did, and in Hollywood that’s benediction enough.', 'Judging by the way the world’s elite are flocking to Vatican City, you might think Pope Francis is sprinkling magic pixie dust, not holy water.\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama will take his turn visiting the popular pontiff.\n(Obama already met Italy’s new prime minister Matteo Renzi in The Netherlands at the Nuclear Security Summit earlier this week.)\nThe Queen of England is scheduled to visit Francis next week in what will also be a highly anticipated grand opportunity for the Vatican photo pool.\nAccording to the Vatican press office, the pope hosts prime ministers, diplomats and special guests in private audiences several times a week.']"

However some insiders indicated that a potential $40 million could happen while Paramount downplayed all expectations and said it expected a subpar $27.5 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film cost $130 million to produce but has become one of the hardest films to measure due to the controversy it has generated with Christian audiences which is one of their target markets.

The controversy generated a lot of buzz even though it was not completely true.\n\nThe last time a biblical adapted film caused so much controversy was in 2004 when Mel Gibson\'s ""Passion of the Christ"" was called anti-Semitic. The result was a record breaking box office. The film scored the highest opening for a rate R film and ended up making $370 million domestically. In total it made $611 million worldwide. The movie also ended up being nominated for three Academy Awards.\n\n""Noah"" has garnered positive reviews.

Aronofsky explains the giant fallen angels made of rocks as a representation of a pre-flood Earth that was home to alternate possibilities of life.\n\n‘WRESTLING WITH DARKNESS’\n\nThe decision to include the fallen angels, called the “Watchers” in the film, is one of the reasons why “Noah” will be challenging, even for religious audiences, said Rebecca Cusey, an editor of the religious website Patheos.com and film critic.\n\n“This movie takes it more seriously than a lot of people who teach it in Sunday school. We have to admit that this story is really dark, and (it is) wrestling with the darkness and having different strains of theology.”\n\nParamount said “Noah” had a $125 million budget.

Jewish moviegoers might also find it irksome that Aronofsky and his team of designers probably got the shape of the ark wrong. Irving Finkel’s “The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of the Flood” was published too late for the filmmakers to revise their design.\n\nFinkel, assistant keeper of ancient Mesopotamian script, languages and cultures in the department of Middle East at the British Museum, makes a convincing argument that the ark was likely circular, rather than the shape traditionally represented in centuries of religious art. A 3,700-year-old clay tablet made available for study only in 2009, and now known as the Ark Tablet, details instructions for building an ark from reeds and bitumen (a waterproof tar or petroleum found in natural deposits), as part of a Mesopotamian flood narrative.\n\nOther elements of this Mesopotamian tale were reproduced a millennium later in the Genesis story of Noah, which is usually dated to between 597 and 538 B.C.E., during the Babylonian exile, when Jews from the ancient Kingdom of Judah were captive in Babylonia. These include descriptions of animals entering the ark two by two, using a dove as a sign that waters had subsided, and other familiar themes that closely relate the two narratives. In the earlier version, the ark is unlike the traditional pointed ships shown in Western art or indeed the rectangular, flat-bottomed vessel in Aronofsky’s movie.\n\nThe Ark Tablet describes the god Enki declaring: “Pay heed to my advice, that you may live forever! Destroy your house, build a boat; despise possessions/ And save life! Draw out the boat that you will build with a circular design.” Instructions are given to build the ark so that it is 220 feet wide and 20 feet high, in the shape of a coracle, a round boat familiar in Iraq, where the Ark Tablet originates. Since the main goal of the ark was keeping afloat and not going anywhere, much of the usual ship-like design would have been superfluous.\n\nFinkel arrived at this remarkable conclusion despite the fact that as a Jew, he was not allowed to visit Iraq for research when he began studying Sumerian languages in the late 1960s. As he told the interviewer Elliot Jager in 2010: “I’m afraid that ‘Finkel’ is too Jewish a name. Under Saddam Hussein and even before, visitors had to prove they were not Jewish in order to visit.”\n\nBorn in 1951, Finkel sports a snowy white beard and mane of hair that recalls one of the wizardly instructors of Harry Potter. Although Finkel has produced standard scholarly volumes such as “The Cyrus Cylinder: The King of Persia’s Proclamation from Ancient Babylon” and “The Hero King Gilgamesh”, his work and approach also have a ludic, conjuring aspect. He earned a doctorate in Assyriology in the UK from the University of Birmingham with a dissertation on Babylonian exorcistic spells against demons. Finkel studied for three years as a research fellow at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, and also played electric bass guitar in a blues band. In Chicago, Finkel studied with such innovative, reputedly omniscient Jewish Assyriologists as Benno Landsberger and A. Leo Oppenheim, the latter editor-in-charge of the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute.\n\nWhat could have attracted a nice Jewish boy from London to the abstruse field of cuneiform script? Boyhood Hebrew lessons gave Finkel a fascination for ancient writing, but some more fundamental predilections were at work, too. Finkel clearly kvells over the advice found in Babylonian wisdom literature, some of which he cites in “The Ark Before Noah.”\n\nHe also finds wry humor in the fact that unlike the Old Testament, where the flood is God’s moral punishment against sinning humanity, in Babylonian tradition the waters are sent to destroy life because mankind has become cacophonous, or as one ancient god put it: “The noise of mankind has become too intense for me,/ With their uproar I am deprived of sleep.”\n\n“To our minds, noise abatement as justification for the total annihilation of life looks a bit over the top,” Finkel writes. Such light-hearted, whimsical observations should not surprise us. After all, Finkel is a world authority on the history of play, as author of “Ancient Board Games in Perspective”; he has also written young adult novels in the romantic fantasy vein. These include “The Princess Who Wouldn’t Come Home,” featuring a heroine who runs off to London to live with a starving artist in an attic. Finkel’s “Swizzle de Brax and the Blungaphone” is about an old man and his grandson who design new musical instruments, and “The Last Resort Library” posits the existence of a physical place to house the vast numbers of authors’ rejected manuscripts.\n\nYet Finkel’s ultimate conclusions about the ark are not whimsical or ironic in the least. He suggests that the Bible was compiled during the Babylonian exile as a way for Jews to preserve traditions. Putting a “unique Judaean twist” on already extant Babylonian tales such as that of the flood, Jews in captivity were energetic and resourceful, not merely sitting by the waters of Babylon and weeping as Psalm 137 depicted. Jews created the Bible, as Finkel points out, stressing the bright side: “It can be argued that the Babylonian exile, far from being the disaster it is usually judged, was ultimately the process that forged what became modern Judaism.” As Finkel told Jager: “The Judeans behaved in the way we would have expected them to behave, based on what we know about how Jews in New York or London behaved upon their arrival millennia later.”\n\nBenjamin Ivry writes frequently about the arts for the Forward.', '● The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of the FloodBy Irving FinkelDoubleday, 432 pages, $30Darren Aronofsky’s $130 million Hollywood epic “Noah” starring Russell Crowe has displeased Christian fundamentalists with its non-literal approach to the Old Testament story.\nJewish moviegoers might also find it irksome that Aronofsky and his team of designers probably got the shape of the ark wrong.\nIrving Finkel’s “The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of the Flood” was published too late for the filmmakers to revise their design.\nA 3,700-year-old clay tablet made available for study only in 2009, and now known as the Ark Tablet, details instructions for building an ark from reeds and bitumen (a waterproof tar or petroleum found in natural deposits), as part of a Mesopotamian flood narrative.\nThe Ark Tablet describes the god Enki declaring: “Pay heed to my advice, that you may live forever!']"

The end is inevitable and, of course, not pretty.\n\nDirector Darren Aronofsky, best known for dark and unrelenting dramas such as the Oscar-nominated ""Black Swan,"" would have it no other way in the biblical epic ""Noah,"" which stars Russell Crowe and is set to be released in US and Canadian theatres, as well as several other countries, on Friday.\n\n""There\'s something elemental about the water,"" Aronofsky said. ""Water has an incredible power to destroy and it also gives rebirth. It\'s an amazing force. So, I\'ve just always wondered why no one ever brought it to the big screen.""\n\nThe film distributed by Viacom Inc\'s Paramount Pictures is the auteur director\'s first big test of whether he can guide a big-budget spectacle to box office success.\n\nAnd the risk-taking Aronofsky, 45, is sure to unsettle some along the way as the film blends one of the best-known Old Testament tales with the trademark psychological torment to which he routinely submits protagonists.\n\n""We all have the Noah story inside of us since we were very young,"" the director said, making the case for why his challenging film can have wide appeal. ""It\'s so deep, a part of not just Western culture, but everyone on the planet has heard of the Noah story. Even if it\'s not part of your belief system, you have a flood story.""\n\nThe film also stars Jennifer Connolly as Noah\'s wife, Naameh, Anthony Hopkins as Noah\'s grandfather, Methuselah, and Emma Watson as Ila, the wife of Noah\'s eldest son, Shem, who is portrayed by Douglas Booth.\n\nWhile faithful to the slim four chapters in the Bible, ""Noah"" also takes a detour into fantasy with the biblical Nephilim. Aronofsky explains the giant fallen angels made of rocks as a representation of a pre-flood Earth that was home to alternate possibilities of life.\n\nThe decision to include the fallen angels, called the ""Watchers"" in the film, is one of the reasons why ""Noah"" will be challenging, even for religious audiences, said Rebecca Cusey, an editor of the religious website Patheos.com and film critic.\n\n""This movie takes it more seriously than a lot of people who teach it in Sunday school. We have to admit that this story is really dark, and (it is) wrestling with the darkness and having different strains of theology.""\n\nParamount said ""Noah"" had a $125 million budget. The film is tracking to gross a respectable $41 million in its opening weekend domestically, according to Boxoffice.com.\n\nThe film also represents a string of bets Hollywood has made on Bible stories.\n\nStudio 20th Century Fox is set to release director Ridley Scott\'s epic ""Exodus"" in time for Christmas, with Christian Bale as Moses. The studio also released ""Son of God"" last month, an adaptation of 2013\'s successful ""The Bible"" TV miniseries.\n\nFor Anthony Hopkins, the revival of Biblical epics on the big screen speaks to the global economic and political upheaval since 2008 financial crisis.\n\n""Maybe it\'s a resurgence of a desire for certainty in an uncertain world,"" the Oscar-winning actor wondered, adding that biblical epics tend to give audiences hope in chaotic times.\n\nBut Bible stories also dovetail with the action films that make significant money for Hollywood studios, said Craig Detweiler, a professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.\n\nAfter all, ""Noah"" serves up plenty of action, special effects, blood and violence.\n\n""Perhaps Hollywood is reaching back to Old Testament stories because of the brawny nature of the conflicts,"" said Detweiler, who has worked for studios as a consultant on religious topics.\n\n""It is the ultimate way to get teenage boys who otherwise would have no interest in this subject into one of our culture\'s largest shaping stories,"" he added.

Countless headlines have featured ""Noah"" in the months leading up to its premiere as Christian leaders continue to speculate on how closely the $150 million film will adhere to the Bible, and in turn, Christians everywhere are taking a close look at the Biblical epic.\n\nThe Biblical story of Noah occupies just five chapters of the Book of Genesis. Consequently, Aronofsky and a team of artists had their work cut out for them while making Paramount\'s two-and-a-half-hour movie, and CP heard firsthand just what that work entailed on the set.\n\nIn October of 2012, I was invited to Brooklyn\'s Marcy Avenue Armory where I toured the massive rectangular ""ark"" that would appear in ""Noah"" on the big screen over 16 months later. Along my visit, I was introduced to not only Aronofsky, but his ""Noah"" co-writer Ari Handel, producers, theologians, and even the film\'s star, Russell Crowe.\n\nAronofsky, who has helmed the likes of ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan,"" took an early interest in Noah. In fact, the Oscar-nominated director earned his very first writing accolade in adolescence with a story, ""The Dove,"" about Noah. Aronofsky went on to tell CP that his upcoming rendering of the flood-predicting prophet was inspired by that same childhood passion, which was evident in every minute detail aboard the ark on set.\n\nAt first sight, I was taken aback by the sheer size of the ark structure, which was made from wood, steel and foam. Aronofsky explained that he wanted to stay as true as possible to original measurements in cubits as described in the Bible in an effort that translated into a structure 50 feet tall and 500 feet long.\n\nOnce I had entered the ark and adjusted to the dim lighting, I noticed the rows and rows of artificial animals used on the intricate set. The director recounted that in Genesis, three levels of decks were described within Noah\'s ark- the first for mammals, the second level for insects and reptiles, and the third for birds. In order to keep production costs low, Aronofsky recruited artists to recreate artificial animals on the set.\n\nAmazingly, artists were able to fashion life-like animals from items ranging from faux fur on lions to Rice Krispies intended to look like beetles. Plastic snakes and even toys were also used on set, all later brought to life with CGI in ""Noah.""\n\nWatch a video taken from behind-the-scenes of ""Noah"" here.\n\nAronofsky\'s ""Noah"" may be his most talked about film yet as it continues to make headlines ahead of the premiere on Friday, March 28.

49109,http://screencrush.com/noah-review/,entertainment,"['The story of Noah as it is written in the King James Bible is about three pages. If you want to Google it, read it, then come back to this you can go ahead. I\'ll wait here as I continue to stream some of Clint Mansell\'s spooky and enthralling score to the new Darren Aronofsky film starring Russell Crowe.\n\nBack? Yeah, so, not a whole heck of a lot there. But did you catch the tiny references to things you may not recall from Sunday School? The “giants in the Earth” and the “flaming sword”? These are the pools from which Aronofsky irrigates his \'Noah.\' This is, to adopt a phrase, the “old, weird Bible,” and its visual language more resembles \'Lord of the Rings\' than any typical sandal epic.\n\nAfter a patchy and surprisingly cheap-looking prologue that recaps the Creation story, the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, and the sibling rivalry between Cain and Abel, we meet Noah, the last descendent of Seth, one of Adam and Eve\'s kids who never quite had the same PR as the others. He\'s the true heir to Adam and the goodness and light that was bestowed to him in the Garden, made evident because he keeps a few glowing totems. The rest of the world is made up of Cain\'s descendents – they are violent, brutal warriors who have built decaying cities, while Noah has chosen to live among the rocks. Though Noah and his family are harassed by these savage jerks, they still live a peaceful life that seems pretty simpatico with nature.\n\nNoah is perturbed by dreams so he and his family trek to visit Methuselah, who is something of a warlock with potions and powers. While Noah is stoned out of his gourd, he intuits what The Creator wants him to do; he is to build an ark, and into it a male and female of every beast, fowl and creeper shall go. And then ... aw, man, it is going to rain. The world has gone evil and it\'s getting a reboot.\n\nSoon he and his family are cutting logs, but not without some help. The Watchers – the giants mentioned in Genesis – who resemble LOTR\'s Ents but made from rock, are clutch players. They don\'t just uproot trees with one yank, they act as muscle when Ray Winstone (the King of Men and descendent of Cain) comes to make trouble.\n\nThe bulk of \'Noah\' is a struggle between bearded Russell Crowe and his family (wife played by Jennifer Connelly, sons played by Douglas Booth and Logan Lerman, and daughter-in-law Emma Watson) to reconcile with his radical vision. For a while, they are ready to play along with his interpretation of The Creator\'s messages. Even when it means letting the rest of humanity weep and wail and beg for entry on the ark. After the clouds burst, however, that\'s when things get weird ... well, weirder than rock monsters bashing the heads of people trying to save themselves from drowning as the hero of this movie stands on his boat with his arms crossed.\n\nNoah becomes a crazed zealot, determined to usher the world\'s return to its initial purity. He has seen the evil that exists in all men (and he\'s seen it in a genuinely terrifying sequence of human savagery), and he is determined to let Adam\'s line die out once his small family has survived the flood and fulfilled the task of bringing the animals to their new garden. The story momentum leads to us rooting, in a way, for Noah to stab a newborn baby with an enormous dagger as Hermoine Granger shudders in terror.\n\nThis will no doubt ruffle the feathers of the faithful, but Aronofsky is taking liberties from the very first frame of the film. (And, as mentioned, with a three-page text, he\'s going to need something to pad this out to feature length.) “In the beginning there was nothing,” read the first words of the prologue, already a key deviation from Scripture. The word ""God"" is never uttered – it is always ""The Creator."" And, in a centerpiece montage that may be one of Aronofsky\'s finest individual sequences, there is a representation of the opening chapters of Genesis that conform both to Creationist and modern Cosmologist points of view.\n\n\'Noah\' is swimming in ambiguity, right down to whether or not our title character is a good person. A key moment of the film can be interpreted, if one chooses to see it that way, as a refutation of fundamentalism straight out of \'Monty Python\'s Life of Brian,\' or it could be seen as promoting the value of taking a leap of faith. One thing that Aronofsky doesn\'t shy away from is the coldness of the Old Testament, its high stakes and Big Ideas. Emma Watson\'s character, for one, is unable to bear children until Methuselah casts a spell on her, at which point she is so overcome by the workings of nature that she is driven to lust like a mad sex machine. Is this what we expect from a religious film? No. Is this, and all the other instances of brute action, an accurate depiction of early man? Well, maybe.\n\nIn addition to the “evolution montage” and rock monster battles, there are other aspects of \'Noah\' that differentiate it from Bible movie expectations. I have no idea what was going on with the costumes. At one point Crowe was wearing what looked like a Henley from J. Crew. This film\'s inscrutable oddness -- and the willingness to take chances -- brought me to a place that could not have predicted. During the film\'s third act I had no idea how this movie was going to end. Seriously. Even more exciting, once the credits rolled, I had to spend some time to work out how I felt. In fact, I\'m still thinking about it.\n\n\'Noah\' opens in theaters on Friday, March 28.\n\nJordan Hoffman is a writer, critic and lapsed filmmaker living in New York City.

The studio found themselves criticized by some Christians who were upset that Aronofsky was taking liberties with the classic tale. Eventually, they compromised with one group by adding a disclaimer to the marketing explaining that “artistic license has been taken.”\n\nBut those detractors didn’t speak for all religious folks.

Described as “Twilight-esque”\n\nAccording to one CinemaCon YouTube review, the “Fifty Shades” film is bound to be a commercial success. “The women are going to go out in droves,” said ZBoneMan.com reporter Adam Mast, describing the footage as “slick.” “I don’t want to use the words \'sappy\' and \'cheesy.\' It looked like ‘Twilight’ with S&M in it."" “It’s not going to be a good movie, but it’s going to do very well,” reporter Sheldon Demke said.\n\n2. Fan Favorite quotes are used the script\n\nThe footage reportedly included several of the iconic quotes from the 2011 best-selling novel. “Mr. Grey will see you now,” which will be the tagline for the movie’s first official poster, was one of the first lines spoken in the sneak peek. The fan-favorite line was reportedly uttered in a scene in which characters Christian Grey (actor Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) first meet at Grey Enterprises. Other notable quotes in the script include Grey uttering the phrases, “Hearts and flowers are not who I am,” “My tastes are very singular,” and at one point telling Anastasia, ""It\'s you that\'s changing me.""\n\n3. Clips don\'t cross over into X-rated territory\n\nDespite speculation that the film could be released in both R-rated and X-rated versions, those in attendance say the feature comes across as more heartfelt than smutty despite reports of a few flashes of skin. “The film looks to be more romantic than sexual,” reads a report from the Hollywood Reporter. “There was a brief glimpse of Johnson wearing a black blindfold in a red room, but most of the focus was on the couple’s courting.”\n\n4. Jamie and Dakota are winners\n\nWhen prompted to discuss actors Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan’s performance in the upcoming film, Langley had nothing but kind remarks to share about the film’s leads. According to a report from The Wrap, Langley referred to the on-screen duo\'s performance as “brave” and “bold,” going as far as to call them “the next iconic screen romance.”\n\nOthers at the screening appear to agree with Langley\'s review. One Yahoo Movies report has since labeled Johnson’s performance in the teaser as “perfectly natural,"" and it referred to Dornan’s studly performance as “simmering.”\n\n5. Notable cameos\n\nWhile multiple reports indicate that Christian Grey’s “red room of pain” never actually makes an appearance in the extended trailer (undoubtedly a disappointment for some of the most devout ""Fifty Shades"" fans), his beloved helicopter, Charlie Tango, does make a cameo. Ana Steele’s best friend and roommate Kate Kavanagh (played by Eloise Mumford) also reportedly appears in the teaser, uttering a few short lines.', 'While the trailer isn’t available for the general public to view to yet, here are five details we know about the secretive “Fifty Shades of Grey” extended trailer:1.\nDescribed as “Twilight-esque”According to one CinemaCon YouTube review, the “Fifty Shades” film is bound to be a commercial success.\n“It’s not going to be a good movie, but it’s going to do very well,” reporter Sheldon Demke said.\nFan Favorite quotes are used the scriptThe footage reportedly included several of the iconic quotes from the 2011 best-selling novel.\nAna Steele’s best friend and roommate Kate Kavanagh (played by Eloise Mumford) also reportedly appears in the teaser, uttering a few short lines.']"

But verdicts on the first footage from Sam Taylor-Johnson\'s take on EL James\' Fifty Shades of Grey suggest the film version of the S&M-flavoured novel may in fact be rather tame.\n\nStudio Universal screened scenes for journalists and cinema owners at the annual CinemaCon event in Las Vegas yesterday, with reports suggesting there could be little in the way of erotic tension on show when the movie hits cinemas next year. Stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who play kinky billionaire Christian Grey and his willing, well-remunerated ""sex-slave"" Anastasia Steele, were mostly seen ""making moon-eyes at each other"", suggested attendees.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter labelled the footage ""more romantic than sexual"", adding: ""There was a brief glimpse of Johnson wearing a black blindfold in a red room, but most of the focus was on the couple\'s courting.""\n\nVariety said the film ""looked like a love story, not the sadomasochistic relationship portrayed in EL James\' first book in the bestselling trilogy"". Its correspondent wrote: ""The now well-known elevator exchange between Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) made it into the first look, as did lot of PG kissing and a sneak peek into the red room, but audience members seated around this reporter expressed a similar sentiment – Universal played it safe.""\n\nThe Wrap called the scenes ""surprisingly tame"", and said romance was the ""over-arching theme"". It added: ""There was a glimpse of a whip, a fleeting look at Johnson wearing a mask, and a confession by Dornan as Grey that \'my tastes are very singular\'. [But] the rest of the footage primarily consisted of the two attractive actors making moon-eyes at each other, in between helicopter rides and job interviews.""\n\nFifty Shades of Grey is expected to be the first of a trilogy based on British author EL James\' three bestselling novels. Artist turned film-maker Taylor-Johnson, whose only feature to date is the acclaimed 2009 John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy, was hired to direct in June last year. She reportedly beat out luminaries of the calibre of Joe Wright, Bennett Miller and Gus van Sant.\n\nThe film was delayed in October when Charlie Hunnam suddenly left the role of Grey amid rumours that the Sons of Anarchy and Pacific Rim star had been spooked by overwhelming fan attention.

The first footage of “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which studio chair Donna Langley said would be the “next iconic screen romance,” looked like a love story, not the sadomasochistic relationship portrayed in E.L. James’ first book in the bestselling trilogy.\n\nThe now well-known elevator exchange between Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) made it into the first look, as did lot of PG kissing and a sneak peek into the red room, but audience members seated around this reporter expressed a similar sentiment – Universal played it safe.\n\n“The questions I am asked the most is how do you make the ‘Fifty Shades’ movie, and the answer is very carefully,” said Langley.\n\nUnlike Monday night’s Paramount presentation, Universal packed its time with trailers and extended previews into franchises including “Despicable Me” and “Fast and Furious,” along with teasers for “Jurassic Park,” “Dumb and Dumber To” and “Lucy,” the Scarlett Johansson pic that posits her as the ultimate femme fatale.\n\nAngelina Jolie, dressed in head-to-toe white, came onstage introduce the footage and tell the story of “Unbroken.” Langley introduced Jolie saying, she “earned the right to direct it.”\n\nThe story follows Louis Zamperini, a juvenile delinquent-cum-Olympic runner-turned-Army hero. According to Langley, the studio first bought the rights to the story in 1957, and it was going to be developed for Tony Curtis.\n\nIt languished for years and experienced “a number of false starts” said Langley. The 2010 bestseller “Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption” by Laura Hillenbrand reinvigorated the project and attracted Jolie.\n\n“I made this film because in the end is a message we need more than ever,” said Jolie, “it is the journey of a man finding his way through the darkness and into the light…[it puts us] face to face with darkness and tells us to never ever give up.”\n\nPHOTOS: CinemaCon Highlights: Angelina Jolie, The Rock, Mark Wahlberg\n\nThere were trailers for “Neighbors,” the Seth Rogen and Zac Efron raunchy comedy as well as Jason Blum’s “The Purge: Anarchy,” and Seth MacFarlane’s “A Million Ways to Die in the West.” That featurette delved into the relationship between MacFarlane’s character and Charlize Theron – a gunslinging woman of the West with a fiery sense of humor.\n\n“Hits don’t come just at summer and Christmas,” Langley said, adding “the year has 52 weekends … and we want to create a habit of moviegoing” year-round.\n\nThe extended look at “Fast and Furious 7” had plenty of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, not to mention cars skydiving out of planes and the usual scantily-clad women and party scenes. Jason Statham and Kurt Russell are shaping up to be the film’s resident bad guys, and Michelle Rodriguez seems to have retained her memory from the last film.\n\n“The only gambling I really like to do is picking release dates,” said Uni’s president of distribution Nikki Rocco, who in addition to NBC Uni’s vice chairman Ron Meyer and Langley mentioned newly-crowned studio topper Jeff Shell, who has yet to do a press interview.\n\n“He’s a smart, savvy student of our business,” said Rocco of Shell, who was in the audience.\n\nRelated stories\n\n'Fast & Furious 7′s' Lucas Black Joins NCIS Spinoff\n\nPaul Walker Death: Investigators Rule Out Drag Racing in Crash"", ""LAS VEGAS — Universal saved the most anticipated for last in its CinemaCon presentation Tuesday morning.\n“The questions I am asked the most is how do you make the ‘Fifty Shades’ movie, and the answer is very carefully,” said Langley.\nAngelina Jolie, dressed in head-to-toe white, came onstage introduce the footage and tell the story of “Unbroken.” Langley introduced Jolie saying, she “earned the right to direct it.”The story follows Louis Zamperini, a juvenile delinquent-cum-Olympic runner-turned-Army hero.\nAccording to Langley, the studio first bought the rights to the story in 1957, and it was going to be developed for Tony Curtis.\nRelated stories'Fast & Furious 7′s' Lucas Black Joins NCIS SpinoffPaul Walker Death: Investigators Rule Out Drag Racing in Crash""]"

""We should use the full calendar to create opportunities for films to find an audience and create a habit of movie-going that isn\'t seasonal, but year-round.""Here\'s a look at three of the studio\'s most promising films, from a racy love story to the return of a few beloved ensemble casts:Fifty Shades of Grey, directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson and starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. The first look at the trailer for the spicy romance based on E.L. James\' best-seller revealed a tale that appears far sweeter than it is steamy. The suave Christian Grey (Dornan) sweeps the ordinary-looking Anastasia Steele (Johnson) off her feet with a joyride in his helicopter, a visit to his swanky Seattle apartment, and a fancy make-over. Anastasia properly transforms from plain Jane to sexy sophisticate. ""Why are you trying to change me?"" she asks her new lover. ""I\'m not,"" he replies. ""It\'s you who is changing me."" But it\'s not all sentimental. The camera pans over Christian\'s collection of S&M toys as Beyonce\'s sleek and sexy Haunted plays in the background. The film is set for release on Valentine\'s Day of 2015.Fast & Furious 7, directed by James Wan and starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson. We may not have a hard and fast answer for how the studio will finish the film since Walker died before production concluded, but those scenes he was able to shoot definitely find their way into the seventh installment of the franchise. In the trailer, Walker, along with his crew of fierce drivers, stun viewers with a stunt involving driving cars out of a helicopter and safely landing with the help of parachutes. Flashy fight scenes and plenty of bare skin are once again on display. The seventh installment is scheduled to hit theaters on April 10, 2015.Vin Diesel posted this last scene shot with Paul Walker earlier this year.Dumb and Dumber To, directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly and starring Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. The anticipated sequel finds Harry (Daniels) visiting Lloyd (Carrey) in a home where he\'s been faking helpless for 20 years as a gag. The pair then searches for the daughter Harry never knew he had. There\'s a cringe-worthy bit with a catheter, an inappropriate instant with an old lady, we visit their same crappy apartment, the dog truck is back, and Kathleen Turner plays Harry\'s baby mama. Queue a very satisfying phew! The comedy is scheduled for release Nov. 14.(Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in a scene from Dumb and Dumber To.

The three books held the top three spots on \u200bbest sellers lists for much of their debut year and have inspired parodies and knock-offs.

Here is a brief summary to help you understand what everyone is talking about.\n\n""Fifty Shades"" Conceived as ""Twilight"" Fan Fiction\n\nE.L. James originally wrote ""Fifty Shades"" as a series of episodes on a ""Twilight"" fan website. The main characters were originally named Edward and Bella, and the story takes place in Seattle, which is close to the location of the ""Twilight"" books. James originally titled the story ""Master of the Universe."" After readers raised concerns about the sexual nature of the content, James removed the story from the fan site and posted it on her own website.\n\nStory Summary\n\n""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is the story of a 22-year-old college student, Anastasia, who begins a relationship with a 27-year-old very successful and powerful businessman, Christian Grey. She meets him while interviewing him for her college newspaper. When they later meet up in Portland, Oregon, he rescues her after she over-imbibes and she ends up chastely spending the night in his Heathman Hotel room.\n\nHe is intrigued by her and offers her a non-disclosure agreement and a contract that keeps their relationship purely sexual and defines it as one of ""dominance and submission."" She doesn\'t sign the agreement but loses her virginity to him.\n\nThe novel plays on tension over the nature of their relationship and the possibility of romance and love as well as Ana\'s sexual explorations in Christian\'s darker tastes in sexuality. Christian is a control freak with physical and mental scars from child abuse before being adopted by loving parents. However, he is likely as seduced by emotion for her as she is enticed by sexual explorations and a romantic relationship with him.\n\nFurther scenes in the first book introduce his lavish lifestyle with astonishing Seattle apartment, personal helicopter, and chauffeur. But there is also tension with an older woman who first introduced Christian to BDSM and allusions to a former girlfriend who figures in the later books. Ana meets Christian\'s parents and the reader is also introduced to Ana\'s mother and stepfather.\n\nSex and ""Fifty Shades of Grey""\n\n""Fifty Shades of Grey"" fits into the genre of erotica but has gained mainstream popularity rather than remaining genre fiction.

Grey’s surprise appearance at the hardware store and his helicopter also make an appearance. Plus audiences were given a sense of the Grey psyche with Dornan uttering, “Hearts and flowers: That’s not who I am.”\n\nBut with the exception of a brief blindfold, a hand on a thigh and a glimpse of a riding crop, Mr. Grey’s penchant for domineering sex was kept to a minimum. (The footage did feature him opening the doors to the Red Room, but alas, there was no wide shot of his illicit den.) In fact, there was more sex featured in Universal’s footage of the Seth Rogen-Zac Efron comedy Neighbors than anything found in the Fifty Shades footage.\n\nRather, the emotional component to the book’s storyline was highlighted with quick appearances from Anastasia’s mom, played by Jennifer Ehle, enthusiastic that her daughter has met someone new; her roommate (Eloise Mumford) warning her not to get hurt and even the heroine protesting that Mr. Grey is trying to change her. He protests with an earnest, “It’s you who’s changing me.”\n\nIt’s clear that the studio is rolling this out as carefully — and meticulously — as possible. It’s just unclear whether playing up the romance in the early footage is the way to get theater owners interested in the property.\n\nTime will tell.', 'Image zoomIt’s the question Universal Pictures Chairman Donna Langley gets asked most often: “How do you make a movie out of Fifty Shades?” Her answer: very carefully.\nIt’s Tuesday at the annual theater chain convention CinemaCon, and Universal Pictures concluded its lengthy slate presentation with the footage Fifty Shades fans have been waiting breathlessly to see since the studio bought the rights to the best-selling novels last year.\n(The footage did feature him opening the doors to the Red Room, but alas, there was no wide shot of his illicit den.)\nIn fact, there was more sex featured in Universal’s footage of the Seth Rogen-Zac Efron comedy Neighbors than anything found in the Fifty Shades footage.\nIt’s just unclear whether playing up the romance in the early footage is the way to get theater owners interested in the property.']"

49209,http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2014/03/26/the-amazing-spider-man-2-interview/,entertainment,"['During the last two generations, Spider-Man has always been a series I could rely on to be far more fun than they should be. Typically movie tie-in games, there was always something inherently fun about swinging through the city and pummeling thugs to a pulp. Needless to say, since the debut trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, I have been intrigued on how Beenox would improve the formula they have created with their past few games. Thankfully, Stepháne Gravel, Executive Producer at Beenox has answered some of the questions I had about their upcoming game.\n\nIt seems that a majority of Spidey fans still hold Spider-Man 2 as the best game adaptation; is that always an over-looming thing while making Spider-Man games?\n\nStepháne Gravel, Executive Producer, Beenox: Not especially. While we’re very big fans of the job Treyarch and others did with the franchise a decade ago, the game that’s most dominated our development process for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been the first The Amazing Spider-Man. This is our first time making a true sequel to one of our previous Spidey games, and iterating on what people loved about that title while re-imagining and improving upon what they didn’t like has been our chief priority.\n\nWhat technical improvements are being made for the PlayStation 4 specifically?\n\nBeenox: The most obvious will be improved graphics and other aesthetic enhancements taking advantage of the powerful hardware. In addition, we will support VITA remote play on the system.\n\nIn terms of world size, what can we expect?\n\nBeenox: We rebuilt New York City from the ground up, and it’s roughly the same size this time around as it was in the original The Amazing Spider-Man, but to judge it solely on that would miss the big picture – one of our main goals for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has been to cram more city into the same space. We’ve overhauled a number of features to make Manhattan a more open world and fun playground. Among other things, we’ve spiced up the landscape with more diverse architecture and unique neighborhoods, shifted much of the story and mission structure away from tight, indoor spaces out into the wide expanse of the metropolis, designed new, interesting crimes to stop, and introduced the Hero or Menace reputation system, which gives you good reason to stop them.\n\nCould you describe the most difficult part of making Spider-Man actually feel like Spider-Man?\n\nBeenox: Well I think you just stated it – what does it feel like to be Spider-Man? To my knowledge, no one at Beenox has webs shooting out of their wrists, so that makes it a bit of a challenge. I always try to remind myself that Spider-Man is different from other pop culture heroes. He isn’t a jaded, hulking, gravel-voiced muscleman with stubble and dark clothing. He’s a small guy in bright spandex doing somersaults off the Empire State Building while cracking jokes, beating up thugs, and returning purses to kind old ladies. There’s a very special, unusual personality there that you have to get right, and it influences everything from story and tone to acrobatics and combat.\n\nDoes Beenox have any contact with the film studio? How does that relationship work?\n\nBeenox: Not in a direct sense, no. We’ve worked closely with the expert loremasters and producers at Marvel in crafting our own unique story separate and independent from Sony Pictures’ version of The Amazing Spider-Man 2. So while there’s a little overlap in characters, our goal from the beginning was always to deliver a distinct experience that complements the film while standing apart from it.\n\nInterested in The Amazing Spider-Man 2?

""We\'re going forward on all fronts.""\n\nProducer Avi Arad is positive people will enjoy the next movie because ""villains can be very entertaining."" He explains, ""It\'s not like somebody\'s born and they\'re a villain. Something happens and it changes their lives. Some people can deal with it - they become the heroes. Some people can\'t and hate the world because of what they felt was done to them - they become the villains.""\n\nThe line-up for the supervillain movie hasn\'t been announced, but %cAndrew Garfield% personally likes Venom, Doc Ock, Vulture, and Kraven. Drew Goddard is penning ""The Sinister Six"" movie, while Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinker are working on the screenplay for the ""Venom (2017)"" film.\n\n""Venom hated only one guy - Spider-Man,"" Arad told SFX in a separate interview. ""He wasn\'t innately bad, he was a shortcut guy, not really into fighting hard for achievement. That\'s the Venom story. Can he also be a good guy? As you know, Venom was also called \'lethal defender of the innocent.\' ""\n\n""We had a great history with him, especially caring for the homeless, which is a very sensitive issue and something that many of us are very concerned with.

Maybe it’s to sidestep his love scenes with Stone?

49223,http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/03/special-features-rules-of-reboot-10.html,entertainment,"['Anghus Houvouras on the rules of the reboot….\n\nSo many comic books are being brought to the big screen that it feels almost critical that they evolve beyond origin stories and break free from the tyranny of their genre. The danger of all these comic book films has always been a vicious cycle of release, relapse, and reboot. Allow me to explain.\n\nRELEASE\n\nThe cycle starts with the release of a comic book film. In the past, fans had waited 10, 20, 30 years or more for their favorite characters to get the big screen treatment. There was a ridiculous amount of goodwill stored up and fans were extremely forgiving. Just seeing the comic book icons of their youth on the big screen was a thrill they never thought they would achieve.\n\nRELAPSE\n\nThe comic book movie is a hit. Now the studio rolls a sequel into production. More often than not, the stakes are raised and everything is amplified to a ridiculous degree. Multiple story lines and characters are strip mined to cobbled together to try and create something epic. Most of the time the second film takes the best parts of the original and tries to build on them. If the second film is still a bankable proposition, the studio doubles down and brings us a third installment.\n\nMore often than not, the third film ends up trying to pack even more in. Shoehorn in more story lines and characters to the point that the fans are bored and creatively the series has nowhere left to go. Which leaves studios with only one option:\n\nREBOOT\n\nIt’s amazing that you only have to back less than 20 years to find a time when comic book movies were sparsely released and not dominant on the cinematic landscape. It really wasn’t until X-Men and Spider-Man in the early 2000’s that this modern surge began. I say ‘amazing’ because within that 20 year period we’ve already established the rules for rebooting a series, and the window is a remarkably short 10 years.\n\nYou could say the reboot window was already established by the original Batman films which were a pop culture phenomenon in 1989 and was creatively out of steam in 1997. Spider-Man took the same route with three hugely successful installments launching in 2002 before director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire parted ways with the webslinger. In 2012 we got The Amazing Spider-Man reboot via Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield. This 10 year reboot cycle (give or take) seems pretty consistent.\n\nBatman Begins: 2004 / Batman vs. Superman: 2015\n\nX-Men: 2000 / X-Men: First Class: 2011\n\nFantastic Four: 2004 / The Fantastic Four (Take 2): 2015\n\nSuperman Returns: 2006 / Man of Steel: 2013\n\nBy this logic, expect new versions of Thor, Captain America and Iron Man right around 2018, whether you want it or not.\n\nThe rules are becoming clearly defined. You get a ten year window for a comic book character. After that, the reset button is hit and you start over again. Whether the property is successful or not. That’s the most troubling part of this new paradigm. Even if it works, even if all the cylinders are firing, there’s still a life cycle.\n\nThere are exceptions both ways. The Hulk was rebooted a handful of years after Ang Lee’s perplexing take on the character. On the other end of the cycle, Fox has been wringing every last drop of sweat out of Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine who seems appropriately unkillable. With the announcement of The Wolverine 2 (which is actually the third solo Wolverine movie), Jackman could manage to outlive the cycle, or wear out his welcome depending in your point of view.\n\nMaybe the 10 year cycle isn’t such a bad thing. It brings in new perspectives and gives filmmakers opportunities to tell new stories. We got Burton’s take on Batman, then Schumacher’s. The window closes, and Christopher Nolan comes in to reopen it with his own take on the character. Certainly for fans of all the different and unique stories, the 10 year cycle allows for these stories to be told outside the constraints of prior continuity.\n\nIt’s a little too early to tell if the cycle is a good thing or a bad thing. We’re still in the formative years of these franchises, but im curious to see if this trend continues. It seems like every 10 years we’ll get a new Batman, Spider-Man, and The Avengers.\n\nHow do we feel about that?\n\nAnghus Houvouras is a North Carolina based writer and filmmaker. His latest work, the novel My Career Suicide Note, is available from Amazon.', 'The danger of all these comic book films has always been a vicious cycle of release, relapse, and reboot.\nRELEASEThe cycle starts with the release of a comic book film.\nJust seeing the comic book icons of their youth on the big screen was a thrill they never thought they would achieve.\nIn 2012 we got The Amazing Spider-Man reboot via Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield.\nThis 10 year reboot cycle (give or take) seems pretty consistent.']"

So far, I think they’re doing a great job of bringing him to life and it will be interesting to see how he compares to James Franco’s version of the character.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 opens on May 2nd and stars DeHaan alongside Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx, Emma Stone, Paul Giamatti, Sally Field, Chris Cooper, B.J.

With The Amazing Spider-Man 2 swinging into theaters on May 2, Sony Pictures takes a big step forward with its amazing Spider-Plan. In this week’s Entertainment Weekly, senior writer Sara Vilkomerson talks with Team Spidey — including director Marc Webb and stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Dane DeHaan — about the decision to commit to two more Amazing Spider-Man films, for 2016 and 2018, in addition to two spin-offs focusing on beloved villains Venom and the Sinister Six.\n\n“At the tail end of this movie we set up some of the other characters that will probably end up being in the Sinister Six,” says Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal. “We’re going forward on all fronts.” (The studio hasn’t yet announced the exact makeup of its big-screen Sinister Six, but comic book fan Garfield says he personally digs Venom, Doc Ock, Vulture, and Kraven.)\n\nWhat makes Sony’s plan so radical is the studio is putting the villains from the Spider-Man universe front and center. “Villains can be very entertaining,” says producer Avi Arad. “It’s not like somebody’s born and they’re a villain. Something happens and it changes their lives. Some people can deal with it — they become the heroes. Some people can’t and hate the world because of what they felt was done to them — they become the villains.” Plus, wasn’t it always the bad guys — Jack Nicholson as the Joker or Michelle Pfeiffer in that catsuit — that seemed like they were having the most fun? “Great villains are the characters you remember,” says producer Matt Tolmach. “There’s a lot of us in those people.

What did come as a surprise was the announced spinoffs, which would delve even further into the Spider-Man universe. The most interesting of them is also the strangest: \'The Sinister Six,\' a movie starring a roster of Spidey\'s deadliest enemies.\n\nAnd according to new statements from Sony, the seeds for this film have been planted in \'The Amazing Spider-Man 2.\'\n\nVia EW, Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal stated:\n\nAt the tail end of this movie we set up some of the other characters that will probably end up being in the Sinister Six. We’re going forward on all fronts.\n\n[SPOILERS] As we previously reported, sources told us that the post-credits scene for \'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\' as glimpsed in the trailers, reveal Doc Ock\'s tentacles, Vulture\'s wings and the Venom symbiote suit, which falls in line with this update. [END SPOILERS]\n\n""Villains can be very entertaining,"" \'The Amazing Spider-Man 2\' producer Avi Arad also told EW. ""Something happens and it changes their lives."" Elsewhere, he explained the Sinister Six a little more in detail:\n\nThis movie [\'The Amazing Spider-Man 2\'] seals the fate of Oscorp as the tower of evil, as science at its worst. The Sinister Six are the creation of this sinister organization. These villains are there to attack humanity. There is only one hero out there that can stop them, and it\'s Spider-Man. One can only imagine what they will do to stop him so they can have free reign over the city. They are united over their deep hatred for Spider-Man.\n\nWe know that the Green Goblin, Electro and Rhino (the latter of which confirmed he\'ll return for \' The Amazing Spider-Man 3 \') all play a role in \'The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\' in addition to the three previously mentioned, so that accounts for the six potential baddies right there. In the comics, the Sinister Six roster is continuously changing, so Sony\'s film could throw a curveball and toss in a few unexpected new faces. We know B.J. Novak\'s character, for one, is playing another villain we weren\'t expecting.\n\nThe thought of seeing this evil superteam appear on the big screen is definitely exciting, but how exactly do you build a film around a team of murderers and thieves? Thankfully, Sony has hired Drew Goddard of \'The Cabin in the Woods\' fame to write and possibly direct the film. Since Goddard is a genius and a tremendous talent (who is also writing Marvels\' \'Daredevil\' Netflix series) that\'s a good start. We have no idea what tone Goddard is shooting for, but he should take a look at Marvel\'s current ongoing series \'The Superior Foes of Spider-Man,\' which follows the current Sinister Six as they attempt to eke out a living as blue-collar and hilariously under-appreciated crooks.\n\n\'The Amazing Spider-Man 2\' is set to open on May 2, 2014. While \'The Amazing Spider-Man 3\' is scheduled to hit June 10, 2016 and \'The Amazing Spider-Man 4\' on May 8, 2018, \'The Sinister Six\' is still in the early stages of development and is without a release.

49241,http://screenrant.com/amazing-spider-man-2-ending-sinister-six/,entertainment,"['108 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\nAndrew Garfield\'s Peter Parker has plenty on his plate to deal with in this May\'s The Amazing Spider-Man 2, not least of all will be the various genetic experiments-gone wrong that emerge from the research facilities at Oscorp Industries.\n\nSuch trouble-making characters as Rhino (Paul Giamatti) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) will be featured in the superhero movie sequel, though in recent weeks it\'s become increasingly obvious that the most crucial plot thread (no pun) - and thus the one that may be given the most screen time for development - is the renewed friendship-turned conflict between Peter and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan).\n\nThat Harry gets transformed into a Green Goblin creature in Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a cat that\'s fully out of the bag now, as earlier today we posted a Sony-approved photo showing DeHaan in his Goblin mode, up close and personal. However, there are even more villainous characters being ""introduced"" in the film - like, for example, Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn, before he fully emerges from the shadows (possibly all Goblin-like himself) in Amazing Spider-Man 3 in 2016.\n\nEW\'s latest article on Amazing Spider-Man 2 offers the following insight, with regard to that matter:\n\n“At the tail end of this movie we set up some of the other characters that will probably end up being in the Sinister Six,” says Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal. “We’re going forward on all fronts.” (The studio hasn’t yet announced the exact makeup of its big-screen Sinister Six, but comic book fan Garfield says he personally digs Venom, Doc Ock, Vulture, and Kraven.)\n\nMany a sharp-eyed fan has noticed that there is a shot contained within the first Amazing Spider-Man 2 trailer that shows versions of Vulture\'s wings and Doc Oc\'s arms on display within the more secret facilities of Oscorp - a shot possibly taken from either the ending or mid-credits sequence for the Amazing Spider-Man sequel (hint, hint).\n\nSony announced development on a Sinister Six spinoff not too long after the initial Amazing Spider-Man 2 trailer dropped, so the immediate connection to be made is that Vulture (who was originally supposed to debut in Sam Raimi\'s canceled Spider-Man 4) and Doc Oc will be among the players in said Spider-Man villain feature - with Norman Osborn and/or some of the other aforementioned super-powered non-heroes being eyed to join them.\n\nAs for the Harry/Goblin (again, no pun), DeHaan is a rising star and he could be used to anchor an upcoming installment in the series (like, in the case where Harry were to undergo a second transformation into Venom), but it depends on what the Harry Osborn character\'s ultimate fate is in the second chapter.\n\nWithin the same EW interview, Spider-Man franchise producer Avi Arad touched on the reasoning behind making a Sinister Six movie:\n\n“Villains can be very entertaining. It’s not like somebody’s born and they’re a villain. Something happens and it changes their lives. Some people can deal with it — they become the heroes. Some people can’t and hate the world because of what they felt was done to them — they become the villains.”\n\nMarvel Studios\' success at bringing together so many superheroes under the same roof in The Avengers has inspired imitations from other studios (see: young/old versions of X-Men in this year\'s X-Men: Days of Future Past), but a villain teamup feature is another beast altogether. There\'s certain some risk involved, if only because there\'s no guarantee that moviegoers will turn out in large numbers to see a movie sold as being focused heavily on squabbling, egomaniacal, dangerous super-powered criminals.\n\nOn the other hand, it\'s the very uniqueness of that premise (with respect to more traditional comic book movies and the genre in general) that makes Sinister Six a project that could have an easier time standing out from the rest of the crowd.\n\nWe still have two Amazing Spider-Man movies to go before the Sinister Six roster has, in essence, been finalized for the spinoff film by screenwriter Drew Goddard (Cloverfield, Cabin in the Woods), who may also direct.

And no hint of where the body’s gone…\n\nWe haven’t seen the Goblin’s face, but we have seen his bare chest and the gigantic scar that he supposedly received from a supposedly fatal glider wound in Amazing Spider-Man #122 (that was later revealed to be less than fatal).\n\nUnless… could that scar be from where a man’s tentacles might have originally been fused to his body in an atomic experiment gone wrong? In order to get him into the grave to begin with they must have been sheared off in the autopsy… which would leave a scar around his chest cavity…\n\nBut who might be in control of the body? Here’s the status quo before we saw it reach the end of its mortal coil:\n\nWhen he died, what if all that was good about Peter Parker, the formative memories that he was trying to reignite in the Superior Spider-Man, died with him? What if all that was left were the internal memories of Spider-Man’s arch-nemesis combined with the external memories of fighting every nemesis Spider-Man ever fought? And what if those memories coalesced to create… a Goblin King?\n\nEven if I’m completely wrong, it’s a compelling notion isn’t it? Otto’s greatest foe being a man who wears the body he was born in. Guess we’ll find out in two short weeks.\n\nRich adds: And yeah, what Liz Allan is holding behind her back? Total red herring. Or green herring. I love Tom’s theory about Doc Ock’s body but I reckon It’s L’il Normie inside the head…\n\nBut what happens to Dock Ock when Peter is back in the body? And while today’s issue gives us one take, I’m unconvinced.\n\nBecause Spider-Verse is coming.\n\nWell maybe. But if one survives, he may make a useful body for whatever remains of Doctor Octopus don’t you think? The Spider-Man of 2211…\n\nMax Borne. He has a little something, don’t you think?

Jupiter (Kunis), like Thomas A. Anderson before her, works as a \'cog in the machine\' and plods through a relatively unremarkable life, though she soon discovers she\'s destined for (much, MUCH) greater things when Trinity, er, Caine (a heavily tattooed Channing Tatum) rescues her and her wardrobe patterned like Dorothy\'s from ""The Wizard of Oz"" from a hospital visit that was set to go horribly wrong.\n\nCaine takes her down the rabbit hole (or is it a wormhole?), introducing the heroine-to-be to a sprawling universe of royal outer space families ... with her as the rightful owner of Earth itself, a title that doesn\'t sit too well with various nefarious parties.\n\nThat\'s right: Mila Kunis is Queen of the Planet. And she shares at least one passionate kiss with Channing Tatum. Could this be the best screen role of 2014?\n\nThere\'s a lot more to this scenario, including large winged beasties, mech suits that recall the battle armor of the soldiers of Zion in ""The Matrix Revolutions"" and a pouting, screaming Eddie Redmayne, channeling Jack Gleeson\'s Joffrey Baratheon on ""Game of Thrones"" as the spoiled brat in charge. It all comes with a very expensive price tag, which the Wachowskis can apparently still demand even after the underperforming box office returns of ""Speed Racer"" (2008) and ""Cloud Atlas"" (2012).\n\nHey, as derivative as it may seem, at least it\'s derivative of stuff that was made by the same filmmaking team. And in yet another summer full of mostly reboots (""Godzilla""), superhero sequels (""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"") and non-superhero sequels (Tatum\'s own ""22 Jump Street,"" ""Transformers; Age of Extinction""), that counts as downright original.\n\n""Jupiter Ascending"" opens July 18.', 'Upon the release of the visually stunning but narratively confusing teaser trailer for ""Jupiter Ascending"" last December, we predicted that the ""official trailer"" for the Wachowskis\' latest extravaganza would reveal more of the film\'s actual story.\n""Jupiter Ascending"" follows the basic plot structure of the Wachowskis\' own ""The Matrix,"" albeit with a gender-swap on two of the main characters.\nThat\'s right: Mila Kunis is Queen of the Planet.\nHey, as derivative as it may seem, at least it\'s derivative of stuff that was made by the same filmmaking team.\n""Jupiter Ascending"" opens July 18.']"

The masters will always keep that secret close until the right time comes to unleash it. And sometimes those secrets are kept within a sacred case created with mastery. And crafted by British-Moroccan artist Yahya, the Wu-Tang Clan has announced that it will have their double album Once Upon A Time In Shaolin in that container. According to Forbes, the album has been in the works for the last few years.\n\nBut here’s the kicker to this elusive and long-time well-kept secret, there’s only going to be one copy.\n\nRobert “RZA” Diggs stated:\n\n“We’re about to sell an album like nobody else sold it before. We’re about to put out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of [modern] music. We’re making a single-sale collector’s item. This is like somebody having the scepter of an Egyptian king.”\n\nThe goal of the group is to bring this one once in a lifetime album the world of art. The group wants to prove that music can be viable as an art form and kept that way. The idea is to have the music presented as Once Upon A Time In Shaolin tour that would occur in museums, galleries, and other forms of intimate artful venues according to RZA and Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh the album’s producer. Of course, just like high end exhibitions the cost of tickets will also most likely match the experience.\n\nRZA also stated:\n\n“The idea that music is art has been something we advocated for years. And yet its doesn’t receive the same treatment as art in the sense of the value of what it is, especially nowadays when it’s been devalued and diminished to almost the point that it has to be given away for free.”\n\nJamiel “Masta Killa” Arief added:\n\n“I think it’s a musical portrait that’s going to revolutionize music in the future. And I’m thankful to my brother Ringz, to collaborate with, and I’m ecstatic to be a part of it.”\n\nAfter the tour, many ideas have been stretched out for the one-time release. It could be sold to museums themselves, it could be sold to a record label for them to release, or it could even be sold to a fan who just keep it away to themselves forever. Cilvaringz and the group are thinking that it could be sold “in the millions.” Either way, this is one ambitious project that the producer and group have in mind. Considering that the conception had first sprung in 1997, it just may be time to unleash this grand idea. Cilvaringz stated “It took a long time. After five years, I’m sitting here and I’m like, ‘Am I really going to release this record and see it die after a week?'”\n\nNo date has been confirmed for the Once Upon A Time In Shaolin double album release or its tour. But the band’s new album A Better Tomorrow will be released in July 2014.

What you really want to wrap your ears around is the Wu’s other brand new release, titled The Wu – Once Upon A Time In Shaolin.\n\n\n\nA double-album that features the original Wu-Tang lineup over 31 tracks and 128 minutes, it’s a record that’s been recorded in secret for for nearly two decades. The catch? They’ll only be one copy of the album available “in the millions.”\n\n“We’re about to sell an album like nobody else sold it before,” Wu member Robert ‘RZA’ Diggs tells Forbes.“We’re about to put out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of [modern] music.”\n\nRZA, along with producer Tarik ‘Cilvaringz’ Azzougarh, say that the highly exclusive release is a modern statement to bring value back to music, re-establishing it with the same highly sought after status as classic art. “We’re about to put out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of [modern] music.”\n\n“The idea that music is art has been something we advocated for years,” RZA explains. “And yet it doesn’t receive the same treatment as art in the sense of the value of what it is, especially nowadays when it’s been devalued and diminished to almost the point that it has be given away for free.”\n\nThe Wu-Tang double album also looks like a rare treasure, housed inside a lavishly engraved silver-and-nickel box, the result of three months’ handcrafted toil by British-Moroccan artisan Yahya. “We’re making a single-sale collector’s item. This is like somebody having the scepter of an Egyptian king,” says RZA.\n\nBefore the inevitable bidding war for the most collectable of music artefacts however, RZA and Cilvaringz say the plan is to allow fans to hear their secret masterpiece first but not through cheap digital means like streaming or downloads. Instead – like art – to tour Once Upon A Time In Shaolin through the world’s museums, galleries, and arts festivals as an exhibit where patrons pay to listen to the album on a pair of headphones.\n\nOf course, all visitors will have to undergo a thorough security check before experiencing the double-album. “One leak of this thing nullifies the entire concept,” adds Cilvaringz.\n\nOnly after the ‘tour’ is over will the Wu-Tang Clan put the album up for sale and for an elite price tag that likely only corporations, record labels, or millionaire fans will be able to afford.\n\nAs RZA explains to Forbes, the contents of the high-concept project date back to 1997, when Cilvaringz joined the Wu onstage before teaming up with RZA to begin work on recordings that eventually stretched into the late 2000s, without ever seeing the light of day. “It took a long time,” Cilvaringz notes. “After five years, I’m sitting here and I’m like, ‘Am I really going to release this record and see it die after a week?'”\n\nNo official release or exhibition dates have been locked in for The Wu – Once Upon A Time In Shaolin, and even its producer admits “it sounds crazy,” Cilvaringz adding; “It might totally flop, and we might be completely ridiculed. But the essence and core of our ideas is to inspire creation and originality and debate, and save the music album from dying.”\n\nWhile you’re mulling over the philosophical nature of it all, you can take a listen to ‘Family Reunion’, the first taste of Wu-Tang’s more traditional new release, A Better Tomorrow, below.\n\n"", 'The Wu-Tang clan will be breaking their long drought between albums with the release of A Better Tomorrow this July.\nThe much-delayed reunion album is set to coincide with the influential rap collective’s 20th Anniversary, but forget that.\nA double-album that features the original Wu-Tang lineup over 31 tracks and 128 minutes, it’s a record that’s been recorded in secret for for nearly two decades.\nOnly after the ‘tour’ is over will the Wu-Tang Clan put the album up for sale and for an elite price tag that likely only corporations, record labels, or millionaire fans will be able to afford.\n“After five years, I’m sitting here and I’m like, ‘Am I really going to release this record and see it die after a week?']"

But a lot has changed since 1997. Namely, the music industry has cratered. Selling an album is an exercise in futility, and just having it join the infinite stream at Spotify can be a little depressing for artists.\n\n“It took a long time,” Cilvaringz told Forbes. “After five years, I’m sitting here and I’m like, ‘Am I really going to release this record and see it die after a week?’”\n\nSo the band came up with another idea. Instead of releasing “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” they’re going to make exactly one copy of the double album. It will be locked inside an engraved nickel and silver box created by British-Moroccan artist Yahya. It will then head out on tour to museums and galleries where visitors will pay an admission price to listen to it on headphones. Heavy security will guard the album to make sure it stays secret and never sees the light of day except by one paying customer at a time.\n\nA touch impractical, maybe, but probably something David Byrnes and Thom Yorkes of the world will approve of.\n\nStream Wu Tang’s single “Keep Watch” from “A Better Tomorrow” here, and watch the Wu Tang-Hall & Oates mashup you didn’t know you needed below:', 'In 1997, Morocco-based producer Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougarh hopped up on stage at a Wu Tang concert in Amsterdam, 18 at the time, and kept in touch with RZA over the following years.\nAfter years of talking about it, Azzougarh finally produced a Wu Tang record.\nInstead of releasing “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” they’re going to make exactly one copy of the double album.\nA touch impractical, maybe, but probably something David Byrnes and Thom Yorkes of the world will approve of.\nStream Wu Tang’s single “Keep Watch” from “A Better Tomorrow” here, and watch the Wu Tang-Hall & Oates mashup you didn’t know you needed below:']"

49321,http://www.geekosystem.com/wu-tang-releasing-only-one-copy-of-album/,entertainment,"['In a recent interview with Forbes to discuss their upcoming album, Wu Tang member RZA spared no hyperbole when describing its highly unorthodox distribution plan. In a bid to remind listeners that music can be a commodity like any other fine art, Wu Tang will be releasing only one (ludicrously expensive) copy of the secretly recorded work.\n\n“We’re about to sell an album like nobody else sold it before” RZA said exclusively to Forbes about the upcoming release of The Wu–Once Upon A Time in Shaolin — and at least in terms of the case the single album will be housed in, that might actually be an understatement.\n\nThe album’s buyer will receive the highly limited edition copy in a decadent silver and nickel case handcrafted over three months by Yahya, a British-Moroccan artist who typically works on commission for royalty. The ostentatious case is currently hidden in a vault underneath Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. Says RZA of the album cover you definitely do not want to lose in your car’s backseat: “We’re making a single-sale collector’s item. This is like somebody having the scepter of an Egyptian king.”\n\nWhy single sale? Explains RZA,\n\nThe idea that music is art has been something we advocated for years. And yet its doesn’t receive the same treatment as art in the sense of the value of what it is, especially nowadays when it’s been devalued and diminished to almost the point that it has to be given away for free.\n\nRZA seems to be implying that casual pirating is diminishing respect for music as an art form–so to combat that, Wu Tang is going the anti-In Rainbows route and treating Once Upon A Time, as Forbes puts it, like “a Monet or a Degas” — and assigning it a (arguably arbitrary) value that will be reflected in the work’s likely multimillion dollar price tag. Obviously, as the album’s main producer Tarik “Cilvaringz ” says, “One leak of this thing nullifies the entire concept.”\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean Wu Tang won’t give fans access to the album. Instead, their audience will have to listen to Once Upon A Time in the same highly secure and often expensive setting that, again, is typically reserved for paintings by Monet or Degas. Before the album is sold to a wealthy bidder, RZA and Cilvaringz told Forbes it will be taken on a tour of galleries and museums where fans can listen to the 128 minute, 31-song album through headphones. Heavy security will prevent recording devices from being smuggled in, and tickets will reportedly cost $30-50.\n\nOnce the album completes its tour and is purchased by a business or wealthy individual, it will be up to the new owner to decide whether or not to make Once Upon A Time available to the public.\n\nObviously, Wu Tang’s decision to emphasize their music’s value as a commodity and equate it to the most traditionally valued (if monetary value is any indication) works of art will likely make the album inaccessible to fans who aren’t extreme billionaires/can’t afford museum admittance. Says Cilvaringz:\n\nI know it sounds crazy. It might totally flop, and we might be completely ridiculed. But the essence and core of our ideas is to inspire creation and originality and debate, and save the music album from dying.\n\n(via Forbes and Gizmodo, image via NRK P3)\n\nMeanwhile in related links\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@themarysue.com', 'In a recent interview with Forbes to discuss their upcoming album, Wu Tang member RZA spared no hyperbole when describing its highly unorthodox distribution plan.\nIn a bid to remind listeners that music can be a commodity like any other fine art, Wu Tang will be releasing only one (ludicrously expensive) copy of the secretly recorded work.\nSays RZA of the album cover you definitely do not want to lose in your car’s backseat: “We’re making a single-sale collector’s item.\nObviously, as the album’s main producer Tarik “Cilvaringz ” says, “One leak of this thing nullifies the entire concept.”However, that doesn’t mean Wu Tang won’t give fans access to the album.\nBut the essence and core of our ideas is to inspire creation and originality and debate, and save the music album from dying.']"

The album will be housed in an engraved box (pictured above) that was handcrafted at the foot of the Moroccan Atlas Mountains.\n\nGiven its mythic backstory and the fact that it could go for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, we\'re voting Quentin Tarantino as the person most-likely to purchase this hip hop Holy Grail.\n\nAs for those of us accustomed to paying approximately a dollar per song, there\'s a much cheaper option for at least hearing Once Upon a Time in Shaolin. The musical tome will tour museums and galleries across the country as a piece of priceless art, with venues charging $30-50 for admission and permitting each ticket holder one listen to the two-hour LP.\n\n""One leak of this thing nullifies the entire concept,"" said producer Tarik “Cilvaringz” Azzougar, who oversaw most of this new album. So expect TSA-style security checks at any venue housing Once Upon a Time in Shaolin to prevent pirates from leaking the album.\n\nAs for what happens when the sole physical copy of the album sells, well, that\'s anybody\'s guess what\'s next.

""Banksy, bitches, Basquiats,"" Hov rapped on Rick Ross\' ""3 Kings,"" a trend continued on last year\'s ""Magna Carta Holy Grail"" and an accompanying six-hour performance piece at New York\'s Pace Gallery attended by the artist/professional sit-and-starer Marina Abramović.\n\nJay is even better at business than alliteration: all those art pieces are investments, not just wall fixtures. But I think his fascination, and Lady Gaga\'s, as exemplified by her strained, Doritos-endorsing ""Artpop"" album cycle, goes deeper than that. The art world is fundamentally built on a sense of importance and a healthy appetite for bluffing: there\'s no value inherent to million-dollar paintings beyond a combination of rarity and arbitrary prestige. (And sure, communicating ineffable truths about the human experience, but you can see that on Tumblr for free.) Pop music has the opposite problem: Jay Z and Gaga are worldwide figures whose music influences millions of people, but they can barely sell a record.\n\nJay Z\'s Samsung partnership for ""Magna Carta\'s"" release -- which delivered one million free copies of the album to smartphone owners for a reported $20 million advance -- was smart business, but take a step back and the picture sharpens: one of the biggest artists in the world was so nervous about selling records he gave a milli away? In the face of apparent consumer apathy (consumers have merely transferred their energies to YouTube and the like, but that\'s another thinkpiece), the protective cocoon of high-art relevance is an understandable escape pod to climb up to.\n\nBut Jay and Gaga have been doing it wrong. Rather than grovel at the feet of the art-world establishment, evoking Warhol or Picasso, pop should be making them watch the throne. Enter the Wu-Tang. Per a Forbes announcement, the hip-hop crew will release a single copy of ""The Wu - Once Upon a Time In Shaolin,"" a secret release recorded apart from summer-due wide-release set ""A Better Tomorrow."" Hidden in a silver-and-nickel box, the double-LP will go on a full-on museum tour, as well as appearing at festivals and other venues. Fans -- sorry, patrons -- will have to buy a ticket to listen to the 31-track album on headphones, like any traveling exhibit. When the tour\'s over, the group hopes to sell the one-of-a-kind piece for a few million dollars. RZA, bitches, Method Man.\n\n""This is like somebody having the scepter of an Egyptian king,"" the RZA told Forbes. While it may not solve the industry\'s financial conundrums, at least it\'s a step toward claiming something else: confidence. Instead of buying art, Wu-Tang Clan have made their own.\n\nWhat do you think of the Wu\'s new release?\n\nCorrection: Jay Z\'s ""Picasso Baby"" performance and film shoot was held at the Pace Gallery, not at MOMA.\n\n-- David Greenwald', 'Wu-Tang ClanWu-Tang Clan\'s art-piece new album, ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.""\nIf you\'ve heard a Jay Z verse in the last few years, you\'ve heard about his new hobby: art collecting.\nPop music has the opposite problem: Jay Z and Gaga are worldwide figures whose music influences millions of people, but they can barely sell a record.\nInstead of buying art, Wu-Tang Clan have made their own.\nCorrection: Jay Z\'s ""Picasso Baby"" performance and film shoot was held at the Pace Gallery, not at MOMA.']"

Soon, that container will house the double album.\n\n""We\'re about to sell an album like nobody else sold it before,"" Wu-Tang member RZA told them. ""We\'re about to put out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of [modern] music.""\n\nRZA explains the dramatic marketing strategy as a way for music to become re-established as a form of highly prized and sought after art, similar to a Monet or a Picasso.\n\n""The idea that music is art has been something we advocated for years,"" explained RZA. ""And yet it doesn\'t receive the same treatment as art in the sense of the value of what it is, especially nowadays when it\'s been devalued and diminished to almost the point that it has be given away for free.""\n\nAnd like a piece of treasured art, it will come along with a hefty multimillion-dollar price tag.\n\n""We\'re making a single-sale collector\'s item,"" RZA said, adding, ""This is like somebody having the specter of an Egyptian king.""\n\nThe album will reportedly go on sale after an exhibition tour. The Staten Island group want the one-of-a-kind piece to be shown at galleries, festivals and museums before it is stored away by the lucky millionaire who obtains it.\n\nDates for the exhibition have yet to be announced.\n\nFor more information, read the statement below taken from the album\'s official website (via Forbes), and check out the full Forbes story here.\n\n#Norules.\n\nHistory demonstrates that great musicians such as Beethoven, Mozart and Bach are held in the same high esteem as figures like Picasso, Michelangelo and Van Gogh. However, the creative output of today\'s artists such as The RZA, Kanye West or Dr. Dre, is not valued equally to that of artists like Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst or Jean-Michel Basquiat.\n\nIs exclusivity versus mass replication really the 50 million dollar difference between a microphone and a paintbrush? Is contemporary art overvalued in an exclusive market, or are musicians undervalued in a profoundly saturated market? By adopting a 400 year old Renaissance-style approach to music, offering it as a commissioned commodity and allowing it to take a similar trajectory from creation to exhibition to sale, as any other contemporary art piece, we hope to inspire and intensify urgent debates about the future of music. We hope to steer those debates toward more radical solutions and provoke questions about the value and perception of music as a work of art in today\'s world.\n\nWhile we fully embrace the advancements in music technology, we feel it has contributed to the devaluation of music as an art form. By taking this step, we hope to re-enforce the weight that music once carried alongside a painting or a sculpture. The album will be put on listening display in renowned galleries, museums, venues and exhibition spaces around the world for only the most dedicated to experience before it disappears into the private collection of a buyer. The public will know that what they will hear will be a once in a life time experience.\n\nA notable few have explored original and creative economic models. Prince, Radiohead and more recently Jay Z and Beyonce have all introduced new financial and distribution models and challenged the industry structure. In 1993, the Wu-Tang Clan introduced the revolutionary \'Wu-Tang deal\' which allowed the group to sign with one record label as an entity, but sign separate deals with other major labels for solo releases. It was an approach adopted by many groups that followed. Now 21 years later a new approach is introduced, one where the pride and joy of sharing music with the masses is sacrificed for the benefit of reviving music as a valuable art and inspiring debate about its future among musicians, fans and the industry that drives it. Simultaneously, it launches the private music branch as a new luxury business model for those able to commission musicians to create songs or albums for private collections. It is a fascinating melting pot of art, luxury, revolution and inspiration. It\'s welcoming people to an old world.""\n\nCilvaringz & The RZA', 'Fans awaiting Wu-Tang Clan\'s 20th anniversary reunion album have something else to turn their attention toward: a forthcoming secret album called The Wu -- Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.\n""We\'re about to sell an album like nobody else sold it before,"" Wu-Tang member RZA told them.\n""We\'re about to put out a piece of art like nobody else has done in the history of [modern] music.""\nAnd like a piece of treasured art, it will come along with a hefty multimillion-dollar price tag.\nSimultaneously, it launches the private music branch as a new luxury business model for those able to commission musicians to create songs or albums for private collections.']"

Since then, claims have emerged that certain staff members on Star Wars: Episode VII are contractually obligated to work on at least two new Indy Jones films.\n\nLatino Review - citing the same sources that gave them the scoop on Bradley Cooper voicing Rocket Raccoon in Disney/Marvel\'s Guardians of the Galaxy - claims that Mouse House and Lucasfilm executives have taken small steps towards recasting the Indiana Jones character, for a new trilogy of film installments in the serial adventure-inspired franchise.\n\nThe site includes the disclaimer that Indiana Jones 5 could still happen, with Harrison Ford reprising his signature role one more time after the 2008 installment Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. (Last year, the 71-year old actor said that he feels it\'s ""perfectly appropriate"" for him to play the character again.) However, as the clock keeps ticking, the window of opportunity in which Ford as Dr. Jones will get to properly ride off into the sunset (... again) ""is getting smaller and smaller.""\n\nThat Ford could be replaced by someone else in the Indiana Jones role (due to his age) is something that many fans have long acknowledged as a legitimate possibility, well before Disney secured the full rights to the series. Just as there may soon come a day when Hugh Jackman is no longer the actor playing Wolverine (or Tony Stark might no longer be synonymous with Robert Downey Jr.), it makes sense that Dr. Jones could get a new face in the future, much like his fellow iconic screen heroes James Bond and Batman (among others) have before him.\n\n[UPDATE: /Film claims it has a source who ""100% debunks"" the assertion that Indiana Jones recasting talk is ongoing right now. If nothing else, though, that\'s a nice reminder for everyone to not get too worked up about this story (either way).]\n\nSo, who might don Jones\' fedora after Ford? Well, again, everything\'s up in the air right now, but Bradley Cooper is apparently the actor currently atop Disney\'s wanted list. It makes sense; in addition to being around the same age as Ford when he made Raiders of the Lost Ark, Cooper\'s also proven to be capable of bringing a similar mix of cockiness and humor to that which Ford infused the character with. (Not to mention, the good-looking actor has a history with Disney, thanks to Guardians).\n\nThat\'s not to say an offer has been made yet, of course - we don\'t even know if Cooper actually wants to take on the role, as he\'s been more inclined to work on indie and/or non-pop genre fare in recent times (see: the upcoming Serena and American Sniper). Plus, as his star looks to keep rising higher and higher over the years ahead, Disney and Lucasfilm might ultimately prefer someone who commands a smaller paycheck than Cooper will.\n\nEither way, Walking Dead TV show creator Frank Darabont might be involved with the next installment in the franchise, should it star Ford or not. The screenwriter/director penned an unused script draft for the fourth Indiana Jones movie - it was better than the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull script, in my opinion - and he would be inclined to deliver a good mix of thrills, story, and character development in his own Indy Jones movie. So, if nothing else, we hope the Darabont rumor pans out.\n\nAgree/disagree?

Cooper is reportedly at the top of their list for the next Indy.\n\nWhile it’s unlikely that a casting such as Bradley Cooper for Jones would be as widely gawked at as Ben Affleck’s casting as the new Batman, recasting of the world’s most notorious archaeological adventurer is bound to come under heavy scrutiny, especially since Harrison Ford has gone on record saying he’s up for reprising the role.\n\nYet it’s hard to ignore the fact that Ford is getting along in years. At 71, the actor was noticeably less agile in the last installment Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. And while the film was a box office success, audiences did not take well to the addition of Jones’ son played by Shia LaBeouf. Add into the mix that LaBeouf has been in the media for blatant plagiarism and strange antics, fans of Dr. Jones may be eager to accept a new face such as Cooper.\n\nIndiana Jones has a big hat to fill, with only one other actor having taken it on (River Phoenix). Harrison Ford did it for years with his cool charisma, snarky smirk, and a perfect melding of nerd and goofy, but Bradley Cooper is certainly no slouch in those areas.\n\nCooper shot to fame with the Hangover franchise, then went on to star as Face in the A-Team reboot. Both films required Cooper to exude a certain type of charisma and he filled those shoes quite well.\n\nSome fans could argue that Bradley doesn’t have the acting chops, but perhaps those people don’t realize that Cooper has two Oscar nominations (Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle) while Ford has only had one nomination and that was for Witness in 1985. With Cooper’s youth, charming smile, ability to look great with a five o’clock shadow, and his way with the ladies, Bradley’s a pretty decent pick.\n\nThe one area that Cooper may fall short in is the ability to pull off nerdiness. In the end, Indiana Jones is a professor of archaeology, and whether or not Cooper can convincingly push his inner nerd out enough to convince audiences is something that remains to be seen.\n\nWhat do you think of this potential casting choice?', 'Actor Bradley Cooper, who most recently starred in American Hustle, is rumored to be in consideration for a recasting of legendary screen character Indiana Jones.\nLatino Review is reporting that if the next Indiana Jones film doesn’t happen soon, they’re ready to recast the role and proceed with new adventures, much like how the James Bond franchise has lived on for decades.\nAt 71, the actor was noticeably less agile in the last installment Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\nIndiana Jones has a big hat to fill, with only one other actor having taken it on (River Phoenix).\nIn the end, Indiana Jones is a professor of archaeology, and whether or not Cooper can convincingly push his inner nerd out enough to convince audiences is something that remains to be seen.']"

They'd Be Stupid Not To.\n\nLatino Review sparked the discussion today with their latest scoop, claiming production on Indiana Jones 5 has a set date, and if Harrison Ford can't put down the bong long enough to amble grumble on over to Disney and sign up before that date, Disney will move forward with plans to cast someone else.\n\nWhich makes perfect sense. As Latino Review pointed out in their article, Indiana Jones was always conceived as an American James Bond; a fact made clear upon reading the transcripts of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Lawrence Kasdan breaking the story. Indy was kind of a gross asshole at first, before the edges got sanded off and a crooked-faced man made of almost total charisma lucked into the part.\n\nPart of the Bond series' appeal (before the Craig reboot put a premium on continuity) was the willingness to recast the lead, providing interesting twists on a familiar recipe. Didn't like staring at the massive caterpillars slouching across Connery's brow? Just wait, a grinning leather couch driving a fuckin' Lotus should be coming sometime soon. Thought that couch was a little too corny? That's cool, a future supermarket manager with a thirst for murder will be doing his best Sonny Crockett any time now.\n\nAnd it's not as if the world isn't used to the idea of Indiana Jones played by someone else. Harrison Ford hasn't even clocked the most hours playing the man. That honor goes to one of the Boondock Saints, thanks to his time on ABC's The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, a failed experiment in semi-educational children's programming.\n\nThere will be hand-wringing and gnashing of teeth in response to this scoop, sure; but this was utterly expected. It's the least surprising bit of film news I've heard all year. Of course they're going to recast Indiana Jones. Disney didn't spend hundreds of millions to square things with Paramount Pictures just to keep re-releasing the original movies on home video. And they're not going to keep pouring Harrison Ford into that shirt and jacket either. It's financially irresponsible and creatively limiting.\n\n(heh, I tried to make it sound like film executives honestly give a shit whether filmmakers enjoy creative freedom or not while producing blister-packaged entries in franchised media properties)\n\nBut if there's a beam of light breaking through the cloudy disappointment of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Whatever the Fuck That Shit Was, it's that the film made it easier to swallow the idea Harrison Ford should be moving right along like a Muppets musical number. Granted, they chose the wrong potential successor (insert LaBeef joke here), but people still like going to Indiana Jones movies, and maybe not for the guy playing Indiana Jones. I think it's more those orange-and-yellow letters, the name that means adventure, John Williams' galloping theme racing past, the promise of crazy stunts by a grinning pile of bruises in a fedora, whipping asses (and getting his ass whipped) on the way towards a hard-fought scramble of a victory.\n\nHopefully, the idea is to simply tell a bunch of stand-alone adventures with Indy throughout the 30s and 40s. Characters move in and out, but there's no movie-spanning arc to follow. You don't have to keep up with previous movies to understand what's going on. One year, the guy under the fedora might have a different face, but otherwise, it's just new episodes of an ongoing adventure story.\n\nA story possibly starring Bradley Cooper, who Latino Review states is the early front-runner. Or Chris Pratt. Or Channing Tatum, Ryan Gosling, Liam Hemsworth, or any number of young-ish movie stars who might be able to channel the charisma needed to successfully portray an iconic character.\n\nI'm not going to play the fan-casting game (although I read an article recently where Drew McWeeny of HitFix suggested Jake Johnson, and I found myself really liking the idea. Timothy Olyphant would be fun, too) I just hope the producers choice is based not on how well an actor holds the whip, but how well he can sell the glasses and the bow-tie, too. Jones is a professor. He's an action hero, but he's not an action star. Part of why Indy is so endearing and ingratiating is because Harrison Ford takes a lot of punishment for his efforts. Whoever plays Dr. Jones shouldn't project an air of invincibility, because that's absolutely wrong. He gets confused, he gets flustered, he gets frustrated; he can bluster and fight his way out of a situation, but we need to believe he can think his way out, too.\n\nThe Bond-era of Indiana Jones will be starting soon. I welcome it gladly. So long as they don't pick a total stiff."", ""Of Course They're Gonna Recast Indiana Jones.\nAnd it's not as if the world isn't used to the idea of Indiana Jones played by someone else.\nOf course they're going to recast Indiana Jones.\nGranted, they chose the wrong potential successor (insert LaBeef joke here), but people still like going to Indiana Jones movies, and maybe not for the guy playing Indiana Jones.\nThe Bond-era of Indiana Jones will be starting soon.""]"

So naturally, talk has begun about making a new Indiana Jones film, one with or without Harrison Ford.

Last year, Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn clarified that Henry Jones Jr. isn't likely to ride again until two to three years from now, saying, “We don’t have a story. We need a story.”\n\nIn two to three years, Ford will be 75 or 76 years old. Again, it's not the years, but the mileage of those years might be a bit much for a globe-trotting adventurer, expert on the occult, and finder of lost antiquities.\n\nJones is a durable, archetypal character modeled on the swashbuckling heroes of 1930s and '40s serials. As such, he could conceivably survive a transition to a new actor. It's worked for James Bond over the last half-century, and with reboots now being the norm, audiences might be less inclined to reject an Indy not played by the actor who first brought him to perfectly to life in Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nThat's the rumor Latino Review is reporting. According to LR's anonymous sources, Disney is keen to make Indiana Jones 5 with Ford, but if that doesn't happen by a certain mysterious date, then the studio will move along to an actor who could star as Jones in a new trilogy.\n\nThe actor at the top of the hypothetical wish list? Bradley Cooper.\n\nKeep in mind that no offer has gone out and no discussions have taken place with the American Hustle star and Guardians of the Galaxy voice, he's just a name that's rumored to have been bandied about regarding this theoretical switch.\n\nWould Steven Spielberg direct an Indy sequel without Ford? Who knows? Hard to imagine an Indy movie without Spielberg's rare command of geography, set-up, and payoff.\n\nAccording to this rumor, though, none other than Frank Darabont might take a crack at writing a fifth Indiana Jones. Darabont – writer and director of The Shawshank Redemption – famously wrote an early draft of what eventually became Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Though his work was lauded by both Spielberg and Ford, it was dismissed outright by George Lucas. Audiences instead ended up with the lumbering shamblefest that hit theaters in 2008.\n\nThat sequel set up a potential franchise hand-off, introducing Indy's long-lost son Mutt, played by Shia LaBeouf. The response to Crystal Skull overall and Mutt specifically ensured that such a hand-off wouldn't happen, however.\n\nThis is pure, uncorroborated rumor for the time being, but you can bet your ass that Disney isn't going to let a property as recognizable and beloved as this one lie fallow for long. The 007 approach makes a lot of sense, but given just how completely Harrison Ford's unique charm defines Indy, recasting the role would be as delicate and precise an operation as snagging a booby-trapped fertility idol:\n\n"", ""According to a new rumor, Disney might be looking to find an actor with less mileage to take over the role of Indiana Jones from Harrison Ford in a fifth Indiana Jones adventure.\nLast year, Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn clarified that Henry Jones Jr. isn't likely to ride again until two to three years from now, saying, “We don’t have a story.\nAccording to LR's anonymous sources, Disney is keen to make Indiana Jones 5 with Ford, but if that doesn't happen by a certain mysterious date, then the studio will move along to an actor who could star as Jones in a new trilogy.\nAccording to this rumor, though, none other than Frank Darabont might take a crack at writing a fifth Indiana Jones.\nDarabont – writer and director of The Shawshank Redemption – famously wrote an early draft of what eventually became Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.""]"

Read that below.\n\nThere are rumors, there are big rumors, and then there are stories like this. A new report says Disney, which recently acquired the rights to release more Indiana Jones films, is looking to go the James Bond route with the character. That is, the company could recast him for years to come. Who would don the fedora after Harrison Ford? Rumor has it Bradley Cooper is at the top of the list.\n\nAccording to Latino Review, Cooper is just one name on a longer list of actors who may, or in most cases may not play Indiana Jones moving ahead.

The idea of Indiana Jones becoming an American James Bond, meaning various actors could continue the role for decades in the future, is actually a pretty great idea. In most people’s minds, no one will ever touch Sean Connery when it comes to James Bond. But the franchise didn’t end with him. We still have that performance, those films, yet we get new Bond movies every few years and some of them — Skyfall for example — are absolutely fantastic. Even the least-loved Bond actors have fans.\n\nIndiana Jones has that potential. He doesn’t have to grow older with each film. Why not hit the reset button and continue forward? We’d still have Ford’s iconic films, yet we’d have new ones too. Of course, this will put the original four movies and TV show in a bit of an odd light, but after a good movie or two, no one will care.\n\nAgain, this is not definite.

But it’s a juicy, fan-enraging (or exciting, depending on just how depressed Kingdom of the Crystal Skull made you) idea, and so you’re likely to see it floating around a lot today. Probably reporters are already calling Bradley Cooper to ask him whether he’d want to be Indiana Jones (I’m gonna take a wild guess that his answer will boil down to “yes”).

Jeff Vespa / Today\n\nThe idea that anyone other than Harrison Ford might play Indiana Jones seems like heresy. While Disney has said that a potential fifth film would be at least two to three years away, the window is closing for the 71-year-old star to return as the swashbuckling archaeology professor-turned-relic-rescuer once more.\n\nSo who might take on the role next? Bradley Cooper is bubbling up as a possibility. The two-time Oscar nominee has kicked butt in blockbusters (""The A-Team""), earned critical acclaim as a serious actor (""American Hustle"") and still can be a lowbrow goof if he likes (""The Hangover""). Plus, he\'s got the charm and the rugged looks that could be dirtied and cleaned up nicely.\n\nBut while Cooper may be a solid option, here are four others we think could just as easily fit into that classic fedora.\n\nRyan Gosling. Victoria Will / Today\n\nRyan Gosling\n\nStar power: One Oscar nomination, intensely loyal fan base\n\nWhy him? Gosling is one of the few men of action in the movies whose gentle looks belie a killer instinct. He can be a skinhead (""The Believer""), a deluded romantic lover (""Lars and the Real Girl"") and a pretty terrifying, vengeful getaway driver (""Drive""). He\'d be completely believable as a bespectacled professor who can go investigate the mysteries of the ancient world in his spare time, and could probably knock back as many shots as Karen Allen\'s Marion in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""\n\nCasting odds: Medium. Last we checked, Gosling is on hiatus from acting.\n\nCharlie Hunnam. Frazer Harrison / Today\n\nCharlie Hunnam\n\nStar power: Golden boy with a dark edge, popular with motorcycle gang members\n\nWhy him? Having dodged a lead role in the adaptation of ""50 Shades of Grey,"" Hunnam proved he\'s more than the angst-ridden, powerful Jax on ""Sons of Anarchy"" — he\'s got eyes on some serious acting jobs once the show ends in 2015. He can play the classics (""Nicholas Nickleby"") but makes a terrific, kick-butt Yank (""Anarchy,"" duh) and has honed his comedy chops with Judd Apatow (""Undeclared""). A solid package.\n\nCasting odds:Hopeful, but likely low. Hunnam might be a little too golden to be Indy.\n\nAndrew Lincoln. David Livingston / Today\n\nAndrew Lincoln\n\nStar power: He\'s the star of one of TV\'s most talked about dramas, ""The Walking Dead.""\n\nWhy him? After four seasons of battling zombies, Lincoln knows what it\'s like to fight crazed, wild-eyed baddies. He\'s an ace with a gun or a sword, sports a terrific 5 o\'clock shadow and has a tough, steely glint in his eye ... but still loves the little children, particularly his own wandering brood. Clean him up and he\'d be a terrific choice to make both difficult moral decisions (save the Holy Grail or the blonde villainess?) but smart enough to know when to keep his eyes closed (when Ark is being opened).\n\nCasting odds: Good. He\'s also Brit, but he wears his American roughness well.\n\n\n\nIdris Elba. Mark Cuthbert / Today\n\nIdris Elba\n\nStar power: Has a Golden Globe and a killer instinct.\n\nWhy him? Elba has practically every credential necessary to be a great Indiana Jones: He was a smart, tough drug lord in ""The Wire"" and a tough, tormented cop in ""Luther,"" but also a hilarious micromanager in ""The Office."" He\'s yet another Brit, and yes, he may require some out-of-the-box thinking, but who wouldn\'t want to see Elba wielding the whip one moment, then hollering about snakes the next?\n\nCasting odds: Probably never going to happen.

It was pure speculation, but since Disney snagged the rights to the iconic adventure franchise the previous week, and Harrison Ford said another film following Dr. Jones wasn\'t out of the question, it didn\'t seem out of the ordinary. But a new rumor seems to indicate that Disney wants to take the character in a different direction. Read on!\n\nLatino Review, who has a pretty solid track record with big blockbuster rumors, reports that Disney might be looking to reboot Indiana Jones and turn it into a franchise that could switch out actors indefinitely like the long-running James Bond series. In addition, the actor at the top of their list is none other than Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper, though the source says there are other names on the list below their top choice. But this doesn\'t mean that Harrison Ford couldn\'t still play Indiana Jones in another sequel, but the studio is aware that his age may start to preclude him from going on.\n\nInitially, the thought of rebooting Indiana Jones seems sacrilegious, but compared to the progress of the Indiana Jones franchise, it makes sense. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created Indiana Jones as a tribute to old adventure serials, so it would almost go against the hero\'s existence to limit him to a series of four films. Plus, Indiana Jones came about because Spielberg was itching to direct a James Bond film, so Lucas gave the filmmaker his own action adventure hero instead. And at the end of the day, a reboot can\'t be worse than Indiana Jones an the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\n\nAs of now, the studio reportedly has a date in mind that Indiana Jones 5 would have to meet. Otherwise they will move forward with a plan for a younger actor to step into the role, and Frank Darabont might be involved with a story for that (hopefully they don\'t throw his script out like they did with Kingdom of the Crystal Skull). While I\'m worried that the abysmal fourth entry in the series might be Harrison Ford\'s last movie as Indiana Jones, I\'m not sure a fifth film could help matters any. Maybe what Indiana Jones really needs is this James Bond style reboot. Thoughts?\n\nUPDATE: SlashFilm received word from a high-ranking source in the know that an Indiana Jones reboot is not in the cards. Of course, this is exactly the kind of reaction you would expect when dealing with such a revered property.

In fact, one possible scenario involves replacing Ford with Bradley Cooper to keep the franchise alive without a traditional reboot.\n\nLatino Review’s source happen to be the same source that tipped them off to Cooper scoring the Rocket Raccoon voice acting role for Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy. This source is either within Cooper’s talent agency camp, the likely scenario, or falls under the Disney umbrella where both Marvel and Lucasfilm reside.\n\nWhichever the case, the scoop seems valid enough given the source and makes all the sense in the world. Disney’s acquisition of Lucasfilm put several Star Wars projects in the fire, but the world of Indiana Jones is still ripe for a return. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was critically panned in 2008 yet still went on to earn $786.6 million at the global box office. Disney isn’t about to not try to revive the franchise in one form or another.\n\nThe scoop lays out two possible scenarios that Disney is persuing. The first involves bringing back Harrison Ford before he becomes a man of a certain age so he can star in Indiana Jones 5. Jones is rumored to appear in Star Wars Episode VII for J.J. Abrams so one would have to imagine that discussions of some sort have already taken place.\n\nIf Jones and the film can’t come together by a cut off date, and apparently there is one, another possibility is taking the James Bond route and simply recasting the character. Disney is apparently high on Bradley Cooper for this route but nothing has materialized as of yet.\n\nAs far as story goes, Frank Darabont has supposedly pitched an idea for the next film. What that idea is, and whether that idea centers around Harrison Ford or a recast Indy, is unknown.\n\nDetails aside, the key to the scoop is that Disney and Lucasfilm are dusting off the fedora and looking to bring Indiana Jones back to the big screen one way or the other.\n\nSource: Latino Review', 'Indiana Jones may be returning to the big screen in the not-too-distant future with or without star Harrison Ford, according to Latino Review.\nIn fact, one possible scenario involves replacing Ford with Bradley Cooper to keep the franchise alive without a traditional reboot.\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was critically panned in 2008 yet still went on to earn $786.6 million at the global box office.\nThe first involves bringing back Harrison Ford before he becomes a man of a certain age so he can star in Indiana Jones 5.\nWhat that idea is, and whether that idea centers around Harrison Ford or a recast Indy, is unknown.']"

Instead, the Indiana Jones film series is said to be following the ""James Bond"" film franchise route of recasting the titular role every couple of years. As to who might be writing Indy 5, the site claims Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead Season 1, Shawshank Redemption) might be making a run for it. For now, it\'s said that Darabont has pitched an idea, but it\'s currently unknown what that idea is or if it has been given the green light.\n\nWhen the time comes that Harrison has to pass his whip and fedora to someone else, whom do you think would be a good fit?

According to a new rumor, that looks likely.\n\nUpdate: Another source told /Film that the rumor is false. It does remain a possibility that Disney could go this route in the future, however.\n\nAccording to a source of Latino Review‘s, the Indiana Jones franchise may very well fall in the footsteps of the James Bond franchise and continually replace the lead actor.\n\nKeep in mind, this is merely a rumor. Latino Review has had mixed results lately with breaking scoops, but they claim this scoop is from the same source that gave them the accurate information that Bradley Cooper would be voicing Rocket Raccoon in Guardians of the Galaxy, so it could be credible.\n\nAccording to the source, Disney has a date in mind for the production of Indiana Jones 5. If the film is not underway by that time with Harrison Ford starring, they will apparently cast a younger actor to play Dr. Jones in a new trilogy.\n\nIf this is done, it will be done in a way similar to when James Bond was recast after Sean Connery left. Indiana Jones would become a character that could be played by many different actors. Doing this would allow them to place Dr. Jones back in the World War II period, something they couldn’t do with an older Harrison Ford.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, this rumor does make a lot of sense. After Disney got the rights to make new Indiana Jones films back when they bought LucasFilm in 2012, they finally got the rights to distribute them this past December. The series is one that obviously has the potential to make a lot of money, and Disney didn’t spend money without intent to make more films.\n\nOn the other hand, it would be a little bit of a surprise to see the Indiana Jones franchise movie on without Harrison Ford while he still wants to make the movies.\n\nIt was rumored last October that Harrison Ford demanded Disney and LucasFilm guarantee him that Indiana Jones 5 would be happening before he agreed to reprise his Han Solo role in Star Wars: Episode VII. Ford cares more about being Dr. Jones again, and if the rumor was true, he was using his pull to make sure it would happen.\n\nThe rumor said that he didn’t get the official confirmation he wanted, but they did guarantee him that an outline for the fifth movie in the series would be completed by the end of next year with the movie coming out no later than December 2016.\n\nSeeing Indiana Jones played by an actor other than Ford would take some getting used to, but the question of whether it should be done or not is a futile one. If Disney wants to replace him, they will. According to the rumor, they’ve already begun considering different actors, and while nothing has been done yet, Bradley Cooper is at the top of their list of potential actors to put on Indy’s classic hat.\n\nThis has not been part of any rumors yet and is purely speculation on our part, but we wouldn’t be surprised if Steven Spielberg would return only to direct a Ford starred Indiana Jones movie, not one with a different actor.\n\nWould you be interested in seeing ‘Indiana Jones’ movies without Harrison Ford?', 'Could Indiana Jones go on without Harrison Ford?\nAccording to a source of Latino Review‘s, the Indiana Jones franchise may very well fall in the footsteps of the James Bond franchise and continually replace the lead actor.\nAccording to the source, Disney has a date in mind for the production of Indiana Jones 5.\nDoing this would allow them to place Dr. Jones back in the World War II period, something they couldn’t do with an older Harrison Ford.\nWould you be interested in seeing ‘Indiana Jones’ movies without Harrison Ford?']"

Yes, after much speculation as to what, exactly, is in store for the Indiana Jones saga in the next few years, it look as though Bradley Cooper (you read that right) is being considered as the actor to replace Ford in an upcoming trilogy, based on an idea that has been pitched by The Shawshank Redemption\'s Frank Darabont. You\'ll remember that Darabont pitched an unsuccessful Indy sequel many years ago, so it\'s weird to see him involved again. But Paramount confirmed a while back that they had plans to deliver more Indy films - as time has gone on, however, it\'s become more and more apparent that it might not be entirely feasible to do them with Harrison Ford. Harrison Ford is 72 years old now, of course, and with the likes of Star Wars: Episode VII and the long-rumoured Blade Runner sequel already in the works, it seems unlikely that he\'ll be able to come back to Indy before he\'s reached age, like, 80. But is Bradley Cooper really a good choice? Is Ford somebody we can just replace with a younger model? Talented as he is, we\'re having a hard time imagining Cooper pulling off Indy\'s sardonic tendencies with the grizzled charisma that Ford brought to the role. Though technically Indiana Jones appears to be a character like James Bond - in the sense that we should be able to wipe the slate clean and recast him every once in a while - it\'s going to be immensely difficult to escape the iconic\'s fedora-clad shadow. Still, might Karl Urban be a better choice? What do you reckon? Does this sound like something you\'d enjoy? Cooper as Indiana Jones? More films? Let us know in the comments section below.', ""You'll remember that Darabont pitched an unsuccessful Indy sequel many years ago, so it's weird to see him involved again.\nBut is Bradley Cooper really a good choice?\nTalented as he is, we're having a hard time imagining Cooper pulling off Indy's sardonic tendencies with the grizzled charisma that Ford brought to the role.\nThough technically Indiana Jones appears to be a character like James Bond - in the sense that we should be able to wipe the slate clean and recast him every once in a while - it's going to be immensely difficult to escape the iconic's fedora-clad shadow.\nCooper as Indiana Jones?""]"
