But how about Mom and Dad? How does smartphone use by parents affect interactions with their children?\n\nIn a first-of-its-kind study published in Pediatrics, researchers analyzed how parents or other caregivers use mobile devices around children and how that use impacts relationships. “We chose to observe caregivers and children during meals because this is a daily routine in which face-to-face caregiver–child interactions are considered beneficial,” said the researchers from Boston University Medical Center.\n\nThey observed 55 caregivers eating with at least one child in fast-food restaurants. Forty of those caregivers used a mobile device during the meal. Researchers were most concerned with the level of absorption, which they defined as the “extent to which the primary focus of the caregiver’s attention and engagement was with the device rather than the child.”\n\nOf the caregivers with smartphones, most of them used the devices throughout the meal and seemed to have more engagement with their phone than the child. Researchers took notes during the observations. Some of their comments included:\n\n“Many caregivers used the device almost continuously throughout the meal, eating and talking while looking at the device or only putting it down briefly to engage in other activities.\n\nCaregiver looks up occasionally to grab a French fry or quickly say something to the girl and then continues to do something on her phone.\n\nFemale caregiver is holding the baby in her lap and is staring at her cell phone.\n\nThere is no conversation. Caregiver appears to be typing into phone, holding it about 10 inches away from her face, looking into it for long stretches during which she does not look up.”\n\nA 2011 study published in Pediatrics advised physicians to tell their patients about the benefits of actively engaging their children during meals. When parents and kids eat meals together at least three times per week, benefits “include a reduction in the odds for overweight, eating unhealthy foods, and disordered eating and an increase in the odds for eating healthy foods.”\n\nIn the current study, it was common for children to act out to get the attention of the distracted parent and equally common for the parent to ignore the needs of the kids. “Caregivers absorbed in devices frequently ignored the child’s behavior for a while and then reacted with a scolding tone of voice,” said the authors.\n\nSuch inattention could lead to potentially dangerous situations. “It may be that children can perceive the inattention and take more risk,” Dr. David Schwebel, a psychologist at the University of Alabama, told the Wall Street Journal during a previous study of texting and distracted parenting.\n\nOne of the positive observations showed enjoyment by caregiver and child when they shared information or entertainment on the mobile device. While no definitive conclusions were made from the observations, the researchers said that this analysis was “an important first step in the study of how device technology affects the daily interactions that are so important to child development.”', 'How does smartphone use by parents affect interactions with their children?\nIn a first-of-its-kind study published in Pediatrics, researchers analyzed how parents or other caregivers use mobile devices around children and how that use impacts relationships.\nThey observed 55 caregivers eating with at least one child in fast-food restaurants.\nForty of those caregivers used a mobile device during the meal.\nOne of the positive observations showed enjoyment by caregiver and child when they shared information or entertainment on the mobile device.']"

They’re a huge convenience to us, we are able to stay connected to our friends and family members via social media, everywhere we go, we can surf the internet right from our phones, and carry an entire library’s worth of books in our purse. Technology is certainly a beautiful thing, and there is no doubting that it has made our lives easier. But are we spending too much time on our mobile devices?\n\nA new study released today in Pediatrics gives us a better idea of what kind of impact our mobile devices have on our closest relationships, especially the ones with our children. Researchers examined patterns of the use of mobile devices during meals in fast food restaurants. The study was designed by researchers from the Boston University Medical Center in order to generate a scientific hypotheses about mobile device use and the effects it has on caregiver-child relationships. As of right now, there has not been much research done on this topic.\n\nThe team anonymously took to fast food restaurants to covertly observe a total of 55 interactions in a total of 15 neighborhoods within the Boston area. The majority of the groups they observed had between 1 and 3 children, of which most appeared to be school-age. The meal observation would last between 10 to 40 minutes. Over the course of the meal, the researchers would take detailed notes on the duration and frequency of use of a mobile device. They also monitored how many times the children would call for attention and how many times the caregiver would respond to the children. 15 of the 55 groups that were observed did not use any device during their mealtime, while the rest of the 40 groups’ usage ranged anywhere from brief interactions with their device to nearly continuous use throughout the entire meal, even eating and talking while staring at their device. Others would put the device down briefly to engage in other activities.\n\nBut how did the children respond to their caregivers behavior? Some of the children were already engaged in conversation or activities with another child, or playing with a toy. Their behavior did not appear to be changed by their caregivers’ device usage, especially if the usage of the device was brief. However, when the caregivers were continuously absorbed in their device, some of the children did not bother to try and get the adult’s attention, while others began to show limit-testing and provocative behaviors, at which point the caregivers would use a scolding tone of voice with the child or seemed to be insensitive to the child’s needs. Some even used physical responses, like one caregiver even kicking the child under the table, and another repeatedly pushing the child’s hand away from their face when the child tried to lift their face away from the device. While most of the time these caregivers were physically near their children, they could not have been further apart, emotionally.\n\nIt is clear that the impact of our mobile device use is effecting the relationships we keep, especially familial relationships. Overuse of mobile devices are sending a very grim message to children; that they are not worth their parent’s time, love or effort.\n\nJenny Radesky, lead author of the study acknowledges that this topic is something that is “very complicated” to study, and that the research project is limited. Her intent in writing the study was to raise questions, rather than finding answers. Her goal was to “break the ice” on the subject and start the walk down the long road of fully researching this increasingly growing problem that affects more and more families every day.\n\nSOURCE\n\n[ad]', 'A new study released today in Pediatrics gives us a better idea of what kind of impact our mobile devices have on our closest relationships, especially the ones with our children.\nResearchers examined patterns of the use of mobile devices during meals in fast food restaurants.\nOver the course of the meal, the researchers would take detailed notes on the duration and frequency of use of a mobile device.\nTheir behavior did not appear to be changed by their caregivers’ device usage, especially if the usage of the device was brief.\nIt is clear that the impact of our mobile device use is effecting the relationships we keep, especially familial relationships.']"

From higher rates of car crashes to apps for detecting eye diseases, they affect us both positively and negatively. Adding to the list of negatives, though, a new study finds that too many parents are using up valuable time at the dinner table on their phones, rather than communicating with their children sitting right in front of them.\n\n“We know from decades of research that face-t-face interactions are important for cognitive, language, and emotional development,” said study author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, according to HealthDay. “Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would’ve been a time where we would’ve seen those interactions.”\n\nStudies have shown that kids learn best through live interactions with their parents and other adults. One study found that interaction, even through video chat applications like Skype, were better than educational videos at teaching kids language and its mechanics with regards to conversation. Another study found that fathers who interacted with their children more put them at a lesser risk of behavioral problems later on. Being on a cellphone takes away a lot from time that should be better spent, especially because children tend to have inquiring minds.\n\nFor the study, researchers watched 55 random caregivers at fast food restaurants as they ate with one or more young children. They took notes about the caregivers’ behaviors, and found that 40 of the caregivers used their phones or other devices during the meal, with 16 of them using it throughout the entire meal. “The girl keeps eating, then gets up to cross the room to get more ketchup. Caregiver is not watching her do this; she is looking down at the phone…,” the notes said, according to NBC. “Still no conversation … Now girl’s head appears to be looking right at caregiver, and caregiver looks up but not at girl…”\n\nOne child’s efforts to get his father’s attention led to being reprimanded for acting up — he was singing the parody of the song “Jingle Bells,” “Jingle bells, Batman smells.” Meanwhile some of those who “appeared to accept this lack of engagement … seemed like they’d given up,” Dr. Rahil Briggs, director of pediatric behavioral health services at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, told HealthDay.\n\nAlthough the effects of parental cell phone use on their children hasn’t been explored deeply, the looks that the researchers saw on the children’s faces showed that they were affected in some way. The study, however, didn’t look into how the children were treated once they got home, and children don’t always need constant face-to-face interaction, Gedeon Deák, a cognitive science professor at the University of California, San Diego told NBC. Nevertheless, it’s important for parents to find some kind of balance between cell phone use and spending time with their kids. Cell phones are “an essential tool,” Radesky said. “What we need to do is help build guidelines for the healthiest ways to use them. It’s important for parents to have ‘off’ time where they tune in only to their child.”\n\nSource: Radesky J, Kistin C, Zuckerman B, et al.

You see them chatting on their cells while pushing their babies in strollers. You see them talking to their bosses on their headsets while playing in the sandbox with their kids at the park. You see them sending texts while chowing down on burgers and milk shakes with their children at fast-food joints. We’ve all assumed parents’ smartphone addictions can’t be good for children and now a new study confirms this to be true.\n\nA study published online today in the journal Pediatrics finds that smart phones are making us bad parents. This news isn’t surprising but might be hard to take for those moms and dads who are tethered to their cell phones and in the habit of constantly checking email.\n\nResearchers from the Boston Medical Center went undercover at 15 fast-food restaurants in the Boston area and surreptitiously observed 55 caregivers accompanied by one or more children. They took copious field notes and analyzed their findings to identify common trends around device use.\n\nForty of the parents were on their smartphones at some point while dining with their children. About one-third were engaged with a device throughout the entire meal.\n\nResearchers noticed that parents who were tapping away on their phones tended to ignore their children or they reacted harshly to their kids’ behavior. Some children seemed unfazed by the lack of parental attention, while others were clearly bothered. The engagement between children and those parents who were glued to their phones was especially negative.\n\nIn one situation, three boys loudly sang “Jingle Bells, Batman smells…” to get their father’s attention. In another, a mom never looked up from her phone while her daughter stole her brother’s chair and swung it around in the air\n\nA mother pushed away a young boy’s hand as he repeatedly tried to lift her face up from looking at a tablet screen. Another mom kicked her child’s foot under the table when he tried to divert her attention from her phone.\n\nSome parents calmed a rambunctious child with a digital device. A toddler who crawled under the table was drawn back to his seat with a tablet. In a few cases, the entire family was absorbed with their own gadget.\n\nMany studies have looked at the effects of unsafe smartphone use among drivers and pedestrians but few studies have analyzed the toll these devices have on parenting. Dr. Radesky, who is a fellow in developmental behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center, thought these devices might be distracting parents from important face-to-face time with their children. She and her team devised a study that would look at families during a meal, a daily situation when parents and their children typically talk.\n\nDr. Radesky hopes to use the study results to help the American Academy of Pediatrics develop guidelines for parents around smartphone use.\n\n“The conclusion I wouldn’t draw from the study, is that we need to completely remove these devices when we are with our children,” the study’s lead author Dr. Jenny Radesky told ABC News. “But it does raise the issue that we need to create boundaries for these devices when we are with our children.”\n\n[Time and ABC News]', 'We’ve all assumed parents’ smartphone addictions can’t be good for children and now a new study confirms this to be true.\nA study published online today in the journal Pediatrics finds that smart phones are making us bad parents.\nForty of the parents were on their smartphones at some point while dining with their children.\nShe and her team devised a study that would look at families during a meal, a daily situation when parents and their children typically talk.\nDr. Radesky hopes to use the study results to help the American Academy of Pediatrics develop guidelines for parents around smartphone use.']"

The reason? Thumbing through one’s phone incessantly could damage the parent-child bond.\n\nA new study published in the journal Pediatrics found that adults absorbed in their mobile devices were more likely to harshly scold their children’s behavior.\n\nResearchers from Boston Medical Center observed parents interacting with their children during meals in fast-food restaurants. They noted that one-third of the adults used their phones continuously during the meals, and 73 percent of them checked their devices at least once.\n\nWhen a parent who was glued to the phone was interrupted by a child, the parent was apt to react negatively, according to the study. One mother even kicked her child under the table after the child attempted to get her attention while she tapped away at her smartphone. Another mother ignored her child as he tried to lift her head from looking down at a tablet. Researchers believed the kids may have been acting out as a way to test limits or gain the parent’s attention.\n\n""What stood out was that in a subset of caregivers using the device almost through the entire meal, how negative their interactions could become with the kids,"" Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the center and lead author of the study, told Time. ""[There were] a lot of instances where there was very little interaction, harsh interaction or negative interaction between the adults and children.""\n\nShe added: ""Caregivers who were highly absorbed in their devices seemed to have more negative or less engaged interactions with children.”\n\nBefore we go pointing the finger at all parents who use their smartphones during meals, let’s keep in mind that most of us have trouble putting the mobile devices away. One British survey found that 66 percent of people are afraid to be separated from their cell phones. Another study by Time noted that 84 percent of respondents said they couldn’t go a single day without their cell phones, and 20 percent said they check their phone every 10 minutes. There’s even evidence that more and more people are using smartphones during sex.\n\nStill, researchers say their study of the effects of smartphone addiction on the parent-child dynamic is particularly important because it could have consequences for a child’s development.\n\n""We know from decades of research that face-to-face interactions are important for cognitive, language and emotional development,” Radesky told Health Day. “Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would\'ve been a time where we would\'ve seen those interactions.”\n\nResearchers say additional studies and further discussion about the use of technology around children are needed.', 'For once, it’s parents and not youngsters who are being told to get their noses out of their smartphones.\nA new study published in the journal Pediatrics found that adults absorbed in their mobile devices were more likely to harshly scold their children’s behavior.\nResearchers believed the kids may have been acting out as a way to test limits or gain the parent’s attention.\n""We know from decades of research that face-to-face interactions are important for cognitive, language and emotional development,” Radesky told Health Day.\n“Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would\'ve been a time where we would\'ve seen those interactions.”Researchers say additional studies and further discussion about the use of technology around children are needed.']"

Some caregivers kept the device out, but on the table. Others spent the meal almost entirely engrossed in the screen. And there was everything in between. But overall the more engrossed the caregiver was with a device, the more likely he or she was to ignore the children. In some cases, researchers even observed parents getting physical with their little ones who vied for their attention. One adult woman kicked a child’s foot under the table and a second female caregiver pushed a young boy’s hands away when he repeatedly tried to lift her face up from her tablet.\n\nThe more absorbed a caregiver was, the more likely they were not to react to their children’s questions, speak to their children, or make eye contact.\n\nFace-to-face interaction is often cited as an important component to child development because it is a foundation for learning language, learning how to regulate strong emotions, and developing empathy and social skills.\n\nRadesky, who is also a pediatrician and worked for a time in Seattle, one of the technology hubs of the United States, said she became increasingly concerned with the effects of technology on the development of these skills in children.\n\n“My concern is that it’s becoming such an obsessive habit that every time we have some downtime or a routine interaction we reach for our phones and we’re missing some fascinating interaction with our kids or maybe not even a fascinating one, but an interaction that their brains are wired to want from us,” she said.\n\nThe children, researchers observed, reacted to their unresponsive parents in different ways, in some cases accepting the lack of engagement and entertaining themselves -- or in other cases becoming more and more disruptive hoping to recapture their caregiver’s attention.\n\nAs a parent herself with two young kids and a hyperactive email, Radesy said she is acutely aware that devices are woven into our daily lives. According to The Pew Research Internet Project, 91 percent of the American population owns a cell phone and nearly two-thirds of them use their device to go online.\n\n“It’s not the purpose of this study to say not to use devices around our kids, because there is some good to their use,” she said citing evidence that technology can be an effective tool for education. “But what is now perhaps becoming a cultural or family norm doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a good thing.\n\nRadesky said she hopes this study opens the door for continued research into the potential effects of device use and child development such as if device use relates to obesity.', '“Like a lot of people I know, I was observing a lot of interesting behavior in public, parents using devices a lot and kids trying to get their attention,” Radesky said.\n“Their interactions were very fascinating to me.”The team found that 40 of the 55 interactions involved use of a mobile device and the interactions varied.\nIn some cases, researchers even observed parents getting physical with their little ones who vied for their attention.\nAs a parent herself with two young kids and a hyperactive email, Radesy said she is acutely aware that devices are woven into our daily lives.\n“But what is now perhaps becoming a cultural or family norm doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a good thing.']"

Radesky, MD, of Boston Medical Center, and colleagues.\n\n""Although detailed analysis of interpersonal interactions was beyond the scope of this study, we did find it striking that during caregiver absorption with devices, some children appeared to accept the lack of engagement and entertained themselves, whereas others showed increasing bids for attention that were often answered with negative parent responses,"" they wrote in Pediatrics.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises physicians to discuss screen time, but that is usually in the context of the patient using the screen, pointed out Ari Brown, MD, a pediatrician at 411 Pediatrics in Austin, Texas. But the AAP policy statement on media use under age 2 does state that ""background media,"" or screen time intended for the parent and not the child, can also have detrimental effects on the child, she added.\n\n""The broader conversation should also go over the parent or caretaker\'s screen time,"" Brown told MedPage Today.\n\n""It\'s time for parents to be aware that their own screen use needs to be limited when their child is around. It only takes a minute with a caretaker\'s eyes and attention elsewhere for a little kid to get into trouble -- [it\'s] a safety risk,"" Brown said.\n\nRadesky and colleagues spent time in fast-food restaurants in 15 neighborhoods in Boston during July and August 2013, and watched a total of 55 caregivers eat with children ranging in age from infants to elementary school age.\n\n""This method of direct, nonparticipant observation is common in the field of anthropology,"" Radesky\'s group wrote. ""The purpose of this approach is to identify cultural patterns and generate hypotheses for additional investigation.""\n\nMedian incomes for the neighborhoods ranged from $45,604 to $108,686. Two caregivers were present for 41.8% of the observations, and the rest involved one caregiver. Almost half of the families had only one child present. About 44% of the caregivers were estimated to be in their 30s. The length of the meals observed ranged from 10 minutes to about 40 minutes.\n\nOf the 55 caregivers observed, 40 engaged with a mobile device during the meal. Radesky and colleagues defined ""absorption"" as ""primary focus of the caregiver\'s attention and engagement was with the device rather than the child."" The researchers calculated absorption based on frequency, duration, and modality of use, against attempts to get attention from a child, and the responses to those attempts from the caregiver.\n\nContinuous engagement with the device was observed in 16 caregivers, which included both sole caregivers and those with another adult present, men and women, and individuals of all age groups.\n\nContinuous use was typically in the form of typing or swiping the screen. Phone calls did constitute use, but caregivers were more likely to make eye contact with the child during a phone call than when they were engaged with the device screen.\n\nIn the case of one absorbed caregiver, the child\'s bid for attention was met with a kick under the table. With another, the child was trying to pull the caregiver\'s face away from the screen, and the caregiver physically pushed the child\'s hands away from her face.\n\n""These findings warrant additional study but are an important first step in the study of how device technology affects the daily interactions that are so important to child development,"" the authors stated.\n\nAreas to explore include how caregivers conceptualize their mobile device use and the impact of ""present absence,"" or when a person is physically present but his or her thoughts are elsewhere, the group suggested.\n\nBrown noted that distracted parenting may be ""dangerous"" as distracted driving. ""When the caretaker has his or her eyes on a screen of any kind, there is less talk time and interaction, and over time, it can take a toll on fostering a child\'s development,"" she said.\n\nAlthough this study was in young children, Brown added that mobile device absorption by caregivers in front of teens is also a problem. ""Teens need attention from their parents as much as young children do ... it is hard to expect a teen to avoid texting and driving, or being addicted to their smartphone if they watch their parents doing these things. It is an implicit endorsement.""\n\nThe study was funded by The Joel and Barbara Alpert Endowment for the Children of the City and Boston University School of Medicine.

Before mobile devices existed, mealtime would\'ve been a time where we would\'ve seen those interactions,"" said study author Dr. Jenny Radesky, a fellow in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at Boston Medical Center according to Philly.\n\nFor this study, the researchers examined a total of 55 groups of people who were eating at fast food restaurants throughout the Boston-area in Massachusetts. The groups were made up of at least one adult and at least one child who appeared to be younger than 10. The researchers observed the interaction between the adult and the child, including whenever the caregiver used a smartphone.\n\nRadesky\'s team found that 40 of the caregivers had taken their phone out at some time throughout the meal. A few of them had placed the phones on the tables but did not check them. Nine caregivers had checked their phones intermittingly. Another small group of caregivers held onto their phones while performing other tasks. The last group made up of 16 caregivers, however, used their phones constantly throughout the meal. These adults were focused on their devices while eating and talking.\n\n""What stood out was that in a subset of caregivers using the device almost through the entire meal, how negative their interactions could become with the kids,"" Radesky stated according to TIME.\n\nWhen the researchers analyzed the children, they found that many of the children of caregivers who rarely used their smartphones were able to entertain themselves. These kids were busy eating, playing with a toy or talking to another child or other children at their table. Children of caregivers who were absorbed in their phones, however, acted differently. The researchers noted that some of the kids appeared to act up in order to seek attention. These moments were initially ignored by the caregivers, followed by scolding in some of the cases.\n\n""Children are going to get X amount of your attention every day.

In this observational study of caregivers and children during public mealtimes, caregiver absorption with mobile devices was a common theme among observed interactions.\n\n2. Caregivers absorbed in mobile device use often responded harshly to child behaviors during mealtimes.\n\nStudy Rundown: While mobile devices are now well-integrated into our daily lives, studies have yet to address the implications of device use on family dynamics. This study lays the groundwork for future research by investigating patterns in mobile device use among caregivers and their children while eating a meal, a time in which person-to-person interaction is typical. Through anonymous, direct observation of caregivers with children at mealtimes, researchers found a dominant theme: caregiver absorption with their device. The greatest extent of absorption occurred with continuous use that consisted of swiping and typing. Caregivers who successfully balanced their attention between the device and their child were apt to use their device for brief time periods with a specific purpose, followed by removal of the device from the setting. Though this study is limited by its small sample size, observational study design leading to a lack of quantitative analysis, and observer interpretation bias, it is the first to document patterns of mobile device use among caregivers with their children in a natural setting and raises many questions for future investigative studies.\n\nClick to read the study in Pediatrics\n\nRelevant Reading: Parenting Behaviors, Perceptions and Psychosocial Risk: Impacts on Young Children’s Development\n\nStudy Author, Dr. Jenny S.

We found that caregivers who were highly absorbed with devices seemed to have less conversation, or sometimes more conflict, with the children in their care. This is relevant to trainees who might counsel families to have some “unplugged” time with each other daily, or might encounter patients/parents becoming very absorbed with devices while we try to talk to them in clinic.\n\nIn-Depth [Naturalistic, anonymous observational study]: Researchers observed children and their caregivers in fast food restaurants in 15 neighborhoods in the Boston area on 55 occasions. Ninety children, estimated to be 0-10 years of age were observed, with 54 estimated to be “school aged,” 14 categorized as preschoolers, 16 as toddlers, and 6 as infants. Researchers had backgrounds in either child development or anthropology, and had additional training in anthropologic field study methods. Fifty-eight percent of caregiver-child groups had 1 caregiver present and 49% of caregiver-child groups had 1 child. Of the 78 observed caregivers, 16 used their devices continuously and 15 did not bring out a device at all during the meal. Researchers categorized absorption by considering frequency, duration and modality of device use (finger swiping, typing compared and taking phone calls), the response of caregivers to children’s behavior, and mobile device viewing patterns (separately or together). Adults with the highest device absorption showed longer latency in responding to bids for attention and directed their gaze primarily at their device while responding to children. Many children exhibited limit testing or provocative behaviors while adults were absorbed, and these adults initially ignored the behavior then followed with scolding or physical responses (kicking a child’s foot under the table, pushing a boy’s hands away as he was trying to lift the caregiver’s face up from the tablet screen).\n\nMore from this author: Bullying associated with poorer health among middle school children, Caffeine intake among youth remains stable, but sources vary\n\n©2012-2014 2minutemedicine.com.

4268,http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/11/sanjay-gupta-s-pot-pilgrimage-for-pain-relief.html,health,"['Last summer, CNN made media waves by running Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s one-hour documentary WEED, where he followed a child named Charlotte and her family on their quest to quell her seizures. Their journey brought them, and Dr. Gupta, to medical marijuana.\n\nIt’s a journey Gupta continues to pursue, with his new documentary, WEED 2: Cannabis Madness.\n\nWhen the first WEED aired, Dr. Gupta apologized, sincerely repentant for having poo-pooed the medicinal benefits of cannabis.\n\nToday, he’s still apologetic. “You have to go for the truth,” Dr. Gupta tells The Daily Beast. “I made the mistake [of being anti-cannabis], and I was wrong.”\n\nAnd so WEED 2 continues his repentance, examining the science of the plant. This time he follows Vivian Wilson, a two-year-old girl suffering from 75 seizures a day, and her family’s struggle to find medical marijuana that eases them.\n\nIt’s stories like Vivian’s that have inspired Dr. Gupta’s quest to discover the science behind the madness surrounding cannabis. “I am not backing down on medical marijuana,” he writes in a recent CNN op-ed. “I am doubling down.”\n\nA big part of WEED 2 is spent confronting the traditionally held anti-pot beliefs that he, as a doctor, used to have, and that are frequently brought up as the opposing viewpoint in media, such as marijuana’s impact on the developing brain, and the belief that marijuana can cause psychosis in young people.\n\nWEED 2 shows Vivian as she has a seizure, and is administered her traditional medication. She goes from bright and happy, to seizure, to zombie after the meds take effect. Existing epilepsy and seizure drugs, Dr. Gupta explains to The Daily Beast, have only been studied on adults and are used off-label on children. While some might argue that we don’t know the long-term effects of marijuana on a child, the same is true for the legal drugs we are already giving them for diseases like epilepsy.\n\nGupta also says it’s “unclear” if marijuana causes the psychosis, or if, perhaps, young people already suffering from some sort of psychiatric problem are using marijuana to self-medicate. He stresses there needs to be more studies—but under U.S. law, he points out and examines in WEED 2, those studies are nearly impossible to conduct.\n\nThe documentary explores disparities in U.S. government research on cannabis, and dives into revolutionary discoveries in other countries, including an exclusive look inside GW Pharmaceuticals, the UK company making cannabis into a prescription drug.\n\nGupta compares the current reefer madness to the madness people had when transplanting organs was a new (and scary) medical practice. He tells The Daily Beast that people thought transplanting organs “was sacrilege.” The prohibition on cannabis and medical research seems to be the result of the same type of zealous fear. Cannabis prohibition, he says, “defies logic, from a scientific standpoint. There are other issues that drove [marijuana prohibition], but science was not one of them.”\n\nThe Federal government treats cannabis as a “Schedule I” controlled substance—meaning it’s dangerous and has no medical use. Gupta points out that even methamphetamine and cocaine are recognized for their therapeutic value as “Schedule II” drugs.\n\n“There is nothing accurate about the scheduling of marijuana,” he says.\n\nWEED 2 also moves full force into Colorado, where “cannabis refugees” are moving—not for themselves, but for their sick children. The doc shows dozens of families from Ohio, Alabama, and New Jersey who have made a huge life change, leaving friends and families behind, to seek out hope and healing for their children when Western medicine has fallen short.\n\nGupta’s new doc shines a light on the Gordian knot of U.S. bureaucracy, pitting states against the Federal government, science against politics, and agency against agency.\n\nBut what can be done in the interim, while the knot is being undone?\n\nGupta is careful to stay away from lobbying and politics (though the first WEED has been quite influential in that regard), but he tells The Daily Beast that the Federal government could permit “compassionate care” to allow some of the obstacles to medical marijuana treatment “to be immediately broken down” so families wouldn’t have to uproot their lives by moving to Colorado to treat their sick kids.\n\nIn addition, Gupta says there is much more research to be done. “You’d want this to go through a real process so you can understand what dose to take, and it’s treated like a real medicine.” Gupta said patients are resorting to trial and error, and they are forced to discover proper dosage on their own. Pause for a moment to consider having to figure out the correct dose of antibiotic or chemotherapy to take, on your own, for your child.\n\nIf the documentary has one message, it’s that there is a science to the benefits of marijuana, and “It’s been there a long time,” says Gupta.\n\nWhen asked about medical marijuana prisoners, such as the case of patient Jerry Duval who is serving a 10-year sentence in Federal prison, Gupta responded: “When we take pride in the United States, it’s because things like that don’t happen in this country. But when someone is taking their medicine, recommended by a doctor, [and is incarcerated for it]… we have arrived at a place where politics trumps science, and that takes us back to the dark ages.”\n\n“It’s important to me that people understand how [cannabis] works,” he says of WEED 2. “I think most people will feel educated and smarter” after seeing it.\n\nWEED 2: Cannabis Madness: Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports premieres on CNN Tuesday, March 11 at 10 pm ET.', 'Their journey brought them, and Dr. Gupta, to medical marijuana.\n“You have to go for the truth,” Dr. Gupta tells The Daily Beast.\n“I am not backing down on medical marijuana,” he writes in a recent CNN op-ed.\nExisting epilepsy and seizure drugs, Dr. Gupta explains to The Daily Beast, have only been studied on adults and are used off-label on children.\nWEED 2: Cannabis Madness: Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports premieres on CNN Tuesday, March 11 at 10 pm ET.']"

4270,http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/stateroundup/ahead-in-polls-medical-marijuana-holds-high-ground-in-ad-war/2169384,health,"['Medical marijuana is not only doing well in public opinion surveys, but it could get an unexpected and unintended boost from its most high-profile opponent: Gov. Rick Scott.\n\nIn an ironic twist, Scott\'s re-election campaign is set to spark such a mammoth TV ad war that it threatens to reduce the supply of available commercial advertising time, drive up the price of commercials and, therefore, make it tougher for outgunned antidrug crusaders to get out their message.\n\n""In an environment such as that, message-penetration can be challenging for anyone who doesn\'t have a lot of money,"" said Kyle Roberts, president of Virginia-based Smart Media Group, one of the nation\'s premier political ad-buying firms.\n\nThe estimated $150 million that could be spent — $100 million from Scott and Republicans; $50 million from Democrat Charlie Crist — ""can cause a lot of voter confusion when it comes to other issues on the ballot,"" Roberts said.\n\nMedical marijuana is so popular in Florida that 78 percent of likely voters in Republican-controlled state Senate districts back the idea, according to a recent state GOP poll obtained by the Miami Herald.\n\nThe survey echoes two others last month that found support for medical marijuana ranging from 64 percent to 70 percent — results consistent with every major Florida public poll released in the past year.\n\nOpponents of medical marijuana have one major advantage, however: It takes 60 percent voter approval — a high bar — to pass a constitutional amendment in Florida.\n\nSo far, 20 states and Washington, D.C., have decriminalized marijuana, most for medical reasons.\n\nThe Republican state Senate district poll, conducted last month by the Tarrance Group, found that 47 percent of likely voters favored outright legalization and 48 percent opposed legalization. And voters strongly backed lighter prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n\nIn a nod to the popularity of the issue — and his own struggles in public opinion surveys — Scott hasn\'t crusaded against the proposed amendment. He said he\'s opposed to the medical marijuana initiative because he\'s against illegal drugs. However, he hasn\'t explained why he would oppose legalized marijuana if it\'s shown to have real medical benefits.\n\nDespite the trends in favor of marijuana decriminalization in one form or another, some surveys show, the argument that medical marijuana leads to complete legalization can be a potent tool to defeat the proposed amendment.\n\nBut to get their message out effectively, opponents need to advertise on TV in Florida due to the state\'s large size and diverse media markets. And ads are expensive.\n\nIt can cost a political candidate nearly $2 million a week to run enough statewide ads so that the average viewer sees them 10 times. For political committees, the cost of such a media buy can be about double what it costs candidates, who get the lowest-priced rates.\n\nAlso, due to the broad array of TV choices and channels, voters are tougher to reach and persuade nowadays, requiring ever-more sophisticated efforts to identify the right way and time to reach them.\n\nAdd it all together — the lack of ad time, the higher costs and the popular polling for medical-marijuana — and antidrug crusaders know they face a tough campaign.\n\nBut they\'re still going to try, according to Lana Beck, spokeswoman with St. Petersburg-based Drug Free America Foundation Inc. and Save Our Society From Drugs, the lead organizations opposed to the amendment along with law-enforcement agencies.\n\n""We will be educating at the grass roots level,"" Beck said.\n\nJohn Morgan hopes the opposition stays that way.\n\n""If this is a word-of-mouth campaign, a grass roots effort, we win,"" said Morgan, an Orlando trial lawyer funding and leading the effort through his group People United for Medical Marijuana.\n\nMorgan has a secret weapon: the $20 million in TV ad time he reserves annually for his Morgan & Morgan firm, which employs Crist. Morgan said he\'s prepared to swap out some of his firm\'s air time for ads for medical marijuana should he need to.\n\nFor years, the GOP-led Legislature has blocked and even refused to hear bills on the topic.\n\nBut this year, Republican lawmakers have backed a bipartisan bill that would legalize a strain of marijuana for people with severe epilepsy. But it doesn\'t address other so-called debilitating ailments — such as cancer, AIDS or glaucoma — targeted by the constitutional amendment.\n\nThe Senate poll indicated support for Charlotte\'s Web stood at 79 percent in favor, 18 percent opposed — mirroring support for the broader medical marijuana effort. Compared with a similar GOP Senate poll in April, support shifted a net 24 percentage points in favor of Charlotte\'s Web.\n\nVoters by 65-28 percent favored reducing prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and, by 78-15 percent, they supported prison diversion programs for those convicted of nonviolent crimes.\n\nSome Democrats, such as state Sen. Dwight Bullard of Miami, want to legalize marijuana outright, as Washington state and Colorado did.\n\nThat bill has a slim chance of passing in the Legislature. Even Morgan, a Democrat, opposes the Democratic legalization effort because, he said, it could be used as a political weapon by opponents who say the medical marijuana amendment is a Trojan horse for recreational pot use.', ""Medical marijuana is not only doing well in public opinion surveys, but it could get an unexpected and unintended boost from its most high-profile opponent: Gov.\nOpponents of medical marijuana have one major advantage, however: It takes 60 percent voter approval — a high bar — to pass a constitutional amendment in Florida.\nHe said he's opposed to the medical marijuana initiative because he's against illegal drugs.\nMorgan said he's prepared to swap out some of his firm's air time for ads for medical marijuana should he need to.\nThe Senate poll indicated support for Charlotte's Web stood at 79 percent in favor, 18 percent opposed — mirroring support for the broader medical marijuana effort.""]"

Josh has been fighting from the fatal adenovirus after undergoing a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nThe drug - Brincidofovir (CMX001) is not expected to win approval for public use until 2016 and Chimerix has not confirmed as to how much the drug might cost per dose, according to a report in Sacramento Bee.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Chimerix has distributed the drug to as many as 430 patients. But since then it have stopped its compassionate care program as the drug has reached advanced stages of testing and development.\n\n""Getting the drug approved - to where it would be widely available and covered by insurance - must be a drug developer\'s priority, even if it means turning down requests from people who need the drug. This is an ethical dilemma of substance. We are heartstricken about this child,"" said Kenneth Moch, Chimerix CEO.\n\nThe Hardy family, who was one of the trending topics on Twitter on Monday, intends to telecast a protest at the headquarters of the drug company with an aim to break the company\'s corporate will.\n\n""This is the first time people have tried to use this kind of pressure. If we were to make this drug available for Josh Hardy, then others could make the same request. Could we say \'no\' to them? Wouldn\'t they start a similar campaign?"" said Moch.\n\nThe family is requesting Chimerix to continue with their established compassionate care program through which pharmaceutical companies used to distribute under developing medications to critically ill patients who have no other option left for treatment. However, the treatment carries risk as these medicines may lead to severe side effects or may be ineffective.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to permit such an emergency in less than a day, but to qualify the grant, the patient has to suffer a life threatening disease with no treatment options.\n\n""Compassionate use involves unidentified risk and may create a false sense of hope in patients,"" according to the standards set by the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical firm. ""Compassionate use also can negatively impact the operations of new or ongoing clinical studies and subsequently delay the approval of a new medication."" He added.\n\nBrincidofovir is available only to limited number of patients. Patients who have previously undergone clinical trials on the drug were only the ones suffering from pox viruses or newborns infected with herpes simplex virus, the drug company clarified.\n\nJosh\'s infection raised another obstacle with the use of the drug Brincidofovir, as the antiviral drug was developed to prevent infection and not treat them. On that ground, it is not clear whether the drug would help Josh recover, explained Moch.\n\nAgreeing to public appeals could undermine the growth of experimental drugs and hamper the health care system that favors some over others, according to Arthur Caplan, Head of the Medical Ethics Division, NYU Langone Medical Center.\n\n(Edited by Anu James)', ""A Durham-based drug company has recently grabbed national attention as it has declined to donate its potential lifesaving drug to a critically ill 7-year-old boy.\nBetween 2009 and 2012, Chimerix has distributed the drug to as many as 430 patients.\nThe Hardy family, who was one of the trending topics on Twitter on Monday, intends to telecast a protest at the headquarters of the drug company with an aim to break the company's corporate will.\nIf we were to make this drug available for Josh Hardy, then others could make the same request.\nPatients who have previously undergone clinical trials on the drug were only the ones suffering from pox viruses or newborns infected with herpes simplex virus, the drug company clarified.""]"

But when a representative from the Max Cure Foundation offered to cover the cost, Moch rebuffed him, apparently citing the ethics of the situation.\n\nAn NYU bioethicist said that companies can also be resistant to compassionate care exceptions because they can skew the drug trials:\n\nIt\'s not just the $50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish, Caplan said, but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad. By definition, compassionate use patients are extremely sick, and might not do well with the drug. Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug.\n\nBut the bad press eventually outweighed those concerns, and the company found a workaround: today Chimerix announced Josh will be the first patient in a new clinical trial that is set to start tomorrow.\n\n""I\'m happy for Josh and I\'m happy for many patients,"" Moch told CNN.

Personal photo\n\nSt. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital said it had been notified by Chimerix that it would receive brincidofovir within the next 48 hours to treat Josh\'s adenovirus.\n\n""This drug is experimental and has not yet been approved by the FDA and the safety and effectiveness of the medication has not yet been established for use in children,"" the hospital said in a statement.\n\nThe drug will be administered under a new treatment protocol as approved by a committee charged with compliance to federal and institutional regulations for clinical research, it said.\n\n""It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,"" it said.\n\n\n\nJosh, who is from Fredericksburg, Va., was diagnosed with cancer in his kidneys while he was 9 months old, said Staton, and he has defeated it three more times since.\n\nLast November, doctors determined he needed a bone marrow transplant due to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. It is a tough-to-treat disease of the blood and bone marrow that occurs following chemotherapy or radiation that prevents blood stem cells from maturing into healthy cells, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThe bone marrow transplant took place in January at St. Jude Children\'s Research Hospital.\n\nJosh was in a coma for 16 days after, his grandmother said, and once he came out of it, he developed a gastrointestinal adenovirus, which is a family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from respiratory infections to fever, diarrhea, pink eye, bladder infections and rashes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPeople with weakened immune system are at higher risk from getting sick from an adenovirus infection.\n\nAccording to a March 5 letter from Dr. Victor Santana, associate director for clinical research at St. Jude -- which was posted on the ""SaveJosh"" Facebook page -- conventional treatments have not fought off the virus, and the boy\'s life is in danger.\n\nHe wrote that St. Jude approached Chimerix on Feb. 12 with a compassionate-use application for brincidofovir, but the request was denied. Afterwards, the hospital tried standard treatment but it led to kidney failure and Josh needed dialysis.\n\nSantana expressed concern that after having fought childhood cancer for so long, Josh might succumb to the virus that was increasing in his body.\n\nIn the statement issued late Tuesday, Moch said: ""This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix\'s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need - for everyone.

The family’s only hope was a drug brincidofovir, that was still in clinical trials and not approved by the FDA to be used openly.\n\nJosh was 9 months old when he was first diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it.\n\nBut after a bone marrow transplant Josh’s immune system weakened and last year doctors detected an infection of adenovirus spreading in his body.\n\nThey gave him an antiviral drug, an intravenous form of brincidofovir, but it ravaged his kidneys.\n\nDoctors at the St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital had been part of the study of this particular drug and assured the family that if the intravenous dosage had failed, the one given orally could be given without damaging the kidneys. They proceeded to ask the manufacturers Chimerix Inc. to use the experimental drug.\n\nTwice the doctors at St. Jude’s requested that Josh be granted permission to use the drug, and both times the company turned them down stating that they were not “in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources.”\n\nThe internet went crazy. Concerned members of ‘Josh’s Army’ responded with angry tweets to @chimerix, telling them to “open their hearts,” asking the executives how they can sleep at night.\n\nOthers have begun sending mails to board members. Chimerix executives say they have also received death threats.\n\nThe company stood firm noting that they were “going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016, and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases, it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug, brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone.”\n\nBut in a turn of events Chimerix, Inc. today announced through a press release that it has reached agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the immediate initiation of a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for the treatment of adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. FDA has committed to work expeditiously with Chimerix on the design of a pivotal Phase 3 study that would be a continuation of this pilot study. Josh Hardy’s story brought to public attention the often-devastating impact of adenovirus infection, and helped accelerate a discussion between the FDA and Chimerix regarding the need for additional clinical development to assess brincidofovir’s potential in adenovirus infection. This study is expected to begin with Josh Hardy as the first patient enrolled on Wednesday, March 12, 2014.\n\n“This 20-patient open-label study underscores Chimerix’s mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need – for everyone,” said Kenneth I. Moch, President & CEO of Chimerix. “Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections.” “We are pleased to be providing access to brincidofovir in a manner consistent with our focus on progressing clinical development toward a potential regulatory approval that would make it widely available to patients who might benefit from its use,” said Hervé Momméja-Marin, M.D., Vice President, Clinical Research of Chimerix. “We are grateful to the FDA for their continuous guidance and assistance in expediting brincidofovir’s development path forward.”\n\nWe pray that this will be the answer this family is looking for to heal their son.

It seems Chimerix has encountered this question before regarding Brincidofovir, the drug that the boy\'s family seeks to help fight a life-threatening viral infection.\n\nOn its site, Chimerix says it has received ""hundreds"" of requests for ""compassionate use"" of the drug, a situation that it says requires the company to work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It has offered up the drug for patients who have requested it in the past, but only in conjunction with ongoing tests, which are in a lull right now.\n\n""Making an experimental drug available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail the approval of that drug,"" the company\'s Website says. ""Providing Brincidofovir in any of these situations, where there is currently limited evidence to suggest that our experimental medicine would be helpful, could very likely place the entire development program at risk.""\n\nThe company even has an email address set aside for compassionate use requests of Brincidofovir: compassionateuserequest@chimerix.com.\n\nFurther, it points to a paper from the trade group Biotechnology Industry Organization, which outlines the history of cases like those involving Josh. In its April 2010 paper, the group agrees that early access to program could create a conflict between the needs of a few against those of large patient populations and their need to have the drug approved swiftly.\n\nThe paper says: ""A patient\'s right to treatment based on his or her autonomous decision-making ability does not supersede a company\'s ethical responsibility to develop and market safe and effective products as fast as possible.""\n\nSpokespersons from Chimerix or Biotechnology Industry Organization did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTo recap, Josh has survived four bouts with cancer, but his weakened immune system contracted a life-threatening virus after he underwent a bone-marrow transplant. His parents are pleading with Chimerix to provide Brincidofovir to their boy but the company is reluctant because it has received hundreds of requests for compassionate use of the drug, which would delay development and approval for it.

By Tuesday night, though, Moch had found a way to give the treatment to the 7-year-old after all, as part of the clinical development program for the drug.\n\nAccording to Moch, the FDA has agreed to let Chimerix ($CMRX) immediately launch a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients. Hardy will be the first patient provided the therapy on Wednesday morning. And the company says that regulators have agreed to help design a pivotal Phase III study that could be launched as a continuation of this pilot.\n\nA battery of national media groups like CNN, Fox and USA Today churned up a blizzard of stories about Hardy\'s plight, putting Moch--and his protests that the company couldn\'t provide the drug under a compassionate use program without triggering hundreds more such demands--under intense scrutiny. But instead of throwing in the towel and simply handing over the therapy, he went for the ""pilot"" compromise to put an end to the controversy.\n\n""Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make,"" Moch said in a statement. ""It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections,"" Moch says.\n\nMoch remains in a tight spot. The company, which is publicly traded, has said it can\'t commit to a charitable program to give the drug away to desperate patients because it couldn\'t afford the cost. But the media storm was a public relations disaster, making the company look indifferent to a child\'s last hope of staying alive. Satisfying its financial responsibilities to stay focused on R&D and gaining public trust about its priorities takes some finesse.\n\nBiotechs, of course, don\'t design drug studies and recruit patients this way. The boy is extremely sick and may not respond, raising questions about what Chimerix is developing. And what happens when the next compassionate use case hits the headlines? There is a limit to the number of pilot studies that can be launched. But as long as the focus is on this boy and his fate, none of that matters so much.\n\n- here\'s the release', ""According to Moch, the FDA has agreed to let Chimerix ($CMRX) immediately launch a pilot trial of open-label brincidofovir for adenovirus infections in immunocompromised patients.\nAnd the company says that regulators have agreed to help design a pivotal Phase III study that could be launched as a continuation of this pilot.\nBut the media storm was a public relations disaster, making the company look indifferent to a child's last hope of staying alive.\nThe boy is extremely sick and may not respond, raising questions about what Chimerix is developing.\nBut as long as the focus is on this boy and his fate, none of that matters so much.""]"

Chimerix, a drug company based in Durham, North Carolina, is receiving unwanted national attention for refusing to donate an antiviral drug called brincidofovir to seven-year old Josh Hardy.\n\nJosh was diagnosed with kidney cancer when he was just nine-months old. He also had cancer in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow but he survived all of them. A bone marrow transplant, however, left him with a weak immune system and this raised a concern when doctors found adenovirus spreading throughout his body. Adenovirus is an acute infection that can be fatal for people with a compromised immune system.\n\n""Normally, Josh\'s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,"" Josh\'s mother Aimee Hardy wrote on CaringBridge.org. ""The challenge is his immune system can\'t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance.""\n\nDoctors recommended that Josh receive the oral form of the antiviral drug brincidofovir as it was found effective in clearing up adenovirus in children in as little as one to two weeks. The problem, however, is that drug has not yet been approved by the FDA so the doctors would have to ask for the drug from the company that makes it, Chimerix, Inc. The drug company, however, didn\'t grant the request.\n\nChimerix used to give brincidofovir to patients who needed the medication in the past but it already stopped the practice. In a statement posted on its website, the company pointed out the implications of making the drug accessible while still in its experimental phase.\n\n""Making an experimental drug available outside of controlled clinical trials has the potential to slow or derail the approval of that drug,"" Chimerix said. ""Providing brincidofovir in any of these situations, where there is currently limited evidence to suggest that our experimental medicine would be helpful, could very likely place the entire development program at risk. The successful completion of SUPPRESS is the primary focus and mission of our small company.""\n\nIn an effort to convince Chimerix to allow Josh to receive the experimental drug under a so-called compassionate use program, in which a seriously ill patient is granted access to an unapproved drug, the Hardy family launched a campaign asking people to help them persuade the company to provide Josh the much needed drug.\n\n""Our son will die without this drug,"" said Josh\'s father, Todd Hardy.

7737,http://blog.seattlepi.com/mommyfiles/2014/03/11/pharmaceutical-company-refuses-to-help-dying-boy/,health,"['The parents of 7-year-old cancer survivor Josh Hardy are speaking to the media and urging people to demand that a North Carolina pharmaceutical company provide their son with a potentially life-saving antiviral medication. The family has rallied thousands of people across the country to sign petitions, send Tweets and make phone calls begging Durham-based Chimerax to provide their son with the experimental drug Brincidofovir.\n\nAfter a bone-marrow transplant, Josh’s immune system was ravaged and he developed a viral infection. Now, he’s fighting for his life in a hospital bed at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. His doctor says the medication developed by Chimerix would allow the boy to survive.\n\nBrincidofovir is in early development stages and unapproved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the FDA will allow patients who are in life-threatening situations and who tried other medications to ask a pharmaceutical company for an experimental drug. In many cases, companies say yes. “The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013,” according to CNN.\n\nBut Chimerix president and CEO Kenneth Moch is denying the Hardys’ requesti. Moch says he receives many compassionate use requests, and if he fulfilled Josh’s request he’d have to help others like him, slowing down the drug’s approval process. Moch says the drug is in trials and on track to eventually become available to many people.\n\n“We have have great compassion for this family,” Moch says. “But this is not just about a single boy.”\n\nThe Hardys and their team of supporters aren’t taking no for an answer. They’ve started a Change.org petition and launched a Save Josh Facebook page that has over 18,000 fans.\n\nThe outpouring and compassion for this child is incredible and Josh’s Mother and Father are the driving force behind it all and\n\nAt 9 months old, Josh was diagnosed with a rare cancer that effects only 15 kids a year. As a result of his treatments, he developed a bone marrow disorder and last year he underwent chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. These treatments led to more complications and in January he was admitted to the ICU for heart failure. Five days later he was put on a ventilator. Just when Josh was improving, his body became plagued by an adenovirus and doctors treated him with a medicine that damaged his kidneys. Doctors recommended switching to Brincidofovir, an antiviral drug manufactured by Chimerix that is still in trial form. Other children treated with the drug had their adenovirus clear up within two weeks.\n\nChimerix has denied the Hardy family’s compassionate use request for Brincidofovir because the drug is in phase-three clinical development. Early in the drug’s development, the company responded to these types of requests but two years ago the CEO decided that his 54-person company needed to stop focusing its efforts on compassionate use requests, which typically cost them $50,000 a patient, and move forward full force on earning FDA approval.\n\nAccording to CNN:\n\nFrom 2009 to 2012, the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients, Moch said, but at least at that time, the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along. But currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market.\n\nMoch says the drug will likely be available in 2016.\n\nMoch’s reasoning is logical, but when you’re a parent of a child whose life is on the line, none of this matters. A writer over at the Huffington Post explains why parents will do anything to help their children:\n\nKnowing all sides of this case, and even as a biased parent whose daughter lost her life to cancer, when you have the ability to save a child’s life, you do it, no matter what. To me, and many people out there, the answer is simple, if you can afford it or not, if you have to go against your principles or not, whether there are consequences to reputation or not, you do whatever is necessary to save the life of a child. Period.\n\n[CNN and USA Today]', 'Moch says he receives many compassionate use requests, and if he fulfilled Josh’s request he’d have to help others like him, slowing down the drug’s approval process.\nMoch says the drug is in trials and on track to eventually become available to many people.\nThey’ve started a Change.org petition and launched a Save Josh Facebook page that has over 18,000 fans.\nChimerix has denied the Hardy family’s compassionate use request for Brincidofovir because the drug is in phase-three clinical development.\nBut currently doctors don’t really learn very much, if anything, from compassionate use patients, so the patients don’t help get the drug to market.']"

The drug isn’t on the market yet, but could be administered under a “compassionate use” exception from the Food and Drug Administration. The situation is a lot more complex than “big mean company keeps drug away from little kid.” Update: Chimerix and the FDA found a way to let Josh Hardy access the drug.\n\nThe 7-year-old is currently being treated at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital. He’s been seriously ill since he was an infant, eventually going into remission from cancer that began in his kidneys and spread to other parts of his body. He has received a bone marrow transplant, and is critically ill from a virus that people who aren’t on anti-rejection drugs would fight off easily. The drug that he needs to defeat the virus without further destroying his kidneys is the oral form of an antiviral called brincidofovir. The problem is that oral brincidofovir, made by a company called Chimerix, isn’t supposed to go on the market until 2016.\n\nDrugs that are still considered “experimental” can go to patients who will die without them: during earlier phases of testing the drug, Chimerix granted hundreds of exceptions. They ended that program, and say that they will not make any more exceptions. One company executive told CNN that even employees’ own family members who could benefit from the drug can’t get it.\n\nThe company claims that evaluating compassionate use cases and manufacturing the drug for those patients wouldn’t be an effective use of company resources. Chimerix only has fifty employees. They estimate that it costs $50,000 to provide it to one patient, since insurance generally doesn’t cover experimental treatments. Spending staff hours and money on compassionate use cases means that time and money can’t be spent getting the product on the market.\n\nThe argument from Chimerix effectively is, “If we give the drug to Josh, we’ll have to consider every other patient who could benefit, too.” If the company makes one exception due to a social media campaign, would hundreds of other such campaigns follow?\n\nBioethicist Art Caplan tells CNN that a compromise is possible: the company could consider taking on a limited number of compassionate use cases each year, or limiting them to the most dire cases.\n\nUpdate, 9:30 PM: Chimerix and the FDA have found a way to let the drug be used in this case: they announced a new clinical trial that will begin tomorrow and enroll Josh Hardy as the first subject. The trial will let the company use the drug on future patients with compromised immune systems who are infected with adenoviruses.\n\nCompany denies drug to dying child [CNN]\n\nSave Josh [Facebook]', 'Most people would be appalled to hear that a pharmaceutical company is withholding a potentially life-saving drug from a dying 7-year-old child.\nThe drug isn’t on the market yet, but could be administered under a “compassionate use” exception from the Food and Drug Administration.\nThe situation is a lot more complex than “big mean company keeps drug away from little kid.” Update: Chimerix and the FDA found a way to let Josh Hardy access the drug.\nThe company claims that evaluating compassionate use cases and manufacturing the drug for those patients wouldn’t be an effective use of company resources.\nThe trial will let the company use the drug on future patients with compromised immune systems who are infected with adenoviruses.']"

Chimerix, the pharmaceutical company that produces the medicine the young cancer patient needs, put a $50,000 price tag on the life-saving treatment.\n\nThe family did not have the funds to pay for the expensive medication. Josh’s fate appeared to improve when a charity stepped in and offered to donate the tens of thousands of dollars needed to buy Chimerix, but the drug maker refused to hand over the medication. His doctor’s and family fear that he will not live out the week.\n\nThroughout his young life, Josh Hardy has spent many weeks in the hospital. The little boy survived heart failure and four bouts of kidney cancer, according to Fox News. In late November, Josh developed a bone marrow disorder as a result of his ongoing cancer treatments.\n\nHe underwent both a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis. Even though the treatments were a success, Hardy developed the adenovirus. The condition is an acute infection that can be deadly for patients with a compromised immune system.\n\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital doctors want Josh to be given Brincidofovir – and antiviral drug that has reportedly been proven to eradicate the adenovirus in children in about two weeks. But the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved Brincidofovir, and have reportedly been preventing the young cancer patient from receiving the potentially life-saving medication.\n\nAimee Hardy, Josh’s mother, directly appealed to Chimerix CEO Kenneth Moch, appealing to grant her son emergency access to Brincidofovir. The drug maker has reportedly granted “hundreds” of patient’s emergency access to the medication during the past several years, but now Moch has stopped the practice.\n\nAccording to the Chimerix CEO, the pharmaceutical company “cannot afford” to keep giving away the medication. The Max Cure Foundation, a research organization focusing on rare pediatric cancers, offered to pay Kenneth Moch’s company for the drug multiple times, but they will not budge. When a representative from the foundation asked Moch to picture Josh Hardy as his own son or grandson, the pharmaceutical CEO hung up on the cancer charity officer Richard Plotkin.\n\nPlotkin had this to say about his conversation with the Chimerix CEO:\n\n“I spoke to Mr. Moch yesterday by phone. I told him that we had the $50,000 that I thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug. He then told me it isn’t about money. He told me it’s all about ethics. I said, ‘Fine, tell me why you will not give [it to] this little boy.’ If he does not get the drug, he will die this week, I’m told. He said he cannot make an exception.”\n\nThe “Save Josh” campaign was launched by the boy’s mother online, a hashtag by the same name has been trending on Twitter. Supporters have chartered buses to travel to the Chimreix headquarters to protest the company’s decision to withhold the life-saving drug.\n\n[Images Via: Facebook]', 'Josh Hardy, 7, is clinging to life in a hospital room even though medication to help him recover from a curable virus exists.\nChimerix, the pharmaceutical company that produces the medicine the young cancer patient needs, put a $50,000 price tag on the life-saving treatment.\nThroughout his young life, Josh Hardy has spent many weeks in the hospital.\nBut the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved Brincidofovir, and have reportedly been preventing the young cancer patient from receiving the potentially life-saving medication.\nI told him that we had the $50,000 that I thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug.']"

7748,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-scott/josh-hardy-cancer-medication_b_4942307.html,health,"[""Updated on March 12, 2014 at 2:45 EST.\n\nThe Chimerix pharmaceutical company answered a desperate family's pleas on Tuesday and said it will provide 7-year-old Josh Hardy with cancer medication that could help save his life, CNN reported. Josh will be the first patient in a new trial set to start Wednesday.\n\nBy now, you have heard the story of young Josh Hardy, a 7-year-old childhood cancer survivor who is fighting for his life against a viral infection. A small drug company in North Carolina (Chimerix) has a medication, Brincidofovir, in clinical trial that fights off viral infections similar to Josh's, but have made the choice to refuse access to what may be the only hope to save Josh's life. This has angered people everywhere (including me) and left us to ask the fundamental question - if a drug exists that can save the life of a child, why is that access being denied?\n\nFirst it is important to understand what compassionate use is, it is the use of medications that have not been approved by the FDA, but are in earlier stages of development and are allowed to be provided to patients when circumstances call for it. I would say that saving the life of a young child who has already battled cancer four times, should be among those circumstances. In fact, I think that preference should be given to children in compassionate use, but clearly that is not what is happening here. So why is this drug being withheld from Josh?\n\nIs it money? The company behind this drug reports that each compassionate case would cost them $50,000, money that the small company does not have. More than this financial limitation, green-lighting a case like Josh's would take the manpower of all the company's employees, likely contributing to the end of their compassionate use program two years ago. As many of us who are following this story learned as we woke up today, there have been offers to pay the $50,000 for Josh, but those too have been denied.\n\nIs it the principle? When asked by the media about the withholding of this medication, the president of Chimerix, Kenneth Moch (who has vocally proclaimed that he too is a parent) has said that while he is heartbroken, saying yes to Josh's case would essentially open the floodgates to all who apply for compassionate use. He followed that up by saying that if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh, he'd be fighting tooth and nail too. It's no secret that a parent would and should fight to save the life of their child, but I have a sneaking suspicion that should the situation be reversed, Josh's parents would provide access to the drug to save Kenneth Moch's children.\n\nWould compassionate use create a black mark on the drug? More than money and principle, compassionate use has the ability to make a drug look bad in the long run. Of course it goes without saying that those in need of these drugs for compassionate use are in dire situations, and that they may very likely die without the use of the drugs. Chimerix would have to report any poor outcome to the FDA when it applies to market the drug, including those of compassionate use.\n\nKnowing all sides of this case, and even as a biased parent whose daughter lost her life to cancer, when you have the ability to save a child's life, you do it, no matter what. To me, and many people out there, the answer is simple, if you can afford it or not, if you have to go against your principles or not, whether there are consequences to reputation or not, you do whatever is necessary to save the life of a child. Period.\n\nMy daughter Alex was on many medications under compassionate use. While they may not have ultimately saved her life, they certainly provided her with more quality time, time to hold her lemonade stands and make a difference in the lives of others. If she would not have had access to these drugs, who knows where we would be now, perhaps not funding millions of dollars of research annually to find better treatments and cures for the very disease that has left Josh fighting for his life.\n\nI understand that this company owes their investors a return on their money, but in the end, we are all human beings, and we owe it to these children to share this potentially lifesaving drug. No matter the obstacles in the way, when a child's life is on the line, you do what you have to. I hope that the president of Chimerix reconsiders, whatever that may mean in the long run - Josh deserves to be given the chance to grow up and it seems to me that through the simple release of Brincidofovir that is completely within the realm of possibility. Let's not let a policy or financial implications come before doing the right thing."", ""The Chimerix pharmaceutical company answered a desperate family's pleas on Tuesday and said it will provide 7-year-old Josh Hardy with cancer medication that could help save his life, CNN reported.\nA small drug company in North Carolina (Chimerix) has a medication, Brincidofovir, in clinical trial that fights off viral infections similar to Josh's, but have made the choice to refuse access to what may be the only hope to save Josh's life.\nThis has angered people everywhere (including me) and left us to ask the fundamental question - if a drug exists that can save the life of a child, why is that access being denied?\nThe company behind this drug reports that each compassionate case would cost them $50,000, money that the small company does not have.\nMore than money and principle, compassionate use has the ability to make a drug look bad in the long run.""]"

After complete heart failure and kidney failure followed the transplant, the need for antiviral medicine became apparent — a life-saving drug a North Carolina pharmaceutical company, Chimerex, is not willing to give.\n\nSaveJoshHardy/Facebook.com\n\n""Having survived four diagnoses of cancer, it would be an absolute travesty for him to meet his demise from a virus,"" said his mother, Aimee Hardy, to ABC News. ""Especially knowing there is a medicine in someone’s hands that can rid of this virus."" The drug, brincidofovir, manufactured by Chimerex, has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks.\n\nThe doctors at St. Jude’s gave Josh antiviral medicine to get rid of the adenovirus he developed after his heart and kidneys began to heal. However, the drug was toxic to the boy’s kidneys, and it wasn’t working. As an alternative, the team of doctors suggested brincidofovir, because they tried it in children in a previous study. ""Our doctor said \'This drug will cure and save your son,\'"" said Josh’s father, Todd Hardy.\n\nChimerex President and CEO Kenneth Moch, aware that Josh’s life is in his hands, simply said they “can’t afford” to take that risk. The drug company has previously given patients emergency access to medication, but they stopped doing so since it was costly, despite receiving $72 million in federal funding to develop brincidofovir. Moch believes saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to more patients, and therefore, drowning the company’s resources and delaying FDA approval that would help a greater number of patients. ""We all have great compassion for this child,"" Moch said to ABC News. ""We spent our lives trying to develop new medications for patients just like Josh. ... We need to make sure to get this drug available as soon as possible to as many people as possible.""\n\nThe company participates in compassionate use — the use of medications that have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration but are in the earlier stages of development. The FDA only allows companies to provide drugs to some patients under certain circumstances. Currently, Chimerex can only give drug approval to patients who have been on the drug in a previous trial and newborns with herpes simplex virus. Josh does not meet either of the criteria.\n\nSaveJoshHardy/Facebook.com\n\n“It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him. But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery,” Aimee told Fox News. Brincidofovir has shown broad-spectrum antiviral activity against all five families of viruses that affect humans, including the adenovirus, and has no evidence of kidney or bone marrow toxicity, according to Chimerex’s website. The adenovirus, although similar to the common cold, can lead to mild and serious complications, such as damage in the eyes, GI tract, bladder, and most notably, a lung problem like acute respiratory distress syndrome, which could be fatal.\n\nSaveJoshHardy/Facebook.com\n\nDespite Chimerex’s “no,” the Hardys, just like their son, will fight this through and not take “no” for an answer. The family has started to use social media to ask supporters to call (919) 806-1074, email compassionateuserequest@chimerix.com, or tweet Chimerex @chimerex using the hashtag #savejosh. They can even track Josh’s progress via the Save Josh Facebook page.

Now, however, a bone-marrow transplant made him susceptible to a potentially fatal adenovirus, and he\'s struggling for survival in a Memphis hospital.\n\nDoctors think Chimerix\'s Brincidofovir, a drug now in the testing stage, could help the child but the company needs to go through an elaborate process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to get the drug to him under the FDA\'s ""compassionate use"" guidelines. Companies are allowed to offer experimental drugs for compassionate use if patients have no other recourse.\n\nChimerix officials, however, say they can\'t spare the manpower needed at their 50-person company based in Durham, N.C., in order to properly process a compassionate use case and are concerned it would open the floodgates for many more such requests. Complying with these requests, company officials told CNN and other news agencies, would hamper its ability to get the drug to market. Brincidofovir is not expected to be approved for sale until at least 2016.\n\nChimerix Chief Executive Kenneth Moch says he would feel ""horrible"" if Josh were to die, but says if he helps the boy, it could hamper his ability to help many more patients down the road.\n\nThe company has granted compassionate use requests in the past for Brincidofovir, but that was in connection with testing programs conducted from 2009 to 2012.

Josh got his first dose of the drug on Wednesday.\n\nThe boy has been battling cancer since he was 9 months old and recently received a bone marrow transplant at St. Jude’s in Memphis. In the days leading up to the new treatment, Josh has been in the ICU ravaged by a virus. His heart and kidneys are failing him.\n\n“Josh has a long road to recovery,” Todd Hardy, Josh’s father, told CNN in an e-mail Thursday.\n\nIn a campaign that went viral, the parents pleaded with the pharmaceutical company Chimerix to provide a compassionate dose of brincidofovir for Josh. Chimerix initially rejected the request.\n\nChimerix CEO Kenneth Moch had said that if the company spends too much time and money on “compassionate use” cases it would greatly hinder its effort to get brincidofovir, on the market and available to everyone. But the company changed course in the wake of the publicity the Josh Hardy case had generated.\n\n“Being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating, and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make. It is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value, a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious DNA viral infections,” Moch said as part of a statement on the final decision to provide the drug.\n\nIf someone faces a life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug. These drugs are usually still under review and have yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSometimes the drug companies say yes. According to CNN, 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013 were approved.\n\nWith every “compassionate use” arrangement a drug company approves, the longer it takes to get a drug out to the general public.\n\nThe FDA says that if someone has a life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug, one that they’re still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA.\n\nYou can visit the “Save Josh” Facebook page.', 'The story of 7-year-old Josh Hardy has brought to light the issue of “compassionate use” of experimental drugs and the willingness of drug companies to provide them.\nIn a campaign that went viral, the parents pleaded with the pharmaceutical company Chimerix to provide a compassionate dose of brincidofovir for Josh.\nBut the company changed course in the wake of the publicity the Josh Hardy case had generated.\nIf someone faces a life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments, they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug.\nWith every “compassionate use” arrangement a drug company approves, the longer it takes to get a drug out to the general public.']"

He\'s the head of a company that ""denies drug to dying child"" (CNN) and ""refuses to give life-saving medication to 7-year-old boy"" (Fox News) as ""thousands beg company"" to fork it over (Detroit Free Press). He and his staff are getting death threats.\n\nThere are plenty more juicy headlines to pick from. Big media groups can really rack up audience traffic when they can profile a dying child and his desperate parents\' fight against a drug company; even if the ""drug company"" in question doesn\'t have any products, works with a small staff of 54 and is trying its best to get an approval so it can start making some money.\n\nChimerix is doing this on a budget, mind you, that is as far from the Big Pharma world as your local bank is from Wall Street. In the last quarter the biotech lost $8.2 million as it worked on an experimental therapy for lethal viral infections dubbed brincidofovir (CMX001).\n\nJosh Hardy, the 7-year-old kid at the heart of this story, is impossible not to like. He\'s been fighting cancer for years and now his parents say that his only chance of surviving the virus that threatens his life is with Chimerix\'s experimental, unapproved therapy.\n\nThe problem for Chimerix, as Moch has been trying to explain, is that if they give the drug to Hardy, they\'d have to set up a program for hundreds of more such patients. And they would have to pay for this philanthropic program and administer it while they\'re working on clinical trials.\n\nBut reason isn\'t going to make a dent in public opinion. Not when you have a dying child in the story. But this situation occurs too often for biotechs, which inevitably come out looking like hard-hearted corporations putting profits ahead of lives.\n\nI routinely get emails looking for some back door to a clinical trial or advice on obtaining a Phase III therapy. Occasionally, desperate patients hire PR firms to take their cases public. But Chimerix and the other biotechs that find themselves in the spotlight aren\'t the villains. Caught between a rock and a hard place, biotechs can\'t sacrifice common sense or veer from their development path. The best they can do is finish their work as quickly as possible, so doctors and patients will know for certain whether the product they\'ve been developing can actually help.\n\nThat\'s the business model this country and much of the world depends on for developing new drugs. It may be deeply flawed, but it cannot be ignored by a company like Chimerix or any other small biotech.\n\nPerhaps there is some other way for biotechs to handle compassionate use programs. Perhaps the bigger CROs, industry leaders and regulators could coordinate a compassionate use program for the most needy patients that could be paid for from multiple sources. But the heat needs to come off the small biotechs. They follow a risky enough path as it is. Suddenly being confronted with a phalanx of cable news shows and USA Today and other major news groups which feed on raw emotion shouldn\'t be one of the threats they face. -- John Carroll, editor-in-chief (email | Twitter)\n\nEditor\'s Note: As we reported Tuesday night, Chimerix came up with a special pilot study that planned to treat Josh Hardy Wednesday morning, saying the FDA was open to expanding it into a Phase III trial at a later date. Also, USA Today\'s writer, Kim Painter, contacted us to say she felt that this piece unfairly lumped her story--""Thousands beg company....""--in with the cable news reports. To be fair, she included comments from the CEO as well as a bioethicist who sympathized with the company\'s position, pointing out some of the complexities of this case. It was the lurid headline that attracted my attention primarily, perhaps unfairly, to the writer. Stories are more than a headline, as I often point out to my own critics.', 'He\'s the head of a company that ""denies drug to dying child"" (CNN) and ""refuses to give life-saving medication to 7-year-old boy"" (Fox News) as ""thousands beg company"" to fork it over (Detroit Free Press).\nIn the last quarter the biotech lost $8.2 million as it worked on an experimental therapy for lethal viral infections dubbed brincidofovir (CMX001).\nNot when you have a dying child in the story.\nIt may be deeply flawed, but it cannot be ignored by a company like Chimerix or any other small biotech.\nBut the heat needs to come off the small biotechs.']"

The challenge is his immune system can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells.

She's a registered nurse, a certified hospice and palliative nurse, and the education institute coordinator for Hospice Family Care in Huntsville, the only non-profit hospice agency in Madison County.\n\nFarrell has worked with many families struggling to care for loved ones with dementia or Alzheimer’s.\n\n“It’s a long process of anticipatory grief,” said Farrell. “Every little thing they lose, you grieve – when your mom can’t walk anymore, then when she can’t use a wheelchair anymore, then when she can’t remember who you are.\n\n“The patient grieves when they can’t remember how to get home, then can’t remember how to carry on a conversation. There are all these losses that families are dealing with constantly throughout the disease.”\n\nCaring for a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer’s can be an exhausting process, both physically and emotionally. It can also be a long process, since a person could live 10 or more years past the original diagnosis thanks to early detection.\n\nAs a hospice nurse, Farrell stresses the importance of family caregivers taking good care of themselves.\n\n“We don’t need to burn out caregivers and ruin their health,” she said. “Always, always ask for help.”\n\nSupport groups in the community are available for caregivers of people with diseases like dementia and Alzheimer's. And the Alzheimer's Association offers tips for caregivers on how best to manage their own health while looking after someone else's. The AA website also offers information about topics like caregiver stress, depression, relationship changes and grief/loss. There's even a quiz to help caregivers understand their own level of stress.\n\nFarrell also points out that part of asking for help is being honest with doctors, and being willing to ask the hard questions about the parent or spouse’s realistic prognosis. Is he or she in the late stages of the disease, and might be appropriate for hospice care?\n\n“Sometimes the doctor may not want to bring it up,” said Farrell. “I encourage caregivers to bring it up so they can understand where they are.”\n\nMany people are uncomfortable with the idea of asking about hospice, said Farrell, associating it with death or believing hospice is only brought in for the last few days of a person’s life.\n\n“Hospice is not for people who are actively dying; it’s for people living with a terminal illness,” said Farrell. “If hospice is used appropriately, we would have people for weeks and months, rather than for days.\n\n“I like to say that all of my patients are 100 percent alive. We don’t take care of dead people – that’s for the funeral homes.”\n\nA physician is the one who can make the determination if a patient is a candidate for hospice services. The Medicare guideline, which is followed by private insurance companies, says hospice is appropriate for people who have been given an expected prognosis of six months or less. Medicare or private insurance pays for hospice services, which are administered by a team of registered nurses, home health aides, social workers and even chaplains and volunteers.\n\nHospice assists the patient with medical care for pain and symptom management, assistance processing paperwork and finding resources for financial support, and also provides support groups and encouragement for family and caregivers. At Hospice Family Care, grief and bereavement services are offered to family members up to 13 months after the death of the loved one – to get them through the first anniversary of the person’s death.\n\n“People shy away from the word ‘hospice’ and they don’t realize,” said Farrell, “that what we really do is we affirm life.”"", ""She's a registered nurse, a certified hospice and palliative nurse, and the education institute coordinator for Hospice Family Care in Huntsville, the only non-profit hospice agency in Madison County.\n“Every little thing they lose, you grieve – when your mom can’t walk anymore, then when she can’t use a wheelchair anymore, then when she can’t remember who you are.\n“The patient grieves when they can’t remember how to get home, then can’t remember how to carry on a conversation.\nIs he or she in the late stages of the disease, and might be appropriate for hospice care?\nMedicare or private insurance pays for hospice services, which are administered by a team of registered nurses, home health aides, social workers and even chaplains and volunteers.""]"

The researchers are hopeful for other diagnostic uses as well.\n\n“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,” says Howard J. Federoff, MD, PhD, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center.\n\nTo date, there is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Approximately 35.6 million people suffer from the disease worldwide, and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), that number will double every 20 years. They predict 115.4 million sufferers by 2050.\n\nThere have been many efforts to develop drug therapies to slow or reverse the disease’s progression, but according to Federoff, all have failed so far. He believes that one reason for this failure is that the drugs were evaluated too late in the disease process.\n\n“The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,” Federoff says. “Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics.”\n\nThe researchers recruited 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older. The participants all gave blood samples at the beginning of the study and at various points during the study. Over the five-year study period, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent. Forty-six of this group were diagnosed upon enrollment in the study and 28 (called converters) developed aMCI or mild AD during the study.\n\nDuring the study’s third year, 53 participants who developed aMCI/AD (including 18 converters) and 53 cognitively normal matched controls were selected for the lipid biomarker discovery phase of the study. The lipids were not the initial focus of the study; instead, they were an outcome.\n\nThe researchers discovered a panel of 10 lipids that appear to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in study participants who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD. The team validated the panel using the remaining 21 aMCI/AD participants (including 10 converters), and 20 controls. To determine if the subjects could be characterized into the correct diagnostic categories based solely on the panel of 10 lipids identified in the discovery phase, the data was analyzed blind.\n\n“The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 percent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,” Federoff says.\n\nThe research team also investigated the possibility that the APOE4 gene, known to be a risk factor for developing AD, would contribute to accurate classifications of the groups. They found it was not a significant predictive factor, however.\n\n“We consider our results a major step toward the commercialization of a preclinical disease biomarker test that could be useful for large-scale screening to identify at-risk individuals,” Federoff says. “We’re designing a clinical trial where we’ll use this panel to identify people at high risk for Alzheimer’s to test a therapeutic agent that might delay or prevent the emergence of the disease.”\n\nComments\n\ncomments', 'The study, published in Nature Medicine, indicates the possibility of developing treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s at an earlier stage.\nThe researchers say that their study is the first known report of blood-based biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer’s.\nTo date, there is no cure or effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease.\nOver the five-year study period, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent.\nForty-six of this group were diagnosed upon enrollment in the study and 28 (called converters) developed aMCI or mild AD during the study.']"

A screening test based on the findings could be available in as little as two years, said the researchers who identified the blood biomarkers.\n\nThe effort to identify predictors of Alzheimer\'s disease that are reliable, easy and inexpensive to detect was described Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine. Blood biomarkers for Alzheimer\'s could make it possible to identify those at risk before they develop symptoms, the authors suggested.\n\nWhile no treatments for Alzheimer\'s have proven effective in slowing or reversing its progress, the authors declared that earlier detection may open new treatment options. Interventions to head off or slow cognitive decline before it is evident might be more effective than intervening later, when dementia has already set in.\n\nThe researchers — from the University of Rochester, Georgetown University and the University of California, Irvine — did not start with a list of possible biomarkers, but recruited 525 subjects at least 70 years old. The team scoured their blood for possibilities while waiting to see which subjects would develop dementia symptoms.\n\nForty-six subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s disease upon entry into the study. And 28 went on to develop mild Alzheimer\'s or amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often progresses to full-blown Alzheimer\'s. The researchers compared the blood of 53 of those 74 subjects with that of 53 matched subjects who had developed no cognitive abnormalities. The analysis allowed them to identify measurable differences between the groups in 10 different lipids.\n\nThe 10 lipids identified as harbingers of Alzheimer\'s appear to be the result of the breakdown of neural cell membranes, a process that accelerates as the disease takes hold.\n\nOnce they had the list of revealing lipids, the study authors gathered 41 of their recruits: 21 who had developed early Alzheimer\'s in the course of the study and 20 who had not. Blinded to the subjects\' status, the researchers tried to see if they could use the 10-lipids panel to sort the subjects correctly on the basis of their blood tests alone. They found they could do so, with over 90 per cent accuracy.\n\nThat\'s an accuracy level on a par with tests that measure the cerebrospinal fluid for evidence of abnormal proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\'s disease. But because a blood test would be much cheaper and less invasive than a spinal tap, it would make screening large populations of people far more practical.\n\nAmong the issues still to be sorted out: how revealing the 10-lipids blood panel would be in a larger and more diverse population of patients; and how sensitive and specific such a screen would be. Many tests are able to identify 100 per cent of people who are sick with a particular disease (they\'re highly sensitive), but they also falsely identify many as sick who are not (they\'re not very specific).\n\nIf patients test positive for impending Alzheimer\'s, many may accept treatments that are expensive and risky in a bid to head it off. As a result, it\'s important to establish that the 10-lipids test does not have a very high ""false positive"" rate.', ""The effort to identify predictors of Alzheimer's disease that are reliable, easy and inexpensive to detect was described Sunday in the journal Nature Medicine.\nBlood biomarkers for Alzheimer's could make it possible to identify those at risk before they develop symptoms, the authors suggested.\nForty-six subjects were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease upon entry into the study.\nThat's an accuracy level on a par with tests that measure the cerebrospinal fluid for evidence of abnormal proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.\nBut because a blood test would be much cheaper and less invasive than a spinal tap, it would make screening large populations of people far more practical.""]"

New research suggests it might be possible to predict if you’ll die from a medical condition in the next half-decade. How, you ask? With a simple blood test. According to a recent study published in the journal PLOS Medicine, if your blood registers high levels of four “biomarkers,” biological molecules found in your blood, body fluids, or tissues, you are at a substantially higher risk of dying in the next five years.\n\nAnd that same CNN.com story appears on many TV station websites across the country. Follow the leader.\n\nBut the leader is woefully incomplete on this one.\n\nYou don’t need to look any further than the “What Do These Findings Mean?” section of the published study. It would seem that if you’re not quite sure about what the findings mean, you might want to at least refer to that section, which states (my emphasis added):\n\nHowever, there are several limitations to this study. As an observational study, it provides evidence of only a correlation between a biomarker score and ill health. It does not identify any underlying causes. Other factors… might be the true cause of serious health problems and would provide a more accurate assessment of risk. Nor does this study identify what kinds of treatment might prove successful in reducing the risks. Therefore, more research is needed to determine whether testing for these biomarkers would provide any clinical benefit.\n\nThe observational nature of the study was not mentioned by CNN. An observational study can not establish cause-and-effect. So talking about “risk” – as in CNN’s 5th sentence, “…you are at a substantially higher risk of dying in the next five years.” – is technically inaccurate. Establishing risk means you’ve established cause-and-effect to define the risk. Anything else is fear-mongering about boogeymen at this point.\n\nThe CNN story’s final sentence – if you made it that far – read, “So don’t obsess too much over your annual blood tests just yet; more research is needed.” But that’s a far cry from the first five sentences of the story, which I posted above. Stories like this – and yesterday’s Alzheimer’s test story – fuel the obsession that you now tell people to ignore in your final throwaway line.\n\nMy summary:\n\nIf you ever hear anyone refer to a “simple blood test,” run away as fast as you can. There is no such thing. Read the study. When you see a heading such as “What Do These Findings Mean?” you may want to pay special attention especially if you’re not sure what it means. Do pay attention to CNN’s last line about not obsessing about your annual blood tests. The problem is: that should have been the headline for this and many other stories by CNN and others.\n\n—————-\n\nTweet\n\nFollow us on Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/garyschwitzer\n\nhttps://twitter.com/healthnewsrevu\n\nand on Facebook.', 'The obsession that some in journalism have with “simple” blood tests – the unquestioning “test for everything” mentality that shines through in so many stories – is, itself, bloodcurdling.\nWith a simple blood test.\nAs an observational study, it provides evidence of only a correlation between a biomarker score and ill health.\nMy summary:If you ever hear anyone refer to a “simple blood test,” run away as fast as you can.\nDo pay attention to CNN’s last line about not obsessing about your annual blood tests.']"

It\'s only dementia.""\n\nMy mom left her doctor\'s office feeling relieved that day. However, by this point in our lives, my sister and I had had plenty of experience with Alzheimer\'s disease. We knew there was plenty to worry about.\n\nThis doctor\'s visit happened eight years ago, but there is still a confusion surrounding Alzheimer\'s and dementia. Many people use the terms interchangeably -- giving the impression they are one in the same. Others, think both Alzheimer\'s and dementia are diseases, with dementia being less damaging or severe than Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nThese myths are widespread, even among the media some healthcare providers, and are very difficult to dispel.\n\nWhy?\n\nFirst, it can be challenging to wrap your head around this complex subject. The confusion may also stem from a lack of clear reporting in the media. Additionally, Alzheimer\'s has become a dreaded word. It\'s a word many people avoid using, preferring instead the softer, less-threatening term, \'dementia.\'\n\nWhatever the reason, the all-to-common misconception is that Alzheimer\'s disease and dementia are one in the same.\n\nThey are not.\n\nTo understand dementia, you have to first recognize it is not a disease. Rather, it is an overall, umbrella term used to describe a group of symptoms that affect a person\'s mental and physical abilities.\n\nYou could compare it to the term fever, which tells you a person has an elevated temperature with perhaps other accompanying symptoms. However, fever is caused by something that is happening in the body.\n\nThe same is true of dementia -- it is result of something happening to the body.\n\nThere are many types of dementia symptoms and they can often vary from person-to-person. Some of the more common symptoms are short-term memory loss, depression, irritability and mood changes, lack of coordination and motor skills, difficulty walking, loss of communication skills, difficulty solving problems, repetitive behaviors and a change in sleep patterns.\n\nSo, what is the root cause of these dementia symptoms?\n\nAlzheimer\'s, a progressive, always fatal brain disease, is the culprit in about 70 percent of the dementia cases and affects more than 5.3 million in the U.S. alone.\n\nYet, you can have dementia symptoms and not have Alzheimer\'s disease.\n\nOther diseases that bring about dementia symptoms include dementia with Lewy Bodies, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson\'s disease, Huntington\'s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, prolonged and excessive alcohol or drug use as well as several other rare types of diseases also affecting the brain. Although dementia symptoms vary widely, all of these diseases affect a person\'s thinking, behavior and memory. The disease steals the person\'s cognitive abilities and destroys their lives in the process.\n\nKnowledge is power. The more we know and the better we can communicate about Alzheimer\'s, the more powerful we become. Use your power to set the record straight about the myth that Alzheimer\'s and dementia are one in the same.\n\nYou may open up some conversations about this disease and who knows where it might lead?', ""However, by this point in our lives, my sister and I had had plenty of experience with Alzheimer's disease.\nOthers, think both Alzheimer's and dementia are diseases, with dementia being less damaging or severe than Alzheimer's disease.\nWhatever the reason, the all-to-common misconception is that Alzheimer's disease and dementia are one in the same.\nYet, you can have dementia symptoms and not have Alzheimer's disease.\nOther diseases that bring about dementia symptoms include dementia with Lewy Bodies, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, prolonged and excessive alcohol or drug use as well as several other rare types of diseases also affecting the brain.""]"

The research team then followed the participants for 5 years. During the course of the study, 74 of the people developed dementia or mild Alzheimer disease.\n\nResearchers compared their blood to the blood of people who showed no signs of cognitive decline.

Would you want that information? Would the fact there is currently no cure or preventative treatment have an impact on your decision?\n\nThese are some of the questions raised by a recent study that suggests a seemingly straightforward blood test might be able to predict, with 90 per cent accuracy, the onset of Alzheimer\'s. Over the past few days, news outlets throughout the world have hailed this research as a ""breakthrough"" that could lead to treatments that, as one article stated, could ""halt or even prevent the disease.""\n\nThis is, no doubt, a potentially exciting development. The test, which measures the level of a variety of lipids in the blood, may help inform both research strategies and, one can hope, future therapies.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStill, we need to be cautious and resist the ""breakthrough"" mentality so pervasive in popular culture today. This is one study. And it is not a terribly large one. Nor is the predictive power as precise as often reported in the media (for example, the 90 per cent prediction refers to the onset of both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\'s disease – two very different outcomes). The results of the study are promising, but we need to take great care not to over-interpret or overreact.\n\nHistory tells us that biomarkers are often not as prognostic as suggested by early research results. Indeed, a 2012 paper by Stanford University\'s John Ioannidis concluded that, despite the large investment in biomarker research – such as genetics testing, body and tissue imaging and the measurement of particular chemicals in the blood – ""the yield of successful biomarkers with unquestionably favorable health impacts has been extremely limited to date."" Other work by Mr. Ioannidis has found that the predictive power of biomarkers is often exaggerated in the scientific literature, thus making it difficult for clinicians to judge their true value.\n\nSo, when faced with the prospect of an exciting new test, such as this one for Alzheimer\'s disease, we should remind ourselves to wait for the results of methodologically rigorous studies that replicate the initial findings.\n\nMoreover, a consideration of the social and individual impact of the test needs to be weighed and investigated.\n\nFirst, it is unclear that the likely onset of Alzheimer\'s is something that all individuals would want to know, particularly since there is nothing that can be done to prevent or cure this fatal condition. While there is survey research that suggests a strong interest in this kind of technology (perhaps people will want to get things done prior to arrival of symptoms), experience with other predictive tests gives us some hint as to how the uptake might actually play out. A genetic test for Huntington\'s disease, for example, has been around for decades. If an individual tests positive for the relevant genetic mutation, the future development of the disease is a virtual certainty. In other words, the test is 100 per cent predictive.\n\nBut despite the power of the test, only 10 to 20 per cent of individuals at risk for Huntington\'s – that is, individuals with a family history – actually get tested. The majority of individuals simply don\'t want to know what the future holds.\n\nSecond, there are questions about how individuals and our health system might react to this information. Would a positive result cause anxiety and, perhaps, enduring psychological harm? Research tells us that humans are, in fact, remarkably resilient to even the most distressing news. But it seems certain that at least some individuals would struggle with the prospect of imminent cognitive decline – a fact that seems particularly salient given that there would likely be a significant number of false positives.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd what impact might a test of this nature have on our health care system? Even inexpensive tests can have significant downstream costs.\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease is devastating. It is understandable that news of a noteworthy advance would result in hopeful headlines and predictions of near future application. Indeed, I too am hopeful that research of this nature will lead to effective tests, preventive strategies and, even, treatments.\n\nBut the announcement of and reaction to this study also highlights the need for caution in the interpretation of results, carefully executed replication studies and a consideration of the cascade of individual and social costs so often associated with potentially powerful medical advances.\n\nThere is a lot at stake. Let\'s get it right.\n\nTimothy Caulfield holds the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta, is a Trudeau Fellow and is the author of The Cure for Everything: Untangling the Twisted Messages about Health, Fitness and Happiness (2012).', ""What if you could find out, with a relatively high degree of certainty, whether you would get Alzheimer's disease in the next few years?\nThese are some of the questions raised by a recent study that suggests a seemingly straightforward blood test might be able to predict, with 90 per cent accuracy, the onset of Alzheimer's.\nNor is the predictive power as precise as often reported in the media (for example, the 90 per cent prediction refers to the onset of both mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease – two very different outcomes).\nHistory tells us that biomarkers are often not as prognostic as suggested by early research results.\nAlzheimer's disease is devastating.""]"

This discovery – which appears today in the journal Nature Medicine – could be the key to unlocking a new generation of treatments that seek to head off the disease before neurological damage becomes irreversible.\n\nThe biomarker – which consists of 10 specific lipids found in blood plasma – predicted with greater than 90 percent accuracy which individuals would go on to develop Alzheimer\'s disease or a precursor condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The cost of the simple blood test required to detect these lipids is a fraction of other techniques and, unlike alternatives, it identifies risk early in the disease process before cognitive symptoms appears.\n\n""The ability to identify individuals who are at risk of developing Alzheimer\'s before the clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment has long been a Holy Grail of the neuromedicine community,"" said Mark Mapstone, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist with the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and lead author of the study. ""Current efforts to develop a treatment for this disease are coming up short because they are probably being used too late. Biomarkers that can allow us to intervene early in the course of the disease could be a game-changer.""\n\nAlzheimer\'s research is at an impasse with many once promising experimental therapies failing in late stage clinical trials. These setbacks have led all but a few major pharmaceutical companies to pull back from their research and development in the disease.\n\nThe absence of an effective treatment for Alzheimer\'s, and the dwindling options in the drug development pipeline, mean that the nation – and the world – are woefully unprepared for the coming ""Silver Tsunami"" of aging baby boomers who will develop the disease in the coming years. By 2050, an estimated 14 million Americans will have Alzheimer\'s, consuming an estimated $1.2 trillion in health care costs per year.\n\nThere is an emerging scientific consensus that once the cognitive symptoms of the Alzheimer\'s have emerged, it may be too late to slow or reverse the neurological damage caused by the disease. Researchers speculate that if treatments could be initiated early in the disease cycle, they may stand more of a chance of being effective. In fact, many of the same experimental treatments that have failed in recent clinical studies may ultimately prove to be successful if they are given to patients sooner. The challenge is there currently exists no way to identify which people are at risk of developing Alzheimer\'s.\n\nThere are several screening methods that can detect Alzheimer\'s disease. These include spinal taps which measure the presence of the proteins beta amyloid and tau and advanced imaging systems such as MRIs, PET scans, and functional MRIs that spot changes in the brain. But these techniques have significant limitations. First, they have only been shown to be effective in confirming the diagnosing of the diseases after the cognitive symptoms have surfaced. And second, the high cost associated with these technologies is a significant barrier to widespread use in clinical practice.\n\nThe Rochester Aging Study, which was launched in 2007, is a community-wide collaboration that involves physicians and researchers from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Unity Health, and Rochester General Health System.\n\nIn total, 425 seniors from the Rochester area participated in the study. The volunteers underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and a blood draw once a year over a five-year period. An additional 100 individuals from Irvine, CA were enrolled in the study.\n\nResearchers at the University of Rochester and Georgetown University used a technique called mass spectrometry to screen for lipid levels in blood plasma. Lipids are a class of naturally occurring molecules found in the body that play a role in energy storage, signaling, and form the structural components of cell membranes. The scientists identified 10 specific lipids that, if present in lower than normal levels, could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy whether an individual would go on to develop either Alzheimer\'s or aMCI.\n\nThe scientists are not entirely sure why this particular set of lipids is indicative of Alzheimer\'s. All ten represent a class of lipids called phospholipids, molecules that are important cellular building blocks. The researchers speculate that the lower lipid levels could be an early indication that the brain cells lost in the disease are beginning to lose their integrity and break down.\n\nOnce commercialized, a blood test required to detect these lipids would likely cost less than $200 – compared to thousands of dollars for a spinal tap or MRI – and could be ordered as a part of a routine exam by an individual\'s primary care physician.\n\n""Having a tool that is able to identify, with a high degree of accuracy and at a low cost, which individuals will convert to Alzheimer\'s could transform how we care for this devastating disease,"" said Mapstone.', ""(Medical Xpress)—A study involving Rochester-area seniors has yielded the first accurate blood test that can predict who is at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.\nAlzheimer's research is at an impasse with many once promising experimental therapies failing in late stage clinical trials.\nBy 2050, an estimated 14 million Americans will have Alzheimer's, consuming an estimated $1.2 trillion in health care costs per year.\nThe challenge is there currently exists no way to identify which people are at risk of developing Alzheimer's.\nThere are several screening methods that can detect Alzheimer's disease.""]"

There are several tests that can help ensure an accurate diagnosis. These include:\n\nMRI (magnetic resonance imaging)\n\nAn MRI takes multiple images of the brain using powerful magnets and radio waves. It can help detect:\n\ncysts\n\ntumors\n\nbleeding\n\nswelling\n\nstructural abnormalities\n\ninfections\n\ninflammatory conditions\n\nproblems with the blood vessels\n\nIt’s a pain-free, noninvasive procedure. It usually takes from 30 minutes to two hours. You lie down on a table that slides into the MRI machine. You may have a contrast dye injected into your arm to enhance the images. You will have to remove all metallic objects, such as:\n\njewelry\n\neyeglasses\n\nhair clips\n\nIn terms of preparation, you may be asked to fast, or not to eat or drink anything, for four to six hours before the MRI.\n\nBe sure to let the doctor know ahead of time if you are uncomfortable in small spaces. They can prescribe medication to help you relax, or recommend an “open” MRI. An open MRI is less visually confining than the standard MRI machine. People with cardiac pacemakers typically cannot have an MRI and should not enter an MRI area. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have a cardiac pacemaker. You will be advised on your particular circumstances. You may not be able to have an MRI if you have any of the following metallic objects in your body:\n\nbrain aneurysm clips\n\ncertain types of artificial heart valves\n\nheart defibrillator or pacemaker\n\ninner ear, or cochlear, implants\n\nrecently placed artificial joints\n\ncertain types of vascular stents\n\nCT (computed tomography) scan\n\nA CT scan uses x-ray technology to create multiple images of the brain. It helps detect conditions like:\n\nbleeding in the brain\n\ninflammation\n\nskull fractures\n\nblood clots\n\nstrokes\n\nbrain tumors\n\nenlarged brain cavities\n\nother signs of brain disease\n\nA CT scan is a pain-free and noninvasive test that last a few minutes. Like the MRI, you will lie down on a table that slides into the CT machine. You have to lie still during the procedure and may have to hold your breath for short periods of time. You may be asked to wear a hospital gown and remove all metal objects. You may have a contrast dye injected into your arm to enhance the images. In terms of preparation, you may be asked to fast for four to six hours beforehand.\n\nPET (positron emission tomography) scan\n\nA positron emission tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test that can provide information on how the brain and its tissues function on a cellular level. It’s used to detect changes in bodily processes that can reveal abnormalities of brain function. These include changes in:\n\nglucose metabolism\n\noxygen metabolism\n\nblood flow\n\nLike the MRI and CT scan, you will need to lie down on a table that slides into the PET scan machine. About an hour prior to the PET scan, you will be injected with or asked to inhale a small amount of radioactive material, called a “tracer.” You may be asked to perform various mental tasks, such as reading or naming letters. This diagnostic tool allows the doctor to see levels of brain activity. Being required to fast for four to six hours prior to the test is not unusual. This test usually takes between 30 minutes and two hours.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer’s Association, research studies have shown that amyloid plaque buildup can be detected with PET scan technology, even before symptoms are evident. It’s still unknown if these plaques are risk factors for AD, the result of the disease, or some combination thereof. Using PET scans as an early detection diagnostic tool is still being developed and isn’t ready for use by general practice clinicians. If you have diabetes, be sure to share that information with your doctor. Blood sugar or insulin levels may affect the PET scan results.', 'Determining whether someone has Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not an exact science.\nAn open MRI is less visually confining than the standard MRI machine.\nAccording to the Alzheimer’s Association, research studies have shown that amyloid plaque buildup can be detected with PET scan technology, even before symptoms are evident.\nIt’s still unknown if these plaques are risk factors for AD, the result of the disease, or some combination thereof.\nBlood sugar or insulin levels may affect the PET scan results.']"

It measures levels of 10 lipids or fats circulating in the blood, and a study of 525 healthy seniors found that it could predict within 90 percent accuracy whether they would go on to develop memory loss or other symptoms five years later, according to the study published in Nature Medicine .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut “potential” is the operative word here. “We are certainly getting closer to having a blood test for Alzheimer’s, which I thought was impossible five years ago,” said Dr. Robert Stern, director of clinical research of the Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Center. “But I predict it will take another five or ten years for one to become available.”\n\nLikely, he said, the lipid measurement will just one marker assessed in a blood test to measure various markers for the disease—similar to the way doctors measure various components of cholesterol and inflammatory markers to screen for heart disease. It could, for example, be combined with another blood test developed by Australian researchers last year that also appears to predict Alzheimer’s disease by measuring different biomarkers.\n\n(These are distinct from genetic tests already available to screen for mutations that predict hereditary Alzheimer’s disease.)\n\nThe drive to develop a cheap, easy way to screen for Alzheimer’s has been getting more urgent as evidence builds to suggest that patients likely benefit most from treatments at the first subtle sign of memory loss or even years before they develop symptoms.\n\n“Drugs need to be used very early in the disease before there’s too much destruction of brain tissue,” Stern said. “By the time symptoms develop, the destruction is usually irreversible.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResearch suggests more than 50 percent of brain cells crucial to memory retention and cognitive processing are lost by the time a patient begins to develop personality changes and impaired memory.\n\nThree clinical trials are getting underway to test experimental drugs designed to clear or prevent the formation of amyloid plaques thought to be involved in the destruction of brain cells in Alzheimer’s disease patients. For example, researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and elsewhere are enrolling 3,000 healthy volunteers ages 65 to 85 in a trial to test an amyloid-clearing drug called solanezumab.\n\n“We’re looking for older people with no symptoms or perhaps subtle memory concerns who aren’t at the stage where they would go to the doctor for an evaluation,” said study investigator Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the Brigham’s Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment. Potential participants in the study, called A4, will first take a cognitive test, and those who fall in the “normal” range for their age will be given a brain imaging scan using positron emission tomography (PET) to check for the presence of amyloid plaques.\n\nThose who have amyloid plaques will then be randomly assigned to take solanezumab, an antibody that targets amyloid plaque, or a placebo to see if the drug works better than a sugar pill to prevent the onset of memory loss and other cognitive symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPET brain scans tend to be used only in the research setting since the $5,000 cost per scan isn’t covered by the federal government’s Medicare insurance plan.\n\nBoth Sperling and Stern agreed that the new experimental blood test was promising and likely a small step of many that will need to be taken before a blood test will be available for clinical use.\n\n“It’s important that this test can predict memory loss, but can it also detect amyloid formation before the development of any symptoms?” Sperling said. She and her research team plan to make blood samples and PET scans collected during the study available to outside researchers developing screening blood tests to help speed their development.\n\n“We’re in a Catch-22 at the moment,” Stern said. “In order for us to develop really good modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s, we need to identify people very early on in the course of the disease. But we still don’t have a cheap and easy way to do that.”\n\nDeborah Kotz can be reached at dkotz@globe.com.

Should they examine patients’ DNA? Their RNA? Or should they look for the byproducts of DNA and RNA, such as fats and proteins?\n\nThey decided to start with fats, since it was the easiest and least expensive. They drew blood from hundreds of healthy people over age 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California. Five years later, 28 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer’s disease or the mild cognitive problems that usually precede it.\n\nScouring more than 100 fats, or lipids, for what might set this group apart, they found that these 28 seniors had low levels of 10 particular lipids, compared with healthy seniors.\n\nTo confirm their findings, the researchers then looked at the blood of 54 other patients who had Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment.

The need for a screening test of some kind for Alzheimer’s has never been greater: A report released last week says the disease claims the lives of perhaps a half a million Americans, making it nearly as deadly as heart disease and cancer.\n\nIf any of these tests work out — and that’s still an if — it would take years to make it to doctors’ offices, since the test would need to be validated by other labs and with larger groups of people.

Then, they tracked their health for a period of five years. At the end of this period, 28 of the study participants had developed Alzheimer\'s disease or the cognitive impairments that tend to precede it, so the researchers went back and analyzed the participants\' blood to figure out what set these adults apart.

This, the researchers say, could be an indication of the early breakdown of certain populations of neurons in the brain.\n\nThe scientists also analyzed the patients\' full genome sequence and, according to lead-author and neurologist at Georgetown University Howard Federoff, the genetic changes that took place over the five-year period are an even stronger predictor of future cognitive impairments.

Many might prefer to remain happily in the dark until the disease hits. But, as Federoff pointed out to New Scientist, there are many other factors to think about besides treatment, or the lack thereof.

If larger studies uphold the results, the test could fill a major gap in strategies to combat brain degeneration, which is thought to show symptoms only at a stage when it too late to treat effectively.\n\nThe test was identified in a preliminary study involving 525 people aged over 70. The work identified a set of ten lipid metabolites in blood plasma that distinguished with 90% accuracy between people who would remain cognitively healthy from those who would go on to show signs of cognitive impairment.\n\n“These findings are potentially very exciting,” says Simon Lovestone, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, and a coordinator of a major European public-private partnership seeking biomarkers for Alzheimer's. But he points out that only 28 participants developed symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease during the latest work. “So the findings need to be confirmed in independent and larger studies.”\n\nThere is not yet a good treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which affects 35 million people worldwide. Several promising therapies have been tested in clinical trials over the last few years, but all have failed. However, those trials involved people who had already developed symptoms. Many neuroscientists fear that any benefits of a treatment would be missed in such a study, because it could be impossible to halt the disease once it has manifested. “We desperately need biomarkers which would allow patients to be identified — and recruited into trials — before their symptoms begin,” says Lovestone.\n\nIn the blood\n\nThe latest study, which is published today in Nature Medicine1, was led by neurologist Howard Federoff of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington DC. He and his colleagues tested the participants' cognitive and memory skills, and took blood samples from them, around once a year for five years. They used mass spectrometry to analyse the blood plasma of 53 participants with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease, including 18 who developed symptoms during the study, and 53 who remained cognitively healthy. They found ten phospholipids that were present at consistently lower levels in the blood of most people who had, or went on to develop, cognitive impairment. The team validated the results in a set of 41 further participants.\n\n“We don’t really know the source of the ten molecules, though we know they are generally present in cell membranes,” says Federoff. But he proposes that concentrations of the phospholipids might somehow reflect the breakdown of neural-cell membranes.\n\nFederoff emphasizes that his results will have to be validated in independent labs, and in much larger studies: “We also have to look at different age groups and a more diverse racial mix, and we need longer study periods.”\n\nEase of use\n\nMonique Breteler, head of epidemiology at the German Centre for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn, says that a test based on Federoff’s biomarker set would be advantageously simple. “If you are to screen the population for those destined to get Alzheimer’s, and who may therefore benefit from any treatment that is developed,” she says, “then you need to use material you can access easily, like blood.”\n\nSome groups are looking for molecules present in spinal fluid or biomarkers based on brain imaging — procedures that are not practical for large-scale use, she adds.\n\nOther research has found differences in patterns of other molecules in the blood of people with Alzheimer’s and healthy controls. But such case–control studies fail to take into account normal variation between individuals, says Breteler. “In general it is better to do a prospective study, like this one, so you can follow how measurements in each individual change as their life progresses.”"", ""A simple blood test has the potential to predict whether a healthy person will develop symptoms of dementia within two or three years.\nBut he points out that only 28 participants developed symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer's disease during the latest work.\n“So the findings need to be confirmed in independent and larger studies.”There is not yet a good treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which affects 35 million people worldwide.\nHowever, those trials involved people who had already developed symptoms.\nOther research has found differences in patterns of other molecules in the blood of people with Alzheimer’s and healthy controls.""]"

Biomarkers that can allow us to intervene early in the course of the disease could be a game-changer.”\n\nAlzheimer’s research is at an impasse with many once promising experimental therapies failing in late stage clinical trials. These setbacks have led all but a few major pharmaceutical companies to pull back from their research and development in the disease.\n\nA ‘silver tsunami’\n\nThe absence of an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s, and the dwindling options in the drug development pipeline, mean that the nation—and the world—are woefully unprepared for the coming Silver Tsunami of aging baby boomers who will develop the disease in the coming years. By 2050, an estimated 14 million Americans will have Alzheimer’s, consuming an estimated $1.2 trillion in health care costs per year.\n\nThere is an emerging scientific consensus that once the cognitive symptoms of the Alzheimer’s have emerged, it may be too late to slow or reverse the neurological damage caused by the disease.\n\nResearchers speculate that if treatments could be initiated early in the disease cycle, they may stand more of a chance of being effective. In fact, many of the same experimental treatments that have failed in recent clinical studies may ultimately prove to be successful if they are given to patients sooner. The challenge is there currently exists no way to identify which people are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s.\n\nThere are several screening methods that can detect Alzheimer’s disease. These include spinal taps which measure the presence of the proteins beta amyloid and tau and advanced imaging systems such as MRIs, PET scans, and functional MRIs that spot changes in the brain.\n\nToo late, too costly\n\nBut these techniques have significant limitations. First, they have only been shown to be effective in confirming the diagnosing of the diseases after the cognitive symptoms have surfaced. And second, the high cost associated with these technologies is a significant barrier to widespread use in clinical practice.\n\nFor the new study, published in Nature Medicine, 425 seniors in the Rochester area underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment and a blood draw once a year over a five-year period. An additional 100 individuals from Irvine, California were enrolled in the study.\n\nResearchers used a technique called mass spectrometry to screen for lipid levels in blood plasma. Lipids are a class of naturally occurring molecules found in the body that play a role in energy storage, signaling, and form the structural components of cell membranes. The scientists identified 10 specific lipids that, if present in lower than normal levels, could predict with more than 90 percent accuracy whether an individual would go on to develop either Alzheimer’s or aMCI.\n\nThe scientists are not entirely sure why this particular set of lipids is indicative of Alzheimer’s. All ten represent a class of lipids called phospholipids, molecules that are important cellular building blocks.\n\nAlzheimer’s game changer\n\nThe researchers speculate that the lower lipid levels could be an early indication that the brain cells lost in the disease are beginning to lose their integrity and break down.\n\nOnce commercialized, a blood test required to detect these lipids would likely cost less than $200—compared to thousands of dollars for a spinal tap or MRI—and could be ordered as a part of a routine exam by an individual’s primary care physician.\n\n“Having a tool that is able to identify, with a high degree of accuracy and at a low cost, which individuals will convert to Alzheimer’s could transform how we care for this devastating disease,” Mapstone says.\n\nResearchers from Georgetown University and the University of California, Irvine, contributed to the study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Aging and the Department of Defense.\n\nSource: University of Rochester', 'Researchers have developed a blood test that predicts with more than 90 percent accuracy who is at risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.\n[related]The cost of the simple blood test required to detect these lipids is a fraction of other techniques and, unlike alternatives, it identifies risk early in the disease process before cognitive symptoms appears.\nResearchers speculate that if treatments could be initiated early in the disease cycle, they may stand more of a chance of being effective.\nThe challenge is there currently exists no way to identify which people are at risk of developing Alzheimer’s.\nThere are several screening methods that can detect Alzheimer’s disease.']"
7909,http://wtkr.com/2014/03/10/doctor-calls-alzheimers-disease-blood-test-a-game-changer/,health,"['(CNN) — In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have developed a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop the disease.\n\nThough much work still needs to be done, it is hoped the test will someday be available in doctors’ offices, since the only methods for predicting Alzheimer’s right now, such as PET scans and spinal taps, are expensive, impractical, often unreliable and sometimes risky.\n\n“This is a potential game-changer,” said Dr. Howard Federoff, senior author of the report and a neurologist at Georgetown University Medical Center. “My level of enthusiasm is very high.”\n\nThe study was published in Nature Medicine.\n\n‘We were surprised’\n\nIn the beginning, the researchers knew they wanted to find a blood test to detect Alzheimer’s but didn’t know what specifically to look for. Should they examine patients’ DNA? Their RNA? Or should they look for the byproducts of DNA and RNA, such as fats and proteins?\n\nThey decided to start with fats, since it was the easiest and least expensive. They drew blood from hundreds of healthy people over age 70 living near Rochester, New York, and Irvine, California. Five years later, 28 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer’s disease or the mild cognitive problems that usually precede it.\n\nScouring more than 100 fats, or lipids, for what might set this group apart, they found that these 28 seniors had low levels of 10 particular lipids, compared with healthy seniors.\n\nTo confirm their findings, the researchers then looked at the blood of 54 other patients who had Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment. This group also had low levels of the lipids.\n\nOverall, the blood test predicted who would get Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment with over 90% accuracy.\n\n“We were surprised,” said Mark Mapstone, a neuropsychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center and lead author of the study. “But it turns out that it appears we were looking in the right place.”\n\nThe ‘holy grail’\n\nThe beauty of this test, Mapstone says, is that it caught Alzheimer’s before the patient even had symptoms, suggesting that the disease process begins long before people’s memories start failing. He says that perhaps the lipid levels started decreasing at the same time as brain cells started dying.\n\nHe and his team plan to try out this test in people in their 40s and 50s. If that works, he says, that would be the “holy grail,” because then researchers could try experimental drugs and treatments in a group that’s almost sure to get the disease. That would speed research along immensely.\n\nPlus, people could get a heads up that they were probably destined to get Alzheimer’s. Although some people might not want to know that they’re destined for a horrible disease, others might be grateful for the warning.\n\nFederoff said he would want to know whether he was on his way to getting the disease, even though there’s nothing he could do about it. He might want to take a family trip he’d been thinking about or might want to appoint a successor at work.\n\n“I would make sure that things that are important to me get done,” he said.\n\nBut, Federoff added, others might not want to know they were about to get a devastating disease they were powerless to stop.\n\n“I think it’s a very personal decision,” Federoff said. “It would have to be thought through on multiple dimensions. Patients and their families would have to be counseled.”\n\nNext steps\n\nOther research teams are looking at other possible tests for Alzheimer’s. The need for a screening test of some kind for Alzheimer’s has never been greater: A report released last week says the disease claims the lives of perhaps a half a million Americans, making it nearly as deadly as heart disease and cancer.\n\nIf any of these tests work out — and that’s still an if — it would take years to make it to doctors’ offices, since the test would need to be validated by other labs and with larger groups of people. Thee test developed by the Georgetown and Rochester researchers, for example, was used mainly in white people, and it might not work as well with other groups.\n\nHeather Snyder, a spokeswoman for the Alzheimer’s Association, said the study was well done but much work is still needed.\n\n“It’s an interesting paper. It’s an intriguing study. But it is very preliminary,” she said.', '(CNN) — In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers have developed a blood test for Alzheimer’s disease that predicts with astonishing accuracy whether a healthy person will develop the disease.\n‘We were surprised’In the beginning, the researchers knew they wanted to find a blood test to detect Alzheimer’s but didn’t know what specifically to look for.\nFive years later, 28 of the seniors had developed Alzheimer’s disease or the mild cognitive problems that usually precede it.\nTo confirm their findings, the researchers then looked at the blood of 54 other patients who had Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment.\nOverall, the blood test predicted who would get Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment with over 90% accuracy.']"

This finding can potentially offer cheaper and faster means of being tested for this cognitive disease.\n\nResearchers from Georgetown University Medical Center, led by neurologist Dr. Howard Federoff, have initiated another study that they believe is a potential game-changer. They recruited hundreds of healthy seniors as participants and analyzed the fats on their blood.\n\nAfter the five-year follow-up period, 28 of the participants were diagnosed with Alzheimer\'s disease. They then reviewed the blood of these seniors and identified 10 lipids that were lower than those who did not develop the cognitive disease.\n\n""This is a potential game-changer,"" said Dr. Federoff, to CNN. ""My level of enthusiasm is very high.""\n\nThey then took blood tests from other 54 Alzheimer\'s patients and compared their lipids to the study participants. Surprisingly, 90 percent of them showed low levels of the 10 lipids.\n\nThe researchers plan to continue their study and test if the same results will show for those below 50 years old.

The test looks for 10 signatures of fatty proteins called lipids, according to a study published in the journal Nature Medicine. It could help families of people developing the cognitive disorder make early decisions on how best to care for them and may also aid the search for treatment, the authors said. Several years of clinical trials are likely to be needed to assess the prototype technique, the first blood “biomarker” to predict the tragic degenerative disease. Alzheimer's, caused by toxic proteins that destroy brain cells, is a currently incurable and fatal degenerative disease.\n\nAround 35 million people have the disease, a tally that is expected to reach 115 million people by 2050, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\n“Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,” said Howard Federoff, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington.\n\nIt could also help efforts to treat the disease, he said in a press release.\n\nAttempts to develop drugs for Alzheimer's have failed possibly because they are tested when the disease has progressed too far, Federoff said.\n\nThese treatments may have a better chance of braking or reversing the disease if they are trialled at a much earlier stage, he said.\n\nThe researchers started by taking blood samples from 525 healthy volunteers aged 70 and older.\n\nThree years later, they looked at a group of 53 volunteers who had developed symptoms of early Alzheimer's or a memory-affecting condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).\n\nThe blood samples from this group were compared against the samples from 53 otherwise healthy volunteers to see what the difference was.\n\nFrom this, the scientists spotted the 10 telltale lipid proteins, which appear to be metabolised residues of brain cell membranes. - Sapa-AFP"", ""The blood test that predicts Alzheimer's(File photo) The researchers started by taking blood samples from 525 healthy volunteers aged 70 and older.\nParis - Researchers in the United States say they have developed a prototype blood test that can tell with 90-percent accuracy whether a healthy person will develop Alzheimer's disease within three years.\nThe test looks for 10 signatures of fatty proteins called lipids, according to a study published in the journal Nature Medicine.\nThe researchers started by taking blood samples from 525 healthy volunteers aged 70 and older.\nThe blood samples from this group were compared against the samples from 53 otherwise healthy volunteers to see what the difference was.""]"

James, Ph.D, of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “Death certificates often list the immediate cause of death, such as pneumonia, rather than listing dementia as an underlying cause.”\n\nJames noted that trying to identify a single cause of death does not always capture the reality of death for most elderly people, and that multiple health issues are often at work.\n\n“The estimates generated by our analysis suggest that deaths from Alzheimer’s disease far exceed the numbers reported by the CDC and those listed on death certificates,” said James.\n\nAlzheimer’s currently comes in sixth on the list of leading causes of death in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — heart disease and cancer top the list.\n\nFor the study, researchers enrolled 2,566 participants ages 65 and older (average age was 78) to receive yearly testing for dementia. After an average of eight years, 1,090 participants died. A total of 559 participants without dementia at the start of the study developed Alzheimer’s disease — the average time from diagnosis to death was about four years. Through autopsy, Alzheimer’s disease was confirmed for about nine out of 10 of those who were clinically diagnosed.\n\nThe death rate was over four times greater after a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s in participants ages 75 to 84 and nearly three times higher in those age 85 and older. More than one-third of all deaths in those age groups were attributable to Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nJames said “this translates into approximately 503,400 deaths from Alzheimer’s in the U.S. in people over the age of 75 in 2010. This is five to six times higher than the 83,494 number reported by the CDC based on death certificates.”\n\n“Determining the true effects of dementia in this country is important for raising public awareness and identifying research priorities regarding this epidemic,” said James.\n\nSource: American Academy of Neurology\n\nDeath From Alzheimer’s Disease Under-Reported', 'Alzheimer’s disease is often under-reported as a cause of death and may contribute to nearly as many deaths as heart disease or cancer, according to a new study published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.\n“Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are under-reported on death certificates and medical records,” said study author Bryan D.

7962,http://www.gizmag.com/blood-test-predict-alzheimers/31142/,health,"[""A group of medical researchers working at Georgetown University, the University of Rochester and UC-Irvine have developed a blood test which predicts with 90 percent accuracy if an individual will develop Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) within three years. The test, which looks for a set of ten lipid markers, will allow treatments to be sought that may be effective during this early, asymptomatic stage of the disease.\n\nAlzheimer's disease (memory-related MCI is thought to consist of early Alzheimer's symptoms) is a scourge ravishing the elderly among us, with 35 million currently afflicted worldwide, a number that is expected to grow to 115 million by mid-century. Alzheimer's is universally fatal, with life expectancy of about seven years after diagnosis. Diagnosis is generally indirect, largely based on symptoms and ruling out other causes of dementia.\n\nThere exist no treatments to cure or slow the inexorable progress of Alzheimer's. Some possibilities, however, have appeared in epidemiological studies, which show that people undergoing long term therapy with NSAIDS (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs) are less likely to develop Alzheimer's.\n\nThe lack of success in finding effective treatments may be that by the time a clear diagnosis can be made, the disease process is too far advanced to be interrupted. Medical researchers have previously found signatures of early Alzheimer's, but these have required examination of brain tissue or extraction of cerebrospinal fluid, preventing wide use as screening techniques.\n\nThe new blood test detects the breakdown products of nerve cell membranes. The signature is a set of ten metabolic products of such disintegration, two of which are highly specific for prediction of Alzheimer's. The test requires determination of the concentration of the ten lipid biomarkers, as all of them are seen in blood of test subjects who do not develop Alzheimer's or MCI.

Blood was drawn at the beginning when they entered the study, when they were cognitively normal. And then blood was drawn on follow-up, including when a subset of them developed cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\nThe way that the study was designed was that we would go and examine the blood of the individuals who went on to what we call ""phenoconvert"" and compare those with those who remained cognitively normal.\n\n\n\nAnd what we found and we reported in Nature and Medicine is that 10 blood lipids, or fats, were lowered in individuals who were going to go on to develop cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\nThe second part of the study was really to validate that observation - these 10 lipids or fats - to ask in a different group of individuals, ""How good would that 10-lipid test determine whether those individuals would go on to cognitive impairment?"" And in that case we were able to predict with 90 per cent accuracy their subsequent emergence of cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\nALISON CALDWELL: This is what everyone\'s looking for: is a test that could show these things. How confident are you that this could really be used broadly?\n\n\n\nHOWARD FEDEROFF: Well, I think that is a key question and, you know, we\'ve done a study. And as I said, we discovered and then validated. But it\'s imperative that our results be replicated on larger numbers of individuals.\n\n\n\nAnd then we would be interested in knowing whether individuals who might be younger than 70 years of age, whether they might test positive and then subsequently have the later emergence of Alzheimer\'s.\n\n\n\nSo more validation is absolutely essential before we will know whether this test and this particular set of 10 lipids or fats is going to turn out to be useful and could imagine be translated into a routine clinical test that one\'s doctor could order.\n\n\n\nALISON CALDWELL: I mean, what\'s the benefit really of knowing that somebody could develop dementia within three years?\n\n\n\nHOWARD FEDEROFF: I have seen this through two different lenses. The first, really, relates to my interest as an investigator or as a clinical scientist. We are as a larger community trying to find a cure for Alzheimer\'s disease. And quite disappointingly the Alzheimer investigators have tested a number of promising drug candidates and they have all thus far failed to slow disease progression or even to have an impact on symptoms.\n\n\n\nAnd so we\'re interested in knowing, if we have a test that can find individuals who might then go on to develop Alzheimer\'s: could we imagine a clinical trial where those who are at high risk but not yet clinically affected, whether a drug can be used to test whether it might delay or perhaps even prevent the emergence of symptoms?\n\n\n\nAnd the second, I think, is really one that will fall into the realm - again, assuming that it is a test that migrates into a routine clinical laboratory setting - this will be something that patients and their families would want to be counselled before agreeing that the loved one who might have a questionable risk for Alzheimer\'s would have their blood drawn and then how to manage a positive test, you know, at the family level with the loved one.\n\n\n\nSo I think that that issue really falls into the category of: one, ethics - a judgement about how to manage a positive test; and then some people, I think, would want to know and be able to plan the next several years so that they could live the most productive lives and be able to do whatever is necessary to make that transition.\n\n\n\nELEANOR HALL: That\'s professor Howard Federoff from the Georgetown University Medical Center.\n\n\n\nAnd his study on dementia was published in the journal Nature and Medicine today.

Leaving aside its 90 per cent accuracy, which could lead to one in 10 people being given a “false positive” result, one may wonder what good could come from confirmation of a condition for which there is no cure.\n\nWould anyone welcome being told that they are going to develop – and very likely die from – an incurable disorder that will eventually rob them of their memories, emotions and personality over a period of many years?\n\nThere is little doubt that Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia in general, is one of the most formidable health challenges facing Britain, and indeed the world, in the 21st century. Some 800,000 people in the United Kingdom already have some form of dementia, more than half of whom suffer from Alzheimer’s. With our increasing lifespans this figure is set to rise to more than a million within 10 years and by a further 1.7 million by mid-century. And all these people will need care for the rest of their lives – sometimes for several decades.\n\nDownload the new Indpendent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\nAt present, it is only possible to diagnose Alzheimer’s and dementia when the symptoms become apparent, which is long after the machinery of the brain has already begun to malfunction at a biochemical level. However a simple blood test which provides an early warning two or three years in advance of its onset has now been achieved by scientists at Georgetown University in Washington. This is a considerable scientific breakthrough.\n\nIt will still take some years before this test can be developed into a commercial form that is properly validated for false negative and false positive accuracy. Even so, some medical ethicists may wonder what good such a test will do given that there is no current effective treatment for Alzheimer’s.\n\nThis is not the first time that medical science has been here. A blood test for HIV was available long before there was an effective treatment for Aids in the form of anti-retroviral drugs. As soon as it became obvious that Aids was not an inevitable death sentence, the HIV test was touted as a vital weapon against the disease because it identified those who needed therapy.\n\nThis blood test for Alzheimer’s therefore should not be seen simply as a way of signalling the thumbs-up or thumbs-down for a possible death sentence. It should be welcomed rather as a means of better understanding this complicated brain disease by giving scientists early warning of who is going to develop the condition.\n\nOne in three of us will suffer dementia at some time over the age of 65. Being able to identify, at an early stage, which of us will go down this path could rapidly accelerate the rate of scientific discovery, leading to more effective therapies, whether they are based on drugs or some kind of early cognitive intervention to delay the onset of the decline.\n\nSo we should not be afraid of this test for Alzheimer’s.

For example, breastfeeding restores insulin tolerance which is significantly reduced during pregnancy, and Alzheimer\'s is characterized by insulin resistance in the brain.\n\nStrong evidence\n\nAlthough researchers used data gathered from a very small group of just 81 British women, they observed a highly significant and consistent correlation between breastfeeding and Alzheimer\'s risk. They argue that this was so strong that any potential sampling error was unlikely.\n\nAt the same time, however, the connection was much less pronounced in women who already had a history of dementia in their family. The research team hopes the study -- which was intended merely as a pilot -- will stimulate further research into the relationship between female reproductive history and disease risk.\n\nThe findings may point towards new directions for fighting the global Alzheimer\'s epidemic -- especially in developing countries where cheap, preventative measures are desperately needed.\n\nUnderstanding the disease\n\nMore broadly, the study opens up new lines of inquiry into understanding what makes someone susceptible to Alzheimer\'s in the first place. It may also act as an incentive for women to breastfeed, rather than bottle-feed -- something already known to have wider health benefits for both mother and child.\n\n""Alzheimer\'s is the world\'s most common cognitive disorder and it already affects 35.6 million people,” said Dr. Molly Fox of the Department of Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, who led the study. “In the future, we expect it to spread most in low and middle-income countries. So it is vital that we develop low-cost, large-scale strategies to protect people against this devastating disease.""\n\nPrevious studies have already established that breastfeeding can reduce a mother\'s risk of certain other diseases, and research has also shown that there may be a link between breastfeeding and a woman\'s general cognitive decline later in life. Until now, however, little has been done to examine the impact of breastfeeding duration on Alzheimer\'s risk.\n\nThe study\n\nFox and her colleagues interviewed 81 British women aged between 70 and 100, including both women with and without Alzheimer\'s. In addition, the team also spoke to relatives, spouses and caregivers.\n\nThrough these interviews, the researchers collected information about the women\'s reproductive history, their breastfeeding history and their dementia status. They also gathered information about other factors that might account for their dementia -- for example a past stroke or brain tumor.\n\nDementia status itself was measured using a standard rating scale called the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). The researchers also developed a method for estimating the age of Alzheimer\'s sufferers at the onset of their disease, using the CDR as a basis and taking into account their age and existing, known patterns of Alzheimer\'s progression. All of this information was then compared with the participants\' breastfeeding history.\n\nDespite the small number of participants, the study revealed a number of clear links between breastfeeding and Alzheimer\'s. These were not affected when the researchers took into account other potential variables such as age, education history, the age when the woman first gave birth, her age at menopause,or her smoking and drinking history.\n\nMain trends found\n\nThe researchers observed three main trends:\n\nWomen who breastfed exhibited a reduced Alzheimer\'s Disease risk compared with women who did not.\n\nLonger breastfeeding history was significantly associated with a lower Alzheimer\'s Risk.\n\nWomen who had a higher ratio of total months pregnant during their life to total months breastfeeding had a higher Alzheimer\'s risk.\n\nThe trends were, however, far less pronounced for women who had a parent or sibling with dementia. In these cases, the impact of breastfeeding on Alzheimer\'s risk appeared to be significantly lower than for women whose families had no history of dementia.\n\nExplaining the connection\n\nThe study argues that there may be a number of biological reasons for the connection between Alzheimer\'s and breastfeeding, all of which require further investigation.\n\nOne theory is that breastfeeding deprives the body of the hormone progesterone, compensating for high levels of progesterone which are produced during pregnancy. Progesterone is known to desensitize the brain\'s estrogen receptors, and estrogen may play a role in protecting the brain against Alzheimer\'s.\n\nAnother possibility is that breastfeeding increases a woman\'s glucose tolerance by restoring her insulin sensitivity after pregnancy. Pregnancy itself induces a natural state of insulin resistance. This is significant because Alzheimer\'s is characterized by a resistance to insulin in the brain (and therefore glucose intolerance) to the extent that it is even sometimes referred to as ""Type 3 diabetes"".\n\n""Women who spent more time pregnant without a compensatory phase of breastfeeding therefore may have more impaired glucose tolerance, which is consistent with our observation that those women have an increased risk of Alzheimer\'s disease,"" Fox concluded.', ""For example, breastfeeding restores insulin tolerance which is significantly reduced during pregnancy, and Alzheimer's is characterized by insulin resistance in the brain.\nUntil now, however, little has been done to examine the impact of breastfeeding duration on Alzheimer's risk.\nMain trends foundThe researchers observed three main trends:Women who breastfed exhibited a reduced Alzheimer's Disease risk compared with women who did not.\nLonger breastfeeding history was significantly associated with a lower Alzheimer's Risk.\nWomen who had a higher ratio of total months pregnant during their life to total months breastfeeding had a higher Alzheimer's risk.""]"

The numbers of people with Alzheimer’s are expected to explode – from 35.6 million worldwide today to an estimated 115.4 million by 2050.\n\n“This is a very exciting finding because it finally gives us a good opportunity to make clinically meaningful advances in Alzheimer’s disease research and treatment,” says the study’s senior investigator, Howard J. Federoff, MD, PD, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center.\n\nThe Georgetown team also included Amrita K. Cheema, PhD, Massimo S. Fiandaca, MD, Xiaogang Zhong, PhD, Timothy R. Mhyre, PhD, Linda H. MacArthur, PhD, and Ming T. Tan, PhD.\n\nGetting Ahead of Symptoms\n\nFederoff led a team of scientists that found a panel of 10 lipids—or fats—circulating in the blood could predict, with greater than 90 percent accuracy in the study population, who would experience symptoms of cognitive decline or Alzheimer’s disease within three years.\n\nThe five-year study followed 525 individuals in California and New York who were 70 years of age or older. Of the group, 46 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease at the time they enrolled, and 28 went from having normal cognitive function to an impaired memory status during the study period. The blood test revealed marked differences in lipids between those who developed cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s, and those who developed no signs of disease.\n\nInvestigators chose this age group because they were the most likely to develop memory problems within five years.\n\nIn addition to several Georgetown investigators, other team members include researchers from the University of Rochester, the University of California-Irvine, Rochester General Hospital, Unity Health System in Rochester, Temple University School of Medicine and Regis University School of Pharmacy in Denver.\n\nThe team determined that the 10 predictive lipids were molecules emanating from the destruction of brain cells.\n\nThe knowledge that a cognitively normal participant in a clinical trial possesses this telltale lipid profile will allow drug developers to see if experimental agents can prevent the onset of memory impairment at an earlier stage, Federoff says.\n\n“There have been many efforts to develop drugs that were thought to modify the history of Alzheimer’s disease and sadly, all of them have failed. One of the reasons for this is that the agents were tested in patients who already have the disease and that is the wrong stage to evaluate disease-modifying therapies,” Federoff says.\n\nWhile it is premature to know if treatment for a few years before the onset dementia can make a difference, Federoff notes that “for the first time, the potential for drug therapy can be tested in a smart and rigorous way.”\n\n‘The Story is Getting a Lot Tighter’\n\nThis is the first in what is expected to be a series of studies that will compare the molecular state in the brains of individuals with and without early signs of dementia.\n\nThe research team is conducting a systems biology analysis of everything from the plasma lipids — a straightforward quantitative test — to genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiles.\n\nThey have sequenced the genome of every one of the participants included in this study, collecting 12 terabytes of data—or 12 trillion digital bytes of information. The researchers are closing in on what Federoff calls a “network of molecules that defines an at-risk individual.”\n\n“The story is getting a lot tighter and the Nature Medicine report is just the very first volley. My anticipation is that eventually we are going to be able to link all of those informational molecules into a coherent story that might even begin to address what is the underlying mechanism that puts people at risk,” Federoff says.\n\nOne key finding is that the presence of the APOE4 gene, a known risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s, did not augment the diagnostic accuracy of the test. This is important because it suggests that “in at-risk individuals, APOE is playing an insignificant small role” and that this new lipid test is “much more predictive.”\n\nInformation is Power\n\nAs the researchers continue to refine their analysis, they are looking to test the efficacy of the lipid profile in more diverse populations.\n\n“When perfected, this very simple and inexpensive test can be conducted using the technology that exists in almost every clinical lab in the world,” Federoff says.\n\n“Knowing you are at risk for cognitive impairment can be valuable for planning, but it is most beneficial if you can modify your risk — and that is what we all seek and now have a helping hand in finding,” he says.\n\nFederoff and Georgetown researchers Amrita K. Cheema and Massimo S. Fiandaca along with Mark Mapstone of the University of Rochester are named as co-inventors on a patent application filed by Georgetown and the University of Rochester related to the technology described.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health (R01AG030753) and the Department of Defense (W81XWH-09-1-0107) funded the study.\n\nFor additional information on this study, view this video.\n\nBy Renee Twombly\n\nGUMC Communications', 'The Georgetown team also included Amrita K.

See video below.\n\nMarch 9, 2014 – If you are a senior citizens over age 70 a new blood test can predict with 90 percent accuracy if you will develop Alzheimer’s disease in the next two or three years. The new discovery still must go through clinical testing before being available for general use but now seniors will have to consider if this is information they really want to know.\n\nThe study, led by neurologist Howard Federoff of Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington DC, is published today in Nature Medicine. He and his colleagues studied 525 seniors over the age of 70.\n\nThey tested those in the study for cognitive and memory ability and took their blood samples about once a year over a five year period. They further studied the blood results of 53 with mild cognitive impairment – or AD – including 18 who developed disease symptoms during the testing, and another 53 who remained cognitively healthy.\n\nThey found ten complex lipids, known as phospholipids, that were present at consistently lower levels in the blood of most people who had, or went on to develop, cognitive impairment. The team validated the results in a set of 41 further participants and determined the 90 percent accuracy.\n\nA report on the study today by National Public Radio says, “The finding could lead to a quick and easy way for seniors to assess their risk of Alzheimer\'s, says Dr. Howard Federoff, a professor of neurology at Georgetown University. And that would be a ‘game changer,’ he says, if researchers find a treatment that can slow down or stop the disease.\n\n“But because there is still no way to halt Alzheimer\'s, Federoff says, people considering the test would have to decide whether they are prepared to get results that ‘could be life-altering.’”\n\nHe emphasizes that his results will have to be validated by others and larger studies: “We also have to look at different age groups and a more diverse racial mix, and we need longer study periods.”\n\nDo we really want to know?\n\nJon Hamilton, in his report on NPR, quoted and paraphrased Dr. Jason Karlawish, professor of medicine, medical ethics and health policy, University of Pennsylvania, on the ethics of being able to predict Alzheimer’s -\n\n""That knowledge can be a good thing. That\'s been shown among people who chose to be tested for a gene that increases the risk of Alzheimer\'s.\n\n""Knowing their risk of developing cognitive impairment is very relevant to making plans around retirement and where they live. So there is certainly a role for knowing that information.\n\n""On the other hand, people who have the Alzheimer\'s gene and know it tend to rate their own memories as worse than people who have the gene but don\'t know it. And knowing you carry the gene also seems to hurt people\'s performance on memory tests.\n\n""But the biggest concern about Alzheimer\'s testing probably has to do with questions of stigma and identity. How will other people interact with you if they learn that you have this information? And how will you think about your own brain and your sort of sense of self?\n\n""The stigma and fear surrounding Alzheimer\'s may decrease, though, as our understanding of the disease changes. Right now, people still tend to think that either you have Alzheimer\'s disease dementia or you\'re normal, you don\'t have it.\n\n""But research has shown that\'s not really true. Alzheimer\'s is a bit like heart disease. It starts with biological changes that occur years before symptoms appear. And there is no bright line separating healthy people from those in early stages of the disease.""\n\n“There is not yet a good treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, which affects 35 million people worldwide,” says Simon Lovestone, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, who was quoted in the Nature Medicine report on the study.\n\n“Several promising therapies have been tested in clinical trials over the last few years, but all have failed. However, those trials involved people who had already developed symptoms. Many neuroscientists fear that any benefits of a treatment would be missed in such a study, because it could be impossible to halt the disease once it has manifested. “We desperately need biomarkers which would allow patients to be identified — and recruited into trials — before their symptoms begin.”\n\n>> Original report, associated information at Nature.com.\n\n', ""Alzheimer's, Dementia & Mental HealthSenior Citizens May Soon Have Blood Test to Predict Alzheimer’s Risk with 90% AccuracyReport in Nature Medicine on discovery in study of seniors over age 70; NPR reports on consequences of knowing – see video in storyDr. Howard Federoff, right, led study at Georgetown University Medical Center to discover blood test to predict Alzheimer's disease.\nMarch 9, 2014 – If you are a senior citizens over age 70 a new blood test can predict with 90 percent accuracy if you will develop Alzheimer’s disease in the next two or three years.\nThey further studied the blood results of 53 with mild cognitive impairment – or AD – including 18 who developed disease symptoms during the testing, and another 53 who remained cognitively healthy.\nThat's been shown among people who chose to be tested for a gene that increases the risk of Alzheimer's.\nRight now, people still tend to think that either you have Alzheimer's disease dementia or you're normal, you don't have it.""]"

Now, whole genome sequencing (WGS) can cost as little as $1,000, with the procedure taking just days.\n\nWhen sequencing an organism\'s DNA, the order of DNA nucleotides is documented by machines. This ordering is transcribed in letters - A, C, G and T - which each represent a particular piece of DNA (adenines, guanines, thyamines and cytosines). The human genome is made up of 3 billion of these letters.\n\nUsing the genome sequence, scientists are able to find genes much more easily. In a clinical setting, it is hoped that WGS could quickly and accurately reveal the genetic basis of family diseases. Even in healthy individuals, it is believed that WGS can uncover potentially important information about a person\'s genes and their health.\n\nFor example, Medical News Today recently reported on new research that looked at using WGS to select embryos for in vitro fertilization.\n\nHowever, it is rare that the clinical findings of WGS are reported. Therefore, scientists do not have much information on how effective or reliable WGS is as a clinical tool.\n\nThree Main Problems in Using WGS to Diagnose Disease or Risk of Disease\n\nResearchers from the Stanford Center for Inherited Cardiovascular Disease in California recruited 12 adult volunteers who underwent WGS between Nov. 2011 and March 2012. The results were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team, and the researchers published their findings in the journal JAMA.\n\nThe study identifies three problems with using WGS in a clinical setting.\n\nFirstly, the study found that WGS\' coverage of inherited-disease genes was incomplete. Being able to accurately map the important parts of the genome for diseases that run in families is more difficult than mapping other sections of the genome.\n\nSecondly, the researchers could not reproduce all of the genetic variations that were detected, and the experts in the study could not agree on which types of variation were important for disease.\n\nThirdly, the experts in the study disagreed on which of the WGS results were most meaningful, or ""clinically reportable.""\n\nConsequently, the authors conclude that although the analytical validity of WGS is improving, there are still technical challenges with assessing individual results.\n\nAlthough the financial cost of the sequencing has made the technology more accessible, there are still ""considerable"" human resource needs in order to interpret and validate the data returned by WGS.\n\nWriting in a linked comment, JAMA associate editor Dr. William Gregory Feero says that studies like this ""provide a glimpse of what is possible but demonstrate that much remains to be learned about previously assumed to be \'known\' information as well as myriad \'known unknowns\' and \'unknown unknowns\' before truly successful widespread integration can occur.""\n\nHe adds: ""A question facing potential early adopters of genome sequencing as an adjunct to patient care is whether or not having WGS data, at this time, will decrease uncertainty and improve outcomes or merely exponentially increase the complexity of clinical care.""', 'The first sequencing of a human genome began in 1990 and was completed in 2003 at a cost of $2.7 billion.\nNow, whole genome sequencing (WGS) can cost as little as $1,000, with the procedure taking just days.\nThe human genome is made up of 3 billion of these letters.\nFor example, Medical News Today recently reported on new research that looked at using WGS to select embryos for in vitro fertilization.\nThe study identifies three problems with using WGS in a clinical setting.']"

New research from Stanford investigated some of the challenges - and highlighted some lifesaving results - of the technique.\n\nIn the study, which will be published tomorrow in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers examined the whole genomes of a dozen healthy people and calculated how long it took to manually analyze each participant’s results, the projected costs of recommended follow-up medical tests, and the degree of sequencing accuracy necessary to make clinical decisions for each person. My colleague Krista Conger describes the findings in a release:\n\nThe researchers estimated a cost of about $17,000 per person to sequence the genome and interpret and analyze the average of nearly 100 genetic variations deemed important enough for follow-up in each person. Each variation required approximately one hour of investigation to assess the relevant scientific literature and determine whether the change was indeed likely to modify disease risk in the individual. After this process, the researchers were left with approximately two to six results they felt could be clinically important; doctors who reviewed the results as part of the study suggested follow-up tests that carried costs of less than $1,000 per person. In one of the 12 cases, however, the payoff of this intensive process was big: A woman with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer learned she carried a potentially deadly deletion in her BRCA1 gene. After confirmation of the finding in a clinical cancer genetics setting, she was able to take action to reduce her future risk for breast and ovarian cancer. ...

Seaman\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Before doctors use technology to evaluate every ""letter"" in a person\'s DNA to detect or diagnose medical conditions, several hurdles must be overcome, according to a new study.\n\nResearchers found that sequencing a person\'s whole genome - all three billion or so DNA nucleotides in the chromosomes - required a significant amount of manpower for a small payoff.\n\nThey also found that identifications of potentially significant variations were not always reliable and doctors disagreed on how to proceed.\n\nOne of the study\'s authors said the cost of sequencing a person\'s entire genome has dropped in recent years, but the technology has been mostly used for research.\n\n""We thought the time had come to do a small pilot study of patients in the clinical setting,"" Dr. Euan Ashley told Reuters Health.\n\nAshley is a specialist in genomics and medicine at the Stanford School of Medicine in California.\n\nFor the new study published in JAMA, he and his colleagues recruited 12 unrelated people between November 2011 and March 2012 to have their full genomes sequenced.\n\nThe goal was to see how whole-genome sequencing may work in a real-world setting, such as a hospital or doctor\'s office.\n\nAfter drawing blood from the participants, the researchers sent all twelve samples to be sequenced by one large company and nine of the samples were also sent to a second sequencing company to see how comparable the sequence results would be.\n\nThe two sets of sequences mostly agreed when it came to common genetic variants (versions) of genes, but there were greater differences in the results among less common variants. For about 10 percent to 19 percent of genes that may be related to inherited diseases, the sequences were not reliable enough to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe researchers also used a computer program to sift the participants\' genetic data to identify the mutations that should be examined more closely - about 100 per participant.\n\nIt took researchers about one hour to research each mutation, which ended up costing about $15,000 per patient in manpower.\n\nExperts who examined the data also disagreed on the significance of some of the specific variants examined.\n\nOverall, a handful of genetic variants for each patient were reported to a group of primary care doctors, who then made recommendations about whether the patient should receive additional tests or be referred to specialists.\n\nThe doctors recommended between one and three referrals or medical tests per patient based on the results. The cost for that testing ranged from about $350 to $800.\n\n""The use of whole genome sequencing was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes, low reproducibility of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable whole genome sequencing findings,"" the researchers write.\n\nHowever, they note that one participant did find out about a gene variant that put her at an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. That led her to have surgery and increased cancer screenings.\n\n""This paper should essentially give people pause and make them think about some of the hard work that is yet to be done,"" Dr. W. Gregory Feero told Reuters Health.\n\nFeero, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, is a contributing editor to JAMA and on the faculty of the Maine Dartmouth Family Medicine Residency in Fairfield, Maine.\n\n""I think right now there are very few places that would be contemplating using this tool on patients clinically,"" he said.\n\n""While there is great opportunity from the standpoint of medicine for this technology, we have to remain cautious,"" Ashley said.\n\nBut Feero said that whole-genome sequencing is not too far off.\n\n""I think at the pace things are moving right now, this will be employed clinically faster than many people would have thought even five years ago,"" he said.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1fq8CJk and http://bit.ly/1fq8GZq JAMA, online March 11, 2014.', 'The goal was to see how whole-genome sequencing may work in a real-world setting, such as a hospital or doctor\'s office.\nThe two sets of sequences mostly agreed when it came to common genetic variants (versions) of genes, but there were greater differences in the results among less common variants.\n""The use of whole genome sequencing was associated with incomplete coverage of inherited disease genes, low reproducibility of genetic variation with the highest potential clinical effects, and uncertainty about clinically reportable whole genome sequencing findings,"" the researchers write.\n""While there is great opportunity from the standpoint of medicine for this technology, we have to remain cautious,"" Ashley said.\nBut Feero said that whole-genome sequencing is not too far off.']"

Exome sequencing, which is less costly and more commonly used, details about 1% of a patient's genome.\n\nThe whole genome sequencing of one patient in the study led to the unanticipated identification of a BRCA gene, which means the patient is at higher risk for being diagnosed with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. That patient underwent surgery to remove her ovaries and will also undergo increased cancer screenings as a result of the genetic findings.\n\nStudies like this one “provide a glimpse of what is possible but demonstrate that much remains to be learned about previously assumed to be 'known' information as well as myriad 'known unknowns' and 'unknown unknowns' before truly successful widespread integration can occur,” Dr. William Gregory Feero wrote in an accompanying editorial.\n\nFor the patient at higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer, sequencing may improve her outcomes. For otherwise healthy patients, who have been provided with new but possibly uncertain genetic information, sequencing may lead to costly and potentially unnecessary secondary testing and referrals.\n\nPrimary-care physicians who reviewed the patients' genomic reports called for follow-up work-ups for some patients. The median estimated costs for such tests and referrals ranged between $351 and $776.\n\n“There's a lot of discussion in the press currently about how inexpensive whole genome sequencing has become,” said Dr. Thomas Quertermous, chief of the cardiovascular medicine division at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., and a co-author of the study. “It's staggering how quickly it has come down. The question is how we implement that technology in the clinical arena.”\n\nEarlier this year Illumina, which markets genomic sequencing platforms, announced that its new HiSeq X Ten technology would sequence a human genome for a $1,000, an aspirational price that has long been cited as the point when whole genomic sequencing would become a mainstream part of clinical practice. Several years ago whole genome sequencing cost upwards of $100,000.\n\n“Until very recently, the time, cost and technical expertise required to generate and analyze WGS data largely precluded serious consideration of its use outside of research settings,” Feero wrote. “This can no longer be assumed to be the case.”\n\nWhat is challenging for clinicians is the time it can take to assess genetic variation for each patient, as well as the time needed to provide guidance to patients. “The amount of work that has to go into a single genome is quite significant,” Quertermous said.\n\nFollow Jaimy Lee on Twitter: @MHjlee"", ""Whole genome sequencing provides information about 95% of the patient's genome.\nExome sequencing, which is less costly and more commonly used, details about 1% of a patient's genome.\nFor the patient at higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer, sequencing may improve her outcomes.\nPrimary-care physicians who reviewed the patients' genomic reports called for follow-up work-ups for some patients.\nSeveral years ago whole genome sequencing cost upwards of $100,000.""]"

The Senate plan, passed for the first time in a committee on Tuesday, would legalize the substance. In contrast, the House proposal would not decriminalize the product but would provide individuals arrested, investigated or charged with a crime an “affirmative defense” that they could use to prove their innocence in court.\n\nBoth proposals deal with Charlotte’s Web, a strain of marijuana low in tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component in marijuana, but high in the derivative cannabidiol, or CBD.\n\nThe Senate measure (SB 1030), unanimously approved by the Senate Health Policy Committee on Tuesday, would create a statewide “compassionate use” registry of individuals deemed by their physicians to be eligible for “low-THC” treatment. The Senate plan would also allow users to ingest the substance by vapor, something not expressly permitted in the House version. And it would allow up to four dispensaries to distribute the substance, which could contain no more than .5 percent of THC and at least 15 percent CBD.\n\nDoctors could write the prescriptions for people who suffer from seizure disorders and who do not respond to other treatments, and keep records of how effective the treatment is. Doctors would have to submit quarterly reports about the efficacy of the treatment to the University of Florida College of Pharmacy, which would conduct research on the reports. The Senate plan would set aside $1 million to cover the research.\n\nUnder the House plan (HB 843), people who have strains of marijuana that contain .8 percent or less of THC and more than 10 percent of CBDs, along with the seeds of the plant, would have an “affirmative defense” available to them if they are caught with the substance or charged with a crime. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, the bill’s sponsor, said he hopes that law-enforcement officials and prosecutors won’t go after families, growers or doctors involved with Charlotte’s Web. The House version also allows for higher concentrations of THC and lower concentrations of CBD, which supporters say would treat more types of neurological diseases than the Senate’s more restrictive levels.\n\nAs in previous hearings on the hybrid, the Senate panel heard from parents who believe their children would benefit from the treatment — and fear they could die without it.\n\nPeyton and Holley Moseley’s 11-year-old adopted daughter RayAnn is one of about 125,000 Florida children diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy that can cause hundreds of seizures a day and does not respond to other treatments. The couple traveled to Colorado, where Charlotte’s Web is manufactured, and met with the child for whom the hybrid is named, who can now walk and talk.\n\n“And that’s why I’m here today, to ask for that opportunity for RayAnn and other children in Florida,” Holley Moseley said.\n\nOne of the bill’s sponsors, Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations Chairman Rob Bradley, a former prosecutor, said that lawmakers need to do something to help the “wonderful, inspirational parents” who are looking to the Legislature for help.\n\n“Any law that would define them as criminals defies common sense and is a law that should be changed,” Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said.\n\nGOP leaders in both the House and the Senate support the concept of making the non-euphoric pot available to parents whose children are wracked with hundreds of seizures a day and which can be fatal.\n\nAnd many Republican lawmakers are galvanizing support around Charlotte’s Web — which doesn’t get users high and isn’t smoked — as a more acceptable alternative to the medical marijuana question that will go before voters in November. The proposed constitutional amendment — bankrolled by Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, who is also Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist’s boss — would let doctors write prescriptions for severely ill patients. Republicans insist the amendment gives doctors too much discretion over who is eligible for the pot treatment and, if passed, would result in “pot shops on every corner.”\n\nSome GOP holdouts are reluctant to legalize any form of pot for personal and political reasons. Some fear that voters will interpret authorization of Charlotte’s Web as tacit approval of traditional medical marijuana. Others are concerned that the House proposal lacks the details necessary to ensure that the product delivered to patients is controlled and regulated.\n\n“I’m still cautiously optimistic that we can thread the needle so that we can help these families in some way and yet not abandon our whole understanding of drug safety and dosage and testing. It has its troubles. But it does protect consumers. We need to handle it very cautiously,” said House Judiciary Chairman Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala.\n\nby Dara Kim, The News Service of Florida', 'Competing Medical Marijuana Proposals In House, SenateLawmakers in both chambers are advancing proposals that would open the door for a non-euphoric strain of marijuana that backers believe can dramatically reduce seizures in children with a rare form of epilepsy.\nBoth proposals deal with Charlotte’s Web, a strain of marijuana low in tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component in marijuana, but high in the derivative cannabidiol, or CBD.\nThe Senate plan would also allow users to ingest the substance by vapor, something not expressly permitted in the House version.\nThe couple traveled to Colorado, where Charlotte’s Web is manufactured, and met with the child for whom the hybrid is named, who can now walk and talk.\nSome fear that voters will interpret authorization of Charlotte’s Web as tacit approval of traditional medical marijuana.']"

Stocking suffered a spine injury from an auto accident and because of chronic pain, he applied for a medical marijuana card in 2009.\n\n(Mark Bugnaski | MLive.com)\n\nLANSING, MI -- It wasn\'t the cancer. It was the weight loss that finally led Montrose Mayor Ray Foust to seek out medical marijuana for his dying niece.\n\nRoughly five years ago, Foust drove her 80 miles to a clinic in Southfield, where doctors ran her through a series of tests, certified her for medical marijuana use and gave her five cannabis capsules to try on her way out.\n\nHis niece, who had lost her appetite due to chemotherapy, popped one of the pills and saw immediate results. ""Let\'s pull into Wendy\'s,"" she told her uncle on the drive home. ""I\'m hungry.""\n\nFoust, testifying before the Michigan Senate Government Operations Committee on Tuesday, offered support for bills that would allow for the return of medical marijuana dispensaries and edible marijuana products in the wake of state court rulings that limited the legality of each.\n\nThe small-town mayor told lawmakers that he registered as a caregiver for his niece under Michigan\'s voter-approved medical marijuana law but found it too time consuming to grow the drug himself. Instead, he continued driving to Southfield each month, picking up medication for his niece until he and other city council members approved a local dispensary in Montrose.\n\n""I call it a safe transfer center,"" Foust said. ""I don\'t see why anybody would have to go to some low-life place to get a medicine … We don\'t want 10 distributors down the line. We don\'t want to be known as the medical marijuana capital. We want people to be able to get their medicine. That\'s all.""\n\nHouse Bill 4271, sponsored by state Rep. Mike Callton (R-Nashville), would give local communities the power to allow, prohibit or limit medical marijuana ""provisioning centers."" The regulated dispensaries could not operate within 1,000 feet of a school, could only sell products tested for safety and could not allow use on the premises.\n\nA 2013 Michigan Supreme Court ruling allowed county prosecutors to shut down unregulated dispensaries that had popped up around the state. Many businesses simply closed up shop before law enforcement stepped in.\n\nHouse Bill 5104, sponsored by state Rep. Eileen Kowall (R-White Lake), would expand the definition of usable medical marijuana to allow for non-smokable forms of the drug, including edibles, tinctures and topical creams. Many patients would rather not smoke, Kowall said, but a Michigan Court of Appeals ruling essentially limited their options.\n\nBoth medical marijuana bills passed the House by wide margins in December, but the Senate has been slow to act. Majority Leader Randy Richardville (R-Monroe), who chairs the Senate Government Operations Committee, took testimony on the bills Tuesday but did not hold a vote.\n\nThe Michigan State Police worked on the edibles bill but opposes it as written because of labeling language and concerns that an officer may not be able to determine how much marijuana is in any given product. MSP also is concerned that dispensaries would have to operate as cash-only businesses because of federal rules, making them potential targets for criminals.\n\nEric Pessle, environmental health division director for the Kent County Health Department, also testified against the dispensary bill, which would also allow provisioning centers to prepare and sell edible products. The legislation would require local inspections, but Pessle said that dispensaries preparing food should be subject to the same state-level requirements as traditional kitchens.\n\nThe majority of the testimony was supportive, however, with several registered patients describing success with the drug and difficulty obtaining it from a registered caregiver, whose numbers are on the decline.\n\n""This is really about dignity,"" said John Targowski, a criminal defense attorney from Kalamazoo who uses medical marijuana to treat symptoms stemming from a severe spinal cord injury. ""Dignity for patients who throughout 2009 and 2010 had legitimate, safe access to marijuana.

Men and women are moving to Colorado as ""marijuana refugees"" in order to legally use the drug.\n\nColorado legalized marijuana sales as of Jan. 1, according to USA Today. Since then, the substance has wound up in edibles that include everything from brownies to beef jerky. Other states have also followed the trend; Massachusetts recently awarded the first 20 licenses to operate medical marijuana dispensaries, and even southern states are changing their views on marijuana. Yet not all states are following this trend.\n\nThat\'s why over the last eight months, more than 100 families have moved to Colorado in order to legally use medical marijuana, according to CNN.com. More specifically, these families have sought out the drug for their children, many of whom suffer from seizures. Fortunately for these children, marijuana seems to be working.\n\nThere are actually a number of anecdotal reports of positive outcomes from a particular strain of marijuana that\'s known as Charlotte\'s Web, according to The Star Tribune. This strain has been known to help children with epilepsy. In fact, one family has managed to reduce the amount of medication their child needs by using the marijuana.\n\n""We\'ve been able to reduce her pharmaceuticals by 50 percent as a result of using Charlotte\'s Web,"" said Paula Lyles, the child\'s mother, in an interview with CNN.com. ""It\'s ridiculous. I didn\'t want to do it, but now that I\'m out here on the other side I know I\'m where I\'m supposed to be. I wanted to do anything to save Jordan\'s life.""\n\nNeedless to say, this case provides strong support for the use of medical marijuana.

8029,http://kcur.org/post/new-mental-health-crisis-strategy-launch-kansas-city,health,"['Every day, police in the Kansas City metro area are inundated with calls to handle mental illness emergencies.\n\n""Usually more than one time a day,” says Don Ash, sheriff of Wyandotte County, Kan. “Calls could come in from a family member. Calls could come in from the general public. From a business owner.”\n\nSomeone might be picked up for something as simple as loitering or trespassing, and even though it might clearly a mental health emergency, police typically have little choice but to take them to jail or possibly an emergency room.\n\nBut a new facility in the works in Kansas City, Kan., raises hope that local police will soon a better option.\n\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback announced Jan. 23 that a former state psychiatric hospital near the University Of Kansas Hospital, which has been mostly mothballed during the past few years, is being converted into a mental crisis stabilization facility.\n\nA Department of Justice report shows that nearly two-thirds of jail inmates in have some kind of mental health problem. Some have committed real crimes, but many have not.\n\nAsh believes taking these people to jail is not a great way to deal with a crisis, and it taps police resources.\n\n“They’re not available to be doing what the public truly expects them to be doing, and that is really dealing with suppressing crime or investigating crime,"" Ash said.\n\n“It is our hope that this is gonna be one of the most helpful and significant changes in the mental health system and its delivery in this state over the past, even couple of decades,” Brownback said when he announced the facility in Kansas City, Kan.\n\nThe Rainbow Mental Health Facility in Kansas City, Kan., has been all but empty since being cited for safety violations and staffing concerns in 2011. It will reopen April 1 as the first of the new 24/7 crisis stabilization centers in Kansas. Patients might stay a few hours or a few weeks. The new facility will have 10 longer-stay beds, compare to 50 beds in the previous Rainbow incarnation.\n\nMany involved in mental health agree the new facility could make a big difference, but see it just one step forward after years of falling behind on supporting mental illness.\n\n""There\'s been a steady erosion over the past seven, eight years on both sides of the state line,"" Susan Crain Lewis, President and CEO of Mental Health America of the Heartland, says of mental illness funding in the state.\n\n""It’s not been a question of ‘let’s get something more’ it’s like ‘how can we hold on to the bare minimum?’”\n\nState grants were created in the early 1990s to fund community mental health centers in Kansas. That funding was cut in 2008-09 and has fluctuated since then. The state attributes recent cuts to lower Medicaid caseloads.\n\nMissouri has also seen significant cuts for safety net services: about $17 million since 2010.\n\nLewis says those cuts have meant the uninsured and underinsured can’t get the help they need.\n\n“The minute you can’t go to your doctor for any amount of time, you get sicker,” says Lewis.\n\nMany advocates trace a new interest in funding mental health to the December 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., when a 20-year-old man who may have had a mental illness killed 26 people.\n\n“You always hate that it takes something like that for us to start paying attention to thing we know we need to be doing, but it did - I think - change the concentration on this issues,” says Brent McGinty, President and CEO of the Missouri Coalition of Community Mental Health Centers.\n\nMcGinty says that in the last year, the Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon and legislature have done a lot more for mental health, with programs like the “Strengthening Mental Health” initiative.\n\nAbout a month after the Sandy Hook shooting, Gov. Brownback announced plans for a new Kansas mental health strategy. He said he would channel $10 million into a regional mental health hub system.\n\nBrownback\'s new mental health strategy includes the rehabilitation of the Rainbow Mental Health Facility, and Sheriff Ash says it will make a difference.\n\n“I believe we will start to see a reduction in some of these people that we see, or that we see on a regular basis,” Ash explains.\n\nSusan Crain Lewis is optimistic, but cautious.\n\n“It’s a huge help, but it doesn’t solve all of the problems,” Lewis says.\n\nEven though the crisis center will fill an important gap, Lewis believes grant money still needs to be restored for community mental health centers. She says those funds are needed to help continue keeping people well after the work of the crisis center has ended.\n\n“The connection’s essential, but how long can that connection hold?” Lewis asks. “And how much can the community mental health center bear with no more revenue for the ongoing needs of those people?”\n\nThe crisis invention approach may be spreading, however. Advocates are currently seeking funding for a crisis facility on the Missouri side of the state line.\n\nEds note: This version adds clarity to the statement mental health funding levels in Kansas.', ""A Department of Justice report shows that nearly two-thirds of jail inmates in have some kind of mental health problem.\nThe Rainbow Mental Health Facility in Kansas City, Kan., has been all but empty since being cited for safety violations and staffing concerns in 2011.\nJay Nixon and legislature have done a lot more for mental health, with programs like the “Strengthening Mental Health” initiative.\nBrownback announced plans for a new Kansas mental health strategy.\nBrownback's new mental health strategy includes the rehabilitation of the Rainbow Mental Health Facility, and Sheriff Ash says it will make a difference.""]"

The issue has been highlighted by HSJ in recent months, including criticism from health minister Norman Lamb.\n\nJane Hughes, director of communications and campaigns at Rethink, said: “It’s a scandal that these crucial services are going through major funding cuts.\n\n“Early intervention is absolutely critical in helping young people recover from psychosis, which affects around 220,000 people in England. This care saves lives - it reduces the risk of a young person with psychosis taking their own life, from as much as 15 per cent to just 1per cent.\n\n“It also offers the NHS huge savings, by helping young people avoid reaching crisis-point and being hospitalised.

Cuts to local authority social care budgets – the majority of which have hit since 2009 – have left a funding shortfall for care of up to £260 million, the charity said.\n\nMind extracted the data from research published by the London School of Economics in December last year. When demographic changes are accounted for, the fall in the number of mental health service users in receipt of social care support since 2005 could be as high as 68,000 – a 48% drop. The reduction in the number of people with physical health needs receiving social care support was 33%.\n\nThe report also found that almost a third (30%) of councils had halved the number of people with mental health problems receiving social care support.\n\nPaul Farmer, Mind’s chief executive, said the findings suggested the government was failing to “look at the bigger picture” around support for people with mental health needs.\n\n“In reality it is cheaper to provide preventative services like social care, which help people affected by mental health problems at an earlier stage, in comparison to crisis services that are currently understaffed and overstretched,” he said.\n\nFarmer also urged the government to introduce a ‘more reasonable’ national threshold for social care than the current plans to set it at a level equivalent to the ‘substantial’ band used by the vast majority of local authorities. The powers to set a national threshold for care are included in the government’s Care Bill, which is expected to complete its journey through Parliament shortly.\n\nFrontline social workers have also raised concerns over funding for services. More than half (50.5%) of 111 mental health social workers surveyed by The College of Social Work (TCSW) said investment in statutory social work for mental health was ‘poor’ in their area. Over a third (35.3%) rated standards of mental health care as ‘poor’ and almost half (47%) reported problems accessing personal budgets for people with mental health needs.\n\nSteve Chamberlain, chair of TCSW’s network of Approved Mental Health Professionals, said the cuts to social care support highlighted by Mind could be “the tip of the iceberg”.\n\n“It looks like the next two or three years is likely to see even more cuts to funding for local authorities. Thresholds for social care have already gone up in many areas as there is less money to go around. It feels like we are increasingly unable to intervene earlier and work with people to access social elements that can help to maintain their mental health and avoid crises,” he said.\n\nFaye Wilson, chair of the British Association of Social Workers mental health forum, also said that rising thresholds for social care were leading to less preventive work.\n\n“If you really want to support someone’s recovery it’s about things like supporting them to integrate into their community, helping them to access employment or benefits, supporting them to get their life back. The support cannot be restricted to just the healthcare part. You take those other social support components away and you’ve got a real problem,” she said.\n\nSarah Norman, co-chair of the Association for the Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass) mental health network, said the research had to be viewed in the context of significant reductions to local authority budgets in the past three years and a general drive to reduce dependency on services.\n\n“Throughout, social care services have done their utmost to maintain services for people with mental health issues, and to extend as far as possible the principles of personalisation in working with them,” she said.\n\nAdass believes that the government’s proposed threshold for care, under the Care Bill, is likely to widen rather than reduce eligibility for social care, Norman added.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson said the government expected NHS and local authorities to ensure “equal priority” is given to mental health and physical health services when making spending decisions.\n\n“We have given councils significant extra funding for social care and are going further by creating our £3.8bn Better Care Fund to invest in joined up services that keep people living well and independently for as long as possible. Our national eligibility threshold will be set at a level that will allow local authorities to maintain the same level of access to support for those who are eligible when they move to the new care and support system in April 2015,” she added.', 'Budget cuts have left tens of thousands of adults with mental health problems without key social care support that could help prevent their health from deteriorating to crisis point, a leading charity has warned.\nThe reduction in the number of people with physical health needs receiving social care support was 33%.\nMore than half (50.5%) of 111 mental health social workers surveyed by The College of Social Work (TCSW) said investment in statutory social work for mental health was ‘poor’ in their area.\nOver a third (35.3%) rated standards of mental health care as ‘poor’ and almost half (47%) reported problems accessing personal budgets for people with mental health needs.\nFaye Wilson, chair of the British Association of Social Workers mental health forum, also said that rising thresholds for social care were leading to less preventive work.']"

More than half of EIP services had lost staff (58%) and almost a third (31%) said that their caseloads had exceeded recommended levels. Some teams had been disbanded entirely, while others had seen their functions absorbed into community mental health teams.\n\nWhat is psychosis? Psychosis is a medical term used to describe mental health problems that stop the person from thinking clearly, telling the difference between reality and their imagination, and acting in a normal way. The two main symptoms are hallucinations and delusions. Source: NHS Choices\n\nThe survey was carried out by mental health charity Rethink mental illness and the IRIS network, a group of professionals that support early intervention work.\n\nEIP teams support 14 to 35-year-olds to recover from a first episode of psychosis through interventions including family therapy and employment support. The EIP model is praised as an example of ‘internationally recognised’ care in the government’s mental health strategy. Research has suggested the services could save the NHS up to £44 million a year by cutting pressure on hospital beds.\n\nJane Hughes, director of campaigns at Rethink, said that the cuts to EIP teams were leading to young people facing “unacceptable waits” for care, increasing the likelihood of them requiring hospital admission or detention under the Mental Health Act.\n\n“That’s why cutting early intervention care makes no sense whatsoever. The human, social and economic costs of are too great, especially at a time when mental health hospitals are completely over-stretched and unable to cope with demand,” she said.\n\nFaye Wilson, chair of the British Association of Social Workers’ mental health forum, said EIP services had “one of the strongest evidence bases for early intervention”.\n\n“It’s appalling to cut these services. They have been incredibly effective in supporting people’s recovery. As well as working with people around their psychosis, they have done incredible work around things like supporting people back into employment and education,” she said.\n\nWilson said moves to absorb EIP teams into generic community mental health teams risked losing the benefits of intensive support.\n\n“Community mental health teams are often running caseloads of 30 or 35 per worker. The recommended caseload for EIP is around 12. With 12 cases you can respond intensively, you can take that whole team and whole life approach and work with support workers to link people into community facilities,” she said.\n\nThe Rethink report report makes a series of recommendations to improve care, including a call on the government to introduce a maximum waiting time of 28 days for accessing EIP services.\n\nResponding to the findings, a Department of Health spokeswoman said: “It’s completely wrong to disadvantage mental health when allocating local funds. We are clear that the NHS must place equal priority on physical and mental health – decisions on how to spend NHS money should reflect this.\n\n“Mental health is a priority for this Government which is why we have invested over £450 million into improving access to treatment for people with mental health problems. We are also improving care for people in crisis, setting up ‘street triage’ pilots across the country, investing £25m in liaison and diversion services and asking NHS England to introduce waiting time standards for mental health.”', 'A survey of 96 of 125 early intervention psychosis services (EIP) in England revealed that 50% had seen their budgets cut in the last year.\nMore than half of EIP services had lost staff (58%) and almost a third (31%) said that their caseloads had exceeded recommended levels.\nSome teams had been disbanded entirely, while others had seen their functions absorbed into community mental health teams.\n“Community mental health teams are often running caseloads of 30 or 35 per worker.\n“Mental health is a priority for this Government which is why we have invested over £450 million into improving access to treatment for people with mental health problems.']"

I’ve invested more than 30 thousand hours investigating this one subject.\n\nAnd what I’ve found sickens me. It compels me to reject with my very being the concept of a Drug War. It is a scam, a feckless, endless, mindless pursuit of global success and salvation. It’s been more than 40 years since President Nixon declared the war on drugs to “Go after the blacks without appearing to do so”.\n\nIt is now over 50 years since the United Nations declared their war on drugs with the belief that they would eliminate drugs from planet Earth within 5 years. Barbarous drug cartels worldwide love this situation. It makes them billions of dollars per year.\n\nCocaine was made a federal offense when politicians proclaimed that black men on Cocaine would rape white women, or at a minimum would fail to step off the sidewalk when a white man approached.\n\nIn 1937, because Mexicans were taking our jobs and they “might” rape white women while high on Marijuana, the feds crafted the Marijuana Tax Act which was later declared unconstitutional in Leary vs. U.S., then put under the regimen of the ludicrously named Controlled Substances Act.\n\nOver the lifetime of the Drug War, more than 45 million non-violent US citizens—have been arrested for these plant products in their pocket. The US has invested over 1 Trillion dollars trying to stop the flow of these drugs. And at the same time, drug users worldwide have invested 10 Trillion dollars in purchasing these drugs. These barbarous cartels, the terrorists and the thousands of U.S. gangs make 400 Billion dollars a year from this policy.\n\nSo what have we wrought? What benefits? What positives have we derived from maintaining this policy? And what are we likely to derive if we continue this forever? Most politicians are so ignorant as to avoid this question at any cost, but when I spoke with former President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, I asked him “Is there anything positive that we derive from this Drug War?” and he said, “Nothing, there is no benefit”, he closed his thought with, ”prohibition doesn’t work”.\n\nBelief in the Drug War allows ignorance to be used as a badge. And to hell with the Constitution. Belief in Drug War encourages feigned hysteria and overblown fears which are now being used as a bludgeon.\n\nBefore prohibition of these drugs, a gram of pure Cocaine could be bought at the drug store for twenty-five cents. Now, the youngsters out there are buying a contaminated, often polluted, gram of Cocaine that could go over one hundred dollars per gram. Prior to the Drug War, a month’s supply of Heroin could be purchased from Sears Roebuck for a dollar and they would throw in a syringe as a bonus as well.\n\nBack in 1900, 1 and ½ percent of us were addicted. Today after all this hoopla, 1 and ½ percent of us are addicted.\n\nAfter forty years, fifty years, more than a hundred years of Drug War, it’s time to face facts. The Drug War is a pipe dream of men who have long since died. It has become a quasi-religion, a belief system that attracted many adherents within law enforcement and the criminal justice system to speak from ignorance, bigotry and steadfastly in support of primitive creeds, platitudes and irrational tradition.\n\nThose who make their bones from this policy—and by God the cemetery is overflowing from their efforts—cannot now back down from their prior pronouncements. They dare not jeopardize their reputation, their legacy; by now embracing the truth that the Drug War is vacuous, hollow and a horrendous mistake. Until we face this truth, these cheerleaders for Drug War, these Drug War addicts, will continue their eternal chant, their everlasting rain dance in the eye of this Drug War hurricane.\n\nThe answer to the Drug War? Legalize. Stop funding the Taliban. Gut the cartels. Eliminate most of the gangs. Let Pfizer produce it and let Walgreen sell it. We’ll judge adults by their actions like it used to be, instead of by the contents of the baggies in their pocket. We’ll then have lots of room in prison for anybody who would dare sell drugs to our children.\n\nI am not for gradual change to the drug laws quoting Martin Luther King Jr., “Gradualism is so often an excuse for Escapism and Do Nothingism, which ends up in Standstillism”.\n\nThe Drug War is an abomination and it must be ended.\n\nTo End The War On Drugs features the thoughts of 115 experts on the subject of drug war. Included are the words of scientists, doctors, judges, cops, wardens, prosecutors, politicians, authors, prisoners, patients, pastors, pot providers and more.\n\n340 pages of unvarnished truth that will help bring about an end to the madness of this irrational, unscientific and plain fucking evil war on drugs.\n\nPaperback On sale at CreateSpace/Amazon\n\nKindle Digital Version\n\nWebsite: Features link to first two chapters & Index of experts\n\nContact: dean@drugtruth.net\n\nGet a copy, share it with friends and family.

Statistics can be gleaned from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and other sources about the prevalence of alcohol use, alcohol use disorders, underage drinking, alcohol-related conditions, and fatalities.\n\nIt is not possible to determine the number of alcoholics in the United States because there is no official diagnosis of ""alcoholism."" Since the publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) in May 2013, drinking problems have been diagnosed as alcohol abuse disorders, ranging in level from mild to moderate to severe. Even before then, in the DSM-IV, published in 1994, alcohol use disorders were broken down into two categories: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence.\n\nAlcohol Use\n\nAmong people 18 years or older, an estimated 86.4 percent reported they had consumed alcohol at some point during their lives; 70.1 percent said they had a drink within the past 12 months and 56.0 percent said they drank alcohol within the past 30 days.\n\nPrevalence of Binge Drinking and Heavy Drinking\n\nAn approximate 26.9 percent of all adults in the U.S. reported engaging in binge drinking in the past 30 days and 7.0 percent admitted to heavy drinking in the past month. For the NSDUH survey, binge drinking was defined as five or more drinking on the same occasion on at least one day in the past 30 days. Heavy drinking was defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion on five or more days in the past 30 days.\n\nAlcohol Use Disorders\n\nAn estimated 6.2 percent of adults over 18—about 15.1 million people—had an alcohol use disorder. This included 9.8 million men and 5.3 million women, or 8.4 percent of all adult men and 4.2 percent of all adult women.\n\nOf the people with a drinking problem, only 6.7 percent received professional treatment for their alcohol use disorder in the past year from a facility specializing in alcohol treatment and rehabilitation.\n\nBreaking it down further, only 7.4 percent of men and 5.4 percent of women who needed help for an alcohol problem actually sought help for that problem.\n\nThe prevalence of heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorders are highest among men aged 18 to 24, and men who are unemployed.\n\nSeveral studies have found that binge drinking was most common among non-Hispanics whites, those with some college education, and those with an annual family income $75,000 or more. In contrast, alcohol use disorders were most common among American Indians or Alaskan Natives, those having less than a high school education, and those with an annual family income of less than $25,000.\n\nAlcohol Use Disorders Among Youth\n\nAmong youth ages 12 to 17, an estimated 623,000 had alcohol use disorders, including 325,000 females and 298,000 males. Among U.S. adolescents, 2.5 percent had already developed an alcohol use disorder. During the previous 12 months, only 5.2 percent of those with a drinking problem received treatment in a rehab facility.\n\nAlcohol-Related Deaths\n\nEach year, an estimated 88,000 people—62,000 men and 26,000 women—die from alcohol-related causes. This makes alcohol abuse the third leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. In 2014, there were 9,967 deaths attributed to alcohol-impaired driving.\n\nPrevalence of Underage Alcohol Use\n\nA CDC report from 2014 said that, among 15-year-old Americans, 35.1 percent reported having had at least one drink and about 22.7 percent reported drinking within the past 30 days. That included 23 percent of males and 22.5 percent of females.\n\nAmong those from age 12 to age 20, 14.2 percent—about 5.4 million—reported binge drinking. That includes 15.8 percent of males and 12.4 percent of females. Approximately 3.7 percent of this age group—about 1.4 million—reported heavy drinking, including 4.6 percent of males and 2.7 percent of females.\n\nPrevalence of Alcohol Use Among College Students', 'It is not possible to determine the number of alcoholics in the United States because there is no official diagnosis of ""alcoholism.""\nPrevalence of Binge Drinking and Heavy DrinkingAn approximate 26.9 percent of all adults in the U.S. reported engaging in binge drinking in the past 30 days and 7.0 percent admitted to heavy drinking in the past month.\nHeavy drinking was defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion on five or more days in the past 30 days.\nThe prevalence of heavy drinking, binge drinking, and alcohol use disorders are highest among men aged 18 to 24, and men who are unemployed.\nApproximately 3.7 percent of this age group—about 1.4 million—reported heavy drinking, including 4.6 percent of males and 2.7 percent of females.']"

Estimates for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine are largely based on information from the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, or ADAM. The final estimates also incorporated information from other data sources\n\nHowever, since the federal government recently halted funding for ADAM, researchers say it will be considerably harder to track the abuse of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine in the future.\n\n""The ADAM program provided unique insights about those who abused hard drugs and how much they spent on these substances,"" said Jonathan Caulkins, a study co-author and the Stever Professor of Operations Research and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. ""It\'s a tragedy that 2013 was the last year for ADAM. It is such an important data system for understanding drug problems.""\n\nTo improve future estimates, the report recommends investments in programs like ADAM that collect detailed data from heavy users.

With open enrollment ending on March 31, that means to meet the goal, 1.8 million people would have to sign up during the month, an average of about 60,000 a day.\n\nThat�s way above the daily averages for January and February, which have ranged between 33,000 and 34,000.\n\nIf the target isn�t met, the immediate fallout will be political. Republicans will say it proves their point that Obama�s signature project doesn�t have the public�s support.\n\nAdministration officials expect the pace to pick up as procrastinators are forced to act. There are no plans to extend the deadline, they emphasize. The big question is whether that will be enough to make up for the technical troubles that paralyzed HealthCare.gov much of last fall and the continuing challenges for several state-sponsored websites.\n\nThe goal of 6 million sign-ups is a lower bar than what was first set. The Congressional Budget Office scaled back its target of 7 million because of the federal website�s computer problems. HealthCare.gov serves 36 states. Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., are running their own sites.\n\nThe numbers released yesterday don�t say how many of those signing up were uninsured, which is the ultimate test of the health-care overhaul. And they don�t say how many consumers have sealed the deal by paying their premiums.\n\nAmong the highlights of yesterday�s federal report:\n\n� Young adults seemed to be showing a little more interest in signing up. Of those signing up in February, 27 percent were 18 to 34 years old. People 55 to 64 currently account for 30 percent of total enrollment.\n\n� More than 4 in 5 who have enrolled thus far were eligible for tax credits to help offset the cost of premiums, and in some cases also to reduce their deductibles and copayments."", ""WASHINGTON - The Obama administration said yesterday that it's making steady progress on health-care sign-ups, but the White House needs something close to a miracle to meet its goal of enrolling 6 million people by the end of this month.\nDuring February, the Department of Health and Human Services said more than 940,000 people have signed up for private coverage under the new health-care law, bringing total sign-ups to 4.2 million.\nWith open enrollment ending on March 31, that means to meet the goal, 1.8 million people would have to sign up during the month, an average of about 60,000 a day.\nThe goal of 6 million sign-ups is a lower bar than what was first set.\nThe numbers released yesterday don�t say how many of those signing up were uninsured, which is the ultimate test of the health-care overhaul.""]"

But administration officials predicted a surge of applications toward the end of this month, just before the open enrollment period ends.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Obama administration said Tuesday that 943,000 people signed up last month for private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, increasing the number of those who have selected health plans since Oct. 1 to more than 4.2 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsurers and the White House have avidly sought young adults, saying their premium payments were needed to offset the costs of coverage for Americans who were older and presumably sicker.\n\nThe latest figures were released as the White House makes a final push to increase enrollment, which got off to a slow start because of the technical problems that crippled the federal insurance marketplace in October. Less than three weeks remain before the March 31 deadline for consumers to sign up.\n\nOf the people who have signed up so far, the administration said, 2.6 million were in the federal insurance marketplace, and 1.6 million were in states running their own exchanges.\n\n“Over 4.2 million Americans have signed up for affordable plans through the marketplace,” said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. “Now, during this final month of open enrollment, our message to the American people is this: You still have time to get covered, but you’ll want to sign up today.”\n\nThe age profile of people signing up is somewhat older than insurers had expected. The number of people age 55 to 64 — 1.3 million — exceeds the number in the 18-to-34 age bracket, 1.1 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsurers say that roughly one in five people who signed up for coverage failed to pay their January premiums. And some of those who paid and received services in January failed to pay premiums for February, putting their coverage at risk.\n\nMore than four-fifths of those choosing health plans to date — 83 percent — qualified for financial assistance to help pay their premiums, administration officials said.\n\nPeople who go without insurance after March 31 may be subject to tax penalties. The Internal Revenue Service can deduct the penalties from any refunds to which taxpayers may be entitled.\n\nNew York Times — NEW YORK TIMES\n\nObama takes a turn ‘Between Two Ferns’\n\nWASHINGTON — President Obama is hamming it up online to promote his health care plan.\n\nObama joked Tuesday with comedian Zach Galifianakis, including poking fun at the poorly reviewed ‘‘The Hangover Part III’’ during an interview on the website Funny or Die.\n\nGalifianakis typically poses awkward questions to celebrity guests appearing on ‘‘Between Two Ferns,’’ and Obama was no exception. After being asked how it felt to be ‘‘the last black president’’ and about the false notion that he was born in Kenya, the president pitched sign-ups for health care by the March 31 deadline.\n\nObama’s appearance is part of an effort to reach young Americans crucial to the program’s success.\n\nAsked whether he’d want a third term — which is barred by the Constitution — Obama said, ‘‘If I ran again it would be sort of like doing a third ‘Hangover’ movie. It didn’t really work out very well, did it?’’\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGalifianakis is a star of the ‘‘Hangover’’ franchise.\n\n— Associated Press ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nSenate OK’s bill backing pediatric medical research\n\nWASHINGTON — The Senate Tuesday passed Republican-backed legislation to repeal taxpayer funding for political conventions and to go on record in support of devoting $126 million over the coming decade for additional research into pediatric cancer and other childhood disorders like autism and Down syndrome.\n\nThe measure was passed by unanimous voice vote at the request of minority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky. It now goes to President Obama for his signature. The House passed the measure late last year.\n\nThe legislation was named after Gabriella Miller, a Virginia girl who died of brain cancer last year at age 10. She had helped raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation and also sought to win public support for pediatric cancer research.\n\n‘‘One courageous young girl, Gabriella Miller, inspired bipartisan action to help research, treat, and cure pediatric diseases and disorders,’’ said majority leader Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia and a key House sponsor of the measure. “When people would remark that Gabriella was wise beyond her years, she would tell them that having a brain tumor means you have to grow up real fast.’’\n\nMajority leader Harry Reid of Nevada said the measure is largely symbolic and doesn’t directly fund additional pediatric research; the actual funding would come in future appropriations bills. Funding for medical research through the National Institutes of Health has been squeezed in recent years under tight spending limits and automatic spending cuts.\n\nAdvertisement', 'WASHINGTON — The Obama administration said Tuesday that 943,000 people signed up last month for private health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, increasing the number of those who have selected health plans since Oct. 1 to more than 4.2 million.\n“Over 4.2 million Americans have signed up for affordable plans through the marketplace,” said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services.\nThe number of people age 55 to 64 — 1.3 million — exceeds the number in the 18-to-34 age bracket, 1.1 million.\nMore than four-fifths of those choosing health plans to date — 83 percent — qualified for financial assistance to help pay their premiums, administration officials said.\nNew York Times — NEW YORK TIMESObama takes a turn ‘Between Two Ferns’WASHINGTON — President Obama is hamming it up online to promote his health care plan.']"

The state is working closely with hundreds of groups in communities across Illinois to assist people in the enrollment process, she said.\n\nNationally, total sign-ups reached 4.2 million, according to the figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration hasn\'t said how many of those people were previously uninsured or how many have paid their premiums.\n\nIllinois\' tally through the end of February fell just short of the original five-month goal of 114,400 for the state, an estimate contained in a Sept. 5, 2013 departmental memo to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. That report also set a target of 143,000 Illinois enrollees by March 31.\n\nIllinois would have to sign up 944 people per day in March to achieve that overall goal.\n\nOne-third of the Illinoisans signing up for coverage are older, ages 55 to 64, a group more likely to have expensive medical needs than younger people. The most popular plans are the so-called silver plans, with 56 percent of Illinois enrollees choosing them over other plans.\n\nThe health care law requires nearly every American to have insurance coverage or pay a tax penalty of either $95 or 1 percent of income, whichever is higher.\n\nTime is running out for people who want to buy private health insurance and avoid the penalty. March 15 is the deadline to sign up for coverage that begins on April 1.

Rappe said a program through her local hospital has helped pay for her prescriptions, but she was unable to afford an insurance policy until she found one through the new marketplace.\n\n\n\nRappe, who describes herself as ""not computer-literate at all,"" met with a marketplace assister at her local library to explore her options and enroll in a plan.\n\n\n\n""Because of all the horror stories I\'d seen on the news, I was very surprised it went so smooth,"" she said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nHer new policy will cost her $30 a month.\n\n\n\n""It\'s a good feeling,"" she said. ""Now, I just need to call up the doctor and make some appointments.""\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire opted not to set up its own marketplace and is partnering with the federal government to educate consumers and manage the health plans being offered. The state Executive Council is set to vote today on whether to allow the Insurance Department to accept a $2 million federal grant for continued plan management.\n\n\n\nFor now, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire is the only insurer offering health plans through the exchange, and it has faced criticism for excluding 10 of the state\'s 26 hospitals from its provider network. At least two other companies have said they plan to begin offering plans next year.\n\n\n\n25,000-plus Mainers picked ACA plans\n\n\n\nAUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The federal government said more than 25,000 Maine residents have picked health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, surpassing the target set by Obama\'s administration for the entire enrollment period that ends this month.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. DHHS said Tuesday that 25,412 Maine residents selected plans on the exchange by March 1. The administration\'s goal was for 23,000 Mainers to be enrolled in plans by March 31, when the open enrollment period ends.\n\n\n\nMaine is one of 16 states that are using the federally run exchange.\n\n\n\nThirty-nine percent of those who have picked plans in Maine are between the ages of 55 and 64.', ""Figures released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services show 4,715 New Hampshire residents signed up in February, bringing the total since enrollment opened Oct. 1 to 21,578.\nThat's well over the target of 19,000 spelled out in a Sept. 5 memo to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\nAs was the case nationally, more women have selected plans than men in New Hampshire.\nNew Hampshire opted not to set up its own marketplace and is partnering with the federal government to educate consumers and manage the health plans being offered.\nThe U.S. DHHS said Tuesday that 25,412 Maine residents selected plans on the exchange by March 1.""]"

But now they are promoting one of its main provisions, cheap and federally subsidized private plans available through the law’s insurance marketplaces, as a way to keep the state from acting on another part of the law, an expansion of Medicaid.\n\nAdditional Photos In this 2005 file photo, nurses care for a patient at Maine Medical Center in Portland. Republican lawmakers, who have long opposed President Obama’s signature health insurance law, are now promoting one of its main provisions: cheap and federally subsidized private plans. Press Herald/2005 Staff File Photo\n\n“We understand this is the law that we have to work with right now,” said Republican Rep. Deb Sanderson of Chelsea. “This is the hand that we’ve been dealt. We have a bad hand and worse hand and, for Maine, Medicaid expansion is the worse hand.”\n\nMaine, one of six states that hasn’t decided whether to expand Medicaid under the health care law, is gearing up for more debates on the topic Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats hope to get enough support for expansion to overturn a certain veto from Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who’s rejected two previous attempts to pass the bill. But many Republicans remain staunchly opposed despite the inclusion of provisions designed to attract their votes, such as implementing managed care in the Medicaid program.\n\nRepublicans, whose opposition to Medicaid expansion has centered on the possibility of hefty future costs to the state, have recently shifted their focus to highlight that Mainers can instead get private plans for as little as $5 or $10 a month. Some lawmakers have even started handling out pamphlets and explaining to protesters about their options on the marketplace, also called an exchange.\n\nAs part of the health care law, the federal government pays for part of some plans on the marketplace through income-based tax credits or subsidies. In Maine, more than 25,000 residents have already picked plans, surpassing the goal of having 23,000 residents signed up by the end of the open enrollment period in March.\n\nBut Democrats and advocates point to the fact that those making roughly $12,000 a year won’t get help to pay for plans on the exchange, which would be about 24,000 Mainers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. They criticized the Republican tactic to push such plans.\n\n“It’s a desperate ploy at the 11th hour to appear to be concerned about the health care of 70,000 people,” said Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves of North Berwick. Maine has the opportunity accept federal dollars that will not only provide health care coverage to all those who need it in Maine, but will also bring significant benefits to the state’s economy, he said.\n\n“If this does not pass, I think going to be reflected on both as a bad human decision and a bad business decision,” he said. “You don’t forgo this kind of money and there not be consequences for our economy.”\n\nAdvocates for Medicaid expansion contend that the subsidies aren’t a viable alternative for many low-income Mainers\n\nMany will likely be drawn to plans on the exchange that have the lowest monthly premiums, but those plans don’t offer subsidies to help reduce the total out-of-pocket cost, said Sara Gagne-Holmes, executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners. That means people who buy them will be on the hook for much higher costs when they seek care, she said.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Michael Thibodeau of Waldo is quick to say that Republicans are by no means support the health care law with their efforts. In fact, he questions whether the subsidies will be sustainable long term. They merely hope to point out what options Mainers have that won’t result in continued dependence on a state-run program, he said.\n\n“This exists,” he said. “I don’t know for how long. But I think Mainers should take advantage of it while it’s there.”\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.', 'AUGUSTA — Maine Republicans who are fiercely fighting an effort to expand government-subsidized health care coverage to roughly 70,000 residents have come up with an alternative: government-subsidized health care.\nBut many Republicans remain staunchly opposed despite the inclusion of provisions designed to attract their votes, such as implementing managed care in the Medicaid program.\nAs part of the health care law, the federal government pays for part of some plans on the marketplace through income-based tax credits or subsidies.\n“It’s a desperate ploy at the 11th hour to appear to be concerned about the health care of 70,000 people,” said Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves of North Berwick.\nSenate Republican Leader Michael Thibodeau of Waldo is quick to say that Republicans are by no means support the health care law with their efforts.']"

That\'s up from 20,511 Mainers at the end of January, but a lag from the previous month\'s sign-up rate.\n\nNationally, about 4.2 million people have signed up for health plans through Healthcare.gov and state-run marketplaces. About 900,000 signed up in February, down from 1.14 million in January and well short of the Obama administration\'s enrollment goals. The waning pace could spell trouble for the health care law, which administration officials had hoped would attract 6 million sign-ups by March 31 , the last day of open enrollment.\n\nMaine , however, has emerged as a leader in health insurance enrollments compared to other states using Healthcare.gov. The state beat not only the federal target of 18,400 enrollments by the end of February, but also outperformed, ahead of schedule, a goal of 23,000 enrollment by the end of the month.\n\n"" Maine\'s numbers are looking good,"" Ray Hurd , regional administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , said Tuesday following a Portland health insurance sign-up event.\n\nChristie Hager , regional director for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , credited Maine\'s ""all hands on deck"" approach for the state\'s enrollment success. Multiple community and health groups partnered to spread awareness of the Affordable Care Act\'s health insurance options, she said.\n\nWill Down , who just moved to Portland from San Diego , signed up for a new Anthem health plan at the event, with help from Liz Charles of Maine Migrant Health .\n\n""You\'re done,"" Charles said, high-fiving Down as the pair completed his application on Healthcare.gov.\n\nDown, 29, said he expected more of a hassle with the site, after hearing about its troubled rollout.\n\n""It was a lot easier than I thought it would be,"" he said.\n\nSitting in front of a laptop at the Charles A. Dana Health Education Center at Maine Medical Center , Down participated in of one of three ACA sign-up events held throughout Maine Tuesday. Down, who qualified for a federal subsidy to help him afford his premium, signed up for a plan that will cost him just shy of $25 a month.\n\n<p>""I don\'t want to go bankrupt if something bad or an accident did happen,"" he said of his choice to buy coverage.\n\nAs a young, healthy enrollee, Down represents a demographic crucial to the health reform law\'s success. The Affordable Care Act\'s overhaul of the insurance market for those who buy their own coverage relies on healthy Americans, who tend to be younger, signing up to help share the risk with older, sicker consumers and keep costs from skyrocketing.\n\nIn Maine , the oldest state in the nation, just 19 percent of enrollees through the end of February were aged 18-34, among the lowest showings in the country for young adult signups.\n\nNationally, young adults aren\'t signing up at the rate administration officials had expected, representing a quarter of all enrollments so far. The administration previously said 40 percent of enrollees should be young adults to offset the higher costs of their older counterparts.\n\nAlso called ""exchanges,"" the marketplaces are geared toward small businesses and individuals who buy their own health insurance rather than receive coverage through work or government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare .\n\nUnder the ACA, everyone must have health insurance this year or pay a penalty, with few exceptions. The penalty is at least $95 but potentially much more, depending on income. Those who fail to sign up by March 31 will have to wait until November for another chance to buy health insurance through the marketplaces.\n\n___\n\n(c)2014 the Bangor Daily News (Bangor, Maine)\n\nVisit the Bangor Daily News (Bangor, Maine) at www.bangordailynews.com\n\nDistributed by MCT Information Services', ""Maine , however, has emerged as a leader in health insurance enrollments compared to other states using Healthcare.gov.\nMultiple community and health groups partnered to spread awareness of the Affordable Care Act's health insurance options, she said.\nUnder the ACA, everyone must have health insurance this year or pay a penalty, with few exceptions.\nThose who fail to sign up by March 31 will have to wait until November for another chance to buy health insurance through the marketplaces.\n___(c)2014 the Bangor Daily News (Bangor, Maine)Visit the Bangor Daily News (Bangor, Maine) at www.bangordailynews.comDistributed by MCT Information Services""]"

8138,http://www.healthitoutcomes.com/doc/gop-questions-medicaid-enrollment-estimates-0001,health,"[""GOP Questions Medicaid Enrollment Estimates Source: Health IT Outcomes\n\nBy Christine Kern, contributing writer\n\nRepublicans say new analysis of Medicaid Enrollment may not be telling the whole truth\n\nNew research from Avalere Health estimates that between 2.4 million and 3.5 million Americans were newly enrolled in Medicaid from October through January as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAccording to Modern Healthcare, the Obama administration has said that 8.9 million individuals are eligible for Medicare or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) through state Medicaid agencies and state-run insurance exchanges, and an additional 1.2 million are Medicaid-eligible through HealthCare.gov.\n\nAccording to Avalere’s website, these enrollment estimates were developed by comparing reported data on new enrollments from October through January to enrollment rates from the summer of 2013. The estimates include both individuals who are newly eligible for Medicaid as a result of states’ expanding eligibility under the ACA and those who were previously eligible but newly enrolled due to greater awareness of coverage options (also known as the “woodwork” population). Avalere’s estimates remove individuals who would have been enrolled in Medicaid absent the ACA, including eligibility renewals in some states.\n\nAvalere's estimate includes Medicaid enrollment both through the federally run and state-run exchanges. Avalere compared the number of new Medicaid and CHIP applications from October through January to the average monthly number of applications submitted from July through September of 2013 as a control.\n\nAvalere’s study indicated that as of Jan. 31, between 1.7 million and 2.7 million people were newly enrolled in the states that have expanded Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, while 700,000 to 800,000 people were newly enrolled in the non-expansion states.\n\nThese numbers are being challenged by officials in the mostly Republican-led states relying on the federal HealthCare.gov insurance exchange to determine Medicaid eligibility, who argue the actual number of people who have successfully enrolled in their states may only be in the tens of thousands. Obamacare and the expansion of Medicare generally have been opposed by elected Republican officials in those states.\n\nModern Healthcare reports that Texas, for example, which has the highest percentage of uninsured in the country, has processed 6,703 Medicaid files for individuals received from the federal exchange, according to state Medicaid officials. However, of those, only 904 have been approved and enrolled for coverage. The rest were either already on Medicaid, not eligible, or didn't complete their applications. CMS says it has found 392,675 Texans to be eligible for Medicaid since the federal insurance exchange opened.\n\nOfficials in several Republican-led states relying on HealthCare.gov said they doubted enrollment figures in the non-expansion states were remotely close to the 1 million mark, including both new enrollees and people re-enrolling into the program through Healthcare.gov. State officials from Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Mississippi, and Wyoming told Modern Healthcare the number of Medicaid applications from HealthCare.gov actually processed was very low, either because they aren't receiving them yet or because they are in a testing phase during which the CMS is sending them Medicaid applications to check on the connection between the federal and state databases. They say the CMS has told them not to make eligibility determinations until the testing process is completed.\n\nIdaho, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Maine have all received far fewer completed applications than the number of those estimated to be eligible. Tom Shanahan, a spokesman for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, reported, “Idaho is not yet getting the enrollment numbers in Medicaid that were expected. We projected about 35,000 individuals to be eligible but not covered. As of today, the only new enrollments that can be counted are the 1,900 that have come from HealthCare.gov.”"", ""GOP Questions Medicaid Enrollment Estimates Source: Health IT OutcomesBy Christine Kern, contributing writerRepublicans say new analysis of Medicaid Enrollment may not be telling the whole truthNew research from Avalere Health estimates that between 2.4 million and 3.5 million Americans were newly enrolled in Medicaid from October through January as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nAccording to Avalere’s website, these enrollment estimates were developed by comparing reported data on new enrollments from October through January to enrollment rates from the summer of 2013.\nAvalere’s estimates remove individuals who would have been enrolled in Medicaid absent the ACA, including eligibility renewals in some states.\nAvalere's estimate includes Medicaid enrollment both through the federally run and state-run exchanges.\nTom Shanahan, a spokesman for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, reported, “Idaho is not yet getting the enrollment numbers in Medicaid that were expected.""]"

8143,http://idahobusinessreview.com/2014/03/10/health-care-reform-and-the-60-day-repayment-rule/,health,"['As most are aware, the federal government, primarily through its Medicare program that pays healthcare costs of America’s seniors, is the preeminent payer of healthcare in the United States. In addition, Medicaid, as administered by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, provides a limited safety net for Idaho’s poor. As such, Medicaid is also a major payer in the healthcare market.\n\nFor a healthcare provider to be reimbursed for providing Medicare or Medicaid services, the provider must make sure that it satisfies certain requirements. If the provider fails to meet these conditions of payment—even by mistake—the provider is not entitled to receive the reimbursement.\n\nOccasionally, after receiving a Medicare or Medicaid payment, a provider may discover that the claim or a series of claims that it submitted did not meet the applicable conditions of payment. Perhaps a required medical record or hospital admission order is missing. Or maybe a required signature was not on the record. When this happens, the provider is required to proactively return the payment, known as an overpayment. This repayment obligation applies even when the provider simply made a mistake. Now more than ever, Idaho’s healthcare providers are making repayments to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAs part of the healthcare reform in recent years, this repayment obligation has become more serious. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, added a provision requiring Medicare and Medicaid providers to report and return an overpayment within 60 days after the overpayment had been “identified.” The most sobering part of this 60-day requirement is that if the provider does not make the repayment by the 60-day deadline, the provider may become liable for significant penalties and damages under the False Claims Act and potentially risk exclusion from further participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Under the False Claims Act (FCA), a provider could be liable for a civil penalty of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, in addition to three times the amount of the damages sustained by the government as a result of the false claim. While we are not aware of any FCA cases in Idaho relating to the 60-day rule, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Idaho prosecutes FCA cases against Medicare and Medicaid providers.\n\nSince this 60-day rule was passed in 2010, providers have struggled to determine when an overpayment has been “identified.” In other words, when does the 60-day clock start ticking? While it is clear that the clock starts once the overpayment has been “identified,” the ACA unfortunately did not define or explain when the overpayment has been “identified.” Does the 60 days start from the moment the provider first learned of a potential overpayment by an anonymous tip, for example? Or does it start once the provider has conducted a thorough investigation to determine whether the potential overpayment is actually an overpayment? The statute does not answer these questions.\n\nIn February 2012, nearly two years after the 60-day rule was passed, the government finally provided some guidance about the rule. At that time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services responsible for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid, issued proposed regulations interpreting the rule.\n\nWhile CMS’s proposed regulations provided some direction to providers about when the 60-day clock started, they did not answer all of the questions. An additional problem is that these proposed regulations have yet to be finalized, more than two years after their publication. CMS’s delay in finalizing the regulations is likely due, at least in part, to the negative reaction they have received. For instance, one of the proposals that has been largely rejected by the healthcare industry is CMS’s plan to increase the look-back period (the period during which Medicare claims remain subject to reopening and adjustment) to ten years—a significant expansion over the reopening periods allowed by CMS’s current regulations. With this enlarged lookback period, a provider would be responsible for investigating and determining if a potential overpayment—even one that was the result of a simple mistake up to a decade ago—was an overpayment. Not surprisingly, this ten-year lookback period proposal received a disapproving response from the healthcare industry.\n\nAt this time, what is the status of the 60-day repayment rule? Even though CMS has yet to finalize any regulations regarding the rule, and even though it may not be clear in many cases when an overpayment has been “identified”—and when the 60-day clock starts ticking—providers still need to repay overpayments within the 60 days of when they are “identified” to avoid liability under the False Claims Act. Needless to say, with only 60 days to make the repayment once the clock starts, when providers become aware that they have, or may have, received an overpayment, they should move quickly and cautiously.\n\nMr. Olson is a partner at Hawley Troxell and a member of the firm’s health law group.

So nervous, he brought his mom.\n\nThe wariness that he may have faced during his first trip to Democrat Days was nowhere to be found this year, as attendees rushed to grab photos with the state’s now second-term attorney general and encouraging him as he readies to be the party’s standard-bearer in 2016. Here in Hannibal and elsewhere on the campaign trail, Koster does not shy from talking about his party switch. And when he brings it up, he gets cheers.\n\nSpeaking here on Saturday as the party’s presumptive nominee for governor in 2016, Koster said the same issues that brought him to Hannibal after leaving the Republican Party in 2007 are the issues that the state is facing, yet again, in 2014.\n\n“I quit my party over a disagreement over public health,” he told Democrats gathered for an annual brunch.\n\nKoster touted his support of the 2010 federal health care law, noting new access to contraceptive services for women and a provision barring insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Koster questioned why Republicans were against the policy, parts of which were first pitched by conservative groups in the 1990’s as an alternative to then-First Lady Hilary Clinton’s health care proposal.\n\n“The Affordable Care Act was a Republican idea, for goodness sake,” he said. “It’s an honest to god Republican idea, they’re just pissed we stole it.”\n\nKoster said perhaps his biggest frustration with his former party’s health care positioning now is its opposition to Medicaid expansion.\n\n“This expansion proposal is the best darn economic development proposal this state has seen in the last 25 years,” he said. “For no other reason than because Barack Obama passed it, this legislature is willing to deny the health and economic benefits of expansion simply to spite a president.”\n\nKoster noted support from the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and former U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, a Republican who was a vocal opponent of the 2010 health care law, which was passed during his final year in the Senate. Koster said the potential economic benefits of Medicaid expansion are undeniable.\n\n“The bill has been passed. Sen. Bond is walking the halls trying to convince Democrats and Republicans to accept $2 billion,” he said in an interview. “If you had $2 billion dollars sitting on your front door, wouldn’t you take it?”\n\nOne reason Republicans offer is broad public opposition in Missouri and elsewhere to the federal health care law. When different provisions of the law have been on the ballot, Missourians have overwhelmingly opposed them. Still, Koster said he believes Medicaid expansion is different.\n\n“The Affordable Care Act is unpopular, but the $2 billion federal offer and the expansion of economic opportunity that is being offered to us doesn’t strike me as unpopular,” he said. “Increasingly when I talk with members of the General Assembly, including Republicans, they are looking for a way out of this.”\n\nKoster’s vocal support of the federal health care law stands in contrast to his only announced Republican opponent, former House Speaker Catherine Hanaway, who has voiced opposition to the law in full, including the Medicaid expansion provision.\n\n“I am against any further expansion of Obamacare. Therefore, I am against Gov. Nixon’s proposed expansion of Medicaid,” she said earlier this month. “I lived through the expansions of Medicaid that Gov. Carnahan put on the books and the strife required to shrink back those expansions when the state could no longer afford them.”\n\nHanaway said she, like Republicans in the General Assembly, believes it would be “ill-advised for Missouri” to accept the federal funds when they will be rolled back in 2020, requiring the state to take on a 10 percent share of the burden.\n\nKoster was the keynote speaker at the morning brunch in Hannibal. Secretary of State Jason Kander was scheduled to speak Saturday evening to the annual dinner.', '– Chris Koster came to Hannibal for the annual Democrat Days gathering seven years ago this weekend as a first-time Democrat.\nHere in Hannibal and elsewhere on the campaign trail, Koster does not shy from talking about his party switch.\n“It’s an honest to god Republican idea, they’re just pissed we stole it.”Koster said perhaps his biggest frustration with his former party’s health care positioning now is its opposition to Medicaid expansion.\nKoster said the potential economic benefits of Medicaid expansion are undeniable.\nStill, Koster said he believes Medicaid expansion is different.']"

This followed claims by science colleagues that the erroneous image data was used for the article published in the journal Nature.\n\n“I have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some confirmation,” Wakayama told NHK. “To check the legitimacy of the paper, we should retract it, prepare proper data and images, and then use those to demonstrate, with confidence, that the paper is correct.”\n\n""When conducting the experiment, I believed it was absolutely right,"" Wakayama said, adding that if it turns out to be wrong, it would be essential to make it clear why a thing like that could have happened.\n\nThe leader of the research team, Japanese researcher Haruko Obokata together with US scientists announced a breakthrough in January: a cheap way to produce valuable embryonic-like stem cells without having to terminate any embryos. The study promised to usher in a new era in stem cell biology, as the prominence of stem cell use grew with the realization of just how much we could accomplish in the way of battling a huge variety of diseases. This is because of the cells’ ability to mimic other cells in the body.\n\nWhat Obokata from the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology in Japan and researchers from the Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) allegedly found at the time was that an adult cell (also known as a “somatic” cell) had the potential to transform into a copy of an embryonic stem cell as a result of a simple process. The scientists subjected cells to external stress, ""almost to the point of death”, by exposing them to various hostile environments, for instance, acid or low oxygen. Within a few days the cells (called Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency, or STAP, cells) survived and recovered from the stressful stimulus by naturally reverting into a state that is equivalent to an embryonic stem cell, the researchers said.\n\nWithin weeks of its publication on January 29, the study faced criticism of irregularities in visual data and allegedly duplicated imagery. Added to that was the problem some scientists were having trouble reproducing the ‘simple’ technique promised by researchers doing the study.\n\nWakayama was in charge of the part of the experiment that checked if the cells had acquired pluripotency – the ability to shift properties to those resembling an embryo cell. He said a change in a specific gene was to be proof. He pointed out that after RIKEN disclosed detailed procedures for making STAP cells, in the newly released procedures RIKEN says this change didn\'t take place, NHK reported.\n\nRIKEN said it has launched an independent investigation in the content of the paper. Nature has responded promptly with its own probe. In an e-mailed statement, the journal said: ""Issues relating to this paper have been brought to Nature\'s attention and we are conducting an ongoing investigation. We have no further comment at this stage.""\n\nBut not all believe that mistakes were made; among them is Hitoshi Niwa, who also contributed to the article in Nature sees the hiccups with the picture data as only “minor mistakes,” according to Japanese media. Joining him is Charles Vanati, a tissue engineer with Harvard Medical School and BWH, who told The Wall Street Journal that “based on the information I have, I see no reason why these papers should be retracted… it would be very sad to have such an important paper retracted as a result of peer pressure, when indeed the data and conclusions are honest and valid.”', 'This followed claims by science colleagues that the erroneous image data was used for the article published in the journal Nature.\nThe leader of the research team, Japanese researcher Haruko Obokata together with US scientists announced a breakthrough in January: a cheap way to produce valuable embryonic-like stem cells without having to terminate any embryos.\nThe study promised to usher in a new era in stem cell biology, as the prominence of stem cell use grew with the realization of just how much we could accomplish in the way of battling a huge variety of diseases.\nWithin weeks of its publication on January 29, the study faced criticism of irregularities in visual data and allegedly duplicated imagery.\nAdded to that was the problem some scientists were having trouble reproducing the ‘simple’ technique promised by researchers doing the study.']"

The new technique could be a quicker and easier source of stem cells than methods now in use, the authors said.\n\nBut Monday, Teruhiko Wakayama, a professor of developmental engineering at the University of Yamanashi and one of the study’s co-authors, told NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, that a series of concerns raised in recent weeks by researchers around the world had shaken his belief in the study’s findings.\n\n“There are too many overall issues that I am not sure about. I am increasingly uncertain,” Wakayama told NHK.\n\nThe new technique was developed by researchers at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, and at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Haruko Obokata, the 30-year-old lead writer of the study’s two papers and a rising star in Japan’s scientific community, has become an overnight celebrity here and a symbol of the rising stature of female scientists.\n\nStill, some experts quickly expressed caution, saying more needed to be known about the new approach.\n\nCaution turned to skepticism as researchers reported trouble in replicating the study’s results.\n\nSome of the photos used in the study were then called into question, as was wording that was found to be similar to that in an article published by different researchers almost a decade ago.\n\nThose questions prompted both Riken and Nature to begin separate investigations into the study’s integrity last month.\n\nWakayama said that the numerous questions raised left the authors with little choice but to retract the paper.\n\n—Hiroko Tabuchi, The New York Times\n\nAdam Lanza’s father says ‘you can’t get any more evil’\n\nPeter Lanza had not seen his son Adam for two years before the day Adam walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and killed 20 schoolchildren and six adults.\n\nSince that morning, Lanza cannot go an hour without thinking about his child. And now, he says, he wishes his son had never been born.\n\n“You can’t get any more evil,” he said in his first public comments since the shooting. “How much do I beat up on myself about the fact that he’s my son? A lot.”\n\nIn a series of emotionally wrenching interviews with the writer Andrew Solomon, Lanza detailed his son’s medical history and increasing isolation, his ex-wife’s struggle to deal with their troubled child, and his own role as the father of the person who committed one of the worst mass shootings in the nation’s history.\n\nSolomon, the author of the book “Far From the Tree: Parents, Children and the Search for Identity,” recounts the interviews in an article in this week’s issue of The New Yorker magazine.\n\nAdam Lanza, 20, shot his mother, Nancy, before going on his shooting rampage at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, 2012, and then shot himself just as the police were arriving at the elementary school.\n\nPeter Lanza’s account confirms the basic portrait that emerged from the investigation, and adds new details as well as a deeper understanding of how he and Adam’s mother struggled to understand and care for their son. Lanza described Adam’s behavior as a child as “weird” but never dangerous. He said that the first official diagnosis they received concerning Adam’s mental health came when he was 13.\n\nThe diagnosis was Asperger’s syndrome, a category that the American Psychiatric Association has since subsumed into the broader diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder.

The report is based partly on conclusions drawn from data that has been issued by other organizations, including the United Nations and the World Health Organization, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, Doctors Without Borders, and other medical research, as well as from the Syrian government.\n\nBut the report also draws on Save the Children’s own research, including interviews with Syrian children, parents and medical providers who painted what amounted to a portrait of medieval health conditions.\n\n—Rick Gladstone, The New York Times', 'The new technique could be a quicker and easier source of stem cells than methods now in use, the authors said.\nThose questions prompted both Riken and Nature to begin separate investigations into the study’s integrity last month.\nHe said that the first official diagnosis they received concerning Adam’s mental health came when he was 13.\nPeter Lanza said that the diagnosis might have kept them from realizing the danger their son posed.\nBut the report also draws on Save the Children’s own research, including interviews with Syrian children, parents and medical providers who painted what amounted to a portrait of medieval health conditions.']"

It was an effort to clarify a situation that has been increasingly murky, because of doubts raised about whether the work was repeatable. Even Wakayama told Nature News that although he was able to do the procedure successfully once, with help from the lead author, Haruko Obokata, he has not since been able to repeat the experiment on his own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the protocol itself raised many questions. Paul Knoepfler, a stem cell scientist at the University of California, Davis, whose blog has become a resource for information about the technique, described what appeared to be contradictions and red flags.\n\nWakayama told NHK World that his review of data brought to meetings revealed many serious problems, including some with images. The news agency reported that he has asked the entire team to retract the papers and then have the work reviewed by outside scientists.\n\nWakayama did not respond immediately to an e-mail, but Dr. Charles Vacanti of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the senior author of the paper describing the technique for creating stem cells, said he only learned about Wakayama’s request Monday morning, through news reports.\n\n“I’ve not communicated with him yet. This is the first I’ve heard of it. I have zero information,” Vacanti said. He said that he still stands behind the papers, and that so far the problems with the papers have been errors that do nothing to endanger the overall result.\n\n“I think there were some simple, perhaps sloppy mistakes that I thought were honest mistakes,” Vacanti said. “I don’t have any information that would make me change my opinion of what I said before.”\n\nAn investigation into the papers has been ongoing at the RIKEN Institute, where Obokata, the lead author of both of the papers, works.

Numerous scientists also had difficulty reproducing the supposedly simple method. The team responded with the promise of corrections and a list of tips to help other scientists to reproduce the results.\n\nOver the weekend, however, two more serious problems surfaced. The Nature paper was found to contain two images apparently duplicated from Obokata’s doctoral dissertation. Her thesis also reported experiments dealing with cells that were supposedly in an embryonic state, but the cells reported in the Nature paper were said to be derived from a different process in an altogether different experiment.\n\nThe revelation has led to a flurry of calls — including some from senior scientists in Japan — for the paper to be retracted.\n\nPerhaps the most damning comes from Teruhiko Wakayama, a cloning expert at Yamanashi University and a corresponding author on one of the papers. Interviewed by NHK news, Wakayama said: “I have lost faith in the paper. Overall there are now just too many uncertainties about it. I think we have to wait for some confirmation.” Wakayama calls for an investigation of all the laboratory notebooks and data. He continues: “To check the legitimacy of the paper, we should retract it, prepare proper data and images, and then use those to demonstrate, with confidence, that the paper is correct.” Wakayama reportedly contacted all of the authors requesting that they agree to retract the paper.

They described how they came to this conclusion in a paper published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.\n\nAnd then, a year later, another UK study published in BMJ Open looked at the effects drinking during pregnancy might have on fetal development and concluded that moderate alcohol consumption in pregnancy was safe.\n\nMeanwhile, American women are advised by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that there is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy, and that women who are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant should refrain from drinking alcohol.\n\nThis is also the view of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, which recommend universal screening for alcohol consumption for all pregnant women and women of childbearing age.\n\nThe UK\'s Department of Health advice is less strict. They recommend women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should not drink alcohol at all, but if they choose to drink, then they should limit their consumption to one or two units, once or twice a week. That is no more than a pint of beer, or a medium glass of wine, twice a week.\n\nDrinking over two units a week ups chances of bearing preterm or small babies\n\nFor this latest study, the Leeds researchers examined data on 1,264 pregnant women in Leeds aged between 18 and 25 who were assessed to be at low risk for birth complications.\n\nAll the women were enrolled in the Caffeine and Reproductive Health (CARE) Study, and had filled in food frequency questionnaires that asked them to specify how often they drank alcohol and of what type, 4 weeks before conception and during each trimester throughout their pregnancy.\n\nWhen their babies were born, 13% were underweight and 4.4% were smaller than would be expected, while a similar percentage (4.3%) were preterm.\n\nEven after taking into account other possible influencers, when they analyzed the alcohol data against the birth outcomes, the researchers found women who drank more than two units of alcohol per week were twice as likely to give birth to a premature or unexpectedly small baby than women who did not drink alcohol at all.\n\nBut the analysis showed that even women who did not drink more than the maximum recommended alcohol intake during this period were still at increased risk of giving birth prematurely.\n\nPlus, drinking during the period leading up to conception was also associated with a risk of restricted fetal growth, suggesting this may also be a critical time, note the authors.\n\nDuring pregnancy, average intake was 11 units a week in first trimester\n\nThe data showed that on average, the women drank the most alcohol before conception and in the first trimester. During pregnancy, the average intake was 11 units a week in the first, four in the second, and just under two in the last trimester.\n\nMore than half (53%) of the moms-to-be drank more than two units a week in the first trimester, and nearly 40% said they drank more than 10 units a week in the weeks leading up to conception.\n\nThe study also found expectant mothers who were the most likely to drink more than the recommended limit of two units a week tended to be older, white, better educated and living in more affluent areas.\n\nSenior author Janet Cade, a professor in Leeds\' School of Science and Food Nutrition, says:\n\n""Since pregnancy is such a special time for women it would be sensible for anyone who is thinking about getting pregnant to avoid alcohol during that time.""', 'A new study suggests light alcohol consumption during the first trimester is linked to a higher risk of bearing a preterm or unexpectedly small baby, even if expectant mothers keep within the government-recommended limit of two units a week.\nThe new finding adds to a debate, fueled by mixed evidence, that has been going on for some time about light alcohol consumption in pregnancy.\nThe authors note that when pregnant women drink alcohol, it crosses the placenta and results in nearly equal cocentrations in both the fetus and the mother.\nHowever, while the effects of heavy drinking in pregnancy are well established, the effect of light drinking is not, and different studies have come to different conclusions about it, as have different health authorities.\nThis is also the view of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, which recommend universal screening for alcohol consumption for all pregnant women and women of childbearing age.']"

However, according to a new study conducted in the UK, researches reported that drinking alcohol anytime before or after conception increases one\'s risk of giving birth preterm.\n\nFor this study, the researchers interviewed 1,264 female participants. They gathered information on the participants\' drinking patterns before and after conception. They calculated that 53 percent of the women had consumed more than the recommended weekly amount of alcohol within the first trimester. Almost 40 percent of the women reported drinking more than 10 units per week before conception.\n\nThe researchers discovered that around 13 percent of the babies born to the study\'s participants were underweight. 4.4 percent of them were smaller than normal and 4.3 percent had been born preterm. The team estimated that women who drank more than two units within the first three months of pregnancy were two times more likely to give birth prematurely and to have a smaller than normal sized infant. The researchers also found that women who drank alcohol in general, even if the amount was below the limit of two units, were still more likely to have a premature or smaller infant than women who did not drink at all. The researcher reported the same relationship for women who drank more alcohol before conception.\n\n""This is a very sensitive issue, we don\'t want women who are pregnant now to panic, the individual risk is actually low,"" Camilla Nykjaer, one of the researchers at the University of Leeds, told the BBC News. ""They shouldn\'t drink, they should stop drinking if they have been drinking during the pregnancy.""\n\nThe researchers noted that the women who were more likely to drink over the recommended amounts of alcohol tended to be white, older and more educated.

Slightly more than half reported downing more than the two-drink maximum recommended by scientists, with four in 10 reporting consumption of 10 or more alcoholic drinks per week in the leadup to conception.\n\nOverall, alcohol consumption fell after the first trimester, as women grew into their pregnancies. Women in the study began their first trimesters drinking 11 standard units of alcohol per week, which fell to four drinks and then just under two during the second and third trimesters, respectively.\n\nNot surprisingly, older educated white women with higher socioeconomic status drank the most, supporting previous study showing a greater propensity for drink among the more affluent. Of babies born to the women in the study, 13 percent were underweight while 4.4 percent were a bit on the small side. Four-point-three percent were born prematurely. All of those adverse outcomes were strongly linked to alcohol consumption among the pregnant mothers.\n\nConversely, Yvonne and her colleagues found no behavioral or cognitive problems among 5-year-olds born to mothers in the cohort study, but did find a higher incidence among even mothers who’d drank lightly, adhering to the government’s two-drink per week maximum. Early in pregnancy, even small doses of alcohol increase the risk for premature birth and other complications.

As little as sixteen years, cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease.\n\nThis report was brought by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in which it reads the number of new cancer cases is expected to increase nearly 45% by 2030. That is a jump from 1.6 million cases to 2.6 cases annually. This expected influx of new patients will place a bigger burden upon a field of medicine already stretched thin by physician shortages and financial difficulties. Because of this bleak, and expected, outlook on cancer cases, the group is calling on the U.S. Congress to help stabilize payments to doctors under the Medicare insurance program for the elderly.\n\nBlase Polite, an oncologist at the University of Chicago, had this statement to Reuters, as reported by MSN, on the increase of cancer cases:\n\nWhat you are seeing from Medicare as well as others is they continue to constrain the revenues to practices. At the same time, the number of patients everyone is seeing is going up as the population increases. Combine that with the cost of the care that we’re providing… It’s really creating a very difficult financial situation.\n\nIn another report by CNN, numerous doctors, especially oncologists, are constantly merging so they can connect with a national network of community doctors which enables them to invest in new technologies and receive group discounts on cancer drugs. In return, the group pays a percentage of their practice’s profit to the network. Unfortunately for them, profit margins are becoming slimmer as competition against hospitals, especially in radiation therapy and other services that would diversify their practice, rises. Insurers would attain advantage in contract negotiations. Because of the imbalance, partially for the favor of hospitals, many community practices are disappearing as their members join large hospitals.\n\nUnfortunately for the patient, less community practices means a smaller range for healthcare. They’ll have to travel further, and pay more, if they want their care to be of a higher quality. The president of American Society of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Clifford Hudis simply stated the following:\n\nIf you can’t get care, you can’t get good care.\n\nRight now, Congress is weighing changes to the physician payment system that calls for sharp cuts in reimbursement to doctors. The system has not been put into place because lawmakers override the legislation each year. By the end of March, Congress must either repeal the formula or provide a temporary patch. One proposal would replace the formula with a 0.5% annual increase through 2018, followed by a two-track system with either a 0.5% or a 1% rise depending on what system the provider uses. This measure is estimated to increase federal spending by about $138 billion between 2014 and 2024.\n\nStill, a real solution has not been given to oncologist about the dire situation. Ergo, oncologists have taken the problem into their own hands and created CancerLinQ, an electronic health system that will collect and analyze data from millions of patients than provide feedback in terms of standards of care and practices. Its goal is to prevent mistakes before they happen.\n\nEven with the progressive steps oncologists are taking, especially with CancerLinQ, they still stress the importance of lifestyle changes as the primary method of prevention. Simple steps, such as quitting tobacco and controlling obesity (which was reported to be linked to ovarian cancer here on The Inquisitr), reduce cancer causes, which also includes recurrence.\n\n[Image via Wikipedia Commons]', 'U.S. doctors are concerned their abilities to handle an expected surge in cancer cases in the coming years as they face cuts to government health plans which includes reduced payments to physicians, will not be enough.\nAs little as sixteen years, cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease.\nThis report was brought by the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in which it reads the number of new cancer cases is expected to increase nearly 45% by 2030.\nBecause of this bleak, and expected, outlook on cancer cases, the group is calling on the U.S. Congress to help stabilize payments to doctors under the Medicare insurance program for the elderly.\nSimple steps, such as quitting tobacco and controlling obesity (which was reported to be linked to ovarian cancer here on The Inquisitr), reduce cancer causes, which also includes recurrence.']"

One in every fourth deaths in the U.S. is a result of heart disease, but medical experts believe that will soon change.\n\nSixteen years from now in 2030, the American Society of Clinical Oncology reports that cancer will become the leading cause of death in the United States. Although cancer research has been extensive in recent decades, there are still physician shortages and financial difficulties that the medical field is dealing with.\n\nOngoing research can only do so much, and the prediction of a 45% increase in cancer diagnoses by 2030 is not going to help.

That means 450,000 new cancer patients could face major obstacles in access to quality cancer care, ASCO president Clifford Hudis, MD, said during the webcast.\n\nAdditional pressure comes from the changing demographics of the U.S. population, not only in terms of patients, but the oncology field. Almost 20% of practicing oncologists are 65 or older, and since 2008, the proportion of oncologists older than 64 has exceeded the proportion younger than 40.\n\nThe squeeze created by demand that outstrips workforce growth will have the greatest impact on cancer patients in rural areas. About 20% of the U.S. population lives in rural areas, whereas 3% of oncologists practice in areas that would be characterized as rural.\n\n""There\'s a big difference between a 5- or 10-minute car ride across a small town versus a 2-hour drive one way to the big city,"" Hudis, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said during the webcast.\n\nThe ASCO review showed that 70% of U.S. counties analyzed did not have even one oncologist.\n\nThe squeeze extends beyond the rural oncology setting and into community practices, he continued. A third of all new cancer patients receive care from community-based oncologists. Yet, almost two-thirds of community oncology practices are likely to merge, sell, or close within the next year.\n\nCarolyn Hendricks, MD, an oncologist in solo practice in Bethesda, Md., offers an example of the hard choices that community oncologists have to make. Reimbursement for office-based administration of oncology drugs has decreased, but the cost of purchasing the drugs has increased dramatically with the introduction of novel therapies.\n\nAdditionally, community oncology practices must maintain the same quality standards (including trained personnel) as those applied to hospital outpatient clinics, which receive higher payments for drug administration.\n\n""Over the past 2 years, my practice has lost a significant amount of revenue,"" Hendricks said during the webcast. ""Community oncologists purchase drugs on credit, essentially a giant credit card, and then we scramble to get reimbursed.\n\n""As a result, I now have a significant amount of debt, and I have had a significant reduction in my own income. My income now approximates what I made 10 years ago. Of course, I retain my staff\'s salaries because I love my staff and want to keep them.""\n\nHendricks is now weighing her options, following the breakdown of talks to sell her practice to a hospital, which backed out because of uncertainty about the economics of community-based oncology practice. Merger and closure are the only remaining options, both of which would adversely affect her patients, she added.\n\nA final pressure on oncology care comes from the rising cost. The ASCO review suggests that the nation\'s annual cost for oncology care will reach almost $175 billion by 2020. By comparison, the total cost of oncology care was $104 billion in 2006.\n\nAdding to the financial strain has been a National Cancer Institute budget that has lost 23% of its effective purchasing power since 2003, said Hudis.\n\nThe actions of the federal government figure prominently in the future of oncology care. The congressionally mandated budget cuts that went into effect in 2013, implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and the contentious sustainable growth rate offer just a few examples of far-reaching effects of governmental actions related to oncology care.\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee health subcommittee, acknowledged that partisan politics often has interfered with meaningful action to resolve the obstacles to access to quality cancer care. He also acknowledged that cancer care is not necessarily the top priority for many members of the House or Senate.\n\nUsing a baseball analogy, Blumenauer emphasized the need for small advances before taking a big step toward improving cancer care.\n\n""Even if it\'s not a grand-slam home run, I\'m of the philosophy that you can\'t have a grand-slam home run unless you have someone on base,"" he said. ""So let\'s hit a single or a double. Let\'s move forward with something that can make a profound difference in how we deliver healthcare.""\n\n""We\'ve made healthcare far too contentious, partisan, ideological, and shouting-head media something,"" he added. ""It doesn\'t have to be that way, shouldn\'t be that way. So much of what will make a profound difference in our ability to deliver the quality healthcare we want, at a price that\'s affordable, in a way that\'s accessible, actually isn\'t that hard. It doesn\'t have to be red state-blue state, Republican-Democrat.""\n\nThe ASCO report ""The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014"" is available on the organization\'s website.\n\n2014-03-11T18:59:14-0400', ""The nation's ability to provide quality cancer care heads toward a conflicted future of increasing demand, rising costs, and a contracting, if not dwindling workforce.\nThat means 450,000 new cancer patients could face major obstacles in access to quality cancer care, ASCO president Clifford Hudis, MD, said during the webcast.\nThe squeeze created by demand that outstrips workforce growth will have the greatest impact on cancer patients in rural areas.\nHe also acknowledged that cancer care is not necessarily the top priority for many members of the House or Senate.\nUsing a baseball analogy, Blumenauer emphasized the need for small advances before taking a big step toward improving cancer care.""]"

8265,http://www.medicaldaily.com/future-threats-quality-cancer-care-include-too-many-survivors-and-doctor-shortage-271023,health,"['The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released a new report on Tuesday that describes a “perfect storm” of future challenges, which could easily undermine access to the many life-saving advances in cancer care. Among these impending challenges are soaring costs, a physician shortage, a fast growing population of survivors, and threats to smaller practices. “We think we owe it to the 1.6 million Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer this year to address these problems,” said Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, ASCO president, in a live webcast.\n\nCancer Care 2014... and Beyond\n\n""The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014"" is a first-ever comprehensive report on the difficulties facing the U.S. cancer care delivery system. Nearly 35,000 oncologists and other professionals are represented by ASCO and their many opinions inform the new report. Months in the making, the report examines both current and projected demand for services and compares this to oncologist workforce supply while also including scrutiny of the full range of economic, regulatory, and administrative pressures that oncology practices face.\n\nKey findings include a swift growth in demand for prevention, screening, and treatment services. By 2030, the number of new cancer cases will increase by 45 percent. “At the same time, the number of cancer survivors, now at 13.7 million, will continue to grow,” the report states. Because survivors require ongoing care, the demand for oncology, other cancer treatment services, as well as end-of-life care will naturally increase. “It’s hard for me to think that any other issue that will have a bigger impact on American families than this,” Representative Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) noted in the webcast. He added, “This condition extends onto family and friends and if we don’t do it right, the impact on the caregiver, the impact on the family … can be extraordinarily stressful.”\n\nAdditionally, the report speaks to uneven access to cancer care across the nation. “Rates of access to care are disproportionately lower for African Americans and Latinos,” is stated in the report. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) may provide millions more with health insurance coverage and though this helps, ASCO believes it will not solve disparities in cancer care due to the fact that it emphasizes expanding Medicaid coverage. (In the past, Medicaid has been associated with poor outcomes for patients with cancer.) Other difficulties with regard to access to care may soon arise due to a doctor shortage.\n\nDisconnect between Patients and Doctors\n\n“As of 2012, there were 13,400 oncologists practicing in the U.S.,” said Dr. Carolyn Hendricks, who runs a private oncologist practice in Bethesda, Md. However, Hendricks noted, there are more oncologists who are over 64 and approaching retirement than oncologists under 40 and so the data predicts a shortage of physicians: by ASCO estimates, a deficit of almost 1,500 doctors in the coming years. Add to that a natural and uneven distribution. According to Hendricks, one in five Americans live in areas designated as rural, while only one in 33 oncologists practice in rural areas. This “disconnect” between patients and doctors will matter more in the coming years, especially as smaller oncology practices (under seven oncologists) are becoming more rare. Though they serve more than a third of new patients, nearly two-thirds of small community practices may merge, sell, or close in just the next year alone. With chemo costs based on quantity, Hendricks explained, “We [smaller practices] pay more for the same drugs as bigger practices.”\n\nAnd though costs are increasing throughout the healthcare system, this trend is most pronounced within cancer care, where annual costs are projected to rise to more than $173 billion in 2020 — a whopping 40 percent increase between the years 2010 and 2020. “Access to high-quality cancer care will be sustained and expanded only if we address these rising costs, including the use of unnecessary or ineffective tests and treatments,” noted the report.\n\nDespite the glum news, ASCO has developed several initiatives to ease the way into the future. Dr. Blase Polite, University of Chicago Medicine, discussed measures to help waylay costs while addressing distribution of doctors and focused particularly on the expansion of health IT. The Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) and Cancer LINQ help oncologists access standards of care and data no matter where their practice is located. As Polite explained, currently, oncologists “collect information from patients on a daily basis but it sits in our own silos.” The Cancer LINQ, an advance IT system, brings all the data together so when a doctor in a rural practice confronts some rarely seen cancer, he or she will be able to get information from practices across the country.\n\nOther recommendations by ASCO include support for SGR Repeal and Medicare Provider Payment Modernization Act 2014, which modifies payment structures, and the establishment of national standards to measure value in oncology care. Consistent, high-quality cancer care will only be achieved if Medicare and private insurers work with physicians to introduce new payment models. “We want to develop the solutions,” Hudis said, referring directly to ASCO\'s report. “We want to be solving the problem of delivering quality care across the country to the people who need it.”\n\nSource: The State of Cancer Care in America: 2014.

A few years later the group merged with another practice, and connected with a national network of community doctors that enabled them to invest in new technologies and receive group discounts on cancer drugs.\n\nIn return, they paid a percentage of their practice\'s profit to the network.\n\nOver time, the doctors\' profit margins became slimmer. They couldn\'t compete with hospitals in the area for radiation therapy and other services that would have diversified their practice, and insurers had the upper hand in contract negotiations.\n\nIt became obvious, as Ward said, ""that 0% of zero would be zero."" So Ward and his colleagues decided to leave the community oncology network and join a large hospital system in Seattle.\n\nWard\'s story illustrates a growing problem for cancer care in the United States, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s inaugural report, ""The State of Cancer Care in America,"" which was released Tuesday.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the small oncology practices surveyed said they were likely to merge, sell or close in the upcoming year. And as community practices disappear, patients are paying more and traveling farther for quality care, an issue compounded by physician shortages and a rapidly aging population.\n\n""If you can\'t get care, you can\'t get good care,"" said American Society of Clinical Oncology President Dr. Clifford Hudis, chief of Breast Cancer Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College.\n\nIn 16 years, cancer is expected to become the leading cause of death in the United States, surpassing heart disease, according to the society\'s report. The number of new cases is expected to increase nearly 45% by 2030, from 1.6 million cases to 2.3 million cases annually.\n\nThe number of cancer survivors will also increase dramatically. Fifty years ago, only a handful of ""minimally effective"" treatments for cancer existed, according to the report. Today, there are more than 170 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans now live at least five years after a cancer diagnosis, up from about half in the 1970s, the report authors write. Survivors need ongoing care, as they\'re at higher risk for other types of cancer and conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will also increase the need for oncologists, as millions of Americans get newly covered by health insurance.\n\nTaking these future patients into consideration, the oncology society expects demand for oncology services to grow 42% by 2030. Yet the number of oncologists is expected to grow only 28%, leading to a shortage of more than 1,400 physicians.\n\nA large part of this is because of the aging physician population, according to the report. In 2008, the proportion of oncologists older than 64 surpassed the proportion younger than 40 for the first time. A large number of communities in central and Midwestern states are covered solely by these older doctors. When they retire, more patients will have to travel farther to find care.\n\n""The shortage of oncologists is a real problem,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""Many smaller practices actually provide a lot of uncompensated care to those who do not have insurance or have insurance that does not pay well.""\n\nThe report also highlights the need to lower costs, for both doctors and patients. Right now, the system is designed to compensate doctors for how much they do, rather than how well they do it. That goes against the oncology society\'s recommendations, which encourage physicians to avoid performing unnecessary tests and treatments.\n\n""One of the reasons that so many patients are harmed in medicine is they are over-treated,"" Brawley said.\n\nDrug prices are another big concern. When Ward started practicing, the average cancer drug cost $1,000 per month. Today, he said, the average is $10,000 per month.\n\n""If we don\'t begin to control these prices in one way or another, in 20 more years, the average cost of a cancer drug will be $100,000. That\'s not sustainable,"" he said. ""Twenty percent copay on $10,000 (per month) is not in the pocketbook for most of my patients.""\n\nBrawley said price is one of the biggest reasons there is such a disparity in cancer outcomes; research shows minorities are more likely to develop cancer and more likely to die from cancer.\n\nTo combat some of the issues raised in the report and improve patient care, the society is working on several projects involving ""big data."" These projects will help physicians ""distill massive volumes of data into meaningful information,"" according to the report authors.\n\nShoppers have Amazon. Students have Google.

Its goal, Hudis said, is to prevent mistakes before they happen.\n\n""I\'d rather have a doctor who avoids mistakes than one who learns from them,"" he said.\n\nThe oncology society said it expects to roll out some components of the system in early 2015.\n\nPosted by Greg Palmer', 'Ward\'s story illustrates a growing problem for cancer care in the United States, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology\'s inaugural report, ""The State of Cancer Care in America,"" which was released Tuesday.\nNearly two-thirds of the small oncology practices surveyed said they were likely to merge, sell or close in the upcoming year.\nTaking these future patients into consideration, the oncology society expects demand for oncology services to grow 42% by 2030.\n""The shortage of oncologists is a real problem,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.\nThe oncology society said it expects to roll out some components of the system in early 2015.']"

The emails, obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, show that the campaign to reassure the public about America’s nuclear industry came as the NRC’s own experts were questioning U.S. safety standards and scrambling to determine whether new rules were needed to ensure that the meltdowns occurring in Japan couldn’t occur here.

The finding adds ovarian cancer, the deadliest of the gynecological malignancies, to a growing list of diseases linked to carrying far too much weight.\n\nResearch has found obesity to contribute to a person’s risk for a wide range of illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancers of the breast, colon, pancreas and esophagus.\n\nIn the case of ovarian cancer, which affects 8 in 100,000 women in the United States, the role of obesity is small: about 5% of U.S. cases of this deadly cancer might be attributable, at least in part, to a woman’s obesity, concluded the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund, which released a report on ovarian cancer Tuesday.\n\nIf American women maintained a healthy weight - with body mass index lower than 30 - the report calculates that 1,112 cases of ovarian cancer might be prevented each year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report also concludes that a woman’s tall stature puts her at higher risk of ovarian cancer. But it notes that tallness itself does not appear to confer that greater risk; rather, some of the factors that result in tallness may also contribute to tumor establishment and growth, the experts suggested. Taller people have been found to be at greater risk for a wide range of other cancers as well.\n\nOvarian cancer typically progresses with no recognizable symptoms, and as a result is often diagnosed in advanced stages, when it is harder to treat. Ovarian cancer claims the lives of about 14,000 women in the United States annually, a number that has scarcely budged in 40 years.\n\nIt is far more common in post-menopausal women - almost 70% of those diagnosed with ovarian cancer are older than 54. But the new study found that obese pre-menopausal women have a more elevated risk of ovarian cancer (compared with non-obese pre-menopausal women) than do obese post-menopausal women (compared with their non-obese peers).\n\nThe cancer specialists who drafted the report cited mounting evidence that obesity-induced disturbances both of the metabolism and of sex hormones probably explain the link between obesity and ovarian cancer. High levels of the hunger hormone leptin, and of circulating insulin - both more common in the obese - spur an increase in growth factors that promote tumors. And accumulated fat can be a powerful producer of estrogen, which can fuel some cancer growth.', 'Obesity is probably a factor in some of the almost 22,000 new diagnoses of ovarian cancer that will be handed out this year to American women, a new study says.\nThe finding adds ovarian cancer, the deadliest of the gynecological malignancies, to a growing list of diseases linked to carrying far too much weight.\nAdvertisementThe report also concludes that a woman’s tall stature puts her at higher risk of ovarian cancer.\nOvarian cancer typically progresses with no recognizable symptoms, and as a result is often diagnosed in advanced stages, when it is harder to treat.\nAnd accumulated fat can be a powerful producer of estrogen, which can fuel some cancer growth.']"

During the past several decades, the percentage of overweight and obese adults and children has increased markedly.\n\nObesity is associated with increased risks of cancers of the esophagus, breast (postmenopausal), endometrium (the lining of the uterus), colon and rectum, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, gallbladder, and possibly other cancer types.\n\nObese people are also at higher risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a number of other chronic diseases. 1. What is obesity? Obesity is a condition in which a person has an abnormally high and unhealthy proportion of body fat. To measure obesity, researchers commonly use a scale known as the body mass index (BMI). BMI is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by their height (in meters) squared. BMI provides a more accurate measure of obesity or being overweight than weight alone. Guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) place adults age 20 and older into the following categories based on their BMI: BMI BMI Categories Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5 to 24.9 Normal 25.0 to 29.9 Overweight 30.0 and above Obese The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute provides a BMI calculator. For children and adolescents (less than 20 years of age), overweight and obesity are based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) BMI-for-age growth charts: BMI BMI Categories BMI-for-age at or above sex-specific 85th percentile, but less than 95th percentile Overweight BMI-for-age at or above sex-specific 95th percentile Obese Compared with people of normal weight, those who are overweight or obese are at greater risk for many diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and certain cancers. 2. How common is overweight or obesity? Results from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that 68 percent of U.S. adults age 20 years and older are overweight or obese. In 1988-1994, by contrast, only 56 percent of adults age 20 and older were overweight or obese. In addition, the percentage of children who are overweight or obese has also increased. Among children and teens ages 2 to 19, 17 percent are estimated to be obese, based on the 2007–2008 survey. In 1988–1994, that figure was only 10 percent. 3. What is known about the relationship between obesity and cancer? Obesity is associated with increased risks of the following cancer types, and possibly others as well: Esophagus\n\nPancreas\n\nColon and rectum\n\nBreast (after menopause)\n\nEndometrium (lining of the uterus)\n\nKidney\n\nThyroid\n\nGallbladder One study, using NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, estimated that in 2007 in the United States, about 34,000 new cases of cancer in men (4 percent) and 50,500 in women (7 percent) were due to obesity. The percentage of cases attributed to obesity varied widely for different cancer types but was as high as 40 percent for some cancers, particularly endometrial cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma. A projection of the future health and economic burden of obesity in 2030 estimated that continuation of existing trends in obesity will lead to about 500,000 additional cases of cancer in the United States by 2030. This analysis also found that if every adult reduced their BMI by 1 percent, which would be equivalent to a weight loss of roughly 1 kg (or 2.2 lbs) for an adult of average weight, this would prevent the increase in the number of cancer cases and actually result in the avoidance of about 100,000 new cases of cancer. Several possible mechanisms have been suggested to explain the association of obesity with increased risk of certain cancers: Fat tissue produces excess amounts of estrogen, high levels of which have been associated with the risk of breast, endometrial, and some other cancers.\n\nObese people often have increased levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factor -1 (IGF-1) in their blood (a condition known as hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance), which may promote the development of certain tumors.\n\nFat cells produce hormones, called adipokines, that may stimulate or inhibit cell growth. For example, leptin, which is more abundant in obese people, seems to promote cell proliferation, whereas adiponectin, which is less abundant in obese people, may have antiproliferative effects.\n\nFat cells may also have direct and indirect effects on other tumor growth regulators, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP-activated protein kinase\n\nObese people often have chronic low-level, or “subacute,” inflammation, which has been associated with increased cancer risk. Other possible mechanisms include altered immune responses, effects on the nuclear factor kappa beta system, and oxidative stress.

But new research suggests that women who are overweight or obese are more likely to develop the disease, compared with women of a healthy weight.\n\nInvestigators from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research conducted the study as part of the WCRF\'s Continuous Update Project.\n\nThe project monitors and assesses research associated with cancer prevention and uses this information to come to conclusions about how lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, may reduce cancer risk.\n\nFor other cancers, including breast, bowel and womb cancer, past research has found that being overweight or obese is a risk factor. Now, ovarian cancer can be added to the list, meaning women can make lifestyle changes to reduce their chances of developing the disease.\n\nTo reach their findings, the research team reviewed 25 studies involving 4 million women. Of these, 16,000 had ovarian cancer.\n\nThe researchers found that for every 5 additional body mass index (BMI) units, there was a 6% increase in the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a non-linear analysis revealed that women with a BMI greater than 28.4 kg/m2 had a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer than women with a lower BMI.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Dr. Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at WCRF, says:\n\n""Previously we only knew about risk factors that are fixed, such as age and family history of the disease, but now we can say that keeping to a healthy weight helps reduce the risk of getting ovarian cancer.""\n\nThe importance of body weight in cancer risk\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a BMI of 18.5-24.9 is deemed a normal weight for adults aged 20 years or older, while 25-29.9 is classed as overweight and 30 or above is deemed as obese.\n\nFast facts about ovarian cancer There are expected to be around 21,980 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the US this year\n\nIt is the fifth leading cause of cancer related deaths among women\n\nAround 50% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer are aged 63 years or older.\n\nApproximately 64% of women in the US are considered to be overweight or obese. These women are at increased risk of 1 in 8 cancers, including breast, bowel, womb, colorectal and now, ovarian cancer.\n\n""These latest findings from the Continuous Update Project show how important body weight is for an increasing number of cancers affecting both men and women,"" says Dr. Kate Allen, executive director of science and public affairs at WCRF.\n\nIn order to maintain a healthy weight, the WCRF says it is important to have BMI checked regularly.\n\nChoosing foods that are lower in energy density, avoiding fast food and sugary drinks, and opting for smaller portion sizes for meals will also help maintain a healthy weight.\n\nBeing physically active is also important for a healthy weight, and both diet and exercise has been directly linked to reduced cancer risk.\n\nMedical News Today recently reported on a study finding that postmenopausal women who followed a healthy lifestyle had a 22% lower risk of breast cancer and a 52% lower risk of colorectal cancer.', ""Body weight is not a factor that has been widely associated with the the risk of developing ovarian cancer.\nInvestigators from the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the American Institute for Cancer Research conducted the study as part of the WCRF's Continuous Update Project.\nFast facts about ovarian cancer There are expected to be around 21,980 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed in the US this yearIt is the fifth leading cause of cancer related deaths among womenAround 50% of women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer are aged 63 years or older.\nThese women are at increased risk of 1 in 8 cancers, including breast, bowel, womb, colorectal and now, ovarian cancer.\nBeing physically active is also important for a healthy weight, and both diet and exercise has been directly linked to reduced cancer risk.""]"
8298,http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-03-excess-weight-factor-ovarian-cancer.html,health,"['Review adds the disease to long list of tumors linked to obesity.\n\n(HealthDay)—A new report reveals that excess weight raises the risk of yet another kind of cancer, with the latest results linking levels of body fat to ovarian tumors.\n\nThe chances for developing many cancers—such as postmenopausal breast, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, kidney, gallbladder and pancreatic cancers—are known to increase with a person\'s weight, but the evidence for any such link to ovarian cancer has been inconclusive until now, the report authors said.\n\n""We estimated a 6 percent increase in [ovarian cancer] risk per five [points] increase in body-mass index,"" said report author Dr. Elisa Bandera, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, in New Brunswick. Bandera said the average woman\'s lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is 1.4 percent.\n\nBody-mass index (BMI) is a rough estimate of a person\'s body fat based on weight and height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal. Between 25 and 29.9 is overweight, and 30 and over is considered obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlmost 600,000 people develop one of the eight cancers linked to overweight and obesity in the United States each year, according to the report compiled by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Foundation. If everyone were at a healthy weight, about one in five of those cancers—or 120,000 cases of cancer a year—could be prevented, according to the report.\n\n""We know that obesity affects hormones known to affect the cancer process,"" Bandera said. ""It also leads to insulin resistance and [high levels of insulin], as well as a chronic systemic inflammation. Inflammation, in particular, has been a major factor implicated in ovarian cancer development and is also associated with poorer survival.""\n\nRegistered dietician Samantha Heller said she wasn\'t surprised by the report\'s findings.\n\n""Research suggests that up to 90 percent to 95 percent of cancers may be preventable with diet and lifestyle,"" said Heller, the clinical nutrition coordinator at the Center for Cancer Care at Griffin Hospital, in Derby, Conn. ""Of those, as many as 30 percent to 35 percent are linked to diet.""\n\n""Contrary to popular belief, fat cells are not the inert compounds we once thought,"" Heller said. ""They are biologically very active cells that produce both anti-inflammatory and inflammatory compounds, as well as hormones and other chemicals.""\n\n""An excess of fat cells—if someone is overweight or obese—appears to knock off the body\'s delicate balance of health,"" Heller said. ""This can lead to inflammation and hormonal imbalances, and can promote the growth of cancer cells.""\n\nThe current report is part of an ongoing project. The last report was published in 2007, Bandera said.\n\nOverall, the report included 25 population-based studies examining how diet, weight and physical activity might affect the risk of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. A major reason for that is that ovarian cancer often isn\'t diagnosed until it\'s in the later stages.\n\nBandera and her colleagues concluded that body fat is likely a contributing factor to the development of ovarian cancer. The risk is greatest for those with a BMI over 30, she added.\n\nAlthough the study found an association between body fat and ovarian cancer risk, it did not establish a cause-and-effect link.\n\nThe report also found that height is a factor in the development of ovarian cancer, with taller women at higher risk. The reason height is linked to ovarian cancer is unclear, Bandera said, although genetic factors and early growth rates might play a role.\n\n""What this means for cancer prevention is that prevention efforts need to target the life course, not just adulthood, and families, not just individuals,"" Bandera said.\n\nThe researchers said they were unable to conclude if any dietary factors might be protective because there simply weren\'t enough studies to draw any conclusions.\n\nFor now, both experts said maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent some cancers.\n\n""Because we also have evidence linking obesity to other cancers and other chronic diseases, maintenance of healthy weight through a healthy diet and regular exercise is a safe bet to live a healthy life,"" Bandera said.\n\nExplore further Nearly 60 percent of uterine cancer cases preventable, report says\n\nMore information: Learn more about ovarian cancer from the Learn more about ovarian cancer from the American Cancer Society\n\nCopyright © 2014 HealthDay.

More than 7,000 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year and there are about 4,300 deaths. If it is caught early more than 90% of women will survive for at least five years, but at the late stage that drops to less than 10%.\n\nThe World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which works on the prevention of cancer, has published an update of the risks for ovarian cancer, as part of its Continuous Update Project. For the first time, it says that overweight and obesity are a probable cause.\n\nWeight is known to be an issue in some other cancers, including breast and bowel cancer. In the UK 61% of people (57% of women) are overweight or obese which, says the WCRF, puts them at greater risk of developing one of eight types of cancer than their normal-weight neighbours.\n\nThe WRCF says an estimated 23,400 cases of cancer – one in six – could be avoided if nobody was overweight. Maintaining a healthy weight is one of its 10 recommendations for avoiding cancer.\n\n""We can now say with certainty that being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer, just as it does with a number of other cancers such as breast, bowel and womb cancer,"" said Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation.

The researchers analysed the results of 25 studies involving 4 million women, 16,000 of whom developed ovarian cancer. They found a 6% increased risk for every five extra BMI units (BMI – body mass index – is a calculation based on weight relative to height, and normal BMI levels are 18.5 to 25).\n\nHow significant a 6% increase for every extra BMI point is will depend on a woman\'s risk to begin with; it matters far more to someone who has a family history of it, for instance. But being overweight is one of the few ovarian cancer risk factors that women can do something about.\n\nAdult height is also a risk, the WCRF says, because it is a result of the rate of growth in the womb and in childhood, which is also a factor in obesity.\n\nThe charity Target Ovarian Cancer pointed out that the additional risk was not massive, but it highlighted the benefits of healthier lifestyles.\n\n""This new study supports earlier work that a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk of ovarian cancer,"" said Dr Simon Newman, head of research. ""For someone without a family history of ovarian cancer, their lifetime risk of developing the disease is 2%. The findings of this latest study suggest this increases to 2.24% for an obese person, which is still a low risk.""\n\nGilda Witte, chief executive of the charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said the research finally provided clarity on the link between obesity and ovarian cancer.\n\n""This robust report enables us to give clear guidance to women, and importantly for parents who can begin to encourage their daughters to adopt a healthy lifestyle as soon as possible so that the next generation has the best chance of reducing their risk,"" she said.', ""Putting on weight can increase women's risk of ovarian cancer, according to a new assessment of the evidence.\nOvarian cancer has a poor prognosis because it has few symptoms and is usually caught at a late stage.\nThe World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), which works on the prevention of cancer, has published an update of the risks for ovarian cancer, as part of its Continuous Update Project.\nBut being overweight is one of the few ovarian cancer risk factors that women can do something about.\nGilda Witte, chief executive of the charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said the research finally provided clarity on the link between obesity and ovarian cancer.""]"

John Kasich's concern about this important public health issue. However, we are disappointed that his mid-biennium budget proposal falls far short of the strong action needed to prevent kids from smoking, help smokers quit and reduce tobacco's terrible health and financial toll on Ohio.\n\nWe urge the Governor and Legislature to immediately increase Ohio's tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack and to dedicate a portion of the revenue to programs that are proven to prevent kids from smoking and help smokers quit. The tobacco tax increase should also still include the immediate equalization of tax rates on non-cigarette forms of tobacco, such as cigars, hookah and spit tobacco, which often come in candy flavors and brightly colored packaging which appeal to children. Ohio must take strong action to prevent youth use of all forms of tobacco.\n\nTobacco tax increases are a highly effective means of reducing smoking and other tobacco use, but the increase must be large enough to have the desired public health impact. The proposal to increase the cigarette tax over a two year period, from $1.25 to $1.85 per pack, would have little to no effect on smoking rates and would be easily undercut by tobacco industry discounting schemes, such as coupons, buy one get one free deals, and temporary price cuts. We are pleased that the proposal equalizes the tax on all other tobacco products, but to impact public health, this tax should also be immediately enacted and not phased-in over a two-year period.\n\nThe Governor has taken a positive step forward by proposing to allocate $26.9 million from the Master Settlement Agreement to the Ohio Department of Health for tobacco prevention and cessation programs over a five year span. However, this amount still falls well short of the\n\n$132 million a year recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs should be restored at least to the level of $50 million a year that Ohio was providing before funding was severely cut in Fiscal 2009.\n\nOhio was making significant progress in reducing tobacco use until funding for its tobacco prevention program was cut. In recent years, this progress has stalled and today Ohio has the 10th highest smoking rate in the country with 23.3 percent of adults smoking. The high school smoking rate is also higher than the nation as a whole at 21.1 percent. As a result, tobacco takes a huge health and financial toll on Ohio, claiming 17,700 lives each year and costing the state $5.6 billion annually in health care bills. Families and businesses alike pay a heavy price.\n\nGovernor Kasich has started an important conversation about the best way for Ohio to reduce tobacco use and its devastating toll. To have a significant impact, we urge the Governor and Legislature to raise the tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack, equalize tax rates on all tobacco products to the corresponding amount immediately instead of a two-year phased-in period, and to also increase funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs."", ""We urge the Governor and Legislature to immediately increase Ohio's tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack and to dedicate a portion of the revenue to programs that are proven to prevent kids from smoking and help smokers quit.\nThe tobacco tax increase should also still include the immediate equalization of tax rates on non-cigarette forms of tobacco, such as cigars, hookah and spit tobacco, which often come in candy flavors and brightly colored packaging which appeal to children.\nTobacco tax increases are a highly effective means of reducing smoking and other tobacco use, but the increase must be large enough to have the desired public health impact.\nOhio was making significant progress in reducing tobacco use until funding for its tobacco prevention program was cut.\nTo have a significant impact, we urge the Governor and Legislature to raise the tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack, equalize tax rates on all tobacco products to the corresponding amount immediately instead of a two-year phased-in period, and to also increase funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs.""]"

8330,http://theconversation.com/scotland-aims-to-be-smoke-free-by-2034-but-what-about-e-cigs-24239,health,"['Given just how well established anti-smoking campaigns in Britain now are, many of today’s smokers, and younger smokers in particular, have taken up the habit with at least some awareness of the damaging consequences of smoking on their long-term health. And despite these campaigns, the number of people smoking is still too high – particularly in Scotland, where, according to the Scottish Health Survey, one in four adults continues to smoke every day compared with around one in five in England and Wales.\n\nIn comparison to some of the more complex messages that public health campaigns need to get across, such as how many minutes a week we should all be active or how many units of alcohol we should be drinking, the message about tobacco harm is simple. So there is clearly more work to be done and the reasons behind smoking uptake still need to be fully understood.\n\nThe big picture\n\nEach year, tobacco use is associated with around a quarter of all deaths in Scotland. It accounts for 56,000 hospital admissions, and costs NHS Scotland £400m in treating smoking-related illnesses. It’s an issue that bears consequences not only on those who smoke, but for Scottish society and its economy.\n\nSince the Scottish Health Survey began in 1995, smoking among adults has declined by nearly 10%. The number of cigarettes being smoked has fallen too, from an average of 15-a-day to just over 12. Almost a third (29%) of those who smoke every day are between 25 and 44, making them the largest proportion of smokers.\n\nVast inequalities exist though. Those living in the country’s most deprived areas are more than three times as likely as those living in areas of least deprivation to smoke.\n\nIn March 2013, the Scottish government published Creating a Tobacco-Free Generation, an ambitious new tobacco control strategy that aims to create a smoke-free Scotland by 2034. The strategy puts Scotland right up there as a world leader on tobacco control. The standardisation of packaging of tobacco products, prohibition of tobacco vending machines, and a restriction on the display of all tobacco and smoking-related products as laid out in the strategy will also all serve to help undermine the marketing efforts of tobacco companies.\n\nThe first of the strategy’s milestones is to reduce prevalence to 17% by 2016. We therefore have a few more years to wait before we get a sense of just how ambitious the aim for a smoke-free generation is. It should be taken as read that the tobacco industry are watching on with great interest.\n\nE-cigarette bans\n\nThe increased profile and availability of e-cigarettes has thrown a bit of a spanner in the works. Are they a stepping stone to tobacco use or if properly regulated could they act as a useful alternative to cigarettes? The long-term effects of e-cigarettes are not yet known. They may in time prove to be a useful quitting aid but as yet there is little evidence to support this. In the meantime, sales of e-cigarettes have increased by 340% in the past year while in the same period sales of licensed nicotine replacement products has slowed.\n\nThe danger lies in e-cigarettes use, or “vaping”, becoming a way of simply replacing one habit, proven to be damaging to health, with an alternative habit, about which little is currently known. Until we know more about their long-term health effects then perhaps the focus should be on discouraging habitual nicotine use more generally. It’s encouraging to see that Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games is the latest event to have banned the use of e-cigarettes from its venues in the same way tobacco smoking has been banned. This follows on from initiatives by other organisations including ScotRail, Starbucks and Wetherspoons pubs, none of whom allow “vaping”.\n\nWe’ve also changed the Scottish Health Survey in 2014 to include questions on e-cigarette use for the first time. This means we will soon have robust data on the prevalence of e-cigarette use in Scotland, how it varies across different groups in society and how it relates to other health behaviours.\n\nA recent EU Directive will also clarify the status of the e-cigarette as a product. The framework allows products to “opt in” to medicines regulation or, failing that, be subject to a range of new controls which include safety and quality requirements as well as restrictions around advertising. With legislation to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to under 18s already passed in England and Wales, it is likely that Scotland will follow soon.\n\nThere are currently also no specific guidelines governing e-cigarette advertising but the Committee of Advertising Practice recently launched a public consultation on the marketing of e-cigarettes after one prime time advert attracted over 1,000 complaints. The consultation ends in April and any new rules arising out of the consultation are expected to be implemented soon after.\n\nGood news\n\nThe good news is that, according to a recent survey by Ash Scotland, Smoking among young teenagers is at its lowest level since 1990, an indication, perhaps, that this generation has taken more notice of – or been perhaps been more exposed to – effective anti-smoking campaigning.\n\nWe know from the latest Scottish Health Survey that 73% of smokers would like to stop and 41% have tried to quit on at least three occasions, so most smokers clearly want to change their behaviour. The challenge is to help and support these people give up, protecting others from second-hand exposure and fostering an environment where young people in Scotland do not want to take up smoking. In tandem with this is the challenge for the health community to figure out where e-cigarettes fit in with this in regards nicotine addiction and harm reduction.', 'The big pictureEach year, tobacco use is associated with around a quarter of all deaths in Scotland.\nIt accounts for 56,000 hospital admissions, and costs NHS Scotland £400m in treating smoking-related illnesses.\nSince the Scottish Health Survey began in 1995, smoking among adults has declined by nearly 10%.\nIn March 2013, the Scottish government published Creating a Tobacco-Free Generation, an ambitious new tobacco control strategy that aims to create a smoke-free Scotland by 2034.\nWe’ve also changed the Scottish Health Survey in 2014 to include questions on e-cigarette use for the first time.']"

This year\'s No Smoking Day is urging part-time smokers to quit too, writes Abi Jackson\n\nEVERY year since the campaign began in 1983, No Smoking Day has been rallying smokers to stub out for good and charities in Ireland and Britain are hoping to inspire even higher numbers this year.\n\nBut it\'s not just those with 40-a-day habits being targeted; this year the focus is shifting to include part-time and social smokers. Because while the past few decades have seen a wealth of research highlighting the dangers of being a heavy smoker, the increased risk of certain cancers being most notable, there has been very little emphasis on \'light\' smokers.\n\nA recent study, published this year in the Smoking In Britain journal, looking at non-daily smoking and common misconceptions, revealed that awareness of potential health risks of part-time smoking is low. Only a quarter (25 per cent) of the non-daily smokers surveyed said they were worried that cigarettes might be damaging their health, while the significant majority were unconcerned.\n\nMike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation (BHF), isn\'t surprised by the findings. ""People often think, including some doctors actually, \'Well, if you only smoke a bit, it\'s not going to do you too much harm\',"" he says. ""Part of that is driven by the lack of evidence; most research is done on people who smoke more. ""We don\'t say enough about part-time smoking.""\n\nThere may be less data on the health risks of part-time smoking, but that doesn\'t mean none exists. A major 2005 study, which followed thousands of men and women from\n\nthe 1970s through to 2002, looking at the consequences of smoking between one and four cigarettes a day, revealed heart-disease deaths were three times higher than in people who didn\'t smoke at all. These two studies alone are cause for concern for the BHF. ""I think we can say with confidence that, one, there is damage being done [if you\'re a part-time smoker] and, two, awareness of that is pretty low,"" Dr Knapton says. ""So this is an important message to get out there.""\n\nThere may be \'guidelines\' for sensible consumption levels for alcohol, for instance, but when it comes to smoking, Dr Knapton\'s view is clear - there is no such thing as a \'safe\' lower limit. ""An unequivocal no,"" he says. ""There\'s no safe limit as far as we\'re aware.""\n\nThere are more than one million part-time smokers in Britain and Northern Ireland. The non-daily smoking survey also found that just one in seven (15 per cent) of them feel they\'re addicted to cigarettes, compared to one in three daily smokers.\n\nNicotine is a highly addictive substance, however, and whether or not somebody experiences powerful physical cravings, smoking can be a very tough habit to break.\n\n""It becomes a social or psychological habit too - you have a cup of tea and a cigarette, for instance, and that becomes difficult to change over time,"" Dr Knapton says.\n\nReasons for part-time smoking vary. Some say it\'s a stress reliever, or to help them cope with they\'re anxious. For many, it\'s a social thing - lighting up with colleagues during a work break, joining in with other smokers on a night out; having something to hold and \'do\' can be a comfort in itself.\n\nDespite the low number of \'light\' smokers admitting to health worries, two in five (40 per cent) said they\'ve tried to quit in the past year.\n\nn continues overleaf', ""But it's not just those with 40-a-day habits being targeted; this year the focus is shifting to include part-time and social smokers.\nA recent study, published this year in the Smoking In Britain journal, looking at non-daily smoking and common misconceptions, revealed that awareness of potential health risks of part-time smoking is low.\nThere may be less data on the health risks of part-time smoking, but that doesn't mean none exists.\nThere are more than one million part-time smokers in Britain and Northern Ireland.\nReasons for part-time smoking vary.""]"

To mark national No Smoking Day, reporter Alexa Copeland swapped her pack of menthols for an e-cigarette to find out how they are helping so many people kick the habit.\n\nI have never wanted to give up smoking to be perfectly honest. Life can be miserable enough without depriving oneself of its simple pleasures and for me, pleasurable moments invariably involve cigarettes. Especially the one that gets you started in the morning. And the one with a relaxing cup of tea or a glass of wine at the end of the day, and the one that stops you cracking when you’re nearing your stress limit. And, well, you get my point.\n\nI know it’s not big, and it’s certainly not clever, but I’ve always enjoyed my cigarettes. And in a perverse way, the more we smokers are made to feel like social lepers through bans and regulation, the more my resolve strengthened to continue the habit. Smoking isn’t illegal, it contributes billions to the treasury and the constant hounding of the sociable souls who indulge feels a bit too much like a Nanny State-sponsored witch-hunt for my liking. And that is something I like to rail against most passionately.\n\nAlas, I was forced to re-evaluate my attitude a couple of weeks ago when I was plagued with a chest infection almost matched in severity by my doctor’s words. She did not explicitly link the infection with smoking, but her stern insinuation that I was setting myself up for a grim future of pain and breathlessness from ineffectual lungs was enough to make me seriously think about what I was doing to myself.\n\nBeing a somewhat reluctant quitter, I didn’t much fancy my chances of giving up easily. Although I don’t smoke heavily – around seven per day unless alcohol is involved – my habit stretches back over a decade and is truly ingrained in my daily routine. Nicotine patches and gum may work for some, but I knew I’d miss the physical ritual of smoking, so I joined the tens of thousands of people around the country who are replacing their smoking with ‘vaping’.\n\nVaping is the term given to the use of electronic cigarettes; also known as vapourisers or e-cigs. These devices come in a range of styles offering different flavours and nicotine doses. E-cigs work by vapourising a liquid solution which contains nicotine, thus allowing users to effectively mimic taking a drag on a cigarette to get their nicotine hit. The ‘smoke’ exhaled is largely water vapour and e-cigs are marketed as a much safer alternative to conventional cigarettes as they do not contain tar or carcinogens.\n\nOne man keen to extol their virtues is businessman Alan O’Neill who was quick to capitalise on the early popularity of the product. Mr O’Neill bought his own vapouriser online about 18-months-ago and within 30 days his 30-a-day habit was history. He then set about bringing e-cigs to the North-East and now owns E-ciggy shops in Darlington, Stockton, Middlesbrough and Washington. He says business is growing from strength to strength as more and more smokers turn to vaping.\n\nHe said: “You get customers coming back to tell you how long they’ve gone without a cigarette, while some come back to say thank you for helping them quit and it feels fantastic to get feedback like that. I’ve found that a proportion of users want to quit completely, but a proportion are quite happy to just carry on using the e-cigs as an alternative to smoking. I switched because I wanted to stop the negative health and financial effects of smoking but I still wanted the pleasure of smoking. In that way it was a fantastic solution and I just thought this incredible product should be more widely available.”\n\nUnfortunately for Mr O’Neill and the estimated one million ‘vapers’ in Britain, uncertainty surrounds the product’s future, with bodies such as the British Medical Association and World Health Organisation expressing safety concerns. The main issue is that unlike nicotine patches and gum, e-cigs are not regulated in the same way as medicines. This means there are no rules when it comes to the purity of the nicotine and so forth. Last month MEPs voted to restrict the availability of e-cigs in the future and it remains to be seen how many pubs and clubs will allow vaping on their premises if it is deemed to be harmful.\n\nFor me, switching to an e-cigarette has been unbelievably painless. In the three days since I started vaping I have had just two real cigarettes. I would normally have had at least 20 in that time. Maybe it’s the novelty factor, or maybe, despite my protestations to the contrary, it was just the right time for me to give up, but whatever the reason I have no doubt that the e-cigarette has helped enormously. It fits into my routine in the same way that real cigarettes did and I find myself enjoying my ‘e-cig moments’ almost as much as I savored the real thing.\n\nAnd if the future of vapourising is threatened by government legislation and public bans, well, I still have something to rail against don’t I? And I do believe I shall do that most passionately.', 'An estimated one million people across the UK have swapped smoking for ‘vaping’.\nNicotine patches and gum may work for some, but I knew I’d miss the physical ritual of smoking, so I joined the tens of thousands of people around the country who are replacing their smoking with ‘vaping’.\nVaping is the term given to the use of electronic cigarettes; also known as vapourisers or e-cigs.\nI switched because I wanted to stop the negative health and financial effects of smoking but I still wanted the pleasure of smoking.\nIn the three days since I started vaping I have had just two real cigarettes.']"

Businesses that primarily sell electronic/vapor inhalation products also will need a conditional use permit, a requirement that now applies to smoke shops. Minors are prohibited from buying and using e-cigarettes and similar products.\n\nElectronic cigarettes are battery-powered devices that can provide doses of nicotine and other additives in an aerosol.

Hookah use with any tobacco product, weed or plant is already prohibited in enclosed public places and in certain outdoor public areas.\n\n""We have the opportunity to stop these e-cigs in their track,"" Kendrick said, who added that ""having a smoking section in a restaurant is like having a peeing section in a pool.""\n\nEl Cajon for years has had some of the most comprehensive smoking restrictions in San Diego County.\n\nSmoking is not allowed in any public place in El Cajon, including common areas in multi-unit residences; on city sidewalks, streets and stores; in common areas of malls; in enclosed and unenclosed areas of hotels, motels and places of business; or in bars, restaurants and public accommodations.

Yes 48% (1062) No 52% (1132) 2194 total votes.\n\nThe San Diego City Council may take similar action later this year. City Councilman Mark Kersey wants to ban their use inside Petco Park and Qualcomm Stadium and all other city facilities. He also wants to prohibit allowing their sale from vending machines, and require a permit for all dealers.\n\nIn Sacramento, a bill to ban electronic smoking in all public buildings and enact other regulations is wending its way through the Legislature.\n\nAnd the U.S. Food and Drug Administration next month is expected to issue long-awaited regulations some seven years after the products first emerged.\n\nThe San Diego County Board of Supervisors also addressed electronic cigarettes and other vapor devices Tuesday, treating them like tobacco products and targeting their use in its health policies and smoking cessation efforts. But regulating them in the workplace or restaurants remains a matter of state law, according to county officials.\n\nFor the electronic cigarette industry, the legislative curtailments are an overreaction to what it says is a non-existent problem.\n\n“We are not in favor of any restrictions, but we understand them,” said Thomas Kiklas of The Vapor and Electronic Cigarette Association. “They can’t ban the products sale or use, but they can restrict it in public places.”\n\nKiklas co-owns NICMAXX Electronic Cigarettes and is engaged in industry advocacy efforts throughout the nation.\n\nHe maintains that while e-cigarettes are a nicotine product, the vapor they produce is not akin to second-hand tobacco smoke.\n\n“When someone vapes in public it is not harming anyone,” he said.\n\nNot everyone agrees, while others say more research is needed.\n\nE-cigarettes are banned for sale to minors, but health officials say they are increasingly alarmed that the products are being marketed using images drawn from games popular with kids such as Angry Birds. They also say the devices are being used to smoke marijuana, hash oil and other illegal drugs.\n\nThat was part of the issue front and center for the county supervisors Tuesday, who voted 3-1 to equate electronic smoking devices with tobacco.\n\nSupervisor Dave Roberts said there are also too many unknowns about potential health problems to allow unrestricted use of e-cigs. He argued electronic cigarettes are a gateway to regular tobacco use because they are primarily used to ingest nicotine.\n\n“The county should be a model, and I cannot support a product that promotes addiction,” he said.\n\nIn May, the county will consider another layer to its policy by prohibiting all electronic smoking devices at all county facilities.\n\nSupervisor Bill Horn cast the lone “no” vote, citing e-cigarettes as a tool for people to quit regular cigarettes.\n\n“It is a knee-jerk reaction to something that is taking place and I don’t think we should be telling adults you can’t use these if you are trying to get off nicotine,” Horn said.\n\nThe board’s vote came after numerous speakers urged action and Dr. Wilma Wooten, county public health officer, said sales of the products have tripled in recent years and that about 7 percent of middle and high school students are illegally using them.\n\nCalifornia’s Health and Safety Code makes it illegal to sell or furnish e-cigs to anyone under 18 and allows local jurisdictions to pass and enforce laws governing their distribution.\n\nThe fair board voted 6-0 to ban use of the products during the county fair, which opens June 7 and runs through July 6. The move comes after it banned smoking at the fair last year. The prohibition does not apply to Del Mar Thoroughbred Club races or fairgrounds’ special events.\n\nBoard members said adding e-cigarettes to the policy was partly an issue of enforcement.\n\n“I would feel sorry for the security personnel trying to distinguish cigarettes from e-cigarettes,” said fair board vice president David Watson. “If we’re going to do it, we’re going to do it 100 percent.”\n\nIn El Cajon, the City Council vote was 4-1 with Mayor Bill Wells opposing.\n\nThe city will now require those-cigarette and related product sellers to get a license, as is the case with tobacco sellers. Businesses that primarily sell electronic vapor inhalation products will need a conditional use permit similar to what’s required of smoke shops in the city.\n\nStaff writer Edward Sifuentes and Karen Pearlman contributed to this report.', 'Government agencies are increasingly snuffing out “vaping” or puffing on electronic cigarettes in public spaces.\nIn Sacramento, a bill to ban electronic smoking in all public buildings and enact other regulations is wending its way through the Legislature.\nThat was part of the issue front and center for the county supervisors Tuesday, who voted 3-1 to equate electronic smoking devices with tobacco.\nHe argued electronic cigarettes are a gateway to regular tobacco use because they are primarily used to ingest nicotine.\nIn May, the county will consider another layer to its policy by prohibiting all electronic smoking devices at all county facilities.']"

John Kasich's concern about this important public health issue. However, we are disappointed that his mid-biennium budget proposal falls far short of the strong action needed to prevent kids from smoking, help smokers quit and reduce tobacco's terrible health and financial toll on Ohio.\n\nWe urge the Governor and Legislature to immediately increase Ohio's tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack and to dedicate a portion of the revenue to programs that are proven to prevent kids from smoking and help smokers quit. The tobacco tax increase should also still include the immediate equalization of tax rates on non-cigarette forms of tobacco, such as cigars, hookah and spit tobacco, which often come in candy flavors and brightly colored packaging which appeal to children. Ohio must take strong action to prevent youth use of all forms of tobacco.\n\nTobacco tax increases are a highly effective means of reducing smoking and other tobacco use, but the increase must be large enough to have the desired public health impact. The proposal to increase the cigarette tax over a two year period, from $1.25 to $1.85 per pack, would have little to no effect on smoking rates and would be easily undercut by tobacco industry discounting schemes, such as coupons, buy one get one free deals, and temporary price cuts. We are pleased that the proposal equalizes the tax on all other tobacco products, but to impact public health, this tax should also be immediately enacted and not phased-in over a two-year period.\n\nThe Governor has taken a positive step forward by proposing to allocate $26.9 million from the Master Settlement Agreement to the Ohio Department of Health for tobacco prevention and cessation programs over a five year span. However, this amount still falls well short of the\n\n$132 million a year recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs should be restored at least to the level of $50 million a year that Ohio was providing before funding was severely cut in Fiscal 2009.\n\nOhio was making significant progress in reducing tobacco use until funding for its tobacco prevention program was cut. In recent years, this progress has stalled and today Ohio has the 10th highest smoking rate in the country with 23.3 percent of adults smoking. The high school smoking rate is also higher than the nation as a whole at 21.1 percent. As a result, tobacco takes a huge health and financial toll on Ohio, claiming 17,700 lives each year and costing the state $5.6 billion annually in health care bills. Families and businesses alike pay a heavy price.\n\nGovernor Kasich has started an important conversation about the best way for Ohio to reduce tobacco use and its devastating toll. To have a significant impact, we urge the Governor and Legislature to raise the tobacco tax by $1.50 per pack, equalize tax rates on all tobacco products to the corresponding amount immediately instead of a two-year phased-in period, and to also increase funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs."", ""John Kasich's concern about this important public health issue.\nThe tobacco tax increase should also still include the immediate equalization of tax rates on non-cigarette forms of tobacco, such as cigars, hookah and spit tobacco, which often come in candy flavors and brightly colored packaging which appeal to children.\nTobacco tax increases are a highly effective means of reducing smoking and other tobacco use, but the increase must be large enough to have the desired public health impact.\nOhio was making significant progress in reducing tobacco use until funding for its tobacco prevention program was cut.\nGovernor Kasich has started an important conversation about the best way for Ohio to reduce tobacco use and its devastating toll.""]"

At the time of the first Surgeon General’s Report, 42 percent of American adults smoked. Today, only 18 percent do.\n\nThat’s according to the 50th Anniversary Surgeon General’s Report released in January.\n\nBut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to list tobacco use as the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. And young people today continue to pick up the habit.\n\nA discussion about new guidelines to help communities control tobacco use and addiction.\n\nLast month Washington University’s Center for Public Health Systems Science (CPHSS) released new tobacco control policy guidelines nationwide targeted at helping states and local communities reduce tobacco use.\n\nThe focus is policy, not education, because that has been determined to have a broader effect, said Douglas Luke, the director of CPHSS and a professor at the Brown School of Social Work.\n\nPolicy Recommendations\n\nThe main recommendations of CPHSS tobacco control guidelines are to raise the price of tobacco products and to implement smoke-free policies.\n\n“Fewer people smoke, fewer people start smoking if the price is higher,” Luke said. While people who are addicted may still buy tobacco products even as the price goes up, a higher cost discourages new smokers from picking up the habit, he explained.\n\nThat’s why Missouri’s low tobacco tax rate worries him.\n\n“We have the lowest tax rate on cigarettes in the entire country. And it just makes it easier for people to start because the cost of starting is much less compared to other places,” Luke said.\n\nDespite the low tax rate, Missouri has about the same percent of smokers as the national average, 19 percent. But St. Louis City has a higher concentration of smokers, sitting at 26 percent, Luke said.\n\nAnd Missouri is doing a bit better on the second half of the policy recommendations. While the state does not have a smoke-free policy, some local communities do.\n\n“As recent as the early 90s very few people in the United States lived in communities that had smoke-free policies, less than one percent. As of this year, about half the country lives in either in a state or a community that has strong smoke-free policies.” Luke said.\n\nE-Cigarettes\n\nAnother focus of the policy guidelines is youth prevention, because most smokers begin smoking before the age of 18.\n\nThe newest challenge on that front is the e-cigarette, said Luke, with many young people already switching over to the new non-tobacco version of the cigarette, which releases nicotine in vapor form.\n\nAccording to Luke, the concern about the e-cigarette is two-fold. First, they often aren’t subject to regulations. And second, they may prolong the use of nicotine even if the initial health risks are lower.\n\nAdding Years to a Child’s Life\n\nThe thing about tobacco use, said Luke, is that not only is it the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, but it is a choice that has a direct impact on how long you live.\n\nIf you can prevent a child from starting smoking, you can add 4 to 8 years to their life, he said.\n\nRelated Information\n\n1-800-QUIT-NOW\n\nFree hotline in Missouri which connects callers with smoking cessation programs.\n\nSt. Louis on the Air provides discussion about issues and concerns facing the St. Louis area.

Perhaps you’re one of them, or you’re working, living or socialising with a would-be quitter.\n\nToday, on No Smoking Day, British Heart Foundation (BHF) Scotland will help tens of thousands of smokers to win the battle against this deadly addiction.\n\nWhy do we care? Sadly, around 13,000 people in Scotland die prematurely from smoking-related causes each year. That includes an estimated 3,000 from heart and circulatory diseases. Quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do to improve your health.\n\nNo Smoking Day merged with the BHF three years ago, and it’s one of the UK’s biggest annual health awareness campaigns. Last year an estimated one million people attempted to quit on the day. At BHF Scotland we work tirelessly to reduce tobacco-related illness and death, and research from stop smoking services shows that smokers are four times more likely to be effective in quitting if they use specialist stop smoking support and treatment.\n\nThe theme for our campaign this year is “V for Victory”, because we recognise that quitting is a battle against addiction. But it’s a battle that we can help you win.\n\nBHF Scotland isn’t fighting this battle alone. Thousands of organisations support the No Smoking Day campaign, from local stop smoking services, to businesses, schools, GP surgeries and the military. They are the lifeblood of the campaign and are using our tools and resources to run thousands of events in the community to encourage people to quit today.\n\nWe’re also supporting the Scottish Government’s tobacco control strategy by playing an active part in its aim to create a smoke-free generation by 2034.\n\nI was at a stop smoking roadshow last week, at our furniture and electrical store in Stockwell Street, Glasgow. As part of a series of roadshows, we invited the public to our stores to get help and advice on how to start a successful quit attempt today.\n\nStop smoking experts were on hand to test people’s lungage and carbon monoxide levels in order to demonstrate the harmful effects of smoking.\n\nI met people who want to stop smoking, and I met a few who don’t but were, nevertheless, curious enough to come along to the event. And I explained to them that No Smoking Day is not about forcing anyone to quit, but about helping those who have decided they’d like to try.\n\nIt amazes me to think that decades ago smoking in the workplace and, more recently than that, in bars and clubs, was not only acceptable but seen as the norm. In 20 years’ time it would be wonderful to look back and remember, with astonishment, the days when it was normal to see someone buying cigarettes and smoking at all. When that day comes we can congratulate ourselves on how far we’ve come to make Scotland smoke-free.\n\nWhen you’re ready to quit, whether it’s on No Smoking Day or any other day of the year, you’ll find all the tools and support you need on our website – www.nosmokingday.org.uk. You’ll find stories from people who have found it tough to give up smoking, but have found some ingenious ways to do it; like Vanessa, who fought off cravings by picking up her knitting needles and has now started a knitting business. And there’s an online forum where you can get support through the tough times and share advice with other quitters.\n\nMany smokers would welcome help from their employers to quit. Research carried out by the BHF showed that two-thirds of workers would like their employers to promote campaigns like No Smoking Day in the workplace and three quarters would like information about their local stop smoking service for support.\n\nOur free Health at Work programme helps employers to create health and wellbeing initiatives that can improve the health and productivity of the workforce.

Dr. Stanton Glantz was a co-author. The study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics.\n\nThe UCSF press release also contains a demonstrably false leading statement:\n\nThe study of nearly 40,000 youth around the country also found that e-cigarette use among middle- and high-school students doubled between 2011 and 2012, from 3.1 percent to 6.5 percent.\n\nThese percentages DO NOT refer to current e-cigarette use, but to ever using e-cigarettes, “even just one time.” I have analyzed this data before (here and here). E-cigarette use among middle- and high-school students did double between 2011 and 2012, from 1.0 to 2.0 percent. The chart on the left provides a truthful picture of e-cigarette use.\n\nThe Dutra-Glantz study consisted of a dizzying array of statistical analyses that could not possibly support their claim that e-cigarettes are a gateway to cigarettes. Unfortunately, the media is headlining this false claim around the globe.\n\nThe only positive note in this otherwise dark story is that, for the first time, Glantz’s fabrication was called out by the American Cancer Society and the American Legacy Foundation.

The study was published March 6, 2014, in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nSimply put, the use of e-cigarettes – which some also call vape pipes, vaping pens, e-hookahs, and hookah pens – may encourage our youth to also try tobacco. In fact, according to the study, those who said they had used an e-cig were six times more likely to try tobacco than those students who had never puffed electronically.\n\nNationally, we already have about 3 million students in high school or below smoking tobacco. And, we know that the use of e-cigs among our youth is growing. This is alarming particularly since nicotine – an addictive drug found in tobacco – is a key ingredient in an electronic cigarette.\n\nSlick and aggressive marketing with glamorous and sexy images makes these devices look cool and attract the interest of our younger generations.\n\nFurthermore, a variety of flavors including cherry, gummi bears, vanilla, and cookies and cream are available for the user.

Now thanks to pioneering use of 3D printing, surgeons were able to repair his face in a boundary-pushing reconstructive procedure that took months to plan and 8 hours to complete.\n\nThe crash, which occurred in September 2012, broke both Mr. Power\'s arms and his right leg, both cheek bones, both eye sockets, and his upper jaw. It also fractured his skull.\n\nHe underwent emergency surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, some 36 miles from where the crash occurred in Llantwit Major. His limb injuries were so serious they required attention from a team of trauma, orthopedic and plastic surgeons. He needed a bone graft for his right leg.\n\nThe surgeons did a good a job on his facial injuries, but they could not fully repair his left cheek and eye socket, as consultant maxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar explains:\n\n""We fixed his facial fractures pretty well but he had damaged his left eye and the ophthalmologists did not want us to do anything that might damage his sight further.""\n\nAs Mr. Power\'s eyesight has mostly recovered, this proved to be a good decision. But, Sugar adds, ""as a result we did not get his left cheekbone in the right place and we did not even try to reconstruct the very thin bones around his eye socket.""\n\nMr. Power was consequently left with a distorted face - his left cheekbone was out of place and his left eye remained sunk in and lower than his right eye.\n\nTeam got together to \'virtually plan\' the facial reconstruction\n\nShare on Pinterest Using scanned 3D images of his face, the surgeons designed guides to cut and re-position the bones, and plates to hold them in place.\n\nSo Mr. Sugar and a team got together to ""virtually plan"" the surgery to restore symmetry to Mr. Power\'s face.\n\nUsing scanned 3D images of his face, they designed guides to cut and re-position the bones, and plates to hold them in place. All the models - including the guides and titanium implants - were made using 3D printing.\n\n""We did two types of model planning - virtual model planning on a computer screen and physical model planning,"" Mr. Sugar explains, ""Also we produced guides at each stage of the surgical process, not only to cut the bone but to reposition the bones, and then we had custom implants 3D printed.""\n\nHe says that without the help of such advanced technology they would have to work freehand and ""guess"" where everything goes. ""The technology allows us to be far more precise and get a better result for the patient,"" he adds.\n\nBoth surgeons and patient are pleased with the results of the operation. Mr. Power\'s cheekbone is in a better position, and the eye is not sunken any more, although it is slightly raised - but that might settle in the next few months, says Mr. Sugar.\n\n\'It has made me look a lot better\'\n\nBefore his pioneering surgery, Mr. Power had continued to wear glasses to disguise his cheek and eye, even though his vision had been improving. He said then that he was hoping the surgery would mean he would not have to hide his face and he would get his confidence back - he would be able to do everyday things, see people and go out in public.\n\nAfter the operation, Mr. Power said:\n\n""To be honest I thought they did a good job in the beginning anyway because of how bad my accident was. But from this operation I can\'t really explain how well it has gone. It has just made me look a lot better. I take my hat off to them.""\n\nHe gave the operation a 9 out of 10. ""I\'m glad he\'s not given us 10,"" says Mr. Sugar, ""because if he did, we would not have any way of getting better.""\n\nShare on Pinterest ""I can\'t really explain how well it has gone. It has just made me look a lot better. I take my hat off to them,"" says Mr. Power.\n\nMr. Power is still not fully recovered from his overall physical injuries, but his facial reconstruction has been successful, and opens the door for the techniques to help others. Mr. Sugar says they did not take 3D technology just one step further, but two, and perhaps even three steps further. He explains:\n\n""Previous efforts elsewhere to take it to this step have failed and so we have had to learn from those experiences. This is really the first time we\'ve taken it to this stage, where everything to the very last screws being inserted has been planned and modelled in advance - and worked sweetly.""\n\nHe says while it took months to plan it this time, next time it will take nowhere near as long.\n\n""We\'re talking maybe days as opposed to months. The ultimate aim is to undertake planning and be able to use custom-made guides and implants on a routine basis,"" he adds.\n\nHe says the more experienced they become, the cheaper it will get, which will help to spread the expertise to ""any surgeon who finds themselves with this kind of problem.""\n\nThe 3D reconstruction project was the work of the Centre for Applied Reconstructive Technologies in Surgery, which is a partnership between Morriston Hospital\'s Maxillofacial Unit and the National Centre for Product Design and Development Research at Cardiff Metropolitan University.', 'Stephen Power, a 29-year-old father from Cardiff in the UK, was left with extensive facial injuries after a motorbike crash.\nMr. Power was consequently left with a distorted face - his left cheekbone was out of place and his left eye remained sunk in and lower than his right eye.\nSo Mr. Sugar and a team got together to ""virtually plan"" the surgery to restore symmetry to Mr. Power\'s face.\n""I\'m glad he\'s not given us 10,"" says Mr. Sugar, ""because if he did, we would not have any way of getting better.""\nMr. Sugar says they did not take 3D technology just one step further, but two, and perhaps even three steps further.']"

He was wearing a helmet at the time of the crash but still suffered gruesome injuries.\n\n“I broke both cheek bones, top jaw, my nose and fractured my skull,” Power, 29, told Hywel Griffith of the BBC. “I can’t remember the accident – I remember five minutes before and then waking up in the hospital a few months later.”\n\nSurgeons at Morriston Hospital in Swansea, Wales used CT scans to recreate Power’s face and then print a symmetrical 3D model of his cranium. They then cut that mould down with cutting guides and printed plates to restructure his face.\n\nThe procedure lasted eight hours, culminating with medical-grade titanium implants set into his face to ensure that the bones remain in place.\n\nPower said that before the surgery he would hide his face with help from a hat and glasses. That is no longer necessary, thanks to the surgeons and their willingness to try what could become a more common method of operation.\n\n“It’s totally life changing,” Power said. “I could see the difference straight away the day I woke up from the surgery…I’ll be able to do day-to-day things, go and see people, walk in the street, even go to any public areas.”\n\nMaxillofacial surgeon Adrian Sugar said in a statement that the results were unlike anything he’s encountered before.\n\n“Without this advanced technology, it’s freehand. You have to guess where everything goes,” he said, as quoted by the AFP’s Guy Jackson. “The technology allows us to be far more precise and get a better result for the patient.”\n\nThe process of 3D printing includes manually entering geometric data into a computer and forming it into graphics, a process that has been compared to digital sculpting. The computer then scans the “sculpture” and forms a physical, three dimensional model of the desired piece.\n\nPrinters have already been used to design new technology that could be used in zero or low gravity situations in outer space. Last year, a US-based group made international headlines after announcing it planned to “[design a working plastic gun that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer,” as quoted by Forbes’ Andy Greenberg.\n\nThe idea of 3D printers helping potentially dangerous people build their own high-powered killing machines was unsettling, although the possibility that 3D printers could be used to benefit someone who had suffered a serious injury did not seem to be considered at the time.\n\nStephen Power appears to be the first person to have undergone such an extensive surgery with help from a 3D printer. Yet dozens of patients in the UK last year did experience similar surgeries to aid with various maladies they were experiencing.\n\nAnn O’Sullivan, a grandmother who lives in Roehampton, in south-western London, thought she had a sinus problem only to go to the doctor and be informed that she was in fact experiencing the rapid growth of a tumor just beneath the skin on her face.\n\n“I’ve always been healthy so it came as a shock when the doctor referred me to the hospital where the scan revealed a tumor. The hardest thing to take was the loss of my left eye,” she told Emma Innes of the Daily Mail last year. “The surgeons told me it was just rotten luck but that I was lucky the tumor had been growing outwards rather than inwards.”\n\nO’Sullivan underwent a 10-hour operation that involved surgeons taking bone fragments from her leg in order to reconstruct part of her jaw. The 3D technology also helped doctors reconnect a number of veins, arteries, and tissue grafts.\n\n“I put my faith in the hospital and they saved my life,” she said. “I told myself it could have been worse and am now focused on getting on with my life.

How many cc\'s should my dr inject into my expanders to acheive this final size. I\'m at 450 cc right now. The dr. is saying we may be at the point where we should stop, but I want to be sure before I stop on the expansion process. I am a 5\'7"", 145 lb woman. Could you please help me, by providing me some information before I make my final decision?\n\nAnswer\n\nThat\'s really tough to answer because of your size. I have the biggest implants they make--850 cc\'s, but they\'re only a B to C cup at the most.....then again, I\'m not a tiny, small frame woman. Of the women I have talked to, the size has varied greatly. I\'m sure 850 cc\'s would look absolutely huge on you, but on me they are just so-so. I had a small D cup prior to cancer. What size does your doctor recommend? Have you asked to see the various size implants he has? Sometimes holding them can give you an idea of what to expect. As far as how much to inject, well that\'s just as tricky cause your doctor will want to over fill you a bit. My doctor filled me to 1150 cc\'s just to put 850 in. Wanted to make sure he had enough extra tissue to close around the implant incase there was some type of problem. He should know exactly how much saline to inject, or how big to take you since he\'s done this type of procedure on other women of your size.\n\nGood luck!\n\nAngi', ""QuestionAsked by AmeliaBreast Size After ReconstructionI am currently going through reconstruction after havng a double mastectomy.\nMy original cup size was A on my right side and B on my left side before my mastectomy.\nI would like to acheive a full C cup to a D.

12025,http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127838-motorbike-accident-victim-has-face-reconstructed-using-3d-printed-parts,health,"[""There are numerous ways you can print objects in 3D starting today, without having to buy a 3D printer or use fancy 3D modeling software.\n\nWhen reading about 3D printers, there's usually an asterisk about how you must first convert any object you want to print into a 3D model or render file that the printer will be able to understand and use as a reference.\n\nAlright...but how exactly do you do that?\n\nIt's actually quite simple. In fact, you don't even have to learn how to work a 3D printer or design a 3D model. That's all due to the internet. It's a handy resource brimming with 3D printing methods that are easy to use and affordable.\n\nKeep reading if you want to learn more or are interested in experimenting with 3D technologies (sans the pricey overhead).\n\nREAD: 3D printing: Everything you need to know\n\nBefore we go any further, you should understand the basics of 3D printing. It's an additive manufacturing process. In other words, it's when a real object is created from a 3D design model. The 3D model is usually saved on your computer as a render file and then sent to a 3D printer. The 3D printer prints your design - layer by layer - until a physical object is formed. Simples.\n\nPractically anything, depending on the type of 3D printer and materials you have around. Just remember: If you can draw it, you can print it.\n\nThat said, complicated objects can only be printed by professional 3D printers from companies like Stratasys and 3DSystems. There are however plenty of consumer-friendly printers on the market, from companies like Makerbot, that let you print smaller-scale objects using a variety of materials. You could even rely on websites that let you upload 3D design models and then order prints online from home, but more on that later.\n\nAnd finally, keep in mind that consumer 3D printing is currently limited to a select few materials. Although agencies like NASA are developing printers that can print entire pizzas using food ingredients as materials, the most common materials currently used by 3D printers include: ABS plastic, PLA, polyamide (nylon), glass filled polyamide, stereolithography materials (epoxy resins), silver, titanium, steel, wax, photopolymers, and polycarbonate.\n\nEven if you have no design experience, you can learn how to 3D model (and eventually make 3D models) through 3D modeling software tools such as Rhino, Blender, Tinkercad, or SketchUp. Please know that it will take practice to become familiar with 3D modeling.\n\nOnce you have dreamed up an object and used a software tool to design a 3D model of that object, you must save the 3D model to your computer as a render file. You will then upload that render file to a 3D printer. Each printer should have specific instructions on how to upload or accomplish this task.\n\nHowever not all of you may want to spend the time designing or learning how to use 3D modeling software. In that case, you could simply find render files for a 3D model similar to the one you have in mind through an online 3D model database.\n\nA 3D model database is a search engine for 3D objects.\n\nTo use one, all you have to do is search for an object on the site, then browse through all the search results, and pick a 3D model. The model should have a source link or button to download relevant render files. As we mentioned earlier, these render files must be saved to your computer and uploaded to a 3D printer before the 3D printer can actually print a physical version.\n\nYobi 3D is a popular 3D model database, where you can find 3D models for a wide variety of objects ranging from Batman's Batarang throwing star to even a cockroach. Gross, we know. Other popular databases include 3D Marvels, 3D Via, GrabCAD, Google 3D Warehouse, Ponoko Product Plans, Shapeways 3D Parts Database, Thingiverse, and Turbosquid.\n\nIf you don't own a 3D printer, you can still 3D print any 3D model you found through a database or designed through a software tool.\n\nJust use a 3D printing service such as Shapeways, i.Materialise, Sculpteo, Ponoko, etc. Not only will they 3D-print objects for you, but they will also ship them to your front door, enabling you to manufacture 3D goods without ever having to leave your house.\n\nShapeways, which will print a variety of different sized objects using different materials, can print an elasto plastic object, for instance, that costs just $1.75 per cm&³3;. The website also offers a materials samples kit, the ability to upload your own designs, and tutorials.\n\nEach 3D printing service offers its own blend of features and price points, so you'll have to do your own research in order to figure out exactly what you want to print, what materials you should use, and how much you are willing to spend."", ""There are numerous ways you can print objects in 3D starting today, without having to buy a 3D printer or use fancy 3D modeling software.\nIn fact, you don't even have to learn how to work a 3D printer or design a 3D model.\nREAD: 3D printing: Everything you need to knowBefore we go any further, you should understand the basics of 3D printing.\nThe 3D model is usually saved on your computer as a render file and then sent to a 3D printer.\nIf you don't own a 3D printer, you can still 3D print any 3D model you found through a database or designed through a software tool.""]"

Also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, the condition increases the risk of a recurrence of colon cancer, as well as of developing uterine, ovarian, gastric and kidney cancers.\n\nAbout the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative\n\nAnyone diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a hospital in Ohio since Jan. 1, 2013 is eligible for the study. As part of the study, patients are provided with free screening for Lynch syndrome. If subsequent genetic testing confirms its presence, close relatives can also get free genetic testing (a blood test or a cheek cell sample collected in mouthwash). Patients who do not test positive for Lynch syndrome (and their families) can still participate in the part of the study that assesses their personal risk for colorectal cancer, and develops a customized screening plan. For information call the Clinical Cancer Genetics Program at Ohio State University at 888-329-1654.\n\nBy the end of the year, researchers across the state would like to test the stored tumor samples of 2,000 patients to assess their likelihood of having Lynch syndrome. Eventually they want to screen 4,000 patients and provide genetic testing to 8,000 relatives.\n\n“For every one patient with Lynch syndrome, three relatives have the mutated gene,” said OSU genetic counselor Heather Hampel, the study’s principal investigator.\n\nOnce a patient is identified as having Lynch syndrome, relatives can get genetic testing themselves. First-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the genetic mutation.\n\nFor people with Lynch syndrome, getting colonoscopies and other cancer screenings earlier - and more frequently - can help catch the disease at its earliest stages. Preventive surgery, in people with a very strong family history, may be an option as well.\n\nCleveland Clinic, which has the largest tumor registry in North America for hereditary colorectal cancer, wants to enroll 700 patients. MetroHealth already has enrolled 20 patients in the study and want to add 30 more.\n\nThe gene for Lynch syndrome was first formally identified in the mid-1990s. OSU researchers later discovered how to screen newly diagnosed colon cancer patients by testing a tumor sample.\n\nStudies suggest that about 3 percent of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients carry the genetic mutations. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that all such patients be screened, that’s not happening on a routine basis.\n\nThis graphic illustrates the impact of universal screening for Lynch syndrome\n\nAt the Cleveland Clinic, the routine screening for Lynch syndrome in new colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer patients whose tumors are surgically removed has been in place for several years.\n\n“There are definitely red flags,” said Dr. Matthew Kaladay, a colorectal surgeon at the Clinic. Among the signs: a diagnosis at a younger age, cancer on the right side of the colon, and an extensive family history of the disease are among the signals.\n\n“I hope we’re able to identify people that we hadn’t been able to before,” Kalady said of the study. “That would make a huge impact, especially on family members.”\n\nAs far as the research, he said, it’s a chance to raise a lot of awareness not only in the general public but in the medical community as well.\n\n“This is kind of the way newborn screening is done, to test for common genetic disorders that are actionable,” Hampel said. “A heel stick [test] is done in the hospital. If something comes back abnormal, patients are referred to a genetic counselor in their region.\n\n“Why can’t we mirror this with cancer genetics?” she said. “If this model works, it can be done with cancer.”"", 'Starting this month, Cleveland Clinic, Fairview Hospital, MetroHealth System and Summa Western Reserve Hospital joined the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative.\nAbout the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention InitiativeAnyone diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a hospital in Ohio since Jan. 1, 2013 is eligible for the study.\nAs part of the study, patients are provided with free screening for Lynch syndrome.\nStudies suggest that about 3 percent of newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients carry the genetic mutations.\nThis graphic illustrates the impact of universal screening for Lynch syndromeAt the Cleveland Clinic, the routine screening for Lynch syndrome in new colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer patients whose tumors are surgically removed has been in place for several years.']"

Jonathan Worsey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, it is estimated that about 143,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThere are a variety of causes of CRC and it tends to develop over several years.\n\nIt predominantly affects those over 50, which is why it is so important to begin the screening process once individuals reach that age. Screening can include blood tests, a colonoscopy and other methods.\n\nGenetics can play a large role in determining a patient’s risk level, but CRC also affects those with no family history of the disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Another significant factor thought to play a role in the development of CRC is diet,” said Beiermeister. “It is well established that an individual who ingests a diet that is high in fiber, fruits and vegetables and low in animal fat and red meat will be on average at lower risk for development of CRC. How each of these factors contributes to the development of cancer individually is unknown.”\n\nAdditional factors thought to play a role in the development of CRC include obesity, decreased physical activity and smoking.\n\nThe symptoms of CRC can be minimal, especially during the early stages. That’s why doctors recommend screening start at age 50, as there is often no other way to know if a patient is affected.\n\nThere are some signs that could be a signal, such as rectal pain or bleeding, which are usually an indication that the cancer has advanced. Surgical intervention and chemotherapy will then be administered.\n\nThere is, however, a treatment which seems to be the most effective.\n\n“From a surgical standpoint, the literature has now demonstrated an undeniable advantage to the laparoscopic/minimally invasive approach to both colon and rectal surgery,” said Beiermeister. “At San Diego Colon and Rectal Surgeons, Dr. Worsey and I approach nearly every case, especially elective colon and rectal resections, with a minimally invasive approach.”\n\nRobotic colon and rectal resections are also being introduced in a lot of practices, which have shown great promise and could be instrumental in the treatment of CRC.\n\nThough medical advancements have opened the doors to new possibilities of treatment, doctors stress prevention and early screenings as the best ways to avoid this disease.', 'Colorectal cancer, also known as CRC, occurs when colon or rectum cells become abnormal and cause uncontrolled growth, then form a tumor.\nAdvertisementIn 2013, it is estimated that about 143,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.\nIt predominantly affects those over 50, which is why it is so important to begin the screening process once individuals reach that age.\nThat’s why doctors recommend screening start at age 50, as there is often no other way to know if a patient is affected.\nThough medical advancements have opened the doors to new possibilities of treatment, doctors stress prevention and early screenings as the best ways to avoid this disease.']"

Once a month, patients affected by serious and often rare diseases share their unique stories; the latest comes from cancer survivor Danielle Ripley-Burgess.\n\nI consider myself one of the lucky ones.\n\nA diagnosis of stage III colon cancer at age 17 probably sounds like a pretty tough blow and not lucky at all. Not to mention a second diagnosis of stage I colon cancer at age 25 and subsequent surgeries and hospital stays to combat my genetic disease, Lynch Syndrome.\n\nYet despite the extensive medical record over the past decade, I still consider myself extremely lucky when compared to other survivors.\n\nYou see, I’m not alone in my fight. Although colon and rectal cancer most often appear in those over age 50, it can happen in young people. In fact, it is happening - and those of us diagnosed under age 50 make up the fastest growing demographic to be diagnosed.\n\nScreening recommendations for colon cancer don’t typically apply for those of us still washing our faces with acne cream, going prom-dress shopping or planning our weddings. But when we walk into a doctor’s office with symptoms like severe abdominal pain, cramping, bloating and rectal bleeding, we need to be taken seriously.\n\nA fellow survivor named Meaghan, stage I colon cancer at age 26, initially assumed her bleeding and pain came from past pregnancies. The emergency room staff concurred and offered her pain pills and suggested a high-fiber diet. Not until she returned to urgent care in extreme pain did a CT scan discover her tumor. Another friend, Melissa, knew that “college stress” couldn’t be the only cause of her pain and blood in the stool. Melissa fought tooth-and-nail for a referral, yet doctors wouldn’t send her to a specialist. Luckily, her mom called a gastroenterologist who had a last-minute cancellation. That appointment discovered her stage III rectal cancer at age 20 and saved her life.\n\nI consider myself lucky because unlike many survivors also diagnosed “too young,” I never got the runaround from physicians. I was never told I had irritable bowel syndrome, prescribed antidepressants, instructed to simply change my diet or denied medical exams.\n\nMy gastroenterologist took aggressive steps and sent my 17-year-old behind straight into a colonoscopy the day he learned of my bleeding. I spent only minutes in his office but as soon as the stool test detected blood, he didn’t cut corners.

12087,http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2014/03/11/colon-cancer-prevention-efforts-expanding-in-sc-a-472213.html,health,"['By Joey Holleman, The State (Columbia, S.C.) McClatchy-Tribune Information Services\n\nMarch 11 -- Gary Hemingway twice had been scheduled for colonoscopies. He\'d been prescribed the laxative preparation to use the day before the exam. And then he backed out.\n\n""They just gave me some stuff,"" Hemingway said. ""They didn\'t really explain it all to me.""\n\nThen he ran into Renay Caldwell , who helps patients navigate through the colonoscopy process in her role with the S.C. Colon Cancer Prevention Network. Caldwell, and the network, likely saved Hemingway\'s life. The Columbia resident finally went through with a colonoscopy, a large polyp was found and it was removed before it would almost certainly have become cancerous.\n\nThe even better news is that increased funding and more participation by physicians this year will allow the network to increase the number of free colonoscopies it can provide -- from about 100 per year to 800. Each of those procedures has the potential to send out ripples that will improve the health of many more than the patients checked.\n\n""It\'s advocacy,"" said Dr. Frank Berger , the leader of the network. ""The people who do this are going to their family and friends and telling them. ... So much of (the reluctance) to getting colonoscopies is a social issue. We\'re chipping away at that barrier one patient at a time.""\n\nFor instance, Hemingway now helps the network spread the word about the need for colorectal exams. He has recruited colonoscopy candidates at his church, telling them the process isn\'t a big deal but the results can be life-saving.\n\n""If I hadn\'t run into Renay Caldwell , I wouldn\'t have went,"" Hemingway said. ""I thank the Lord she was there.""\n\nColon cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the country and the second leading cause of cancer death in South Carolina . Yet it\'s preventable with early detection, and removal, of polyps in the colon through colonoscopies.\n\n""The goal with prostate and breast cancer screening is to detect it early to treat and cure it,"" said Dr. March Seabrook , a Columbia gastroenterologist. ""The goal with colon cancer screening is to prevent it.""\n\nThe rule of thumb is for most people to get checked around age 50, though African-American men and those with family history of colon cancer should get checked in their 40s.\n\nWhile South Carolina ranks near the bottom in the number of colon cancer deaths per capita, the state ranks in the middle of the pack in cancer screening rates. About 64 percent of South Carolinians age 50-75 reported having had a colorectal screening test, according to a 2012 accounting by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Massachusetts was No. 1 with 76.3 percent getting tested. Arkansas was worst with 55.7 percent.\n\nOne major problem in South Carolina is that the percentage getting tested is lowest among a group statistically most likely to develop colon cancer -- African-American men. And testing rates are especially low for people without insurance because of the expense of colonoscopies.\n\nThe S.C. Colon Cancer Prevention Network has focused its efforts at those groups.\n\nThis year the network should be especially busy because, after running a pilot screening program for several years thanks to grants from BlueCross BlueShield of SC , others jumped on board to increase funding.\n\nBlueCross came through with another $171,950 , two-year grant for clinical services, the Duke Endowment provided a $450,000 , two-year grant for navigators to help patients through the process and for evaluation of the effort, and the state legislature kicked in $500,000 .\n\nThe network estimates it will be able to provide free colonoscopies for 800 people this year, compared with 550 in the 2008-2013 period. The effort has expanded from two counties to 28.\n\nMost patients are referred from free clinics or federally qualified health centers to gastroenterologists who have volunteered to perform a certain number of the free exams each year. (Their practices are paid the Medicaid rate for the procedure, but the physicians waive their separate fee.)\n\nDespite the procedures being free, many candidates still balked at the opportunity. ""When you give away something, it\'s not appreciated,"" Seabrook said.\n\nThat\'s why navigators such as Caldwell are important. She not only explained the procedure\'s importance to Hemingway, she also sat down with him and watched a video on the subject. She thoroughly detailed the preparation process. She reminded him what needed to be done each step along the way.\n\n""If we get them in the front door, they get it,"" Caldwell said. ""We try to make it a personal experience, not just wham, bam, you\'re done.""\n\nBased on general population statistics, the 800 exams this year will save two or three lives and about $500,000 in medical costs, Berger said. And those savings will be multiplied if more patients follow the lead of Hemingway.\n\n""I talked to one of my friends at church about how important it was,"" Hemingway said. ""I called Ms. Caldwell and gave her his number. And now he\'s scheduled for an exam.""\n\n___\n\n(c)2014 The State (Columbia, S.C.)\n\nVisit The State (Columbia, S.C.) at www.thestate.com\n\nDistributed by MCT Information Services', 'Then he ran into Renay Caldwell , who helps patients navigate through the colonoscopy process in her role with the S.C.

Since then, though, food labels have remained largely unchanged. Now, the FDA is finally giving them a much-needed overhaul, which could encourage the public to eat healthier.\n\nThe main revision to the food labels will be serving sizes. Currently, a package of something can have multiple servings within it. For example, a single muffin may be listed as containing two servings, despite being only one item. While a single serving may be 200 calories, the entire muffin would be 400 calories. This means that there\'s the illusion that the muffin has fewer calories than it actually does.\n\nFurther details are still being debated, according to The Huffington Post. The FDA have released two proposed options for the labels, and will be gathering feedback until late May. Yet once these details are finally settled, food makers will have just two years to updated their labels to comply with the new format.\n\nSo what should we expect? The new label will emphasize calories, added sugar and serving size. It\'s also unlikely to show ""calories from fat,"" since the information doesn\'t have any real relevance to good nutrition, according to SF Gate.\n\nIt looks like the food level changes are also getting support from the Grocery Manufacturers association. In a written statement, the trade group said, ""For 20 years, the Nutrition Facts panel has been an invaluable tool to help consumers build more healthful diets for themselves and their families, and the time is right for an update. We look forward to working with the FDA and other stakeholders as these proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts label make their way through the rule-making process.""\n\nWe\'ll likely see more official announcements in late May, once all of the details have been released. Yet the proposed changes could mean better information for consumers across the United States-and an easier way to choose healthier food options.', 'About 20 years ago, the Food and Drug Administration introduced Nutrition Facts labels for the first time.\nSince then, though, food labels have remained largely unchanged.\nThe main revision to the food labels will be serving sizes.\nThe FDA have released two proposed options for the labels, and will be gathering feedback until late May.\nWe look forward to working with the FDA and other stakeholders as these proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts label make their way through the rule-making process.""']"

These changes reflect the first significant changes in the 20 years since nutrition information was first required to be placed on labels in the form of a Nutrition Facts panel or Supplement Facts panel (changes to include trans fats information were initiated in 2006.) First Lady Michelle Obama and FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, M.D. both trumpeted the updates as important changes that will allow consumers to make healthier food choices.\n\nWhile compliance with regulatory requirements for labeling is always a consideration for companies, class action litigation over labeling issues has become an equal, if not greater, concern for food, beverage, and dietary supplement companies. Consumer activist groups and plaintiff lawyers have increased their focus and attention on labeling claims like “all natural,” to more technical labeling issues such as the names of ingredients and nutrient content claims like “high in calcium.” Accordingly, the process regarding these proposed labeling changes will most assuredly be monitored with great interest, not only by regulatory attorneys and industry companies, but by public interest groups, class action lawyers, and consumers alike.\n\nSome of the proposed changes include:\n\nIn recognition of growing obesity issues, information about the amount of “added sugars” in a food product would be required.\n\nServing sizes would be updated to more accurately reflect the amounts people currently eat. For example, the serving size for beverages would be changed from eight fluid ounces to 12 fluid ounces.\n\nInformation will be presented in “dual column” formats to indicate “per serving” and “per package” calorie and nutrition information for packages that that could be consumed in one or multiple sittings.\n\nRevision of the Daily Values for nutrients like sodium, dietary fiber and Vitamin D will be made to more accurately reflect the recommended intakes.\n\nInformation regarding nutrients such as Vitamin D and potassium would become mandatory, while information on other nutrients that is currently mandatory, such as Vitamin A and Vitamin C, would no longer be mandatory.\n\nCertain elements of the Nutrition Facts panels will be emphasized, including calories, serving sizes and Percent Daily Value.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of the current format for a proper Nutrition Facts panel, in contrast with the proposed Nutrition Facts panel format, is provided below. (While the Supplement Facts panel will also undergo some changes, the proposed changes do not appear to be nearly as dramatic).\n\nThe proposed changes come in the form of two proposed rules. One rule consists of revisions to the language in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 regarding Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts panels, respectively. The other rule will modify the current regulation found at 21 CFR 101.12 regarding the “Recommended Amounts Customarily Consumed” or “RACCs.” Both proposed rules will be open for public comment for an initial ninety-day period from the date of publication, intended for Monday, March 3, 2014. The rules implementing changes, if finalized, will not go into effect until two years after the effective date of the regulations\n\n.', 'Sunday, March 9, 2014The FDA caused quite a stir recently by announcing proposed updates to the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts information required for packaged foods and dietary supplements.\nThese changes reflect the first significant changes in the 20 years since nutrition information was first required to be placed on labels in the form of a Nutrition Facts panel or Supplement Facts panel (changes to include trans fats information were initiated in 2006.)\nA side-by-side comparison of the current format for a proper Nutrition Facts panel, in contrast with the proposed Nutrition Facts panel format, is provided below.\n(While the Supplement Facts panel will also undergo some changes, the proposed changes do not appear to be nearly as dramatic).\nOne rule consists of revisions to the language in 21 CFR 101.9 and 21 CFR 101.36 regarding Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts panels, respectively.']"

It happens when hormones activated during pregnancy weaken the effect of insulin, the hormone that normally allows cells to absorb glucose from the blood.\n\nFactors that can make pregnant women at greater risk of getting gestational diabetes include having a family history of diabetes, having previously had an unexplained miscarriage, being older than 25 when they became pregnant or being overweight before becoming pregnant.\n\nWomen who develop gestational diabetes are usually able to control their blood sugar without harming their baby\'s health. But having gestational diabetes does make women more likely to develop diabetes 5-10 years after giving birth.\n\nThe new study finds that women who get gestational diabetes while pregnant also have an associated risk of atherosclerosis - where the arteries around the heart become clogged by fatty substances. Because atherosclerosis disrupts the flow of blood to and from the heart, this can eventually cause heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases.\n\nStudy tracked women\'s metabolic and heart health over 20 years\n\nIn the study, 898 women aged between 18 and 30, who later had children, were assessed for heart disease risk factors. Over a period of 20 years, the women were periodically tested for diabetes and other metabolic conditions. An average of 12 years after giving birth, the thickness of the walls of their carotid arteries was also measured using ultrasound.\n\nOverall, 13% of the women in the study developed gestational diabetes. On average, the carotid artery walls of these women was 0.023 mm thicker than those of women who did not have gestational diabetes while they were pregnant.\n\nFast facts about gestational diabetes Although some women with gestational diabetes will need to take medicine, most women will not have to take insulin.\n\nDiet and exercise are the best way to manage gestational diabetes.\n\nWomen with gestational diabetes tend to give birth to larger babies, so in some cases a C-section may be needed.\n\nThe thickness of carotid arteries is used by doctors to measure atherosclerosis and predict heart attack and stroke.\n\nThe researchers also took into account other factors that might have influenced the thickness of the women in the study\'s arteries, such as whether the women were obese, or if they had high glucose levels before pregnancy.\n\n""This finding indicates that a history of gestational diabetes may influence development of early atherosclerosis before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases that previously have been linked to heart disease,"" says study lead author Erica P.

The researchers specifically assessed carotid artery wall thickness an average of 12 years after pregnancy.\n\nAfter controlling for number of births, age, race, pre-pregnancy body-mass-index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, insulin, lipids and blood pressure, the researchers found that a history of gestational diabetes could be tied to a thicker carotid artery intima-media. 119 women, who made up 13 percent of the sample, had gestational diabetes. These women had carotid artery intima-media thickness that was on average 0.023 mm larger than women without gestational diabetes. The researchers concluded that the thickness was not caused by obesity. At the end of the study, a total of 13 women suffered from some kind of cardiovascular event. Only one of them was from the gestational diabetes group.\n\n""This finding indicates that a history of gestational diabetes may influence development of early atherosclerosis before the onset of diabetes and metabolic diseases that previously have been linked to heart disease,"" Gunderson said.

It is this DNA integration that leads to HIV infection. However, the infection doesn\'t take place as soon as the virus enters the body. It takes place typically more than six hours after exposure. Researchers suggested that this window can be used by people to protect themselves after exposure to HIV.\n\nIf similar findings are observed in humans, the gel will be a new way for women to protect themselves from HIV infection after intercourse, according to NBC News. Until then, experts suggest large clinical trials would be needed to test any new treatment, and condoms remain the best defense.\n\nAccording to CDC statistics, 1.1 million Americans suffer from HIV/AIDS and among these, 15.8 percent are unaware of their infection. In the United States, the infection is mainly spread through unprotected sex. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) remain the population most profoundly affected by HIV.\n\nAccording to the latest WHO and UNAIDS global estimates, women comprise 50 percent of people living with HIV.\n\nThe study was published in the Science Translational Medicine.', 'An experimental new HIV gel will reportedly protect women from AIDS, even after they\'ve had sex, a new study finds.\nTo measure the effectiveness of the gel, researchers applied it to three monkeys who were exposed to HIV twice a week for seven weeks.\nBy applying the gel three hours after exposure, researchers were able to protect five of the six monkeys from HIV infection.\n""It\'s a promising after-sex vaginal gel to prevent HIV infection,"" Dr Charles Dobard, of the division of HIV/Aids prevention, told BBC News.\nIf similar findings are observed in humans, the gel will be a new way for women to protect themselves from HIV infection after intercourse, according to NBC News.']"

There is also evidence that violence, or the fear of violence undermines access to treatment, care and support services for women living with HIV.\n\nIn efforts to address the complex linkages between violence and HIV, in a statement, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the world to do more, “We must take action to end violence against women and girls and ensure that they have the sexual and reproductive health and rights that they deserve. Violence has a drastic impact on the health of women and children and is inextricably linked to a higher prevalence of HIV. That is why I have made ending violence against women and girls a top priority for the United Nations.”\n\nThe Secretary-General’s call was amplified at the high-level panel Linking HIV, gender equality and sexual and reproductive health and rights as part of the Every Women Every Child initiative, and the post-2015 social justice agenda organized by UNAIDS during the 58th Commission on the Status of Women held in New York. “Not only is violence against women an extreme human rights violation, it also makes women more vulnerable to HIV infection,” said Michel Sidibé, Executive Director of UNAIDS. “Post-2015 is the opportunity to ensure all women and girls reach their full potential, without the threat of violence, risk of HIV infection and violation of their sexual and reproductive rights.”\n\nThe event, chaired jointly by Mr Sidibé and the Executive Director of UN Women Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, encouraged dialogue around the critical need for women-centred efforts to end the AIDS epidemic; the advancement of sexual and reproductive health and rights for women; gender equality and women’s empowerment; and zero tolerance for gender-based violence. “The single most important strategy in dealing with HIV is empowering women and protecting their rights,” said Ms Mlambo-Ngcuka.\n\nPanellists included HRH the Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Ministers of Gender Equality from Ghana, Malawi, Brazil and a representative for young women living with and affected by HIV from Algeria. ""In my region, discrimination is a societal phenomenon. We must continue to act to eliminate discrimination—it’s the key to the end of the AIDS epidemic,” said Fatima Bendida, El Hayet Network of People Living with HIV, Algeria.\n\nThe panellists also elaborated on the importance of addressing stigma and discrimination. They stressed the need to end violence against women for their own health, as well as to prevent new HIV infections. They also emphasized the particular focus needed on young women and girls to ensure they have access to comprehensive sexuality education that all women living with HIV have access to treatment, care and support, within a rights-based and social justice framework.\n\n“It is essential that we achieve universal access to integrated sexual and reproductive health information, education and services, fully addressing HIV, based on gender equality and with zero-tolerance for gender-based violence,” said HRH Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Patron of UNFPA and Member of the High Level Task Force for the International Conference on Population and Development\n\nThe panellists also highlighted poverty as a driver of HIV and sexual and reproductive ill-health and recognised equity in access to services as a key focus for development for women. They also emphasized the continued need to secure funding for the most marginalized in societies.\n\nMs Nancy Mahon, Executive Director of the M·A·C AIDS Fund moderated the event at which Mr Sidibé launched a UNAIDS Advocacy Brief: Unite with women unite against violence and HIV. The brief outlines five core reasons to prevent violence against women; violence against women is a human rights violation; women who experience violence are more likely to acquire HIV; women living with HIV are more likely to be subjected to violence; women most vulnerable to HIV are also most vulnerable to violence; and that violence undermines the HIV response by creating a barrier to accessing services.\n\nThe discussions at the panel event were an important milestone in the ongoing post-2015 debate, underlining the central role women living with HIV need to play in the discussions around the post-2015 debate.', '12 March 201412 March 2014Studies have shown that intimate partner violence can increase the risk of HIV infection by around 50% and that one in three women experience violence by their intimate partner during their lifetime.\nThere is also evidence that violence, or the fear of violence undermines access to treatment, care and support services for women living with HIV.\nViolence has a drastic impact on the health of women and children and is inextricably linked to a higher prevalence of HIV.\nThey stressed the need to end violence against women for their own health, as well as to prevent new HIV infections.\nThe brief outlines five core reasons to prevent violence against women; violence against women is a human rights violation; women who experience violence are more likely to acquire HIV; women living with HIV are more likely to be subjected to violence; women most vulnerable to HIV are also most vulnerable to violence; and that violence undermines the HIV response by creating a barrier to accessing services.']"

The world tour will continue its journey through the five African countries—Algeria, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria—whose national teams have qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\n\nThe event also provided an opportunity to announce Kweku Mandela and Ndaba Mandela as global spokespersons for Protect the Goal. The objectives of the campaign are to use the popularity and convening power of sport to unite the world for the goal of an AIDS-free generation. The campaign also raises awareness and support for UNAIDS’ vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths.\n\n“We are proud to be working with our South African partners in a rapidly evolving environment for mobilizing the global football community against AIDS,” said Dr. Djibril Diallo, Senior Adviser to the Executive Director of UNAIDS.\n\nThe campaign has garnered support from around the world. UNAIDS has signed cooperation agreements with the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), South American Football Association (CONMEBOL), and Asia Football Confederation (AFC).\n\nIn Africa, UNAIDS and partners, including youth leaders, have disseminated HIV prevention messages on large electronic screens to football fans in stadiums and fan zones during games, including the Orange Africa Cup of Nations, Africa’s most prestigious football tournament.\n\nIn Asia, UNAIDS, in cooperation with the Asian Football Confederation and the Asian Development Bank, are engaged in a partnership to enhance awareness of HIV, improve access to HIV prevention and treatment, and work to eliminate HIV-related stigma and discrimination in five pilot countries, Myanmar, Cambodia, Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand.\n\nCONCACAF, the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, has also promoted the campaign in the framework of major sporting events. During the Gold Cup soccer tournament the captains of the national football teams of the United States and Panama pledged to raise awareness of HIV in the football community.\n\nGlobally, an estimated 5.4 million adolescents and young people are living with HIV, and 1.8 million are eligible for HIV treatment. Millions of young people living with HIV do not know they living with the virus, and every day, approximately 2100 adolescents and young people become newly infected, which accounts for 36% of all new HIV infections globally.\n\nAs part of the Protect the Goal Campaign, UNAIDS, TMZF, SDA and Grassroot Soccer, a South African-based, non-profit organization that uses football to educate young people about HIV, will stage a promotional event at the Alexandra Football for Hope Centre on 6 March.
