No.\n\nLeave the man to peacefully mourn as we would anyone who’d lost someone so dear and, instead, let’s celebrate Scott’s independence; her ability to hold her own and steer a fashion empire; her passion to create scintillating fashion showpieces and her modelling heyday, when she was celebrated as the woman with the longest legs in Britain.\n\nIf we remind ourselves of the real reasons the world envied someone who so tragically lost their life way, way before their time, it deems redundant the need to bring to the fore cruel speculations.

On red carpets, the designer towered over her famous boyfriend.\n\nIn 2006, Scott founded her eponymous label, with an initial collection based on the Little Black Dress. She became known for designs that had a vintage feel and bared little skin, such as her famous ""headmistress"" dress — prim, with three-quarter sleeves, but also close-fitting and stylish.\n\nMadonna was one of those who wore Scott\'s designs and called her death ""a horrible and tragic loss.""\n\n""I\'m so upset. I loved L\'Wren\'s work and she was always so generous with me,"" the singer said in a statement released by her publicist.\n\nVogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour called Scott ""a total perfectionist, someone who absolutely embodied everything her marvellous clothes stood for: strength of character combined with a confident and powerful style.""\n\nAnd supermodel Naomi Campbell, a close friend, wrote on WhoSay that Scott was ""the epitome of elegance and femininity yet still had a girlish quality. I will miss her honesty and I will miss her friendship. My heart goes out to Mick and all who loved her and were loved by her.""\n\nThe Associated Press', 'As a teenager, she developed a love of clothes and made her own, according to biographical notes from London Fashion Week.\nIn 2006, Scott founded her eponymous label, with an initial collection based on the Little Black Dress.\nMadonna was one of those who wore Scott\'s designs and called her death ""a horrible and tragic loss.""\nI loved L\'Wren\'s work and she was always so generous with me,"" the singer said in a statement released by her publicist.\nMy heart goes out to Mick and all who loved her and were loved by her.""']"

22739,http://www.ozy.com/c-notes/hard-life-lessons-the-untimely-loss-of-lwren-scott/30418.article,entertainment,"['Because her loss uncovers the unseen side of fashion typically lost in all the glamour: It’s a completely unforgiving business, first and foremost.\n\nThe fashion world was shocked and saddened by the apparent suicide of designer and stylist L’Wren Scott on Monday in her New York home. But almost as astonishing, at least to those looking from the outside in, was the news that her 7-year-old business was deep in the red, owing millions of dollars.\n\nFor fashion insiders, however, this was not altogether surprising.\n\nIt’s extremely difficult to create and maintain high-end fashion collections these days. Glamorous brands — like the one Scott cultivated — often mask a shaky business. For every critical and commercial success like Ralph Lauren or Michael Kors, there are countless others who are unable to survive the considerable challenges the fashion industry presents. And this, coupled with fashion’s seasonal treadmill of public accolades and withering rejection, can cause a great deal of private pain.\n\nScott’s is the third high-profile fashion suicide in six years.\n\nPain that isn’t new to the fashion world.\n\nMarc Jacobs has been frank about his fight with tobacco addiction and drug use. The very public meltdown of John Galliano cost the once-celebrated designer his perch at Dior and the adulation of the fashion press. And Scott’s is the third high-profile fashion suicide in six years. The first was Isabella “Issie” Blow, a stylist and fashion editor who took her own life in 2007. Three years later, designer Alexander McQueen (following the death of his mother, Joyce) hung himself. Three suicides in six years in one industry is not the kind of statistic that makes waves. But for some of us, it feels tremendous.\n\nWhat we’re left with is what we remember of Scott.\n\nOver 6 feet tall, with long dark hair, Scott, 49, was a successful former model and gifted stylist who had dressed the likes of Madonna, Ellen Barkin and first lady Michelle Obama even before she met Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones. She introduced an eponymous fashion line in 2006, and began to attract attention as much for her womanly silhouettes and expensive fabrics as for her relationship with the rock music legend.\n\nIt must’ve been hard to push Scott’s elegant aesthetic beyond this clubby atmosphere.\n\nScott was her own best muse. She believed in classic clothes that emphasized a woman’s figure, both for herself and for her customer. A black, calf-length sheath with a white inset at the neckline and an elegantly sexy, body-hugging look grazing the knee were typical of her designs. More recently, inspired by the work of artist Gustav Klimt, she created her signature sheath in colorful prints of intense blue, orange and yellow.\n\nStill, Scott’s work was not widely known outside of fashion and Hollywood. The collection was carried by precious few retailers, among them the discerning Kirna Zabete and Barneys.\n\nYet even as her brand faced obstacles, she possessed the right sensibilities, introducing categories with the potential for big profit margins like handbags, eyeglasses and fragrance. Just last year, she sought to make her name more recognizable and reach a wider audience by collaborating with Banana Republic to create the Banana Republic L’Wren Scott Collection for holiday selling.\n\nIt had its strengths and weaknesses, and illustrated the tricky business of expanding a luxury brand. Sequined cardigans fit well into the lives of women who expect Banana Republic to provide them with understated, uncomplicated workwear with a smidgen of trendiness. But fitted sheaths, like the ones Scott favored, are unforgiving and difficult for everyday women to wear.\n\nScott had long been ready to go mass. Some time ago she had expressed interest in collaborating with eBay to introduce a line for plus-size women.\n\nStill, Scott’s forays into beauty and handbags were another route she took to grow her business, one that undoubtedly ate up wads of money without a commensurate increase in demand. Her shows were an elite affair, with lunch served to a few hand-picked editors and retailers who got to dine with Jagger.\n\nIt must’ve been hard to push Scott’s elegant aesthetic much farther beyond this clubby atmosphere. The money required to build a luxury brand has reached absurd heights compared with, say, 50 years ago, when designers like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein started their companies.\n\nAnd there’s a certain lightning-in-a-bottle aspect to it. Designers used to hope for a hot item that would catapult them to, if not stardom, then at least to comfortable solvency. Lauren found it in polo shirts; Klein in fragrance and underwear modeled by Marky Mark. For Miuccia Prada, it was a black nylon handbag.\n\nNow, there’s another possibility for success: television. But, again, only a few are lucky. At the same time that the talented Scott was attempting to build her own brand in small, precise steps, Michael Kors was skyrocketing to fame and a level of financial success that now assures the continuation of his luxury business for decades to come after several bumpy years. For the once-bankrupt Kors (who reportedly had debts of $1.4 million at the time) appearing on the Bravo show Project Runway provided the fuel most designer brands need for liftoff and helped attract the deep-pocketed financing necessary for a brand to take flight to sustained growth.\n\nPerhaps it was all too much for the former Louann Bambrough from Utah — who became the glamorous L’Wren Scott — to fit into a world where fantasies are spun from silks and satins, but where an uglier, rougher reality is never far away. She made beautiful, elegant clothes, we must remember. But in the end, the harsh exigencies of the business may have trumped her considerable creativity.', 'The fashion world was shocked and saddened by the apparent suicide of designer and stylist L’Wren Scott on Monday in her New York home.\nGlamorous brands — like the one Scott cultivated — often mask a shaky business.\nScott’s is the third high-profile fashion suicide in six years.\nAnd Scott’s is the third high-profile fashion suicide in six years.\nJust last year, she sought to make her name more recognizable and reach a wider audience by collaborating with Banana Republic to create the Banana Republic L’Wren Scott Collection for holiday selling.']"

The designer was found hanging from a scarf on a doorknob by her assistant at 200 11th Avenue around 10 am and the cause of death is yet to be stated. As the world mourns over the death of the famous fashion designer, L’Wren Scott, here are five things you probably should know in the remembrance of this small town fashionista who made it big!\n\n1. Luann Bambrough\n\nLuann Bambrough is the birth name of L’Wren Scott. She was raised in Roy, Utah spent most of her teenage years poring over fashion magazines and dreaming of a career in Paris. In 1985, just after she turned 18, the frustrated future fashionista changed her name to something not quite so…regional, and set off for Paris.\n\n2. Calvin Klein Shoot\n\nEvery journey begins with a single step. In the case of Scott, it was this Calvin Klein shoot. Almost 30 years ago, Bruce Weber discovered this beauty when he was in Utah and went on to cast her in a Calvin Klein shoot. This set to action the fashion ride for Scott, who was just 18 at the time.\n\n3. Height\n\nL’Wren Scott was obviously famous for her designer clothing, but what set her apart was her height. Scott was a gangly 6’4”. She is known for her tall frame and had already reached a height of 6’ at the age of 12.\n\n4. Paris\n\nAfter the shoot, Scott flew to Paris at 18 without telling her parents. In Paris, she went on to work for Thierry Mugler and Chanel as well as model for such renowned photographers as Guy Bourdin, David Bailey and Jean-Paul Goude. She then returned to LA and even started her own brand in 2006.\n\n5. Sir Mick Jagger\n\nShe was in a relationship with The Rolling Stone singer, Sir Mick Jagger, from the past 13 years. She had been linked romantically to Jagger since 2001 and also designed his costumes for The Rolling Stone’s 50th Anniversary.', 'L’Wren Scott, the 49-year-old designer was found dead on March 17 in her Manhattan apartment.\nAs the world mourns over the death of the famous fashion designer, L’Wren Scott, here are five things you probably should know in the remembrance of this small town fashionista who made it big!\nLuann BambroughLuann Bambrough is the birth name of L’Wren Scott.\nIn the case of Scott, it was this Calvin Klein shoot.\nAlmost 30 years ago, Bruce Weber discovered this beauty when he was in Utah and went on to cast her in a Calvin Klein shoot.']"

You wouldn’t stay with someone for 13 years if it’s not good.\n\n`I always thought they were very happy, I never saw any kind of argument or anything like that, she was always very supportive of him.’\n\nFinancial troubles\n\nMeanwhile, details emerged in Britain about financial troubles that Scott’s eponymous label had been experiencing. Last month, the designer cancelled her London Fashion Week show, due to reported production delays.\n\nAccounts filed by Scott’s LS Fashion Ltd. in London show the company had liabilities that exceeded assets by €4.24 million (Dh21.7 million) as of December 31, 2012.\n\nThe company’s long and short-term debts totalled €6.75 million against assets, capital and reserves of €2.51 million, according to the accounts, which were filed in October.\n\nThat news raised questions about whether Scott’s label, popular on Hollywood red carpets, would now be able to survive. Steven Frumkin, dean of business and technology at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, said that was an open question, but that despite the company’s difficulties, the brand could survive with skillful marketing.\n\nHe said it was crucial that the label also stake a claim to a wide audience, as Scott did in a recent collaboration with Banana Republic, and not just go after the high end of the market. Scott’s designs have been popular with celebrities such as Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Tina Fey, Amy Adams, Nicole Kidman and first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nFuture prospects\n\nProminent fashion writer Robin Givhan noted that with a private company, it’s impossible to know what the future holds. But she suggested that survival could be a challenge for the label, since it was “still quite young in its development and with a very limited audience. It certainly was not a household name.” She added that the fashion line was “based on a particular aesthetic sensibility that was quite personal.”\n\nScott was adopted by a Mormon couple and grew up in small-town Utah. She made her way to Paris after high school where, aided by her 6-foot-3 height (some say it was 6-foot-4) and striking looks, she found work as a model for some prominent photographers.\n\nBut she became more interested in working with clothes than modelling them, and eventually made her name as a top stylist in Los Angeles and a costume designer for films including Ocean’s 13.\n\nIn 2006, Scott founded her label, with an initial collection based on the ‘Little Black Dress’. She became known for designs that had a vintage feel and bared little skin, such as her famous “headmistress” dress — prim, with three-quarter sleeves, but also close-fitting and stylish.', 'Mick Jagger paid poignant tribute to his late companion, designer L’Wren Scott, on Tuesday, calling her his “lover and best friend” and saying he was struggling to understand why she might have taken her own life.\nJagger posted the message on his Facebook page as the Rolling Stones cancelled their seven-date tour of Australia and New Zealand, 14 on Fire, in the wake of Scott’s death.\nThe noted fashion designer was found dead on Monday in her Manhattan apartment, an apparent suicide.\n“I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way,” Jagger wrote.\nThat news raised questions about whether Scott’s label, popular on Hollywood red carpets, would now be able to survive.']"

""Absolutely nothing could happen until after the AFL season."" With the oval in high demand at weekends by the city\'s two AFL teams, a mid-week show would be impossible, Mr Daniels said, because of the eight days required to build and then dismantle the stage and facilities. This raises the possibility of transferring the Adelaide shows indoors but for the 51,000 ticket-holders to be accommodated indoors would require at least two and maybe three nights and that may be too difficult to manage. Then there is the reported $450,000 contribution by the South Australian government for the concert to be specifically held at the cricket ground, a sum which an incoming government may demand be repaid.\n\nSo if the show stays outside the next issue is the weather, with Mr Daniels adding that “we wouldn\'t normally stage a big outdoor show in winter"", a similar sentiment to that expressed by the Macedon Ranges shire council, responsible for the tour\'s other outdoor show, at Hanging Rock in Victoria.

Bookings listed for Sydney\'s Allphones Arena, Melbourne\'s Rod Laver Arena and both the Perth and Brisbane entertainment centres show that while May is reasonably busy for concerts and special events, June, July and August have large swathes of open dates at all the centres. A return in late September, October or into November, however, will see the Stones clash with major national tours by Robbie Williams, Justin Timberlake and Katy Perry, all of whom will be playing the same rooms.\n\nLoading Promoter AJ Maddah, who recently toured the Big Day Out festival across Australia, said the “nightmare” scenario of multi-million dollar expense was because “we are talking venues that were set up, production that would be in trucks and in motion around the country, crew flights, accommodation, dozens of vehicles and drivers in each city, catering companies in various stages of setting up and pre-production… right down to thousands and thousands of T-shirts printed with cancelled dates on the back”. So far ticket-holders have been advised to keep a hold of their tickets and await new dates or new arrangements.

Schulz, a producer on the film, says the movie is “about a round-headed kid and his dog, and that’s about as far as I’m willing to go.”\n\nUSA Today had some details about the new movie, such as Snoopy won’t talk; Charlie Brown’s skating pound, house and “the wall” won’t be updated; and some modern details will be added to make the film current.\n\n“Snoopy will not be rapping, no one will be twerking, we’re in good hands,” producer Paul Feig said.\n\n“We handle it very respectfully,” Schulz said. “We knew we wanted this movie to be bigger than any kind of TV special.

Beginning life as a one-panel newspaper strip in the late-1940s, Charles Schulz’s life’s work has epitomized the precociously tortured souls of generations of children, and served as a nostalgic talisman for many of the adults they went on to become. The anti-commercialism holiday special, A Charlie Brown Christmas, took a brave stance toward perhaps the most beloved American tradition, and its message reverberates to this day. Considering how Schulz reportedly stipulated in his will that the Peanuts characters remain as authentic as possible and that no new comics be drawn based on them, it is a distinctly mixed bag to see that new Peanuts action is headed to theaters in a glossy CGI cartoon movie.\n\n\n\n\n\nA new teaser that premiered online late on March 17th offers us a glimpse at how our noble, lovable not-quite-winner and his dog will appear in next year’s feature film.

Producer Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, The Office) and director Steve Martino (Ice Age: Continental Drift) seem well aware of the risk, as the first teaser trailer shows off a style that’s definitely shooting for a hybrid of 3D CGI and hand-drawn style.\n\nThe result, funny enough, actually looks a little bit like stop motion, with a herky-jerky-ness to Charlie Brown’s motions that remind a bit of The LEGO Movie, another recent animated pic that actually was looking for a stop motion style. Some stylistic flourishes call back to the property’s newspaper origins, like Snoopy’s waving arms and legs being represented by scribbled lines or dizzy circles which surround Charlie Brown’s head. It’s still weird to see the characters on such a bright color palette, but the trailer ought to give fans hope that Peanuts will be properly represented in a visual sense.\n\nAs for story, nothing has been released so far. The project was first announced last October, but with release not planned until the end of 2015, it could be a while before we get any details.

We have 12 more artists taking the stage tonight, but after we take a look at them work with their coaches and their mentors. Who is your favorite mentor this season? Let’s get it started!\n\nTeam Shakira: Clarissa Serna vs Jeremy Briggs\n\nSong: “Cold As Ice” by Foreigner\n\nClarissa is hoping success on this show will help inspire the girls she mentors. Jeremy has been waiting for his music to take center stage and this is his opportunity. Shakira paired them together because they are her rockers. Miranda Lambert said it is straight up rock and roll. Jeremy seems strong, but Clarissa seems to be holding back and nervous during rehearsals. They are having some issues mending and harmonizing and they think that could hurt both of them. They both do a good job, but this song choice seemed like a better fit for Jeremy and his voice. The coaches all loved Clarissa and her big voice.\n\nWinner: Clarissa Serna and no steals for Jeremy, so he is headed home!\n\nTeam Adam: Caleb Elder vs Delvin Choice\n\nSong: “The Man” by Aloe Blacc\n\nCaleb was hoping to leave his job at the donut shop and do gigs every night! Delvin works as a barista and did not get any chairs to turn around last season, but they told him to be more emotional during performances and it worked for The Voice USA 2014! Adam Levine said these two artists are as different as they can be, but it comes down to who wants it more. They come back to their second rehearsal and Adam said it is not good and they are missing it. Adam and Aloe put them through a test and rapping the lyrics and they get it and improve by the end of rehearsals. This is another one of those song choices that fits one of the singers really well, as Delvin shined on this one for me. Caleb was not made for this song and I loved his audition, so I was disappointed with this for him.\n\nWinner: Delvin Choice and no steals for Caleb, so he is eliminated on The Voice USA 2014 tonight!\n\nQuick Results:\n\nTeam Blake – Megan Ruger defeated Ria Eaton , no steals\n\ndefeated , no steals\n\nTeam Shakira – Ddendyl defeated Lindsay Pagano , no steals\n\ndefeated , no steals\n\nTeam Usher – Morgan Wallen defeated Brothers Walker, no steals\n\nTeam Usher: Brittnee Camelle vs Melissa Jimenez\n\nSong: “Give It To Me Right” by Melanie Fiona\n\nBrittnee risked her scholarship for this opportunity and if she makes the show then she loses it! Melissa has worked with her Dad and his band, but she wants to really be a solo artist. Usher put these two together because they have powerful voices to go against each other. Jill Scott said Brittnee has an amazing voice, but when she watches her she has this attitude in her face and needs to let that go. Usher said they have evened themselves out heading into the battle and it could turn into a cat fight! They both work it out on that stage and Melissa started so strong and thought she had it hands down, but Brittnee comes back strong and this is going to either way!\n\nWinner: Melissa Jimenez and Adam and Shakira want to steal Brittnee away, but Brittnee picks Team Adam!\n\nThe Battles are done for tonight on The Voice USA 2014!

She decided to go with Adam, whose team she\'ll be on for the rest of the season.

It started with a classic rock duet that didn’t rock as hard as it should and a lopsided contest in which one singer clearly outdid the other.\n\nBy the end of the night, seven more singers had moved on to knockout rounds, including one steal.\n\nHere’s a look at how it played out.\n\nClarissa Serna and Jeremy Briggs, Team Shakira: Clarissa was described as a pop rocker who had turned four chairs; Jeremy as a classic rocker who turned two, but the advantage wasn’t necessarily Clarissa’s. Shakira chose Foreigner’s “Cold as Ice” for their battle song, which Jeremy said he’d grown up listening to. In rehearsal, Jeremy and Clarissa got pointers from Shakira and Miranda Lambert about performing together rather than screaming over each other, but perhaps they dialled it back too much. True, Jeremy could sing really high for a guy, but I wanted him to dirty the whole thing up more. Clarissa showed she can really blast out the notes, but she got a bit too fancy with them for my taste: fewer runs, more raunch, please. Adam Levine correctly noted that “the end of it was the best part.” Shakira picked Clarissa, although she called her “Clarice.” It’s not a good sign when you can’t remember the name of your battle winner. There was no steal for Jeremy.\n\nCaleb Elder and Delvin Choice, Team Adam: This was one of those battles where you could see the outcome a mile away. Caleb was the final pick of the blind auditions and filled the last spot on Levine’s team. Delvin, a returning contestant, turned four chairs. But beyond that, Delvin had a lot of substance to his voice whereas Caleb’s was a little thin once you got beyond what Levine and Aloe Blacc called his gravel and rasp. Still, both singers had trouble grasping the rhythm and phrasing of Blacc’s song “The Man” in rehearsals. On battle night, Delvin’s voice, with its deep notes, its fullness and its lovely vibrato, carried more weight. Unsurprisingly, Levine picked Delvin, telling Caleb he had “a great quality to your voice that does need to mature.” There was no steal, but one thing that didn’t need to mature was Caleb’s attitude. “I go home happy at the end of the day no matter what happens,” said the 19-year-old. “I had a good time rubbing elbows with some of the best singers in the country. I take back more than I ever dreamed of.”\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nThe blink and you miss them battles: Alas, six singers got very little air time as clips of three battles were jammed into a segment of less than a minute and a half. Whether that means they’re being set up as knockout round fodder remains to be seen. Blake Shelton picked Megan Ruger over Ria Eaton. Shakira picked Ddendyl over Lindsay Pagano. And Usher picked Morgan Wallen over Brothers Walker. The only one that really stood out for me in the montage was Morgan.\n\nBrittnee Camelle and Melissa Jimenez, Team Usher: Usher said he chose Melanie Fiona’s “Give It to Me Right” to “show the aggressor in both Melissa and Brittnee.” Also, since this is a TV show, there was the visual appeal of having two attractive young women sing a song about not being satisfied sexually in midriff-baring tops, tossing their long, flowing locks in sexy poses. Still, these were no pop tarts. Both women unleashed some big vocal fire power. Brittnee was more of a belter; Melissa could hit higher high notes. And both sang with a lot of confidence. Shakira declared the battle “smoking hot” and Levine said, “The only thing you didn’t do was punch each other in the face with boxing gloves.” There was no need to get that competitive, it turned out. Usher said he wanted to keep both of them and chose Melissa, but Levine and Shakira fought to steal Brittnee. Shakira said, “I understand female pop singers because I am one of them.” Levine said, “I’m much more interested in finish lines, really, and I enjoy crossing them and I actually have, twice on this show.” That was good enough for Brittnee. “It’s hard to fight for a female singer when you have the sexiest man alive up here sitting next to you,” said Shakira. “There’s nothing I can do.”\n\nThat’s it until next week when the battle rounds continue, Monday at 8 p.m. on CTV Two.\n\nYou can comment here, email me at dyeo@thestar.ca , tweet me @realityeo or visit my Facebook page.', 'On battle night, Delvin’s voice, with its deep notes, its fullness and its lovely vibrato, carried more weight.\nUnsurprisingly, Levine picked Delvin, telling Caleb he had “a great quality to your voice that does need to mature.” There was no steal, but one thing that didn’t need to mature was Caleb’s attitude.\nShakira picked Ddendyl over Lindsay Pagano.\nAnd Usher picked Morgan Wallen over Brothers Walker.\nUsher said he wanted to keep both of them and chose Melissa, but Levine and Shakira fought to steal Brittnee.']"

Their task: Foreigner\'s ""Cold as Ice.""\n\nJeremy\'s effortless knack for the song had Clarissa nervous, but she took to heart Shakira\'s and mentor Miranda Lambert\'s instruction to connect with the song emotionally and project confidence, ""a quintessential ingredient of rock and roll,"" as Shakira explained. Miranda Lambert, meanwhile, cautioned both singers to focus on building chemistry. ""If you don\'t make it a performance together, you both end up looking bad,"" she warned.\n\nBut their electric performance certainly wasn\'t lacking in chemistry. The two rockers complemented each other perfectly, Shakira said; Adam and Blake picked Clarissa as the battle\'s winner, while Usher handed it to Jeremy ""for the effort and tenacity to take it on."" Shakira sided with Blake and Adam, though, and named Clarissa the winner of the battle.\n\n""The Voice"": Greatest Moments\n\nNext, two very different soul singers from Team Adam -- Delvin Choice, a Starbucks barista, and Caleb Elder, a doughnut shop worker -- were tasked with tackling their mentor Aloe Blacc\'s own song ""The Man.""\n\nDelvin admitted that the tough song assignment required him to rethink his usual approach to singing. ""The beauty is in the simplicity of the song,"" he admitted. Still, the pair struggled in rehearsals; as Adam worried their performance would become overwhelmed by a focus on style, he had Delvin and Caleb go back to basics and rap the song\'s lyrics to get a sense of their rhythm.\n\nOnstage, though, Delvin appeared to have bested some of their struggles in rehearsals, singing confidently and wowing the coaches with his rich, deep vocals. Caleb\'s nerves took a toll on his performance, though, and he sounded out of breath as he sang. Indeed, though both struggled, Adam chose Delvin to remain on his team. ""Delvin has this looming voice that\'s just captivating,"" he explained.\n\nNext came a bevy of battles that, fast forward-style, flew by without much fanfare. First, Team Blake\'s Megan Ruger ousted Ria Eaton on Avril Lavigne\'s ""My Happy Ending."" Then, Ddendyl won her battle with Lindsay Pagano on Carole King\'s ""I Feel the Earth Move"" to remain on Team Shakira. And then, Morgan Waller managed to best not just one opponent but two, as he beat out the season\'s lone duo the Brothers Walker for the chance to stay on Team Usher.\n\nThe night\'s final battle was another between two members of Team Usher -- this time, two of his most belt-worthy powerhouse divas, nursing student Brittnee Camelle and R&B singer Melissa Jimenez, whom he paired on Melanie Fiona\'s ""Give It to Me Right.""\n\nThe singers each had their own challenges in rehearsals. Mentor Jill Scott advised Brittnee to work on communicating emotion not just in her voice but in her face as well, and to work on dropping the attitude from her act. She also cautioned the women not to step on each other\'s toes.\n\nBut the women may not have taken that latter advice to heart, given the desperation, drama and fireworks of their performances as they stalked the stage in a battle Usher called ""epic."" The coaches praised Brittnee\'s strong, consistent vocals and Melissa\'s big note toward the end, and Usher declared Melissa the winner of the battle.\n\nCue the steal.\n\nBoth Adam and Shakira slammed on their button in an effort to grab Brittnee for their own teams. But Shakira, the only one of the pair to have turned her chair for Brittnee at blind auditions, turned out to be a two-time loser. All it took was for Adam to remind Brittnee of his past ""Voice"" wins, and she chose him as her coach.\n\nBattle rounds will resume next week on ""The Voice,"" before the contestants still left head on to the knockouts.\n\n""The Voice"" airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8/7c.', 'Shakira sided with Blake and Adam, though, and named Clarissa the winner of the battle.\nThen, Ddendyl won her battle with Lindsay Pagano on Carole King\'s ""I Feel the Earth Move"" to remain on Team Shakira.\nAnd then, Morgan Waller managed to best not just one opponent but two, as he beat out the season\'s lone duo the Brothers Walker for the chance to stay on Team Usher.\nAll it took was for Adam to remind Brittnee of his past ""Voice"" wins, and she chose him as her coach.\nBattle rounds will resume next week on ""The Voice,"" before the contestants still left head on to the knockouts.']"

They were all up in each other\'s faces, singing their own faces off, chewing each other\'s faces off, etc. They almost seemed that they didn\'t like each other at all. But I sure liked this battle. It was all very ""Rock of Ages,"" meaning it was awesomely over-the-top. Jeremy was a perfectly passable rock singer, but I was loving the Taylor Dayne realness that Clarissa was serving. Shakira totally made the right decision here.\n\nWINNER: Clarissa Serna\n\nTEAM ADAM: Caleb Elder vs. Delvin Choice\n\nIt was the donut shop worker vs. the Starbucks barista, and this pairing left a bad taste in my mouth. Why? Because ONCE AGAIN, Adam Levine pitted two of his best contestants against each other. Why does Adam always do this? Caleb and Delvin were two of my Team Adam favorites. To be honest, though, both of them disappointed me in this battle — and they probably disappointed their guest mentor, Aloe Blacc, whose song ""The Man"" they sort of ruined. The song was way too challenging for either of them, and they noticeably struggled to power through it. Delvin struggled much less, however, so he prevailed. If Caleb had been more able to hold his own, there may have been a Steal with his name on it, but his performance was full of holes, so to speak. So it was back to the donut shop for Caleb.\n\nWINNER: Delvin Choice\n\nTEAM BLAKE: Megan Rüger vs. Ria Eaton\n\nBoooooo: Another pair of great singers forced to compete against either. Double boooooo: And they were part of a montage, so we didn\'t even get to see their full battle of Avril Lavigne\'s ""My Happy Ending."" Ria, who I thought had a lot of promise, went home. Maybe if we\'d seen all of this performance, we\'d have a better idea of what went wrong for her. I like Megan, but I was not happy with this ending.\n\nWINNER: Megan Rüger\n\nTEAM SHAKIRA: Ddendyl vs. Lindsay Pagano\n\nDdendyl made a big impression on me in the Blind Auditions. Lindsay I barely remembered, except for the fact that her name sounded like Season 2\'s Lindsay Pavao but she was not nearly as cool. On Tuesday, these two sang a few montaged seconds of ""I Feel the Earth Move"" and I was mostly unmoved, but based on their past performances, I\'ll say Shakira made the right decision by keeping Ddendyl.\n\nWINNER: Ddendyl\n\nTEAM BLAKE: The Brothers Walker vs. Morgan Wallen\n\nThis one hurt my soul. Really? Two of my favorite contestants in all of Season 6, sparring in the ring together? And no one steals the Walkers? And they get montaged, so the Brothers don\'t even get a proper goodbye? Come on, NBC, you know this was not right. Over the three hours of ""Voice"" programming this week, we saw only about 15 minutes of actual singing. Surely there was some wiggle room to give the Brothers Walker the screentime they deserved.\n\nWINNER: Morgan Wallen\n\nHere\'s some behind-the-scenes Brothers Walker video to ease your pain:\n\nTEAM USHER: Brittnee Camelle vs. Melissa Jimenez\n\nThis was a diva battle royale: two powerhouses, guest-mentored by Jill Scott, talking Melanie Fiona\'s ""Give It to Me Right"" to church. There was no denying the talent of both ladies, but I thought it was Brittnee who owned this performance. Brittnee may not have hit that a big glory note at the end, like Melissa did, but she had such stage presence that Melissa all but disappeared for me. And I thought Melissa\'s ""astonishing"" wailing at the end of the song was just plain showing off, anyway. (Even Blake said it was an act of ""desperation,"" although he oddly acted as if that were a good thing.) That big show-off note was enough to impress Usher, though, so he went with Melissa. But just when I was about to get all worked up all over again, both Adam and Shakira went in for the Steal. Phew. Brittnee, wanting to win, of course, signed up with the coach with the proven track record — Adam, of course. Let\'s just hope for her sake that Adam doesn\'t put her up against one of his frontrunners in the Knockout Rounds. But…he probably will.\n\nWINNER: Melissa Jimenez\n\nSTEAL: Brittnee Camelle moves to Team Adam\n\nJoin us next Monday, when the battles rage on…and I\'ll probably rage a bit as well.

How did they do that? By compressing three of the battles into a quick montage. That meant some singers got a very few moments in the spotlight indeed – but it left time to tell other stories more fully.\n\nHere’s how it broke down, as judges Shakira, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Usher continued the work of whittling down their teams:\n\nCary Laine: Nope. The longtime coastal Alabama singer, now based in Wyoming, did not make an appearance.\n\nThe battles: Clarissa Serna over Jeremy Briggs (Shakira), Delvin Choice over Caleb Elder (Levine), Megan Ruger over Ria Eaton (Shelton), Ddendyl over Lindsay Pagano (Shakira), Morgan Wallen over th eBrothers Walker (Usher), Melissa Jimenez over Brittnee Camelle (Usher).\n\nSteals: Nobody got a nibble until the last round of the night, when both Shakira and Levine wanted Brittnee Camelle. She went with Levine. Here\'s a look at the duel between Jimenez and Camelle:\n\nWho\'s torturing those cats? The worst rehearsal moment of the night came during Serna and Briggs\' practice sessions on ""Cold as Ice."" Let\'s just say the duet chemistry wasn\'t there, at first. The look on Shakira\'s face suggested she\'d just walked into a room where a skunk had exploded. After some calm words from assistant coach Miranda Lambert, Shakira said, ""Let\'s do this one more time, and this time let\'s sing. Don\'t scream."" Ouch. But the two showed considerable improvement.\n\nD\'oh! Before they went onstage, the competitors sometimes get to share a few words about their mindset or motivation. Briggs said, ""I don\'t want to go back to working for the unemployment office. This is my dream."" Then he got his wake-up call. That\'s going to be slightly awkward, back at the office.\n\nBest musical moment: As Delvin Choice and Caleb Elder struggled with Aloe Blacc\'s ""The Man,"" Adam Levine took them to school, commanding them to perform the song as a rap. With Blacc on hand as Levine\'s assistant coach, they stripped the tune down to words, handclaps and a little bit of beatboxing. Their understanding and command of the song immediately strengthened. ""I come from a hip-hop background, I\'m an MC,"" said Blacc. ""I think it\'s super-important to learn the rhythm of the lyrics, and then you can add melody on top.""\n\nBest thing said by Shakira: The Colombian singer\'s accent often perks up her fellow judges\' ears, and on Tuesday her pronunciation of ""Herculean"" sent them into conniptions. ""I just wanted to say how remarkable it is that Shakira speaks English as her second language, and she speaks it better than Blake Shelton does,"" said Levine. Retorted Shelton: ""I speak Oklahoman. I don\'t speak English.""\n\nNext episode: ""The Voice"" airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m. Central time on NBC.', 'Here’s how it broke down, as judges Shakira, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Usher continued the work of whittling down their teams:Cary Laine: Nope.\nThe battles: Clarissa Serna over Jeremy Briggs (Shakira), Delvin Choice over Caleb Elder (Levine), Megan Ruger over Ria Eaton (Shelton), Ddendyl over Lindsay Pagano (Shakira), Morgan Wallen over th eBrothers Walker (Usher), Melissa Jimenez over Brittnee Camelle (Usher).\nSteals: Nobody got a nibble until the last round of the night, when both Shakira and Levine wanted Brittnee Camelle.\nAfter some calm words from assistant coach Miranda Lambert, Shakira said, ""Let\'s do this one more time, and this time let\'s sing.\nBest thing said by Shakira: The Colombian singer\'s accent often perks up her fellow judges\' ears, and on Tuesday her pronunciation of ""Herculean"" sent them into conniptions.']"

It also involves a new twist to “The Voice” that is going to bring forth more and more of the famous battles.\n\nSources confirm that Martin is going to appear in what is the latest twist for the show: A second round of battles, which may be replacing the Knockout Rounds starting at the end of the month. Martin will be the guest adviser to all of the coaches, and help to advise the remaining contestants on how to move forward. He definitely knows a thing or two about success in the music industry; Coldplay has sold millions around the world, and his touring earnings but even some of the coaches on the show to shame worldwide. He’s also married to a Hollywood superstar, and has perfectly balanced out the art of being relatable while still coming across as huge, unobtainable rock star.\n\nThere is a little bit of happenstance in Martin’s decision to appear now, as Coldplay is starting to get closer to releasing some new music. He needs to be in the spotlight a little bit more, and this is one of the best ways for him to do that … even more so than “American Idol.” (Hey, they already have Randy Jackson as a mentor there … good luck with that.)\n\n“The Voice” will air its next new episode of the standard battle rounds on Monday night, and for now, click here to read some more news and reviews related to the show.

For the first time, the remaining contestants will again be paired off to perform the same song in a sudden-death match, beginning March 31.\n\nThe stage replaces the knockout round that had two singers each performing a song of their choice, which had been an early indicator to mentors of a contestant\'s ability to plan their own show-stopping performance, as well as how well a singer can handle sudden pressure, as they were matched up on the spot. Still, in the new battle rounds, each coach will be allowed one steal.\n\nMartin is set to appear on the March 31, April 1 and April 7 episodes, according to USA Today. He is the latest big name to lend his expertise to The Voice -- current guest mentors are Miranda Lambert, Aloe Blacc, Jill Scott and The Band Perry, while Ryan Tedder signed on as in-house songwriter last year. Martin was also one of the leading names to replace Keith Urban on The Voice Australia, after the country singer went stateside to join American Idol\'s panel of judges.\n\nThe battles reboot seems to be season\'s shift in the show format, as season five introduced the Twitter #InstantSave that lets Twitter users save a singer from elimination each week; season four introduced new coaches Usher and Shakira to rotate in for Cee Lo Green and Christina Aguilera; and season three introduced the now-defunct knockout round.\n\nThe latest change was almost mentioned weeks ago by executive producer Mark Burnett, host Carson Daly and mentor Usher at a special Voice screening in New York City. The three teased that something new may be happening within the format this season. (Usher asked if they could talk about it; Burnett and Daly said no).\n\nPHOTOS: \'The Voice\' Finalists and Favorites: Where Are They Now?\n\n""Every season, we do reserve the right to look back and say, how do we tweak this show to keep what\'s important -- authentic music and the highest level on talent -- onscreen, with four of the biggest people in music?"" said Daly at the event.

While a couple artists were sent home, a couple were stolen with the last performance of the evening resulting in a steal for Team Adam. Who goes head-to-head tonight as battle round 1 continues and who moves forward with their team? Who goes home and who is stolen? This is what is happening on The Voice~\n\nThe first battle is between Clarissa Serna from Corpus Christi, Texas and Jeremy Briggs from Sacramento, California of Team Shakira. She has enlisted the professional advice and assistant in training from Miranda Lambert, a secret weapon to winning against husband, Blake Shelton. It is a rock showdown and the song chosen for this battle is “Cold As Ice” by Foreigner. Comments include punctuating lines and holding notes but they are not harmonizing and before the battle, practice sounds really flat and forced. Who remains on Team Shakira? The interplay between the two on stage is daunting; the vocals on point. Well placed punctuations making each stand out when necessary. Great battle! Tough decision for the coach…who does she choose? Usher for Jeremy; Adam and Blake for Clarissa. Team Shakira retains Clarissa leaving Jeremy up for a steal. He is not saved and heads back to California.\n\nThe next vocal battle to enter the ring is from Team Adam between Caleb Elder from Appomattox, Virginia and Delvin Choice from Greenville, South Carolina. Adam Levine has enlisted the assistant of Aloe Blacc whose song, “The Man,” is chosen for this battle. The two voices are different but each with unique qualities…power versus rasp. These two singers struggle with the melodic phrasing – rhythms and punctuations off – so they are given a lesson in rapping. Problem solved but does it continue to play out on the stage in front of an audience? Performance is a little force and pitchy in places especially on the part of Caleb. All the coaches believe they looked as though they were having fun and even though they felt Caleb has uniqueness to offer but it is Delvin who remains with Team Adam. Caleb, like Jeremy, is heading back home.\n\nTeam Blake pairs Megan Ruger from Nashville, Tennessee with Ria Eaton from Massachusetts to sing “My Happy Ending” by Avril Lavigne. Blake chooses Megan Ruger to move on with Team Blake. Team Shakira has Ddendyl face off against Lindsay Pagano singing “I Feel the Earth Move” by Carole King with Ddendyl clearly outperforming Pagano and moving on with her team. Team Usher found the battle between the Brothers Walker and Morgan Wallen who sing “Hey Brother” by Avicii as decision a little difficult to arrive at but in the end it was Morgan moving into the next round with Team Usher.\n\nTeam Usher is up next with the battle pair of Brittnee Camelle from Lawrenceville, Georgia and Melissa Jimenez from Fort Lee, New Jersey. Usher has chosen Jill Scoot as his advisor and assistant coach to bounce thoughts off of. The song selected is “Give It to Me Right” by Melanie Fiona. Scott tells Brittnee to let down her guard and tell the story without attitude. Will they step on one another on stage? The two powerhouse vocalists hit the stage with one of the most punchy performances…great battle filled with wonderful vocals and the right touch of attitude. Outstanding last note! Who will Usher choose? Melissa Jimenez remains with Team Usher but Brittnee is not let go as Adam Levine and Shakira battle for her to come to their teams. Blake reminds Brittnee that Shakira originally wanted her during blind auditions. She chooses to go with Team Adam.\n\nImage courtesy of NBC', 'While a couple artists were sent home, a couple were stolen with the last performance of the evening resulting in a steal for Team Adam.\nWho remains on Team Shakira?\nTeam Blake pairs Megan Ruger from Nashville, Tennessee with Ria Eaton from Massachusetts to sing “My Happy Ending” by Avril Lavigne.\nBlake chooses Megan Ruger to move on with Team Blake.\nMelissa Jimenez remains with Team Usher but Brittnee is not let go as Adam Levine and Shakira battle for her to come to their teams.']"

Each battle saw two teammates performing a duet assigned by their coach, with only one advancing in the competition. However, each coach has two ""steals"" they can use to save a contestant.\n\nDuring rehearsals, the artists received help from guest advisers. ""Wake Me Up"" singer Aloe Blacc was a tutor for Adam Levine\'s team; The Band Perry assisted Blake Shelton\'s protégés; Blake\'s wife, Miranda Lambert, worked with Shakira\'s crew; and R&B diva Jill Scott advised Usher\'s team.\n\nHere\'s what happened on Monday night\'s two-hour episode:\n\nThe first battle featured two artists from Team Usher, Biff Gore and T.J. Wilkins. They sang The Temptations classic ""Ain\'t Too Proud To Beg."" Adam and Blake both noticed how much Biff and T.J. enjoyed themselves on stage. Usher said it was a difficult decision to make because both artists were technically sound. He declared T.J. to be the winner. Biff was subsequently saved by Blake.\n\nNext up were two 17-year-olds from Team Blake: Jake Worthington and Lexi Luca, who were instructed to perform ""It Goes Like This,"" by country musician Thomas Rhett. Usher said he could tell that Lexi was nervous, adding that Jake showed more confidence. Blake pointed out the tears in Lexi\'s eyes, and noted that Jake fumbled the lyrics a couple of times. Blake went with his gut and picked Jake. Lexi was eliminated.\n\nTeam Shakira\'s Dani Moz and DeShawn Washington were pit against one another. They were given ""My Kind of Love,"" by Emeli Sandé. Shakira admitted after the performance that she regretted pairing Dani and DeShawn. Dani was named the winner. DeShawn is gone from the show.\n\nKat Perkins and Patrick Thompson battled for the right to remain on Adam\'s team. They joined forces on the Kenny Loggins/ Stevie Nicks duet ""Whenever I Call You \'Friend.\'"" Blake felt Kat hit the notes more easily. Adam sided with Kat, too, saying she has a presence about her. Just as Patrick was ready to walk off the stage, Shakira swooped in and stole him.\n\nBlake paired two powerful singers: Paula DeAnda, who once toured with Rihanna, and Sisaundra Lewis, a former vocal director for Celine Dion. They took on Lady Gaga\'s ARTPOP single ""Do What U Want."" Usher said both women pushed each other vocally, though he detected some pitch issues by Paula toward the end. Blake said he was proud of both of them. Sisaundra is moving on in the competition. Paula was sent home.\n\nTeam Usher\'s Jake Barker and Stevie Jo entered the spotlight for the final battle of the night. They traded lyrics on Steve Winwood\'s ""Higher Love."" Adam assured them that whoever loses the battle would be saved by him afterward. Usher said it was a very hard decision for him, but he selected Stevie Jo. Adam, Shakira and Blake all made a bid to save Jake. Jake chose Adam.\n\nThe battle rounds continue Tuesday night on NBC at 8 p.m. Eastern time.', '(Photo: Tyler Golden/NBC)Following weeks of blind auditions, The Voice launched its battle rounds on Monday night.\nHere\'s what happened on Monday night\'s two-hour episode:The first battle featured two artists from Team Usher, Biff Gore and T.J.

Delvin says it’s scary yet motivating to do the song for him; Adam says that both of them are so different and likes Delvin’s power and Caleb’s emotion is great in his voice.

As of Wednesday morning, a version posted March 7 on YouTube had been viewed more than 460,000 times. And it’s prompted requests for TV appearances.\n\nThe cellphone video was recorded by Edward Bone, whose daughter is among the choir’s third to eighth grade students.\n\n“Really, it was just me being proud of my daughter … and wanting people to see what a good job they’re doing,” Bone said. “It’s like the song says, happy. I’m happy to be a proud parent of one of the students.”\n\nChoir director Angela Kee said the video was made after a producer for NBC’s “America’s Got Talent” requested a recording. The students helped create the choreography and Kee said she’s “tickled and pleased and amazed” by the positive response.\n\n“I picked the song because it is a favorite of the children,” she said. “It’s catchy.

The proud dad wanted to share daughter Aisha Newsome\'s solo during a gospel-style performance of ""Happy,"" the No. 1 pop hit by Pharrell Williams.\n\n\n\nAisha Newsome, center, sings a joyous-voice solo during ""Happy."" Her dad posted the now-viral video March 7.\n\nMission accomplished. The infectious two-minute clip (below) has been played more than 820,000 times and the school got calls Tuesday from producers at BET and three programs you\'ve heard of: ""Today,"" ""The Queen Latifah Show"" and ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""\n\n""We\'re still talking to a \'Today\' producer about the arrangements,"" academy CEO Maurice Morton, 44, tells Deadline Detroit by phone Tuesday afternoon. The NBC morning show may fly all or some of the 40 elementary and middle school singers to New York, Morton says, or shoot a segment at the school -- as it did in May 2012, when correspondent Jenna Bush Hager came. Morton doesn\'t know yet whether the former presidential daughter will do the follow-up.\n\nPharrell Williams may be part of the segment in person or remotely, Morton hinted to Eric Lacy of MLive earlier Tuesday.\n\nRelated coverage: Pupils\' Video of Pharrell Williams\' \'Happy\' Passes 150,000 Views\n\nThe whirlwind of attention is ""exciting for the kids"" and choir director Angela Kee, Morton says.\n\nKee tells Cassandra Spratling of the Free Press:\n\n“I picked the song because it is a favorite of the children. It’s catchy. It’s easy to teach, and the lyrics are positive. It drives negativity out of your heart. “I can hear the children singing and whistling the song in the hallway after they’ve left class."" . . . The teacher and the students created the choreography together. “I threw in some of my old-school moves, and the students added some more modern steps,” Kee said. “I didn’t think they would like my dances, like ‘the swim’ and ‘the shimmy,’ but they did.”\n\nFox 2 Detroit posted the video March 12, five days after Bones put it on YouTube, and apparently was the first local news outlet to notice the rousing, well-choreographed. Deadline Detroit posted it three days later on Saturday morning, noting that the clip had been seen 5,600 times. National pickups began Monday, boosting the figure above a half-million.\n\nThe tape\'s opening soloist is Samuel Pickins.\n\nBenefits reach beyond the 16-year-old school, as Morton sees it. ""Detroit has talent,"" the education administrator says, his voice rising with an oral exclamation mark. ""Here\'s an inspiring example people can see of the revival of Detroit.""\n\n\n\nMusic teacher Angela Kee has been at the academy nearly 10 years.\n\nSeeing their video\'s numbers climbing steadily is horizon-expanding for the animated young singers from grades 3 through 8 -- who put arms, legs and voices into the rousing, harmonious performance. ""They realize their talents are touching so many people around the country and the world,"" Morton says during the interview. ""It\'s a teachable moment, allowing them to realize they can do anything.""\n\nI\'m a hot air balloon that could go to space . . .\n\nClap along if you feel like a room without a roof\n\nAt DAAS, a shorthand name for the academy chartered by Oakland University, academic performance is required to join what\'s called the show choir. Singers must maintain a 3.0 grade point average.\n\nDividends from lifting their voices in song will last a lifetime, Morton and Kee feel. ""These kids are exhibiting talent and skill sets they\'re need later,"" the CEO says. ""They learn about poise, confidence, teamwork, communication skill, voice projection, appropriate appearance and articulation. It\'s powerful.""\n\nHe notes that nearly all of the academy\'s roughly 1,000 elementary and middle school students are from Detroit. ""Many are from the east side and a lot of our families live in poverty,"" Morton adds.\n\n\n\n""I hadn\'t heard the song until my kids performed it.,"" says Maurice Morton, the self-managed charter school\'s CEO. (BET photo)\n\nIn addition to managing the East Jefferson charter schools, the chief executive is a Democratic candidate for the14th Congressional District seat being vacated by Rep. Gary Peters, who wants to succeed Sen. Carl Levin.\n\nHis focus on the academic job and his political sidelight may explain why Morton is a relative newcomer to the catchy tune Williams performed at the Oscars telecast Feb. 24.\n\n""Truthfully,"" he says with a laugh when asked, ""I hadn\'t heard the song until my kids performed it. Then I thought, I have to see the [original] video.""\n\nIn past years, the DAAS choir has performed at Ford Field during halftime of a Detroit Lions game and as an opening act locally for Chaka Khan and The O’Jays.\n\nDonations sought: The academy wants to send 50 students to perform a Disney World this spring if it can raise at least $20,000 for travel costs.

Within 24 hours of it going online Monday night, the school was inundated with calls, requests to appear on various programs and a host of congratulatory messages.\n\n\n\n“It has been a crazy and amazing day here,” said Maurice Morton, the chief executive of the well-known elementary school, in an interview with BET.com. “We’ve been called by media all over the country. It’s been pretty exciting.”\n\n\n\nMorton said that the school’s teachers and parents — and indeed the city — take great pride in the video and the response to it because it reflects the fact that Detroit is a place with highly talented youth.\n\n\n\n“Despite the headlines that people read about Detroit, we have extremely talented kids here,” said Morton, a lawyer and former prosecutor in Wayne County, Michigan, and a candidate for office in Detroit.\n\n\n\n“This is exciting for us because people are recognizing their talent and the fact that their educational experience here is bringing out the best in them,” Morton said. “We use our arts program to get them interested and inspired about school.”\n\n\n\nThe school has become well known for its famous choir, which has performed at a number of national venues, from the halftime show of Monday Night Football to the Today show on NBC. The school also prides itself as a place where students use the latest in technology.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, Morton says, the students at the school still encounter all the problems that face any school seeking to educate children in Michigan’s largest city, a place that has been besieged with high unemployment and poverty rates. But he explained that the school has had a great deal of success because its leaders and administrators can tailor their work to meet the needs of students without having to answer to a huge school-district bureaucracy.\n\n\n\nThe video came about as a result of a parent taping a rehearsal of the young people in the school’s library. The parent placed the video on YouTube, which helped launch the performance into international acclaim.\n\n\n\n“It was literally a practice and rehearsal tape that went viral,” Morton said. “They were just having fun. Last night we got an email that it was on the Huffington Post and that it went to 70,000 views overnight. Then the calls started coming in from all over the country. It’s been amazing.

Fortunately, Hypable was there to capture a bit of the night’s magic on video!\n\nAs we’ve mentioned before, the Chicago premiere of Divergent was a fantastic experience. We loved being around so many avid fans and movie enthusiasts. When the stars finally took to the red carpet, there was a real electricity in the air.\n\nOur first interview of the night was with the lovely Amy Newbold, the actress who played Dauntless initiate Molly Atwood. When we asked Newbold what she was most excited to see in the movie, she told us that she was really looking forward to seeing the whole Divergent world come together.\n\n“I didn’t ever get to see Erudite headquarters or a lot of Abnegation houses, so I’m excited to see all that come to life too,” she said. “Because I was on set for all of the Dauntless stuff but [there wasn’t a lot of overlap], especially for me.”\n\nWatch our entire interview with Newbold below.\n\n\n\nWe had the fortunate opportunity to speak to the wonderful Veronica Roth right after we finished our discussion with Newbold. We were dying to ask her if there was something in the movie that she wishes that she would have included while writing Divergent. Surprisingly, she didn’t hesitate at all in responding that she wishes she would have emphasized Jeanine’s role more.\n\n“You have this antagonist who’s off the page for most of the book,” explained Roth. “So if I could go back and do something, it would be to make her more nuanced and maybe a little more present at the ending.”\n\nWatch our entire interview with Roth below.\n\n\n\nThe men of Divergent were our final two interviewees of the night. Up first: the talented Theo James. We were most interested in finding out what he was most excited about filming when he first received the script.\n\nInterestingly, he was most looking forward to the final scene with Four in the control room. “It’s a mix of action and also love between two characters,” he explained.\n\nWatch our entire interview with James below. (Unfortunately, the high five he gave us was not caught on film.)\n\n\n\nWe wrapped up our time on Chicago’s Divergent red carpet with the enthusiastic and charming Ansel Elgort. Honestly, our favorite part about our interview with Elgort was when he compared the Divergent world with Middle Earth.\n\n“There’s this story with this whole different world, you know sort of like The Lord of the Rings,” Ansel gushed. “…They built [this whole new place] with these factions and everything.”\n\nWatch our entire interview with Elgort below.\n\n\n\nWe hope you enjoy watching these interviews as much as we did doing them.\n\nStay tuned to Hypable for more Divergent news and coverage leading up to the movie’s premiere this Friday, March 21!\n\nAlso be sure to check out our account of a day on the set of Divergent!\n\nThank you to Fangirlish’s Dan Schiffmacher for teaming up with us and recording our interviews!', 'The Divergent author and stars were very candid and excited about the movie while walking the red carpet in Chicago on March 4.\nWe wrapped up our time on Chicago’s Divergent red carpet with the enthusiastic and charming Ansel Elgort.\nHonestly, our favorite part about our interview with Elgort was when he compared the Divergent world with Middle Earth.\n“…They built [this whole new place] with these factions and everything.”Watch our entire interview with Elgort below.\nStay tuned to Hypable for more Divergent news and coverage leading up to the movie’s premiere this Friday, March 21!']"

While you may know the film solely as “that movie with that girl from ABC Family’s show about a pregnant teenager,” there’s actually much more to the story. Sort of like (its bound-to-be-compared-to nemesis) The Hunger Games, Divergent takes place in the far-off future, in the barely recognizable Chicago. War had almost destroyed the world, so the government sought to eradicate the traits that led to the fighting. Thus, the idea of a faction was born, and Chicago was divided into five of them, each prizing one trait above all, such as selflessness, courage, and kindness.\n\nIn this future, a girl named Beatrice Prior, a.k.a Tris (Shailene Woodley), must decide which faction she belongs to on Choosing Day, when each 16-year-old boy and girl chooses to either remain with the one he or she was born into, or leave it behind forever and choose a new group. Problems arise when Tris learns she isn’t just fit for one faction, but three, making her Divergent.\n\nIn a world where factions are the very crux of the government, Divergents threaten the system. They cannot be easily controlled. To hide her secret, Tris joins the Dauntless faction, and soon finds herself learning how to fire guns and throw punches, preparing her for a battle she doesn’t even know she’ll have to fight. Along the way she meets the Dauntless instructor Four (Theo James), and learns she may not be the only one hiding a secret.\n\nAnd those are just the basics.

The up-and-coming star has been in the Hollywood scene since the age of 8, but her Golden Globe nominated performance in “The Descendants” is what made Hollywood take notice.\n\nWithin the past year, Woodley landed starring roles in two upcoming film adaptations of wildly popular books, “Divergent” and “The Fault in Our Stars.” But she certainly isn’t letting fame get to her head. She is using the spotlight to speak out about the issues she believes in. One thing is for sure, Shailene Woodley is exactly what we’ve been waiting for in Hollywood.\n\nHere’s a quick primer on everything you need to know about the California native who is taking over Hollywood:\n\n1. She only shampoos her hair once a month!\n\nAccording to her, “the oiler, the better.”\n\n2. Her poop smells like metal.\n\nAfter a taxi driver told her women in Africa eat clay for its health benefits, she began eating it daily.\n\n3. She tans her vagina.\n\nAccording to her it helps with yeast infections and other genital issues.\n\n4. She worked at American Apparel until she was cast in “The Descendants.”\n\nWoodley told Chelsea Lately in November 2012, that despite starring in “Secret Life of the American Teenager” she continued to work in retail.\n\n5. As a teenager she was diagnosed with scoliosis\n\nSo she spent a lot of her time growing up (almost 18 hours a day!) in a back brace.\n\n6. She was considered for the role of Katniss Everdeen in “The Hunger Games”\n\nBut Jennifer Lawrence was cast, instead.\n\n7. She’s best friends with Megan Park\n\nHer “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” co-star.\n\n\n\n8. She hates “Twilight.”\n\nIn an interview with Teen Vogue, she explained, “‘Twilight,’ I’m sorry, is about a very unhealthy, toxic relationship. She falls in love with this guy and the second he leaves her, her life is over and she’s going to kill herself! What message are we sending to young people? That is not going to help this world evolve.”\n\n9. She listens to Disney when she needs to be cheered up.\n\n“If you listen to the lyrics, they actually have incredibly valuable lessons for human beings to learn,” Woodley told L.A. Confidential in January 2012.\n\n10. She doesn’t own a cell phone.\n\n“I’m not a big technology person,” she told The Daily Beast, “I’m talking to people more than I’ve ever talked to in my life because I no longer have that crutch.

23043,http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/cinema-review-divergent,entertainment,"[""Even if Divergent is terrible, it has a guaranteed young-adult audience. The good news? It's enjoyable, even if it seems to serve solely to set up the action for the sequels.\n\nDivergent\n\nDirector: Neil Burger\n\nStarring: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Kate Winslet\n\n⋆⋆\n\nPost-Hunger Games, to which Divergent will inevitably be compared, the logic of cashing in on the young adult fiction market is faultless. There’s a guaranteed audience (Veronica Roth’s novel has sold more than 5 million copies) and the sequels are already set up – the second book in Roth’s trilogy is scheduled for a 2015 cinema release. Even if the film is terrible that’s millions of tickets, plus family and friends. If it avoids being terrible it can pull newcomers in and the accountants are very happy.\n\nI’m pleased to report that it isn’t terrible. In a nutshell, in post-apocalyptic Chicago, society is divided into five factions: Abnegation, selfless souls who run the government; Amity, peaceful farmers; Dauntless, the brave types who act as police and soldiers; Erudite, the knowledgeable; and Candour, honest and without a clear purpose. At 16 each citizen is tested to determine which faction they fit into, though they are free to choose another. But the choice is final and if they fail to make the grade in their new faction they are kicked out of society to join The Factionless, a shuffling bunch of ragged extras straight from a Dickens musical.\n\nThen there are the Divergents – those who fit into multiple categories, pose a threat to social order and thus must be eliminated, at least according to Kate Winslet’s Cruella Deville-esque Erudite leader. Our heroes Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) are, of course, Divergent, and inevitably uncover a plot by Winslett’s Jeanine to take control of the Dauntless’ minds and wrestle power from the humble Abnegates.\n\nThe biggest flaw here is how these factions have tolerated each other for the 100-plus years since “the war”. The Dauntless are an endless frat party – they get tattoos, they slap thighs and their insistence on travelling everywhere by jumping on and off moving trains has only the one possible benefit of keeping their infuriating population down. The Erudite are pompous snobs (no surprise to find an English actor in charge there then). Amity are a bit part that universally resemble a Woodstock reunion, and it’s unclear how anyone as servile as the Abnegates would ever get near government in a million years, never mind stay there for 100. Candour? No idea.\n\nThe film also seems to serve solely to set up the action for the sequels, so nothing really happens. Divergent Tris chooses Dauntless, and we get two hours of her in boot camp and a will they/won’t they romance with trainer Four before a token 20 minutes of plot when the conspiracy is unearthed.\n\nAlmost two and a half hours seemed a long time for a glorified origins movie. It might be great for those who already know what happens next, but I wanted something to happen in this film.\n\nThen again, if you’re the target audience you do already know what’s going to happen, and you’d go even if I said this was the worst film ever. Which it isn’t, so enjoy it.\n\ncnewbould@thenational.ae"", ""Even if Divergent is terrible, it has a guaranteed young-adult audience.\nIt's enjoyable, even if it seems to serve solely to set up the action for the sequels.\nDivergentDirector: Neil BurgerStarring: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Kate Winslet⋆⋆Post-Hunger Games, to which Divergent will inevitably be compared, the logic of cashing in on the young adult fiction market is faultless.\nEven if the film is terrible that’s millions of tickets, plus family and friends.\nDivergent Tris chooses Dauntless, and we get two hours of her in boot camp and a will they/won’t they romance with trainer Four before a token 20 minutes of plot when the conspiracy is unearthed.""]"
23044,http://www.ibtimes.com/6-outrageous-shailene-woodley-quotes-her-divergent-movie-press-tour-1562251,entertainment,"['Shailene Woodley is to memorable sound bites what Jennifer Lawrence is to trips on the red carpet. Woodley, 22, has recently been in the public eye promoting her latest feature, the film adaption of the best-selling YA book “Divergent,” and in her wake, has left behind a trail of memorable quotes solidifying her hippie-chick ways. Here\'s a roundup of the top six best gems spoken by Woodley in recent weeks during her “Divergent” movie press tour:\n\n“Clay is one of the best things you can put in your body.” In an interview with IntoTheGloss.com, Woodley discussed some of her favorite beauty and health products, clay being one of her top picks. Unfortunately, for the film star and everyone around her, her clay-eating habits (clay has health properties, which she said that she learned after questioning an African taxi driver about his native customs), makes everything from her skin to her bowel movements “smell like metal.” Lovely.\n\n“Another thing I like to do is give my vagina a little vitamin D.” A visit to the gynecologist ranks second in Woodley’s book to a good dose of sunshine. When prompted to discuss her favorite natural ways to heal her body, the actress said letting vitamin D soak in where the sun doesn’t shine is a great alternative for treating yeast infections and other women genital issues. “If you live in a place that has heavy winters, when the sun finally comes out, spread your legs and get some sunshine,” she clarified.\n\n“I only shampoo [my hair] once a month.” While Woodley isn’t the first and certainly not the last person to admit to washing their hair only once a month -- “the oiler, the better,” she said -- it does make the quote both memorable and cringe-worthy.\n\n“Let’s hug it out.” Woodley’s hippie ways trump professionalism because according to the former Golden Globe nominee, hugs are better than handshakes. “I love hugging. It’s like I’m real, you’re real, let’s hug it out. Instead of like a handshake and then you’re like hmm, I don’t know where that hand’s been,” Woodley told Jimmy Fallon during a March 12 appearance on “The Tonight Show.” But just any only old hug won’t do for Woodley who specified that she only likes hugging on the left. “A little heart to heart action. I feel like inherently we go to the other side, the right, but what’s that about? Maybe it says something about our society that we go to the right and not to the heart,” she explained.\n\n“Do you guys have any raw garlic?” When Fallon asked Woodley to share some of her favorite herbs for keeping up her immune system during the winter, the actress admitted that she loves to eat garlic. “Here’s the thing if you’re feeling sick, eat raw garlic,” she said, admitting to eating some raw cloves from room service before her TV appearance. “I had some this morning, so you might be like, ‘Shai, stay away because you have fire dragon breath,’ But raw garlic is so good for you,"" she added. Other herbs Woodley likes are horseradish (which amusingly looks quite phallic) and ginger, in case you were interested.\n\n“There are a lot of mountains with a lot of water.” During a February appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Woodley discussed her hobby of collecting her own water from fresh mountain streams. Kimmel then pointed out that wild animals are most likely urinating in the natural springs that she works so hard to collect and drink from when she’s not traveling. Woodley claimed that she\'s content with her decision. “You have to be careful about it though, you could have some danger zones ... something funky in the water,"" she joked.\n\n""Divergent,"" directed by Neil Burger, hits theaters this Friday.', 'Shailene Woodley is to memorable sound bites what Jennifer Lawrence is to trips on the red carpet.\n“Here’s the thing if you’re feeling sick, eat raw garlic,” she said, admitting to eating some raw cloves from room service before her TV appearance.\n“I had some this morning, so you might be like, ‘Shai, stay away because you have fire dragon breath,’ But raw garlic is so good for you,"" she added.\nOther herbs Woodley likes are horseradish (which amusingly looks quite phallic) and ginger, in case you were interested.\n“You have to be careful about it though, you could have some danger zones ... something funky in the water,"" she joked.']"

Like soul sister Jennifer Lawrence before her, Woodley seems 100% incapable of being anything other than amazing in interviews, and that includes her new one with beauty website IntoTheGloss.com during which Woodley recommends a truly wonderful new skincare technique for a woman\'s genitals:\n\nAnother thing I like to do is give my vagina a little vitamin D. [Laughs] I was reading an article written by an herbalist I studied about yeast infections and other genital issues. She said there’s nothing better than vitamin D.

23078,http://move.themaneater.com/stories/2014/3/18/divergent-veronica-roth-will-it-be-different-movie/,entertainment,"['On Friday — or Thursday night, if you go to movie premieres the day before like I do — “Divergent” comes out in theaters.\n\nI have been waiting for this moment since they played the trailer during the premiere of “Catching Fire.” Seeing the trailer inspired me to read the book because I personally enjoy comparing the movie that plays in my head while I read to the movie they put on the screen. (Mine is always better.)\n\nAnd although I’m pretty certain that I will leave the theater unsatisfied, I can’t help but hope that this time, Hollywood will get the whole book-to-movie thing right, and I’ll leave feeling full from the greatness I just consumed.\n\nNow, this series by Veronica Roth is excellent dystopian fiction. The first book is my favorite of the three, and the concept of this series is so addicting that not only does the reader feel like they are there with the characters, but they also find themselves wishing the story were real.\n\n“Divergent” takes place in a futuristic Chicago. This fictional society is divided into five separate factions, each of which stands for a desirable virtue. The Abnegation are selfless, the Amity are peaceful, the Candor are honest, the Erudite are intelligent and the Dauntless are brave.\n\nAt age 16, each member of this society participates in a ceremony in which they choose to either stay in the faction they were born into or leave their family for another faction. This is a critical moment for the main character, Tris. She is Abnegation-born, but chooses Dauntless during her ceremony. The choice Tris makes does not mean choosing another faction, but rather, another family.\n\nThis choice sends her on a journey where she goes from living a life of wearing gray and constantly trying to forget herself, to riding on top of trains, getting tattoos and fighting to be initiated into a place she wants to call home. And of course there is a gorgeous, mysterious guy named Four, who is as close as you can get to being a perfect Dauntless (there’s a little four-shadowing for you, wink).\n\nTris conquers her fears and finds herself, literally living life on the edge. Who wouldn’t want to be her? But unfortunately, this is a dystopia, and the book ends with something major (let’s keep this spoiler-free), and shows the reader why this type of society is not perfect.\n\nIf you haven’t read the book already, have no fear — you will not need that long. I read it in a day. Not even by choice but, rather, out of pure necessity. If you do end up reading it, you will have your own list of things you hope to see in the movie.\n\nUntil then, here’s this MOVEr’s list:\n\n1) Shailene Woodley, who plays Tris, is doing the role justice. Tris is a powerful 16-year-old who conquers unfathomable problems admirably. She is an excellent role model for young women and could have a huge impact on today’s youth.\n\n2) Shots that allow the viewer to see everything Tris sees through her perspective. I want to feel like I am choosing a faction, risking my life and facing my fears, as well.\n\n3) Insight into each faction. I want to see the clothes each faction wears and how they differ from one another.\n\n4) A nice, slow scene where Four, played by Theo James, removes his shirt to show Tris his tattoos and their meaning.\n\n5) And finally, I want to see everything. When moviemakers cut something out from the book I want to cut them. If it was important enough for Roth to create and bring to life through words then I want to see it on the screen. People should leave the movie and be impacted enough to live their lives differently because that is what this book does to the reader.', 'On Friday — or Thursday night, if you go to movie premieres the day before like I do — “Divergent” comes out in theaters.\nThe choice Tris makes does not mean choosing another faction, but rather, another family.\nIf you haven’t read the book already, have no fear — you will not need that long.\nI want to feel like I am choosing a faction, risking my life and facing my fears, as well.\nPeople should leave the movie and be impacted enough to live their lives differently because that is what this book does to the reader.']"

23081,http://www.moviefanatic.com/2014/03/divergent-shailene-woodley-talks-bumps-and-bruises-of-action-mov/,entertainment,"['Divergent star Shailene Woodley talked to someone she admired before accepting the role in the franchise starter based on the blockbuster book series by Veronica Roth. And that superstar would be The Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence.\n\n“I sent her an email. I was curious… she’d gone from doing indie films to Hunger Games and I wondered if it had changed her life,” Woodley told Movie Fanatic recently.\n\n“She said, ‘Don’t do anything stupid. Don’t do drugs or go to Whole Foods the day the movie opens and you’ll be fine. Yeah, there can be some hard things that come with it, but the amount of beauty and positivity that come with it will transcend any of the other complications.’”\n\nWhen we talked to her for The Spectacular Now, we immediately could tell that Woodley had a good head on her shoulders. She told us at the Divergent press day that a lot of it has to do with her parents and how she was brought up.\n\n“A lot of it was the way I was raised by my parents who are both psychologists. Empathy and compassion were ingrained into me in a very young age. I feel like a lot of people don’t learn about those values until later in life, but I was very fortunate to have two parents who made sure that they were two very important things in my brother’s and my lives,” Woodley said.\n\n“They said as long as I stay the person they thought I was, had fun and did good in school, then I could keep doing it.”\n\nAs teased in the Divergent trailer, Woodley plays Tris. In this dystopian future, war has gutted society over 100 years ago and Tris and her family live amongst the survivors in Chicago. Their society is broken down into five virtue-based factions. As our film begins, Tris and thousands of others are about to take a test to determine where they will live, work and grow as human beings for the rest of their lives.\n\nTo say that Woodley identified with Tris and her situation is a gross understatement. “A lot of who Tris is resonated with me. When I was her age, I was going through a lot of those struggles. I had to balance being compassionate and empathetic toward my peers and also living my life for myself,” Woodley said.\n\n“She was raised in a society where she had to be selfless and then join a faction that’s all about being selfish -- she had to find the balance between that.”\n\nOne of the most iconic scenes in the book, and the film for that matter, is when Tris shows her mettle and climbs atop an enormous Ferris wheel with Theo James as Four. “It was beautiful up there. How many people can say they’ve actually climbed up a Ferris wheel?” she wondered. Sure, it was freezing, but who cares?!\n\nThere is plenty of action in Divergent. One of the most exciting sequences features Tris and her colleagues jumping off of trains.\n\n“That was a little painful. But when you sign on to an action movie, if you don’t get a few bumps and bruises you’re not doing something right.”\n\nAs Divergent is set to hit theaters March 21, Woodley will become a household name, there is no question (she is one of our 13 stars whose names everyone will know). If that happens, she will be ready.\n\n“I just live my life for me, and I don’t let anything else influence me. If it ever becomes not fun anymore, I’m quitting and doing something else. Life is too short to take yourself too seriously,” Woodley said.\n\n“I’ve been very lucky. I’ve been doing this for 17 years. It just started as a fun hobby, and I still think of it like that.”', 'Divergent star Shailene Woodley talked to someone she admired before accepting the role in the franchise starter based on the blockbuster book series by Veronica Roth.\nI was curious… she’d gone from doing indie films to Hunger Games and I wondered if it had changed her life,” Woodley told Movie Fanatic recently.\nDon’t do drugs or go to Whole Foods the day the movie opens and you’ll be fine.\nShe told us at the Divergent press day that a lot of it has to do with her parents and how she was brought up.\nI had to balance being compassionate and empathetic toward my peers and also living my life for myself,” Woodley said.']"

At least that’s what it looks like to us, although teen dystopia stories are very popular these days, and the book was a big hit with young adults.\n\nNow the official reviews for Divergent have hit. The verdict? Not so hot, although it’s sure to have a big opening weekend. (Not Hunger Games big, but it will certainly come in at #1 on the box office charts.)\n\nVariety writes, “This film has clearly been designated an heir apparent to [the] massively lucrative teen-targeted Twilight and Hunger Games properties. Yet director Neil Burger seems so concerned with laying franchise groundwork that he neglects to create an engaging standalone movie.” Divergent also apparently suffers from “uncertain sense of setting, bloated plot, drab visual style, and solid yet underwhelming lead turns from Shailene Woodley and Theo James.”\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter calls the film “a rocky start to the Next Big Thing in YA movie franchises,” yet acknowledges the film will make money. “Lackluster direction in the early installments hasn’t slowed their moment [and] Divergent will be no exception.”\n\nFinally, The Wrap called Divergent, “A little Hunger Games, a little Harry Potter, a lot of dull.”', 'There’s been a lot of hype and expectations for Divergent, which we at TGD have been calling Hunger Games Lite.\nNow the official reviews for Divergent have hit.\n(Not Hunger Games big, but it will certainly come in at #1 on the box office charts.)\nVariety writes, “This film has clearly been designated an heir apparent to [the] massively lucrative teen-targeted Twilight and Hunger Games properties.\n“Lackluster direction in the early installments hasn’t slowed their moment [and] Divergent will be no exception.”Finally, The Wrap called Divergent, “A little Hunger Games, a little Harry Potter, a lot of dull.”']"
23083,http://www.mercurynews.com/entertainment/ci_25367251/hicks-divergent-follows-hunger-games-formula-success,entertainment,"['If you’re an actor looking for a role in a film with a young, female protagonist with action hero leanings who’s fighting the power in a futuristic dystopian society, you’re in luck — studios are hiring.\n\n“Divergent” opens today and likely will dominate the box office this weekend — and perhaps a few weekends after that. Stop me if you’ve heard this before: The film, based on a best-selling novel aimed at teens, chronicles a society recovering from an unspecified calamity by seriously restructuring itself and, in the process, giving rise to a sadistic streak that those in power feel is necessary to keep order.\n\nNo, actually, it’s not the next “Hunger Games” installment. Though you wouldn’t know it from the imagery on the book sleeve.\n\nThere are a lot of parallels. Both movies feature characters played by people named Kravitz (Lenny in “Hunger Games” and his daughter Zoë in “Divergent”). One has already made truckloads of money, while the other is about to, because filmgoers of all ages currently love movies based on books featuring strong female leads with hearts of gold, fighting oppression in future post-apocalyptic societies.\n\nThe trend isn’t surprising to Robert Thompson, the founding director of Syracuse University’s Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture.\n\n“The assumption is, ‘OK, we’ve gone through this hundreds and hundreds of years with men being in power, and now it’s time for the women’,” he says. “It’s something different. White men in charge would look completely out of step with contemporary times.”\n\nThompson says conditions are perfect for films such as “Hunger Games” and “Divergent” to flourish. Women such as Hillary Clinton are breaking through glass ceilings of America’s power structure, and while films concerning futuristic, dystopian societies have fascinated us since “Metropolis” in 1927, the difference is the quality of special effects that allow stories to come alive like never before.\n\nIt’s also a new way for Hollywood to exploit an old method of attracting men to films with female leads. “It’s also a more politically correct way of featuring beautiful women in movies,” Thompson says. “It’s not like women are suddenly taking over Hollywood.”\n\nThe world of “Divergent” consists of five “factions,” or groupings of people, based on shared philosophical beliefs in what best serves humankind. Sixteen-year-olds undergo a ritual designed to determine where they fit best in society (if you’re catching a whiff of a certain “sorting” scene from “Harry Potter,” you aren’t alone). The hero of “Divergent” is 16-year-old Beatrice “Tris” Prior (played by Shailene Woodley). Although Tris switches from her childhood faction of selflessness to a more reckless faction, she’s actually “Divergent,” meaning she possesses elements of multiple factions and special abilities. That makes her dangerous to those in power.\n\n“Divergent” author Veronica Roth chose a dystopian society on purpose, as she explains in a Q & A that accompanies her book. “I love that the majority of the characters in dystopian and post-apocalyptic literature have a lot of agency — they take charge of their lives in environments that make it hard for them to do so,” Roth says. “And I love reading about strong characters like that.”\n\nShe’s obviously not the only one. Like other blockbuster film franchises derived from best-selling books written by women — “The Hunger Games,” “Harry Potter” and even “Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn” — the team of heroic protagonists are mixed-gender with burgeoning romance afoot, which Thompson calls key.\n\n“It’s cliche,” he says, “but the ones who do so well with young females … it’s not so much whether it’s a male or female protagonist. There are elements of deep romance.”\n\nIf the public’s thirst for these adaptations isn’t sated by “The Hunger Games” and “Divergent,” others could be on the way. Though Fox decided late in the game not to pick up the pilot (starring Emma Roberts), fans are still hopeful for a TV or film adaptation of Lauren Oliver’s “Delirium” books. And CBS reportedly optioned Marie Lu’s “Legend” series for the big screen.\n\n“I suspect we’re going to see more of them,” Thompson says.\n\nI suspect he might be right.\n\nContact Tony Hicks at Thicks@BayAreaNewsGroup.com, Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.', 'No, actually, it’s not the next “Hunger Games” installment.\nBoth movies feature characters played by people named Kravitz (Lenny in “Hunger Games” and his daughter Zoë in “Divergent”).\nWhite men in charge would look completely out of step with contemporary times.”Thompson says conditions are perfect for films such as “Hunger Games” and “Divergent” to flourish.\n“Divergent” author Veronica Roth chose a dystopian society on purpose, as she explains in a Q & A that accompanies her book.\nThere are elements of deep romance.”If the public’s thirst for these adaptations isn’t sated by “The Hunger Games” and “Divergent,” others could be on the way.']"

But unlike the ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"" series, this one was actually written by someone under 30.\n\n""Divergent,"" the latest young adult novel poised to become a blockbuster movie, meets all the criteria for the YA genre: It\'s adapted from a best-seller; the story is rooted in sci-fi; and the cast consists of hot, young stars-to-be. But unlike the ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"" series, this one was actually written by someone under 30.\n\nIn 201, writer Veronica Roth was just 22 years old when her book hit shelves. Based on a future dystopian society where people are segregated by their values, her debut landed on the New York Times children\'s best-seller list, where it remained for 11 weeks. She followed it up with the sequel ""Insurgent"" and completed her trilogy with ""Allegiant."" Her books have sold over 11 million copies.\n\nSummit Entertainment, the same studio behind the ""Twilight"" franchise, acquired the film rights before the first copy of ""Divergent"" was sold. ""It\'s been surreal,"" Roth said during a recent interview. ""When I found out Summit wanted to make a movie, I was like, \'They want to do what?\' I was really nervous, but I was relieved when it started doing well. That they were interested was really encouraging.""\n\nStarring Shailene Woodley, Theo James and Kate Winslet, the film opens Friday.\n\nDuring an interview with The Associated Press, Roth talked about letting the studio take her book and run with it, the inevitable comparisons with ""The Hunger Games"" and how she\'s grown as a writer:\n\nAP: The first time you saw the film adaptation of ""Divergent,"" did it look the way you\'d envisioned it?\n\nRoth: Not until I saw the shot of the Sears Tower (now Chicago\'s Willis Tower) and the characters going into the choosing ceremony did I really go, \'Oh that\'s really it.\' I got really emotional. And I was happy because I didn\'t want any sleek or super polished future and it does look kind of destroyed. You can\'t micromanage the movie adaptation of your book. First of all, they won\'t let you. Second of all, I didn\'t want to.\n\nAP: Your stories have been compared to writer Suzanne Collins\' ""The Hunger Games"" series. Both focus on heroines in dystopian societies. Feel any pressure to match the box-office numbers of those adaptations?\n\nRoth: I think it\'s a double-edged sword. I try not to think about it, but I don\'t succeed most of the time. ""The Hunger Games"" did something remarkable. So in that sense, it\'s a flattering comparison. But you can\'t hope to replicate that experience. It was unique.\n\nAP: What are your thoughts on the casting choices of Shailene Woodley as the character Tris and Theo James as Four?\n\nRoth: (Shailene and Theo) transported me right away. They had great chemistry. That is what I was most concerned about because that has to carry the story.\n\nAP: What was the inspiration for the story?\n\nRoth: My freshman year of college I learned about exposure therapy, which is a method of treating anxiety and phobia. Someone is repeatedly exposed to the thing that makes them afraid, so they become habituated to it. I wanted to use it in a sci-fi context.\n\nAP: Writer Stephenie Meyer was 31 when her first book from the ""Twilight"" collection came out. Suzanne Collins was 46 when the first novel from her ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy released. How does it feel to be a young adult generating young adult material?\n\nRoth: I feel acutely aware of how young I am. In a way that is good. It\'s productive. It makes me realize that I should be growing as a writer and a person.\n\nAP: How have you grown as a writer?\n\nRoth: I take things that I am putting on the page more seriously now. In the subsequent books, I thought more about violence and young people. It\'s very serious. That doesn\'t mean I\'m limiting the content. I just handle it different. In terms of writing skill, I think more detail and less repetition.\n\nAP: Does the pressure to produce a good follow-up weigh on you?\n\nRoth: It depends on the day. The only time I\'m able to write is when I can let that go. It\'s been helpful to have a series finished and think that whatever I do next just gets to exist between me and my screen for as long as I want it to. It\'s a way of coaching myself into relaxing.\n\nAP: Have you finished your next book?\n\nRoth: I wrote a collection of short stories that\'s coming out in July. (The collection is told from Four\'s perspective.) It\'s kind of a prequel to ""Divergent."" I\'m just finishing them now.', 'But unlike the ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"" series, this one was actually written by someone under 30.\nBut unlike the ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"" series, this one was actually written by someone under 30.\nAP: Your stories have been compared to writer Suzanne Collins\' ""The Hunger Games"" series.\n""The Hunger Games"" did something remarkable.\nSuzanne Collins was 46 when the first novel from her ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy released.']"

The film is slated for a worldwide release on March 21, 2014.\n\nDivergent is based on Veronica Roth\'s book of the same name and is directed by Neil Burger. It is the first installment in the trilogy starring Shailene Woodley in the lead. The futuristic book is set in dystopian Chicago and depicts young Tris Prior\'s (Woodley) coming of age.\n\nThe youth oriented theme is reminiscent of Lions Gate\'s hugely successful franchise The Hunger Games trilogy, which also had a female lead (Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence) fighting against odds.\n\nHowever, critics do not seem to be too impressed as is evident from the reviews. Despite laudable performances from Woodley, James Theo and Kate Winslet (who plays the villain), critics found this 140-minute film a clichéd, run-of-the-mill affair.\n\nThe director\'s adaptation was also seen as a poor attempt at stitching philosophy, romance and brutal action on celluloid.\n\nDivergent is the latest in the genre of ""young-adult fantasy adaptations."" The success or failure of this movie will decide the future of this franchise and possibly of the genre, according to some experts. They argue that four high-profile films of this genre ( Beautiful Creatures, The Host, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and Vampire Academy ) failed to make it big at the box office as compared to Hunger Games and Twilight in the past.

The main character, Beatrice “Tris” Prior (played in the film by the wonderful Shailene Woodley), is what’s known as a divergent (someone who fits in with more than one faction). Upon learning this, she uncovers a sinister plot that threatens to wipe out all of her kind and must get to the bottom of what’s going on before it’s too late.\n\nRecently, at the Los Angeles press day for Divergent, we had the chance to chat with the entire cast about the highly-anticipated film. Along with Woodley, we spoke to Theo James, Miles Teller, Jai Courtney, Ashley Judd and several others. They discussed, among other things, what it was like working with so much green screen, injuries suffered on set, learning the fight choreography, and the upcoming sequel, Insurgent.

We wanted to know which faction Shailene Woodley would choose, if she had to.\n\n“I would choose Dauntless, but the second I sort of didn’t enjoy the way that they were functioning, I would become factionless so that I didn’t have to be controlled,” Woodley said.\n\nWoodley also had a lot of on-screen chemistry with Theo James, who plays Four.

I trained about two weeks alone, then Theo got there and we trained together.”\n\nConsidering Hollywood has been focused on the strong female heroine lately, we asked Woodley if she thinks the days of the damsel in distress are over.\n\n“I hope so. I feel like it’s important to have a fine balance, because we all have days of good and really intense situations so the ebb and flow is important, but there’s been a sort of lack of balance, so it’s good to see the balance come to fruition.”\n\nAbout whether or not a Divergent-type society could exist in the future, Woodley said, “I hope that it couldn’t. I don’t think it could, because I don’t think that human beings could commit themselves to one virtue.”\n\nAnd, of course, if there was a fight between Katniss from The Hunger Games and Tris from Divergent, we asked Woodley who she thought would win.\n\n“I don’t think either of them would actually fight each other.

There’s this big push to be skinny, be tall, have a small waist. It’s almost like we’re obsessed with our prepubescent selves, we’re obsessed with like this need to have everything be flawless and everything be thin and that’s just not, especially for women — I’m a fan of hips and I’m a fan of breasts and a fan of owning your body and not feeling self-conscious because you have some fat. That’s sexy. Fat is sexy, to an extent. Being unhealthy is not optimal but I think it’s important to start owning ourselves.”\n\nOn wearing a bra:\n\n“I feel passionate about just shifting our paradigms and stirring things up. I’m wearing a bra now, not like a padded bra, a little sports thing, and I feel like it’s maybe important to start looking at things differently even if you don’t change the way that you do it. just look at it differently, just think about it differently, just question things that you never really questioned before.

They can also wear a plain watch.According to the norms of the faction, it is dictated that a faction member must wear at least one blue article of clothing at a time, because blue causes the body to release calming chemicals which attest to their saying, a calm mind is a clear mind.

23138,http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/the-teen-flick-divergent-isnt-just-a-hunger-games-or-twilight-clone-say-cast,entertainment,"[""Divergent, an adaptation of the hit dystopian sci-fi novel, looks set to rival Twilight and The Hunger Games for a slice of the teenage market. We talk to the film's stars Theo James and Kate Winslet.\n\nThere seems to be no quenching the thirst for bringing young-adult literature to the big screen. Following the success of the Twilight series and The Hunger Games, which together have grossed about US$5 billion (Dh18bn) in cinemas worldwide, a number of young-adult novels have been adapted by Hollywood. Beautiful Creatures, Warm Bodies, I Am Number Four, Ender’s Game and The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones – to name but five – have experienced varying success at the box office.\n\nNow comes Divergent, an adaptation of Veronica Roth’s hit dystopian sci-fi novel that looks set to rival Twilight and The Hunger Games for a slice of the oh-so-lucrative teenage market. With Insurgent and Allegiant completing Roth’s trilogy, the books so far have sold more than 5 million copies worldwide. Meanwhile, the industry paper Variety reported recently that the film could debut to a $50 million-plus opening weekend in the United States alone.\n\nCo-produced by Summit, the company behind Twilight, and Lionsgate, which bankrolled The Hunger Games, Divergent’s backers clearly have a track record in this arena. “I don’t know if it will get any Twilight comparisons, because it’s a different genre,” says the film’s 29-year-old British male lead, Theo James. “It’s sci-fi and that’s fantasy. I guess there are some parallels with Hunger Games. Mainly that it’s set in the future and it has a female lead \xadprotagonist.”\n\nThat female may not be as deadly as Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, but Beatrice “Tris” Prior (Shailene Woodley) also emerges as a “chosen one” heroine. Likewise, the film is set in a world where political oppression rules. Set in a decaying future vision of Chicago, society has been remoulded into five factions, based on personality types: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. Each teenager must join one of these factions for life.\n\nIn a world, rather like The Hunger Games, where rebellion is brewing, as James puts it: “It has this grimy feel where things are a little bit rundown and underpopulated and undernourished slightly; a sense of a society that is functioning but on the edge of a crack, or a fissure of some kind, in the social construct.”\n\nJames plays Four, an instructor in the warrior-like Dauntless faction, who mentors Tris when she joins up. “He’s a very honourable, morally centred person,” claims James.\n\nWhatever James thinks, Divergent merits comparisons to both Twilight and The Hunger Games, not least because it’s following those films’ blueprints closely. Each has hired respectable directors – names such as Catherine ardwicke, Bill Condon, Gary Ross and now Neil Burger, who made Limitless (2011) and The Illusionist (2006). Each has strong female leads; Woodley is already being dubbed the new Jennifer Lawrence. And each has plumped for British male co-stars – from Robert Pattinson and Sam Claflin to Theo James here.\n\nPerhaps the biggest coup for Divergent is scoring Kate Winslet in support (echoing The Hunger Games’s casting of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman). In a rare blockbuster outing for Winslet – arguably her first since Titanic – she plays Jeanine Matthews, the power-grasping head of the intellectual Erudite faction. “I play a real baddy. And I’m really mean,” Winslet says, with glee. “It was really, really great – just to do something so totally and utterly \xaddifferent.”\n\nIt wasn’t simply this that drew her to the film. “I completely found it fascinating. I didn’t find it in any way teen or tween. It’s quite sophisticated writing, very sophisticated themes,” she says.\n\n“And what I loved about it too is that it doesn’t matter how old you are or what’s happening in your own life, we will always all want to come from somewhere and belong somewhere, and come from something in order to count. It really taps into those values, I think, in a really clever and sometimes sinister way.”\n\nThe sinister aspect of Divergent rumbles below the surface, hinting at the Holocaust and the Nazi Final Solution in the Second World War. “It’s based on purity,” says James. “This idea [that] you have to be pure. A Divergent isn’t pure. It’s someone of mixed mental capacity. They don’t fit into one group.” This becomes clear early on when Tris takes the mandatory aptitude tests that all teens are required to complete before selecting their faction; her results suggests she is a rare species of Divergent, scoring highly in three different skill-sets.\n\nOf course, the predominantly female adolescent audience will probably be less concerned with political allegory than the blossoming romance between Tris and Four (and, in a marvellously timed piece of PR, James and Woodley are dating in real life). At least James reports that the book’s “beloved” Ferris wheel scene made it into the film intact. Shot at Chicago’s Navy Pier, it was 4am when he and Woodley climbed the structure – hardly ideal for conjuring romantic feelings. “I block it out,” he says, laughing, “and try to get as turned on as I possibly can.” Spoken like a true pro.\n\n• Divergent is out tomorrow in UAE cinemas.

Many of them believe they’re tough enough to be part of Dauntless. Apparently, it’s not as intimidating as we think.\n\nFriday, viewers will finally enter the world of Divergent. It’s set in a futuristic society where people are placed into factions according to their personalities. If you’re Divergent, you don’t fit into any one group. This is the case with the film’s main character, Tris, played by Shailene Woodley.\n\nSheKnows quizzed the cast on what faction they’d fit into and the results were surprising. They could choose from Abnegation (the selfless), Erudite (the intelligent), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful) and Candor (the honest). Most of the stars had their hearts set on Dauntless. The group isn’t for the weak and is known for breeding warriors.\n\nJai Courtney, who plays Eric, called Dauntless’s brutal training “a sifting process.” He admits, “They don’t coddle you.” Co-star Miles Teller (Peter) likens them to boot camp instructors. “It’s not a cakewalk. They do push you to the point where you break. It’s tough love.”\n\nChristian Madsen (Al) opted to look at the lighter side of the group. “If you sort of follow their non-rules then there are no rules, if you know what I mean,” he explains. “Like, the parties seem endless. Am I alone?” All joking aside, Mekhi Phifer, who plays Max, believes any actor could be on the Dauntless team. The entertainment industry can be just as intimidating if not more so.\n\n“I think to be in this business you have to be a risk-taker. I get people that come up to me sometimes and they say, ‘What advice do you have for me in this business?’ I’m like, ‘Just get out of here.’ It’s a tough racket. It’s tough,” he admits. “This is such a competitive, cutthroat sort of industry. It takes so long to sort of get to a place to where people actually know who you are where you can even get in the rooms. It’s a daunting task. ”\n\nNo pun intended.\n\nDivergent opens in theaters March 21.', 'How brave are the stars of Divergent?\nSheKnows quizzed the cast on what faction they’d fit into and the results were surprising.\nThey could choose from Abnegation (the selfless), Erudite (the intelligent), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful) and Candor (the honest).\nMost of the stars had their hearts set on Dauntless.\nAm I alone?” All joking aside, Mekhi Phifer, who plays Max, believes any actor could be on the Dauntless team.']"

In her feature, she talks shedding her possessions, the single life, her position on ""the one"" and Miley Cyrus.

Mom is a counselor, and her dad is a family therapist. They are divorced, however.\n\nShe thinks teenagers are smarter than we give them credit for.

And with a particular emphasis on the kooky, because really, she just put her vagina out there mid-conversation and that\'s something your aunt Pat would do:\n\n""[One] thing I like to do is give my vagina a little vitamin D. I was reading an article written by an herbalist about yeast infections and other genital issues. She said there\'s nothing better than vitamin D.

Or, if you live in a place that has heavy winters, when the sun finally comes out, spread your legs and get some sunshine.""\n\nSo go look for Shailene at your local nude beach, I suppose. And while you\'re there, ask her about CLAY. She has a great story about clay, which she eats:\n\n""I first heard about the benefits of eating clay from a taxi driver. He was African and was saying that, where he\'s from, the women eat clay when they\'re pregnant. Seriously—ask your taxi drivers where they are from and about their customs. You will learn a lot. So, I\'ve discovered that clay is great for you because your body doesn\'t absorb it, and it apparently provides a negative charge, so it bonds to negative isotopes. And, this is crazy: it also helps clean heavy metals out of your body. My friend starting eating it and the next day she called me and said, \'Dude, my shit smells like metal.\' She was really worried, but we did some research together and everything said that when you first start eating clay, your bowel movements, pee, and even you, yourself, will smell like metal.""\n\nAlso, Shailene shampoos her hair once a month.

But that’s only the beginning.\n\nWoodley is more magical nymph than Hollywood starlet; even Jennifer Lawrence’s relatable clumsiness can’t hold a candle to Shailene’s lovable kookiness. So after reading the Divergent star’s latest awesome interview, we decided to compile the Shailene-iest quotes she’s ever given. Check out what the offbeat actress has said about eating clay (yes, for real) and giving up Instagram below:\n\nOn eating clay: “Clay is one of the best things you can put in your body… My friend starting eating it and the next day she called me and said, ‘Dude, my s— smells like metal.’ She was really worried, but we did some research together and everything said that when you first start eating clay, your bowel movements, pee, and even you, yourself, will smell like metal.” (Into the Gloss)\n\nOn giving up Instagram: “Everything I was posting was for a story — like, ‘Look how interesting I am.’ It felt disgusting to me. It feels as though we’re so detached from actual human connection. And I got rid of my phone, too. We’re all such narcissists, and that’s what social media caters to. Our society conditions us to be our own planets, which is great. Independent thinking is so important. But we expect everyone around us to be our moons.” (Marie Claire)\n\nOn religion: “My religion is the Earth, man. I believe in trees.” (Hollywood Reporter)\n\nOn waking up: “The second I wake up, I scream very loudly [sings to the tune of “Good Morning” from Singin’ in the Rain], “Good morning! Good morning!” And then I scream out, “Exciting day! Exciting day!” I feel like it completely sets the mood for the whole day.” (Interview)\n\nOn hugging to the left: “I feel like inherently we go to the other side, the right, but what’s that about? Maybe it says something about our society that we go to the right and not to the heart. Heart to heart, man!” (The Tonight Show)\n\nOn lucid dreaming: “There is an herb called mugwort that I’ve tried, which is supposed to help enhance dreams. You can burn a little before bed or sleep on a mugwort pillow. It’s found in all parts of America, East Coast and West — anytime you see weeds growing through cracks in a parking lot, there’s probably mugwort. You can harvest it yourself, dry it, bundle it, and burn it like sage.” (Harper’s Bazaar)\n\nOn enjoying life: “Well, I realized — and this is just like in my personal life, too — we have a set number of days to live, you know? Or like, whatever, breaths to breathe. And you’ve got to enjoy all of them, even in the moments where you’re like, “I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to do this.” Am I going to complain about it? No. I’m going to f—ing make it fun.” (Huffington Post)\n\nOn Sundance: “This is sort of a materialistic tradition, but every year for Sundance, my friends and I road trip out here. It’s a special time where we give each other our time and space and existence.” (The Daily Beast)\n\nOn making medicine: “I make my own medicines; I don’t get those from doctors. I make my own cheese and forage wild foods and identify wild plants. It’s an entire lifestyle. It’s appealing to my soul.” (Flaunt)', 'Woodley is more magical nymph than Hollywood starlet; even Jennifer Lawrence’s relatable clumsiness can’t hold a candle to Shailene’s lovable kookiness.\nSo after reading the Divergent star’s latest awesome interview, we decided to compile the Shailene-iest quotes she’s ever given.\nI believe in trees.” (Hollywood Reporter)On waking up: “The second I wake up, I scream very loudly [sings to the tune of “Good Morning” from Singin’ in the Rain], “Good morning!\nGood morning!” And then I scream out, “Exciting day!\nHeart to heart, man!” (The Tonight Show)On lucid dreaming: “There is an herb called mugwort that I’ve tried, which is supposed to help enhance dreams.']"

As Four, meanwhile, James manages the considerable accomplishment of seeming like a real grown-up man rather than a teenage girl\'s image of a dreamy boy, and he makes the character\'s transformation from hardass to collaborator seem natural, if inevitable."" —Todd Gilchrist, The Playlist\n\n\'Clearing its throat\'\n\n\n\n""Even though it stretches to nearly two-and-a-half hours and concludes with an extended gun battle, by the time \'Divergent\' ends, it still seems to be in the process of clearing its throat.

But despite the hype that dystopian Chicago film has bought, two things remained certain: First, those who read the trilogy say that the book is better than director Neil Burger\'s interpretation of the series. Second, Shailene Woodley\'s performance is terrific as the heroine, Tris Prior.\n\nIn an interview with MTV, Woodley said that she wanted to make sure that the film would feel authentic for the audience. ""He has to take his shirt off in that scene and we didn\'t want it to feel like, oh, attractive male lead taking his shirt off in a young adult franchise.""\n\nDespite the actors\' efforts, the critics are not very fond of the film, with The Hollywood Reporter saying that ""director Neil Burger struggles to fuse philosophy, awkward romance and brutal action.

The film was shot in Chicago. It was really cool to see how Chicago would look like in the future. The Chicago scenery was beautiful. The acting was right on for stars that are somewhat starting out their acting careers. The film had action, romance and adventure something for everybody.

23186,http://nypost.com/2014/03/15/divergent-delivers-crazy-stunts-in-a-new-kind-of-action-film/,entertainment,"['One pivotal stunt in the new franchise-starter “Divergent” involves a group of actors running alongside and jumping onto a train speeding by at 30 mph. When they arrive at their destination, they descend from the still-moving train in an orderly fashion, of course — by jumping over a 10-foot gap onto a rooftop.\n\n“That’s where some of them didn’t make it and hit the wall,” admits the film’s stunt coordinator Garrett Warren. “But nobody went to the hospital!”\n\nBased on the first book of a series by Veronica Roth that has sold more than 10 million copies, “Divergent” is poised to become the next blockbuster young-adult adaptation — a la “The Hunger Games” — when it hits theaters Friday. The dystopian film stars Shailene Woodley as Tris Prior, a 16-year-old in a society that separates its members by factions based on their predominant character traits.\n\nWhen Tris takes the required aptitude test to determine which faction she belongs in, she discovers she is “divergent,” meaning she fits into more than one category and is thus considered a danger to the societal structure. She leaves the selfless, submissive Abnegation faction she was born into and joins the Dauntless — those who value bravery above all else. Along the way, she meets initiate trainer and leader Four (Theo James). With his help, she must discover who she is and what that means for her future.\n\nThe Dauntless are the gated city’s protectors, which meant that, in addition to spectacle stunts, Warren had to train the actors in hand-to-hand combat, shooting and knife-throwing. For this he enlisted JJ Perry, who spent four years in the US Army, as fight coordinator.\n\nPerry led the cast’s boot camp — a three-week training course that began before filming.\n\n“The first week, I just hazed them, ground them into dust,” he says.\n\n“ ‘I’m the drill sergeant and you’re my privates. You’re going to do what I tell you to do, or I’m going to knock your d–k in the dirt.’ ”\n\nAfter breaking them down, Perry built the actors back up, teaching them the specific fight choreography they’d need captured in their scenes. At the request of director Neil Burger, Warren designed a unique fight style for the film — something that would feel realistic and visceral, but could have been developed by this futuristic society separated from the rest of the world by gates.\n\nWarren considered everything from the moves in old Muay Thai movies to the tight-to-the-face boxing style favored in the “Bourne” films. But his greatest influence turned out to be George Foreman.\n\n“He had this really unorthodox kind of stance, called the peek-a-boo fighting stance,” explains Warren. “He held his hands in front of his body like he’s hugging himself almost and would just look through his arms or over his arms. You’d say, ‘That’s just stupid, he’s going to get hit.’ In fact, he was able to hurt people.”\n\nWoodley says the fighting was the most difficult for her, particularly when she had to fight James.\n\n“He is incredibly strong, and a boxer in real life, so his sheer strength and intensity was intimidating,” she says. “I had to be sure to be fully alert and aware when sparring with him.”\n\nThe Dauntless also have a flair for knife-throwing, which proved to be one of the hardest tasks — both for the actors (Zoë Kravitz, who plays one of Tris’ fellow initiates, particularly struggled) and for the trainers.\n\n“Knife-throwing for me, it’s a circus act,” says Perry. “It’s really hard to make it stick. If it bounces off [someone’s] chest, they’ll pick it up and run over and stab you with it.”\n\nTo train his pupils, Perry moved them incrementally back — from 4 feet to 12 feet — from their targets, to allow the knife a full turn and a half before, hopefully, sticking in the target. It was so difficult, 100 percent wasn’t even the goal.\n\n“[James and Woodley] were sticking them probably 2 or 3 for 5 every times, which is outrageous for only having a month and a half of training,” says Perry.\n\nThe Dauntless are also known for their reckless abandon, which meant lots of stunts — jumping from roofs, climbing to extreme heights, zip-lining across the Chicago skyline.\n\n“This [movie] had so many different things going on,” says Alicia Vela-Bailey, Woodley’s stunt double. “High free-falling, underwater stuff, fighting, working with animals, climbing a Ferris wheel. It kept you on your toes.”\n\nIn one scene, Tris has to jump off a 74-foot ledge — a height that required Woodley to sit out for insurance reasons. But even seasoned double Vela-Bailey had never done a free fall that high. Add in winds of up to 20 mph that could throw a fall off course, and you’ve got quite the feat.\n\n“We were using a seat drop, so you had to step off with your feet forward, and land on your back,” says Warren. “It took us about two weeks to train her. ”\n\nThe film’s 30 or so background stunt people also had their fair share of epic jumps — including off that train onto a hill, which meant they were airborne for 16 to 20 feet before landing on their feet. Warren enlisted parkour professionals for some of the most difficult shots.\n\nHe and Perry both agree though, that seeing the lead actors perform their work for the camera was when they were most proud.\n\n”There’s this moment when [James] beats two guys up. I was in the monitor room, egging him on, ‘Come on, bro, let’s go!’ ” says Perry. “He really put a beating on those guys. One of those guys was limping for like three days. It was beautiful.”', 'One pivotal stunt in the new franchise-starter “Divergent” involves a group of actors running alongside and jumping onto a train speeding by at 30 mph.\n“That’s where some of them didn’t make it and hit the wall,” admits the film’s stunt coordinator Garrett Warren.\nThe dystopian film stars Shailene Woodley as Tris Prior, a 16-year-old in a society that separates its members by factions based on their predominant character traits.\nShe leaves the selfless, submissive Abnegation faction she was born into and joins the Dauntless — those who value bravery above all else.\nThe Dauntless are the gated city’s protectors, which meant that, in addition to spectacle stunts, Warren had to train the actors in hand-to-hand combat, shooting and knife-throwing.']"

She doesn\'t have a bow-and-arrow, but rather a fearlessness verging on suicidal — she leaps off tall buildings and enters the ring with nothing but her bare fists. While clearly following in Katniss\'s footsteps, Woodley takes her character\'s physical displays to levels even beyond the heights Jennifer Lawrence has scaled.\n\nBut who is the greatest young heroine? Here\'s how the two compare:\n\n[Related: 5 Reasons \'Divergent\' Is Not Just Some \'Hunger Games\' Redux]\n\nTris sees more action. Lawrence\'s ""Hunger Games"" warrior is savvy and impressive. And yes, like Tris, she goes through the ringer. But if you line up the two for a scene-for-scene comparison, Woodley\'s Tris gets into far more action.\n\n""It would be an epic battle and I\'d like to see it,"" said Woodley\'s ""Divergent"" love interest Theo James of a Tris vs. Katniss scenario during a recent interview with Yahoo Movies.\n\nWoodley, who was actually convinced by Lawrence to take on the role, shied away from comparisons. But, she told Yahoo during an interview with the cast at the film\'s press day, she found the experience to be ""powerful"" and ""special."" Advantage: Tris\n\n[Related: Unfiltered Fun From #Divergent\'s Week-Long Instagram Takeover]\n\nTris loses. Woodley\'s character falls far short of the spotless victory record achieved by Katniss — who has now survived two deadly Hunger Games tournaments unscathed on the big screen.\n\n""Tris, in this [first installment], is an initiate. She\'s just started her training,"" said Mekhi Phifer, who plays the head of the soldier faction called Dauntless. If it came down to a battle, Phifer reluctantly admitted to Yahoo Movies that Tris wouldn\'t win: ""As of now, I would have to go with Katniss."" Advantage: Katniss\n\nTris gets laid out. Her losses are dramatic in ""Divergent."" Tony Goldwyn, who plays Tris\'s father, explained it to us: ""Tris starts out as someone who is not powerful, in fact, the opposite. When she gets into Dauntless and is forced into this initiation, she gets her ass kicked — and it\'s violent and brutal.""\n\nIn one sequence, when Tris faces off with Peter (Miles Teller), she gets knocked out cold for several hours. Beaten and bruised, she\'s in much worse shape than we\'ve ever seen Katniss — who has sustained a few scratches here and there. Advantage: Katniss\n\n[Related: Theo James Is the \'Perfect Warrior\' in \'Divergent\']\n\nTris invites danger. Unlike Katniss, Tris willingly leaves her rather docile faction, Abnegation, to try out for Dauntless — a group that scales buildings without harnesses, regularly jumps on and off moving trains, and generally values dangerous, daredevil deeds. Katniss only confronts danger when she is forced to; if given the choice, she would do away with the gory games altogether.\n\nAs much as Tris proves to be a scrapper in ""Divergent,"" it\'s still not a fair fight between she and the much more experienced Katniss. We\'ll have to revisit this faceoff when Tris\'s skills are more developed in the sequel, ""Insurgent,"" in theaters exactly a year from now. Advantage: Tris\n\nThe victor remains: Katniss Everdeen.\n\n""I want to know who\'s going to pick up the scraps there and write the spinoff where they come together,"" joked ""Divergent"" star Jai Courtney, who plays a ruthless Dauntless leader.\n\n""Divergent"" punches its way into theaters on March 21.\n\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@meriahonfiah)', 'When it comes to the leading ladies of ""Divergent"" and ""The Hunger Games"" everyone agrees: They\'re not fooling around.\nHere\'s how the two compare:[Related: 5 Reasons \'Divergent\' Is Not Just Some \'Hunger Games\' Redux]Tris sees more action.\nLawrence\'s ""Hunger Games"" warrior is savvy and impressive.\nBut if you line up the two for a scene-for-scene comparison, Woodley\'s Tris gets into far more action.\n""It would be an epic battle and I\'d like to see it,"" said Woodley\'s ""Divergent"" love interest Theo James of a Tris vs. Katniss scenario during a recent interview with Yahoo Movies.']"

But this is still an entertaining movie.\n\nOf course, ""The Muppets,"" the brilliant — yes, brilliant — film from 2011, wasn\'t the first time the felt-and-fur favorites made a film (the song makes note of this), but it was the first one in a while. And with Jason Segel, who also co-wrote the script, and Amy Adams on board, it soared.\n\nThey\'re both gone for ""Muppets Most Wanted."" Which is OK — the movies are based on a television show that featured a revolving door of guests, after all. Co-writer Nicholas Stoller returns, however, as does director James Bobin, who wrote this one with Stoller.\n\nBut, although this movie has lots of laughs and a willingness to poke fun at itself, it doesn\'t quite recapture the magic of the last movie. Close, but not quite.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 movie puppets\n\nThe new film begins immediately after the last one ends (we even see the backs of stand-ins for Segel and Adams). Kermit (voice of Steve Whitmire) and the gang are still buzzing with the success of getting everyone back together, so they decide that they need to keep the momentum going.\n\nKermit thinks the act needs polishing, but the Muppets are quickly recruited by an agent, played by Ricky Gervais with gleeful malice, named Dominic Badguy. (Pronounced ""bad-gee,"" he explains, because it\'s French. Uh-huh.)\n\nDominic thinks they need to immediately begin an ambitious world tour, playing top venues in international cities, all of which happen to be next to banks or art museums or other places cops might call ""high-value targets.""\n\nThat\'s because Dominic is actually scheming with his boss, Constantine (Matt Vogel), the world\'s most dangerous frog and most-wanted criminal, who is a dead-ringer for Kermit.\n\nConstantine has been held in a gulag in Siberia, run by Nadya (Tina Fey, barking orders in a stern Russian accent). But he escapes and soon swaps places with Kermit, who is sent back to the gulag, where he helps Nadya organize the talent show to be put on by the fearsome criminals. If you don\'t think seeing Danny Trejo do a song-and-dance number is funny, then this probably isn\'t the movie for you. But it\'s pretty great.\n\nMeanwhile, back in various European cities, the Muppets don\'t seem to notice that ""Kermit"" now speaks with a Russian accent, suffers from stage fright and, most obvious of all, is willing to commit to marriage with Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson).\n\nAs Dominic and Constantine carry out their plan, CIA agent Sam Eagle (Jacobson) and French Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) are on their trail, sort of. In a recurring bit that\'s actually quite funny, Jean Pierre, being French, takes a lot of time off, with lunch breaks, vacations, etc.\n\nHonestly, though, the plot is, as you might expect, just a reason to make one joke after another, and most hit their target. Bobin wisely doesn\'t let anything get in the way of that. There is also an absolute mob of big stars making cameos, whose identities won\'t be revealed here because that kills the fun. (Do keep an eye out for the Great Escapo, though.)\n\n""The Muppets"" was a blast out of nowhere, the return, with appropriate updating, of a venerable (read: old) franchise. ""Muppets Most Wanted"" by definition can\'t bring that same welcome shock to the system. But it\'s not for lack of trying, and it definitely makes you hope the franchise continues.\n\nReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz@arizonarepublic.com. Facebook: facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

23198,http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/movie-review-muppets-most-wanted.html,entertainment,"['Photo: Jay Maidment/Disney\n\nThree years ago, when The Muppets injected new cinematic life into Jim Henson’s long-dormant creation, it did so with equal doses of parody and pathos. James Bobin’s reboot was knowingly frivolous — at times, it barely seemed to hold together as a movie — but it also milked the genuine nostalgic power of its plot, which built up to a climactic, cathartic performance of The Muppet Show itself. The kids in the audience may have wondered why their parents were both singing along and crying at the same time.\n\nIt’d be impossible to replicate that earlier film’s unique trajectory; after all, it had to reintroduce the homespun, ambling charm of the Muppets to a world more familiar with slick CGI and 3-D animation. But any hope you may have had that Muppets Most Wanted would take these characters in any direction besides the most predictable is quickly scuttled with the new film’s opening number, “We’re Doing a Sequel,” in which our heroes sing, “We’re doing a sequel/That’s what we do in Hollywood/And everybody knows/The sequel’s never quite as good.”\n\nRelated Stories 20 Amazing Musical Numbers From The Muppet Show\n\nIt’s funny ’cause it’s true, and Muppets Most Wanted pretty much exists on the self-aware level of that lyric throughout — charming, but uninspired. This time, no longer worried about reuniting or reintroducing themselves, the Muppets are on a world tour with their new manager, played by Ricky Gervais and named Dominic Badguy (ha-ha). Halfway across the world, however, Constantine, the world’s most dangerous frog and a Kermit look-alike, escapes from a Siberian gulag. Soon enough, Constantine has taken over the Muppets, and Kermit has been shipped to the gulag, where he has to contend with a warden played by Tina Fey (who looks awfully fetching in an ushanka, for some reason).\n\nMeanwhile, pretending to be Kermit, Constantine uses the world tour as a cover to stage an elaborate, multi-nation jewel heist. Of course, the evil frog’s evil accent threatens to get in the way. Between Constantine’s Dracula-like vocal stylings, Fey’s gulag warden, and Ty Burrell’s Parisian detective, the film pretty much weaponizes bad accent jokes. The throwaway gags work best, which is typical of the Muppets: Upon seeing a German sign for the show advertising, “Die Muppets,” Statler and Waldorf muse, “Looks like they put the reviews up early.”\n\nAs always, cameos abound: Christoph Waltz shows up to dance the waltz, while Salma Hayek attempts to do an indoor Running of the Bulls. Saoirse Ronan has five seconds as a ballerina; Chloe Moretz has two as a Russian newsie. Some of these are pointless, some are funny: Tom Hiddleston, playing a gulag escape artist named Escapo, is probably the funniest, but I also appreciated seeing Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo singing and dancing up a storm as gulag prisoners. Anyway, like they said in Wag the Dog, “It’s a pageant.”\n\nAs for the actual human performances: Fey probably comes off the best, in part because her character has slightly more to do, and she’s a more versatile actress. Gervais is his usual insincere self, but he’s stuck in a part that doesn’t quite play to his strengths as a master of embarrassment comedy. Why not give a role like this to someone who can properly go big, like a John Malkovich or a Richard E. Grant (who played a not-entirely-dissimilar character in Spice World)?\n\nBut of course, unlike with the previous film, the human characters are mere accessories here — familiar live faces to go along with the familiar felt ones. Indeed, it’s like the reboot never happened. Muppets Most Wanted feels like a film that could have easily been made back during the days of The Muppet Christmas Carol or Muppet Treasure Island. It’s not bad, exactly; the songs are catchy, the cameos are okay, and some of the jokes work fine. Set your expectations super-low, and you’ll probably be fine.', 'The kids in the audience may have wondered why their parents were both singing along and crying at the same time.\nHalfway across the world, however, Constantine, the world’s most dangerous frog and a Kermit look-alike, escapes from a Siberian gulag.\nMeanwhile, pretending to be Kermit, Constantine uses the world tour as a cover to stage an elaborate, multi-nation jewel heist.\nBetween Constantine’s Dracula-like vocal stylings, Fey’s gulag warden, and Ty Burrell’s Parisian detective, the film pretty much weaponizes bad accent jokes.\nMuppets Most Wanted feels like a film that could have easily been made back during the days of The Muppet Christmas Carol or Muppet Treasure Island.']"

A charming, delightfully upbeat film packed with memorable songs from Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie, it served as both an accessible introduction for newcomers and fan service to those who grew up with Jim Henson's endearing creations.\n\nFollow-up Muppets Most Wanted begins just seconds after its predecessor, with the gang still basking in the glory of their show-stopping Hollywood performance. When they realise the cameras are still rolling, opening number 'We're Doing a Sequel' kicks in to set up a continental caper that sees Kermit replaced as the Muppets' figurehead by his sinister Russian doppelganger Constantine.\n\nRicky Gervais takes the (human) lead here as Dominic Badguy (pronounced Bad-gee), the second-in-command to Constantine who pinballs across Europe with the Muppets using their tour as a cover to execute a number of jewel heists. As the caper unfolds, Kermit, having been mistaken for Constantine, finds himself imprisoned in a Russian Gulag by Tina Fey's Nadya, while Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) teams up with CIA agent Sam the Eagle to catch the thieves in the act.\n\nDisney\n\n\n\nWhere The Muppets wrapped wistful nostalgia around smartly-scripted meta humour, Most Wanted is a more conventional series outing that brings the eponymous stars front and centre. Gervais, more in the Charles Grodin mould than his everyman predecessor Segel, is the strongest presence among all the three leads. His Dominic makes for an amusingly sly counterpoint to our earnest felt friends, and he even commits to an ambitious song-and-dance number that sees him bust out some David Brent-style dance moves.\n\nThe three-pronged narrative means that Fey and Burrell don't fare quite so well, finding themselves with less screen time than Gervais and leaning heavily on the comedy Euro accents. Nevertheless, the gags fly thick and fast and more often than not hit the target in spite of the patchwork nature of the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuppets Most Wanted is gleefully entertaining from start to finish, the kind of film that'll quickly put a grin on your face that won't subside until long after the credits roll.\n\n\n\nKermit's attempted prison break, which tips its hat to The Shawshank Redemption, and fellow inmates (among them Danny Trejo, Jemaine Clement and Ray Liotta) are highlights. Burrell also makes the most of his bumbling Clouseau-esque Frenchman, playing on awkward Anglo-American relations with his eagle co-star.\n\nMuppets Most Wanted is gleefully entertaining from start to finish, the kind of film that'll quickly put a grin on your face that won't subside until long after the credits roll. Director Bobin is able to carry over the feeling of warmth and cosy familiarity from the previous film into a fast and funny Muppets-led adventure.\n\nMcKenzie's songs aren't quite as good as last time, but the film is so fleet-footed and fun it hardly matters. If you're amused by the idea of Christoph Waltz dancing the waltz, Swedish chef re-enacting The Seventh Seal and Miss Piggy performing a duet with Celine Dion, then this is a sequel that won't disappoint."", ""Follow-up Muppets Most Wanted begins just seconds after its predecessor, with the gang still basking in the glory of their show-stopping Hollywood performance.\nDisneyWhere The Muppets wrapped wistful nostalgia around smartly-scripted meta humour, Most Wanted is a more conventional series outing that brings the eponymous stars front and centre.\nMuppets Most Wanted is gleefully entertaining from start to finish, the kind of film that'll quickly put a grin on your face that won't subside until long after the credits roll.\nMuppets Most Wanted is gleefully entertaining from start to finish, the kind of film that'll quickly put a grin on your face that won't subside until long after the credits roll.\nDirector Bobin is able to carry over the feeling of warmth and cosy familiarity from the previous film into a fast and funny Muppets-led adventure.""]"

In Muppets: Most Wanted, the fuzzy stars of the long-running franchise team up with the likes of Tina Fey, Ricky Gervais and Ty Burell on a cross-continental hunt for a high-profile jewel thief – who just happens to look a lot like Kermit the Frog.\n\n\n\nSo far, the critics are divided on Muppets: Most Wanted.\n\nWith two days left until the premiere, the movie is already a hit, as far as early reviews are concerned. Without going into too much spoiler-y detail, The Wrap’s review promises self aware jokes and absurdist plot twists – just what we’ve come to expect from the Muppets. It’s not a universal hit – THR’s review is one of a few negative ones, pegging MMW as “an oddly off-key follow-up to the generally amusing 2011 feature”.\n\nWatch the MMW trailer below.\n\n\n\nBut with a 76% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and constant promotion , which has been going on for months now, Muppets: Most Wanted is pretty much a guaranteed hit. For Kermit the Frog, who has been doing the usual press rounds this week, everything is much simpler. He is a master actor, after all, as we learned in the frog’s recent Reuters interview (along with his puppeteer, Steve Whitmire.)\n\n“Well, listen, people think that frogs are wimpy little creatures,"" Kermit explains. ""That you can just step on, you know?

Press releases on new superhero adventures are practically a constant.\n\nSo it\'s no surprise that, after ""The Muppets"" turned out to be a successful revival back in 2011, the little green frog and his heartfelt friends would all come back for more too. After all, there\'s still money to be made.\n\nWhat is surprising is that it\'s not just a cash grab.\n\nThe new movie, ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" isn\'t as hip as the last one, which opened with a sarcastically sunny number and kept its ironic tongue in cheek throughout. Neither does it have Jason Segel, who had co-written and starred, and often put himself centerstage.\n\nAnd that\'s OK with me.\n\nInstead, the new film feels a little more like a look back to earlier installments like ""The Great Muppet Caper,"" which were less self-referential than just plain silly, with a variety of old-time guest stars (mostly in unexpected cameos) fearlessly joining in the childlike fun.\n\nThe movie, which relies more on music than most Muppet films, starts with a big production number about sequels (which, it cheerfully admits, are ""never as good""), then moves to a confidently corny plot about an international master criminal, who just happens to be a dead ringer for Kermit.\n\nAnd in a flash there\'s a frognapping — and poor Kermie is off to prison (actually, the gulag) while the devilish Constantine is leading the Muppets on a European concert tour (which conveniently hits a string of cities with some begging-to-be-robbed museums).\n\nAdmittedly, most of the songs — which range from quiet-storm soul to some Celine-Dion-ish ballads — go on too long. And the movie itself is too loud, with one explosion after another. (Although a particular projectionist who clearly had the dials turned up to 11 didn\'t help.)\n\nBut as the human villains, Ricky Gervais is surprisingly bearable and Tina Fey — as a prettier Rosa Klebb — is very funny. And although some of the big celebrity cameos fall flat (Chloe Moretz? So?) a lot of them, particularly once we get to the Russian prison, are delightful.\n\nOf course it\'s the most fun for Muppets fans. But if you don\'t love the chipper Kermit, the self-involved Miss Piggy, the sweetly foggy Fozzie — not to mention the hard-to-explain Beaker, Animal and the Great Gonzo — well, please, sit over there. I don\'t think I quite trust you.\n\nBut if you do — well, then you\'ll probably be glad to see them back. And agree with Disney that — as long as they keep the quality up, and the guest stars coming back - it is easy being green. Or at least raking it in.\n\nRatings note: The film contains some violence.\n\n\'Muppets Most Wanted\' (PG) Disney (112 min.)\n\nDirected by James Bobin. With The Muppets, Tina Fey, Ricky Gervais.

Are you aware of Bollywood?A. Yes, I\'m very aware of the Bollywood industry. In London, I lived in Brick Lane for 10 years, so I watched a lot of films in local restaurants...usually, quite bright classic 1960s or 1970s films, but in more recent times I\'m a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan and think Irrfan Khan is great - would love to do something with either.Q. What do you think audiences in India will like about ""Muppets Most Wanted""?A. For any audience, spending 90 minutes of your time with the Muppets should be chaotic, colourful, musical fun - so I hope people in India will like that.Q.Some people feel characters like the Muppets only appeal to kids. Do you agree?A. When Jim Henson created the \'Muppet Show\' back in the 1970s, he very much squarely aimed at everybody - it was on in the evening in Britain and the US - and therefore really targeted at adults. But children of course also loved it because it was puppets and because it was silly fun.I sort of feel the same now and ensure it works just as well for the 40-year-old me as it does for my six-year-old daughter. And I really think \'Muppets Most Wanted\' does that. Adults, I hope, will love it.Q. What inspired you to do a sequel to ""The Muppets""?A. I wanted to tell the story of \'what happened next\'... having got the Muppets back together again in the 2011 film, I really wanted to explore where they would go and what they would do next. And of course, we do this quite literally in the film!Q. In what ways does the new movie up the ante in terms of the entertainment it offers?A. I think it offers more scope and scale...this one feels as if we are following different stories across a variety of international locations - London, Berlin, Madrid, Dublin, Siberia...I also think it is more of an out and out comedy. It probably has a higher joke count!Q. Where was the film shot?A. We shot the film primarily in Britain - with a few days on stage in Los Angeles. But the vast majority was at Pinewood Studios in London and on location in and around London.Q. What do you think audiences will enjoy most about ""Muppets Most Wanted""?A. I hope they like all of it - the songs, the laughs, and the heart. Emotion is a very important part of any Muppet movie - you really care for the whole Muppet gang and I\'m really pleased that people really have fond memories of them from their childhood.Q. Will we see more Muppets movies in the near future?A. I certainly hope so.

She and all other 16-year-olds must undergo a grueling test to determine each teen’s place within society. Factions include: Abnegation (the selfless leaders); Amity (the peaceful); Candor (the truthful); Dauntless (the brave); and Erudite (the knowledgeable). A rare “Divergent,” Beatrice fits several factions, choosing the Dauntless, where she trains as a warrior. Though brutalized by peers doubting her worthiness, Beatrice forms a connection with her protective instructor Tobias (Theo James). Upon graduation from training, Beatrice and Tobias uncover a plot to kill all Divergents after the Erudites force the Dauntless to seize control from the Abnegation faction.

Badguy sells the Muppets on doing a European tour, though the furry ones are unaware they’ll perform in theaters adjacent to the museums Constantine plans to rob during Muppet shows. Once overseas, Kermit is mistaken for the thief and is arrested, then imprisoned in Siberia. His prison guard is ruthless Nadya (Tina Fey), but her weakness for Broadway musicals presents Kermit’s one hope of escape. Constantine, posing as Kermit, has arranged to marry Miss Piggy at the Tower of London, where the thief means to steal the Crown Jewels. Though the film’s humans are weighed down by tedious characterizations, snappy songs bolster the Muppets’ likability. Ty Burrell appears as Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon, and if you don’t blink, you’ll catch cameos by Sean “Diddy” Combs, Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis.

(Is there any other kind of French detective since Inspector Clouseau?)\n\nAnd just to be safe, let’s throw in Ray Liotta, Jemaine Clement, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek, Celine Dion, Christoph Waltz, Tom Hiddleston and a few more big-name celebs we won’t tell you about.\n\nAs for a plot, that was the real question.\n\nThe beloved franchise had been rebooted in 2011 with “The Muppets,” starring Jason Segel and Amy Adams in a story about getting the old gang back together — Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal and Gonzo, along with a new character named Walter.\n\nUp until then, Walt Disney Studios, which had owned the Muppets since 2004, wasn’t sure to do with them. Then Segel — fresh off the success of “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” — pitched the idea for the film and co-wrote the script with “Marshall” director Nicholas Stoller. “The Muppets” was directed by James Bobin, co-creator of HBO’s satirical musical-comedy sitcom “Flight of the Conchords.”\n\nIt grossed around $88 million at the box office, and Bret McKenzie, the “Conchords” actor-musician who wrote the tunes for the film, won an Oscar for the song “Man or Muppet.”\n\nThe film’s success left everybody wondering what to do for a follow-up, which is exactly where the new movie, “Muppets Most Wanted,” opening today, picks up. The Muppets, along with the human stars, were in Beverly Hills last week to promote the film.\n\n“We wanted to have the movie start with the same problem we had,” says Bobin, who wrote the “Most Wanted” script with Stoller. To get started, they had McKenzie write a song called “They’ve Ordered a Sequel” with the line “Muppets Again,” the original working title.\n\n“Then the marketing department changed the title,” wryly notes the composer, who wrote most of the tunes in the new film. When that happened, they tried to substitute “It’s the Muppets Most W-a-a-a-nted” into the song. McKenzie sings to demonstrate, but it obviously didn’t work.\n\nCreated by Jim Henson, who died in 1990, the Muppets have long been known for their parodies, even when they first appeared on PBS’ “Sesame Street” in 1969.\n\n“We saw this as a chance to go wilder,” says “Most Wanted” producer Todd Lieberman.\n\nSo the filmmakers turned to two well-known movie devices. Long a fan of movies like “The Pink Panther,” Bobin wanted to make it a fun caper movie, and then added the old mistaken-identity trope.\n\nIn “Most Wanted,” it turns out that Kermit has an evil doppelganger named Constantine, imprisoned in a Serbian gulag. The only difference between them is a small mole that the criminal mastermind has. He even sounds like a Soviet über-bad guy from the Cold War.\n\nGervais’ Badguy, posing as a theatrical manager, persuades the Muppets to go on an international tour. There’s an escape, a switch and soon Kermit finds himself in the gulag with tough guys Liotta, Clement (the other half of the “Flight of the Conchords” duo) and Trejo — playing, naturally, Danny Trejo — under the watchful and occasionally lustful eye of Fey’s Nadya.\n\nMeanwhile, using green makeup to cover the mole, Constantine poses as Kermit, and — despite the accent — nobody seems to notice. As the Muppets barnstorm Europe, he and Badguy pull heists in pursuit of long-lost treasure.\n\nOnce upon a time, entertainment trade papers would trumpet the success of something with the term that it “has legs.” Well, the Muppets do have legs in the movies, thanks to CGI.\n\nThis allows the Muppets to take part in a lot of song-and-dance numbers in the film. None, however, may top the indescribable vision of Liotta, Clement, Trejo and the other convicts putting their all into “I Hope I Get It” from “A Chorus Line.”\n\nBad guys Gervais and Constantine get to do their own nifty steps in McKenzie’s “My Name First ___ Your Name.”\n\nThe comedian and creator of “The Office” says the singing didn’t worry him — “I’m a secret pop star” — but the dancing did a bit.\n\n“I don’t move well, but it doesn’t matter,” Gervais says. “I’m with a frog.”\n\nEver the wit, Gervais wondered what an offspring from Kermit and Miss Piggy might look like.\n\n“An abomination?” injects Fey.\n\n“We actually haven’t consummated the experiment,” Kermit admits soberly. (Of course, we know that today, as ever, there is someone working the puppets while making those jokes.)\n\n“I never realized how overrated I was until you go out and do a scene with somebody who is doing eight things at once,” Burrell says in admiration for the puppeteers. “All I had to do was remember my words, and I failed miserably.”\n\nAs in any Muppets film, “Most Wanted” is aimed as much at adults as children, combining silliness with a sense of the absurd. Some of the humor may seem more for parents, but Fey, who cracks “as of this morning, I had two kids,” says children “take pride in getting the jokes.”\n\nOne subplot in the film about paying off critics brings the only somewhat serious moment to the day when Gervais is asked if he is concerned about good reviews for “Most Wanted.”\n\n“If you’re worried about pleasing people it will drive you mad,” he says. “Now with Facebook, everyone’s a journalist. Everyone’s a critic. It’s like glorified graffiti. If you care about that, you might as well go around to every toilet wall in the world and get offended when they mention you.\n\n“Now, having said just that,” he adds, “say nice (expletive) things about me.”', 'Then there’s Tina Fey as Siberian gulag warden Nadya, a closet Broadway musicals lover who has the hots for Kermit the Frog.\n“We wanted to have the movie start with the same problem we had,” says Bobin, who wrote the “Most Wanted” script with Stoller.\nIn “Most Wanted,” it turns out that Kermit has an evil doppelganger named Constantine, imprisoned in a Serbian gulag.\n“I’m with a frog.”Ever the wit, Gervais wondered what an offspring from Kermit and Miss Piggy might look like.\n“All I had to do was remember my words, and I failed miserably.”As in any Muppets film, “Most Wanted” is aimed as much at adults as children, combining silliness with a sense of the absurd.']"

These guys don”t even age. Kermit the Frog remains as constant as true north. Miss Piggy is as maddeningly Piggy-like as she was when Jimmy Carter was president. And Animal was, is and forever will be looking for the next opportunity for a drum solo.\n\n“Muppets: Most Wanted,” the eighth movie in the franchise that began in 1979, contains exactly zero surprises, and that”s a good thing. If you”re bored by the Muppets” shtick, may we suggest looking elsewhere for novelty? Kermit and friends deliver exactly what they”ve been expected to deliver for almost 40 years.\n\nIronically, the only thing that really dates Muppets movies is its live-action co-stars. Among those featured in the first one were Milton Berle, Bob Hope, Cloris Leachman and — look it up if you don”t believe me — Orson Welles.\n\nIn that way, and only in that way, is “Most Wanted” an artifact of the current times. Like all Muppets adventures, this one is as full of celebrity cameos as a Snickers bar is full of peanuts — Lady Gaga, Puff Daddy, Tony Bennett, Usher (as an actual usher). But the three main live-action figures are Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey and Ty Burrell of “Modern Family,” contemporary stars that will date this picture when future generations watch it on their holographic Google brain implants 30 years from now.\n\nThe new film is a well-oiled machine in its delivery of songs, comedy, effects, carpet chewing, clever lines and sight gags and just enough sophisticated absurdist humor to reward adult viewers, many of whom by now grew up themselves watching the Muppets.\n\nThe plot is an “Austin Powers”-style lark, opening with the jailbreak from a Siberian gulag of a malevolent frog named Constantine who is the exact doppelganger of Kermit but for a facial mole. Gervais, who does comic oiliness better than anyone alive, is the comically oily Dominic Badguy (“It”s pronounced ”Badge-y,” he says. “It”s French), Constantine”s lieutenant who has talked himself into the job of managing the Muppets on a world tour.\n\nIt gives nothing away to say that the two evil masterminds find a way to put Constantine in Kermit”s place as the Muppets” dependable father figure, while putting the real Kermit — glued-on mole and all — in the gulag under the command of a snarling female Russian officer (Tina Fey). If you”re over 3 years old, there”s no way that you won”t see that plot point coming from the film”s opening frame.\n\nMeanwhile, Burrell teams up with mono-browed Muppet Sam the Eagle as a joint Euro-American investigation team looking into the burglaries that coincide with Muppet performances across Europe. Burrell”s pinched Frenchmen provides a few satirical jabs at Europeans that could draw blood.\n\nThe result is a big load of fun without a single slack moment in its not-quite-two-hours running time. Does it have the socio-political implications or transcendent genius of Pixar”s best films? No. But it doesn”t reach for that kind of thing either. It has the smarts to stay firm to a recipe that has worked since the Muppets debuted with their own TV show in 1976: deliver entertainment by the bushel and depend on the goodwill and love that audiences have for its beloved characters.\n\nIt works, and “Muppets: Most Wanted” proves that it doesn”t need fixing.

So, it’s that thing where you have the friendship going and you hang out together and that’s very much what writing is these days. It felt natural and easy. It’s a helpful thing. I knew him five years before The Muppets. In fact, The Muppets came about because I knew he was writing it. I love the guy and it’s been a huge plus point for me with this entire Muppets journey. I knew it would be a pleasure, and sure enough… it really was [laughs]. We have the same sense of humor and a shared love of the Muppets and both love Ricky Gervais, Tina (Fey) and Ty (Burrell). It was a dream team.\n\nMovie Fanatic: I can’t imagine anyone else doing it, but why was Ricky Gervais perfect to be Mr. Badguy?\n\nJames Bobin: The character he plays is so like the characters he’s brilliant at playing. He has this incredible sense of delivering deadpan lines and sly or mean lines. He makes a perfect Muppets villain. He’s cynical… he’s everything they’re not. Also, he’s got this childish nature. It’s weird. He has this childhood innocence and this wild laugh [laugh]. It’s very Muppets. I knew if you combined these elements, you’d have this bad guy who is going to be funny as a mean guy. He’s going to believe Constantine, the frog, is real, and treat him like a real character. But, at the same time, at the end of the day, Dominic Badguy is a guy you quite like. I love that about it.\n\nMovie Fanatic: What was it about working with Bret McKenzie? It’s so natural. He won an Oscar for writing music for The Muppets and his songs on this are simply astounding.\n\nJames Bobin: It’s the same thing with music as it is with writing the script. He’s a friend and the people you hang out with will have a similar sense of humor. And that comes through in the music. When I have an idea for a song, like We’re Doing a Sequel, he instantly gets what that should be. For me, it actually saves a lot of time. And you know what, it gets better with time. It’s very rare that he produces something that I’m not feeling, and usually that is only because it doesn’t fit the story. For example, when we were doing the I Can Give You What You Want song with Constantine with the cheesy, 1980s disco number, it started out like a rock and roll Jerry Lee Lewis-type number, which was funny. Somehow, it didn’t feel right for the character. I knew Constantine so well, but Bret hadn’t met Constantine at that point, so he didn’t know the character. Within a day, he changed it to what you hear now. It’s amazing.\n\nMovie Fanatic: Does he continually surprise you?\n\nJames Bobin: Yeah, he writes so well, so quickly. The lyrics to The Interrogation Song, sung by Ty and Sam (the eagle), is like a huge Broadway number. Singing words that rhyme that move along the story is very difficult and he just does it effortlessly. I’m lucky that I know him. He’s so humble and nice, you see the guy stand up and win an Oscar… you just don’t believe it!\n\nMovie Fanatic: One of the things about the Muppets that we’ve loved for decades is the cameos. For you as the director and shepherding the story, is there a certain point where there are too many cameos and how do you make sure they fit?\n\nJames Bobin: They always serve the movie, that’s rule number one. We don’t put them in the movie because they’re famous. They have to move the story. It can be for a joke, or they fit the role. Occasionally we get people who love the Muppets, like Christoph Waltz. It was easy to write a joke about him liking waltzing… that’s a great Muppet Show joke! Generally, we have an idea for them in the script stage because it works for the movie. We’re lucky the Muppets are so beloved, because when we call people up, they say, “Sure!” Generally people we ask, do it -- which is amazing, because in this business that is not always the case.\n\nMovie Fanatic: You filmed the last movie here in LA. Was it nice to leave here and film in London?\n\nJames Bobin: It was like a homecoming. The Muppet Show was made in England in the 1970s. It felt like a very Anglo-American collaboration, so it was nice to go back. The first one, I felt like the Anglo coming to America to make the movie. This time, I felt the Americans came to England. It was a poetic thing that the Muppets should be shot in England. The best part was that I could hire Louise Gold, who was the only female puppeteer who worked The Muppet Show in the 1970s and is still around! I hired her and brought her back. It’s fantastic!\n\nMovie Fanatic: If you could go back to your eight-year-old self and tell him we were sitting here talking about you making a Muppet movie…\n\nJames Bobin: He wouldn’t believe it! [Laughs] There’s no way! Especially in those days… England’s such a small country and America was the great culture exporter back in those days. The idea of me writing lines for Fozzie would blow my mind as an eight-year-old!', 'How many cameos are too many and how did he choose which superstars made the cut for Muppets Most Wanted?\nMovie Fanatic: Jason Segel and Nick Stoller wrote the first one, and you wrote this one with Nick.\nJames Bobin: He’s a friend!\nMovie Fanatic: I can’t imagine anyone else doing it, but why was Ricky Gervais perfect to be Mr. Badguy?\nMovie Fanatic: One of the things about the Muppets that we’ve loved for decades is the cameos.']"

Writers Nicholas Stoller and Jason Segel and director James Bobin managed to capture the absurd irreverence of Jim Henson\'s creations as well as their inherent sweetness, and the original songs from Bret McKenzie were spot-on. Now the same creative team (except Segel) is back for the inevitable follow-up, but can ""Muppets Most Wanted"" sustain the feel-good magic?\n\nNot completely, it turns out. The film picks up directly following the finale of ""The Muppets,"" with Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear and all the rest reunited and triumphant. They immediately launch into a metafictional opening song about the difficulty of mounting a sequel, which is more amusing to media-savvy grown-ups than the kids in the crowd, and feels like an oddly defensive jumping-off point.\n\nOnce the story proper begins, it too feels slightly out of time. Constantine, the ""world\'s most dangerous frog"" and a dead ringer for Kermit other than a distinctive mole, escapes from a Siberian gulag. Meanwhile, an unctuous talent agent named Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais) -- ""it\'s pronounced bahd-gee,"" he tells them -- convinces the Muppets to embark on a world tour. Turns out that Badguy is Constantine\'s right-hand man. The evil amphibian soon secretly takes Kermit\'s place and, using the Muppets world tour as cover, begins a series of robberies across Europe. As this is going on, Kermit ends up in Constantine\'s Russian prison cell, where the commandant (Tina Fey, very sporting) puts him in charge of the annual gulag revue.\n\nNone of the Muppets (except the ever-perceptive Animal) notice Constantine\'s Boris Badenov accent or question his abruptly changed personality, which understandably rankles Kermit later on. Some of the movie\'s best gags come from the pairing of extremely French Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell) and CIA officer Sam Eagle, assigned to investigate the thefts, which culminate with an attempt on the British Crown Jewels.\n\nThis description makes ""Muppets Most Wanted"" sound overplotted, and it is, but there are still enough moments of anarchy (including Gonzo\'s staging of an ""indoor running of the bulls"") to rank it as a perfectly acceptable family matinee. The longstanding Muppet tradition of endless celebrity cameos is reliably diverting, with Christoph Waltz, Saoirse Ronan and Salma Hayek popping up alongside the amusing trio of Danny Trejo, Ray Liotta and Jemaine Clement (McKenzie\'s erstwhile ""Flight of the Conchords"" bandmate) as Kermit\'s fellow gulag residents. And Usher plays an usher, so there\'s that.\n\nWalter, the newest Muppet, who was introduced in the 2011 movie, is still around, but without much purpose. (There\'s a nice gag about the marginalization of Kermit\'s adorable nephew Robin.) Steve Whitmire (Kermit) and Eric Jacobson (Miss Piggy, Fozzie) will always operate in the shadow of Henson and Frank Oz, but they\'ve also been voicing those characters and many others long enough to have established them as their own.\n\nIt might not be long before the same can be said of Bobin and Stoller. They\'ve resuscitated a beloved franchise, and now they\'ve made a decent enough follow-up. If Quentin Tarantino cameos and animated infantilism can be avoided, the Muppets could be in good hands for years to come.\n\n\n\n-- Marc Mohan\n\n***\n\n""MUPPETS MOST WANTED""\n\nGrade: B-\n\nRating: PG\n\nRunning time: 112 minutes\n\nPlaying at: Opens Friday, March 21 at multiple locations\n\nCast and crew: Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, Ty Burrell; directed by James Bobin\n\nThe lowdown: Reunited at last, the Muppets embark on a world tour, unaware that their leader Kermit the Frog has been replaced by an escapee from a Siberian gulag and that their performances serve as cover for a series of brazen heists.

23239,http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/muppet-show-20-amazing-musical-numbers.html,entertainment,"['Muppets Most Wanted opens this weekend, which means it’s the perfect time to dig back through the vast Muppet archives for some classic gems. Over its five seasons, The Muppet Show solidified itself as a cultural landmark not just through the jovial, pun-heavy gentle humor of the Muppets and the broader Henson universe, but also through some iconic musical numbers. Ranking these feels is anathema to the all-in-this-together spirit of the Muppets, so we’ll instead simply say these are 20 wonderful segments. Some are original Muppet songs, some feature celebrity guests, and all poke at that part of your heart only Kermit and pals have access to.\n\nHarry Belafonte, “Turn the World Around,” season three, episode 14\n\nBelafonte co-wrote this song, which has become iconic separately from its Muppet Show origins. Apologies: This will be stuck in your head for weeks.\n\nJoan Baez, “Will the Circle Be Unbroken,” season five, episode 3\n\nBonus points for the swirly 1980 vibes.\n\nRita Moreno, “Fever,” season one, episode 5\n\nMoreno won an Emmy for this episode, which is how she completed her EGOT.\n\n“Six String Orchestra,” season four, episode 17\n\nThe Harry Chapin original is great, of course, but there’s something even more endearing about Scooter’s version.\n\nPetula Clark, “Tomorrow,” season two, episode 20\n\nThis is a perfect example of The Muppet Show’s ability to rearrange songs and give them a different spin. “Tomorrow,” Annie-style, is sort of brash and brassy; here, it’s almost tender and poignant.\n\nJudy Collins, “Send in the Clowns,” season two, episode 5\n\nBringing in literal clowns could have turned this into a joke, but instead, it retains that resigned misery that makes the song a classic in the first place.\n\nLena Horne, “Sing,” season one, episode 11\n\n“Sing” is a go-to Muppet song and has been on Sesame Street dozens of times. But Horne’s version is still gentle and beautiful.\n\nJohn Denver, “Grandma’s Feather Bed,” season four, episode 1\n\nDenver has a fabled history with the Muppets, but he only hosted TMS once. Still, it’s hard to imagine this song not with the Muppets as backup singers.\n\n“Comedy Tonight,” season two, episode 2\n\nThe Muppets do good covers. They just do! Even though this is the Zero Mostel episode, this number doesn’t even need him.\n\nBernadette Peters, “Just One Person,” season two, episode 12\n\nThis one takes on additional weepiness if you remember that it was also performed at Jim Henson’s memorial service.\n\nDanny Kaye, “Inchworm,” season three, episode 16\n\nAnother one that’s just a perfect marriage of the musical style of the show, its persistent can-do idealism, and the fact that everything sounds special when the Muppets sing it.\n\n“I’m My Own Grandpaw,” season one, episode 13\n\nThese guys are known as the Gogolala Jubliee Jugband. Use that at your next Muppet trivia night.\n\nSteve Martin, “Rambling Man,” season two, episode 8\n\nThis isn’t even that notable a performance; it’s just deeply memorable for the shot of all the Muppets in the audience gleefully watching Martin onstage.\n\n“In the Navy,” season five, episode 24\n\nAgain, good at covers.\n\n“Halfway Down the Stairs,” season one, episode 11\n\nIf you can watch this without getting choked up, you are a monster.\n\nGilda Radner, “Pirates of Penzance,” season three, episode 4\n\nThis is a long, long way to go for this joke. But that does not stop The Muppet Show.\n\nMadeline Kahn, “The Wishing Song,” season two, episode nine\n\nGonzo is usually the most lovelorn of the Muppets, and here that’s used to full effect. The Muppets can be sad, too!\n\n“Do Re Mi,” season three, episode 10\n\nThis here is the quintessential simple-but-impossible-task sketch.\n\nRudolph Nureyev, “Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails,” season two, episode 13\n\nRudolf Nureyev is a really talented guy — but he’s not much of a singer. And it doesn’t matter at all! Such is the power of the supportive world of Jim Henson.\n\nBen Vereen, “Mr. Cellophane,” season one, episode 17\n\nAnd at the other end of the spectrum, here’s Ben Vereen – who really can sing, and gets to just let it all out in this number. Not everything has to be wild production and elaborate stagecraft: Sometimes people just sing and dance.', 'Harry Belafonte, “Turn the World Around,” season three, episode 14Belafonte co-wrote this song, which has become iconic separately from its Muppet Show origins.\nRita Moreno, “Fever,” season one, episode 5Moreno won an Emmy for this episode, which is how she completed her EGOT.\nPetula Clark, “Tomorrow,” season two, episode 20This is a perfect example of The Muppet Show’s ability to rearrange songs and give them a different spin.\nLena Horne, “Sing,” season one, episode 11“Sing” is a go-to Muppet song and has been on Sesame Street dozens of times.\nMadeline Kahn, “The Wishing Song,” season two, episode nineGonzo is usually the most lovelorn of the Muppets, and here that’s used to full effect.']"

Under the direction of James Bobin (Flight of the Conchords), who also co-wrote the Muppet caper with Nicholas Stoller (The Muppets), Burrell plays “a very Frenchy French” (his words) Interpol agent, Jean Pierre Napoleon. Napoleon reluctantly teams up with CIA agent Sam Eagle to track down the evil frog Constantine (Kermit’s doppelgänger) and his number two, Dominic Badguy (Ricky Gervais), who are intent on stealing England’s Crown Jewels.\n\nThe unlikely detective duo sing some catchy tunes including the “Interrogation Song” - written by Bret McKenzie (who won an Oscar for best original song with “Man or Muppet”). The film also stars Tina Fey as Nadya, a feisty Russian prison guard, along with guest appearances from Celine Dion, Salma Hayek, Sean Combs, and Christoph Waltz.\n\nBurrell recently voiced Mr. Peabody in the DreamWorks Animation 3D feature Mr. Peabody & Sherman, and he will be the voice of Bailey the Beluga whale in the long awaited Pixar Animation, Finding Dory, the sequel to 2003’s Finding Nemo. He also stars in the indie drama, The Skeleton Twins, with Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, slated for release later this year\n\nIn our interview, Screen Rant learns that Burrell acted like a giddy schoolgirl when he was offered the role in a Muppet movie.\n\nScreen Rant: That moment you received the call from Disney asking if you’d like to work with The Muppets, how did your inner and outer self react?\n\nTy Burrell: Well unfortunately they were kind of one in the same, a giddy schoolgirl or a seven year old with turrets or something. I was blurting out all of my joy, which didn’t give me a ton of negotiating power. Yeah, I was just super excited to be a part of it and didn’t really believe it at first. I just had a really hard time believing that I was being offered a part in a Muppet movie, I’m still sort of pinching myself.\n\nSR: You play Jean Pierre Napoleon, which is a fantastic name. Tell me about developing your character and his role in the film?\n\nTy Burrell: Well the name is pretty indicative. If we could have, we would have added another French word in there. Basically, just try to find the funniest Frenchiest, Frenchest name! He’s essentially an amalgam of every French character you’ve ever seen and also intended to be the most European person essentially alive - so he could stand in contrast to Sam Eagle who is so American. And they spend the whole time just fighting about which culture is better basically.\n\nSR: Hollywood magic aside, in between takes with Sam Eagle, you’ll never hear him say, I’m popping to the loo. Does quashing the sense of disbelief feel a bit weird?\n\nTy Burrell: It does take a little bit of time. It’s funny what happens as you do find yourself talking to the Muppet. If it’s a short stretch between takes you will actually be conversing with the Muppet, which is disturbing. If it’s longer, then you end up talking to the puppeteer and in my case I spent a lot of time with Eric Jacobson. I have an incredible amount of admiration for those guys, men and women.\n\nSR: You’re doing the voice over for Bailey in Finding Dory, which is the follow up to Finding Nemo. Can you tell us what we can expect from that film?\n\nTy Burrell: To be totally honest, I don’t know a lot of what to expect from that because we’re at the very very beginning and it’s almost a three year process. I know Bailey is a Beluga whale and he will be using his sonar abilities which beluga whales have. But I really don’t know much about the plot yet. I’m sorry.\n\nSR: After working so intensely with the Muppets, did you develop a favorite?\n\nTy Burrell: Sam Eagle. I really became…\n\nSR: Emotionally attached?\n\nTy Burrell: Yes I did! There was something about the rough sarcastic exterior and his soft spot. And Eric is so good in terms of improvising as the character of Sam Eagle. He was my favorite.\n\nSR: Did you have to audition for Kermit as he has the final word?\n\nTy Burrell: I’m sure my tape got passed to Kermit. I must have got the green thumbs up at some point.\n\nSR: What can audiences expect from this film - because it has every genre?\n\nTy Burrell: Yeah that’s kind of the thing isn’t it? The Muppets can hold everything. It’s the craziest movie. You can’t even call it a style because you can do everything in a Muppets movie. It’s a lot of everything. It’s big, broad, humor and it has these hilarious songs and sometimes it’s really subtle and sometimes really sweet, I don’t know how they do all of that in one movie, but they seem to.\n\n__\n\nMuppets Most Wanted opens in theaters on March 21.\n\nShare Tweet Email Copy Link Copied', 'SR: Hollywood magic aside, in between takes with Sam Eagle, you’ll never hear him say, I’m popping to the loo.\nTy Burrell: Sam Eagle.\nAnd Eric is so good in terms of improvising as the character of Sam Eagle.\nTy Burrell: I’m sure my tape got passed to Kermit.\nYou can’t even call it a style because you can do everything in a Muppets movie.']"

Now she\'s gearing up to win a sparkly mirror-ball trophy, making her debut as the first double-amputee to take part in ABC\'s ""Dancing With the Stars.""\n\nProfessional dancer Derek Hough flew to Russia to perfect their ballroom bond, preparing for potentially several weeks of samba, tango and cha-cha-cha. Today, they\'ll arrive at a Los Angeles television studio for more practice.\n\n""It was really great to be able to dance, do something a little bit different and have something exciting beyond Sochi to look forward to,"" said Purdy, who lives in Colorado.\n\nAs Hough waited around Sochi in the morning - with stray dogs for company according to his Instagram feed - Purdy was on the slopes. She\'d then take a gondola lift down to a hotel in the Alpine resort of Rosa Khutor to make sure she was as sure-footed and graceful waltzing across a dance floor as she was with a board on snow.\n\n""It\'s been a good distraction because we had a lot of down time here,"" said Purdy, even if it meant little time for rest in Russia. ""The energy came from adrenaline. Pure adrenaline.""\n\nThat came after years of pure determination. ""Courageous and inspiring"" is how Hough describes the 34-year-old Purdy.\n\nShe took up snowboarding at 15, contracted bacterial meningitis four years later and had her legs amputated just below the knee. The impairment didn\'t hold her back or stop dreams of sporting success for her and other physically challenged snowboarders. She co-founded Adaptive Action Sports with boyfriend Daniel Gale in 2005.\n\nThe Olympic medal came after years of pushing for the inclusion of snowboarding in the Paralympics.\n\n""After meeting Amy and watching her struggle just finding resources to get back into the sport she loved - snowboarding - it seemed like it was something that needed to happen for her and everyone else,"" Gale said amid the celebrations at the Rosa Khutor Alpine Center.\n\nWhen Purdy completed her third and final run of the course, Gale rushed to drape an American flag around his girlfriend.\n\n""So proud of you,"" he said.\n\nIn an event where the two best times are combined, Purdy was 16.86 seconds behind Dutch winner Bibian Mentel-Spee, while Cecile Hernandez Ep Cervellon of France was second.\n\n""The conditions here have been really challenging, it has been anything from ice to icy slush to just wet slush,"" Purdy said in bright sunshine at a location that has seen little snow in recent weeks. ""I wanted to play smart and I feel that\'s what I did.""\n\nWith the high-profile dancing contest coming up, there was also the fear of injury.\n\n""The course was so bumpy that it was just about staying on my feet,"" Purdy said. ""This course is really steep. It\'s not a course where you are looking for speed. It\'s a course where you are trying to figure out smart spots.""\n\nNext week, she\'ll be on a wooden dance floor under studio lights with millions watching on television. American teammates are delighted a Paralympian will be in prime time.\n\n""There is now that awareness she is bringing to the world,"" said Mike Shea, who won silver in the men\'s race. ""And we couldn\'t be happier for her.""\n\nShea was in the middle of an American sweep of the podium, standing between winner Evan Strong and Keith Gabel.\n\n""We are all best friends and to be involved in it and then to get a gold medal in the end is great,"" said Strong, who was set for a career in skateboarding before a drunk driver struck him on a motorcycle.\n\n""After my accident and losing my leg, snowboarding gave much more to me than just sport or racing,"" he said. ""It gave me my life back.

The Little Mermaid is basically about a disaffected princess whose famous father, the king of the sea, resents her burgeoning sexuality.

Drinking the potion will make her feel as if a sword is being passed through her, yet when she recovers she will have two beautiful legs, and will be able to dance like no human has ever danced before. However, it will constantly feel like she is walking on sharp swords, and her feet will bleed most terribly. In addition, she will only get a soul if the prince loves her and marries her, for then a part of his soul will flow into her. Otherwise, at dawn on the first day after he marries another woman, the Little Mermaid will die brokenhearted and disintegrate into sea foam.\n\nThe Sofia Coppola version of this story will involve two hours of the little mermaid and the prince kissing under a sheet and dancing to synth pop hits while feeling alienated from normal society because of their wealth. Then, at the very end, the sea witch offers the mermaid this horrible bargain. “So, what do you say?” says the witch. The little mermaid leans close to the witch and whispers something in her ear, but we can’t quite hear what it is.

Surprisingly, crunching the numbers makes hiring Coppola a canny business decision moreso than a creative one. Coppola’s come a long way since her dreamy debut picture The Virgin Suicides, and the video below shows exactly that.\n\n\n\nSofia Coppola is one of the most acclaimed filmmakers in the industry today, a three-time Oscar nominee with a passionate fan base. But that fan base is small, and being critically-acclaimed doesn’t always pay the bills: Coppola’s last film,, was given a sizable mainstream push but it only collected $5.8 million at the domestic box office. Being a Coppola means a lack of struggle to make it in the industry, but it always helps to diversify your portfolio.And for that, Coppola is moving from the penthouse to under the sea. Deadline reports that Coppola is in negotiations to direct, Universal’s long-gestating adaptation of the Hans Christian Anderson story. Reportedly this will take a darker tone with the material, distinguishing it from the famous Disney film; for one, there probably won’t be any songs. Coppola’s an inspired choice, however, for a movie about a girl who makes a Faustian bargain for materialistic things. In case you haven’t read the source material, it doesn’t end well for our sea-faring maiden.This latest draft of the script is penned by Caroline Thompson, a Tim Burton veteran who has writing credits onand: seems like they might have wanted Burton to do this film, though he’s busy shooting. Previous drafts were done byscribe Kelly Marcel andscreenwriter Abi Morgan, suggesting that this has been a very high profile project for awhile now. Coppola is expected to start shooting very soon, stepping into the shoes of director Joe Wright, a perfect choice who has since bailed from the project.Coppola’s biggest ""hit"" is likely Oscar nominee, which made $44 million in America. However, the global tally ran a surprising $119 million overall, which is pretty spectacular for a glacially-paced Bill Murray drama costing $4 million.

23317,http://www.slashfilm.com/sofia-coppola-little-mermaid/,entertainment,"['The trend of producing live-action adaptations of popular animated films continues. Sofia Coppola is in negotiations to direct The Little Mermaid, a live-action adaptation of the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale Disney made into an Oscar-winning film in 1989. Universal Pictures will distribute. Frequent Tim Burton collaborator Caroline Thompson, who wrote Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride, is currently rewriting the script.\n\nDeadline broke the news of the potential deal and reports that the intention for the studio is to get this movie made as quickly as possible. Coppola has directed five really solid films but they’re all aimed at adults. She’s a mother now and Deadline surmises she could be at the point where she wants to make something her kids can watch. The Little Mermaid would certainly be that.\n\nWhile Disney owns the rights to the above image and all that goes with it, the Hans Christian Anderson story is surely in the public domain. That’s how studios other than Disney can make films or shows based on stories we so regularly and falsely remember as theirs. Pinocchio or Beauty and the Beast for example. We might know The Little Mermaid best from 1989, but the story has been around since the 1830s.\n\nCoppola’s The Little Mermaid joins two different versions of The Jungle Book (one by Jon Favreau, the other by Ron Howard) as well as an Alice in Wonderland sequel, directed by James Bobin, Pan directed by Joe Wright, Cinderella, directed by Kenneth Branagh and Maleficent as just a handful of well-known animated stories getting made into live action. Honestly, Coppola’s feels like the most interesting of the bunch. She’s a filmmaker with a very unique vision who has never had the budget or resources a studio like Universal can provide. It’ll very cool to see what she does with this classic story of a mermaid who gives up her life to be with the man she loves.', 'Sofia Coppola is in negotiations to direct The Little Mermaid, a live-action adaptation of the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale Disney made into an Oscar-winning film in 1989.\nCoppola has directed five really solid films but they’re all aimed at adults.\nThe Little Mermaid would certainly be that.\nWe might know The Little Mermaid best from 1989, but the story has been around since the 1830s.\nShe’s a filmmaker with a very unique vision who has never had the budget or resources a studio like Universal can provide.']"

All this, thanks to Tomnod, a satellite imaging website run by DigitalGlobe satellite company. On March 10, Tomnod encouraged its followers on Twitter to scan its catalog of photographs over the area of search including the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Thailand.\n\nDigitalGlobe launched a crowdsourcing campaign to help locate the Malaysia Airlines jet. Join the crowd to help! http://t.co/1u3jh7xIRE — DigitalGlobe (@DigitalGlobe) March 10, 2014\n\nOver 2.3 million people have been said to have scanned pictures from Tomnod’s satellites. They’ve aimed them at several different areas where the plane was believed to have lost contact with air traffic controllers and radar. It is something reminiscent to the Boston Marathon bombing just last year, when Reddit took to up arms to analyze photographs taken of the tragedy in hopes to find clues and track down possible suspects. While the efforts proved unsuccessful, causing more trouble than resolution, this hasn’t kept the enthusiasm of good Samaritans out of the current search for the Malaysia Airlines aircraft. Over 745,000 blue pictures of the ocean have been scanned by Tomnod site visitors, looking for evidence of the crashed aircraft, smoke, or oil slicks.\n\nThe most notable (or viral) find was publicized by rock star and celebrity drama queen Courtney Love, who posted on her Facebook page a picture of what she thought could be wreckage and an oil slick.\n\nWhile critics lambasted Courtney for, well, being Courtney, the general attitude on the tragedy seems to be one of dumbfound curiosity. What exactly happened during that flight? Between possibilities of a fire, hijacking, or even aliens, all avenues have been considered with major news outlets consistently talking to experts on aviation about their theories.\n\nOne of the more interesting perspectives was published by Wired this morning. Veteran pilot, Chris Goodfellow, explained his theory that the aircraft had likely experienced an electrical fire and was heading towards the 13,000 foot runway of an airport in Pulau Langkawi, a nearby coast.\n\n“The pilot did all the right things. He was confronted by some major event onboard that made him make an immediate turn to the closest, safest airport,” wrote Goodfellow.\n\nTuesday, U.S. officials said a review of the pilots’ computers and air traffic controller logs found nothing suspicious, leaving the mystery still largely unsolved. The only notable evidence is that the pilot or someone changed course deliberately. Nevertheless, this is not an unheard of event. A map of 83 planes that have gone missing since 1948 published by Bloomberg Visual Data proves the disconcerting possibility that even with advanced technology like Tomnod and its millions of armchair detectives, the passengers and debris of flight 370 may never be found.\n\nVia: Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Wired, CNN\n\nSource: DigitalGlobe', 'With the world focused on missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370, armchair detectives have come out of the woodwork in attempt to solve the mystery.\nDigitalGlobe launched a crowdsourcing campaign to help locate the Malaysia Airlines jet.\nhttp://t.co/1u3jh7xIRE — DigitalGlobe (@DigitalGlobe) March 10, 2014Over 2.3 million people have been said to have scanned pictures from Tomnod’s satellites.\nWhile the efforts proved unsuccessful, causing more trouble than resolution, this hasn’t kept the enthusiasm of good Samaritans out of the current search for the Malaysia Airlines aircraft.\nWhile critics lambasted Courtney for, well, being Courtney, the general attitude on the tragedy seems to be one of dumbfound curiosity.']"

(OK, I made the latter person up).\n\nProving once again that the Internet can make an expert of anyone, Love — who admits that she, like millions around the world, has become obsessed with the jetliner mystery — visited the map search website Tomnod, which is crowdsourcing for clues in the case. There she found, and helpfully posted to Facebook, a photo that she thinks shows the plane and an oil slick.\n\nPHOTOS: Malaysia Airlines plane missing\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough to this observer, who admittedly has old, tired eyes, it shows, well, water.\n\nBut before you scoff (and yes, Tomnod has already posted a rebuttal), you should know that Love is digging hard for the truth and has rejected — sort of — some other, uh, less plausible explanations: “I really doubt aliens took it,” she told New York Magazine.\n\nSorry to disappoint you, alien abduction fans. Hang tough, though. Miley Cyrus hasn’t weighed in yet.\n\nNow, back in the real world, the search area has been put at about 2.24 million square nautical miles. Which is a lot. For scale, it’s much bigger than the search area for Amelia Earhart, who disappeared in 1937 — and no, neither she nor her plane has ever been found.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeaning that everyone might want to take a deep breath here. After all, the Titanic went down in 1912, and we didn’t find the wreck until 1985. (And yes, it was located by Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Coincidence? Maybe not.)\n\nStill, I’m not making fun of Love (OK, maybe a little). She’s just caught up in what is, in some ways, the Earhart story of the 21st century. With all the technology we have at our disposal, stuff just doesn’t go missing these days (except for car keys and socks, but those are mysteries that will never be solved).\n\nPlus, we live in the age of conspiracy theories. It’s a game everyone can play: The pilots flew the airliner to a remote island and are holding the passengers for ransom. No, terrorists took it, and are preparing it for another 9/11-style attack somewhere.\n\nOr more likely, it crashed into the sea. Maybe it floated for awhile. Or it crashed in the jungle.\n\nIt would be a great TV show, except it already was: “Lost.”\n\nAt this point, all we can say for sure is that it’s missing.\n\nAnd that Courtney Love didn’t find it.

Courtney wanted to do her part after reading an article on Tomnod.com. She asked people to help with the search.

However, she has retweeted several news outlets reporting that she may have found the plane. This situation is very serious and Courtney probably really does mean well, but let’s be honest, it’s humorous to think she really solved the mystery that has baffled even the most experienced people.\n\nThe photo is also posted on Courtney’s Facebook page. “Swear to god if courtney love finds the f******* plane,” someone commented. And I agree!\n\nAll jokes aside, the singer did express her sympathies. “I hope they find the plane, I pray they’re still alive, it’s sad and my heart goes out to all those involved.” CDL also sends thoughts and prayers to those affected by this tragic situation.\n\nWhat is your take on Courtney Love conducting her own investigation of missing flight 370?

23424,http://www.latintimes.com/game-thrones-season-4-episode-2-preview-what-will-happen-lion-and-rose-160278,entertainment,"['“Game of Thrones” Season 4 is nearly here but before fans are lucky enough to experience the premiere episode “Two Swords” they must wait 19 long days until the arrival of April 6th! The Season 4 premiere episode “Two Swords” will be followed by episode 2 “The Lion and the Rose,” which will most likely be the episode that sets the tone for the entire season. Simply based on the title, many fans are expecting to see the forthcoming wedding between King Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell. The ceremony, which has been dubbed “The Purple Wedding” by fans of George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” book series, will essentially join two of the most powerful houses in Westeros, the Lannisters and the Tyrells.\n\nAccording to the synopsis though, Joffrey and Margaery are merely hosting a breakfast. However, there is much more occurring than just the arranged marriage between the two scheming houses. As for the Lannisters, Tyrion “lends Jamie a hand” while we appreciate HBO’s clever attempt at a cover up, he think this is more of a literal hand. In the promo video for Season 4 of “Game of Thrones,” Jamie is seen back in Kings Landing, however he is still missing a hand. But based on the synopsis it seems that Tyrion is the one who gifts his elder brother with the golden hand. We have heard of the historical expression that some leaders rule with an iron fist, but it seems like the Kingslayer will now fight with a golden hand, very Lannisetr-esque.\n\nIn addition to the action in Kings Landing, the Starks are attempting to navigate the world that lies in perpetual winter. In episode 2 “The Lion and the Rose,” Bran and the Reeds will continue their journey North of the Wall but even before they set out, it seems they only just realize “where they must go.” It seems like Bran may have under estimated the seriousness of the conditions, or may have never even really considered the implications of what he will discover in the true North. As for Theon, things are still not going so well for him after slowly losing body parts that were distastefully sent back to his family on the Iron Islands. It seems like in Season 4, “Ramsay finds a purpose for his pet,” hopefully for Theon’s sake it is more productive than just being flayed.\n\nRead the full synopsis for “Game of Thrones” episode 2 “The Lion and the Rose” below, “Tyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand. Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery (Natalie Dormer) host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) loses patience with Davos (Liam Cunningham). Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) finds a purpose for his pet. North of the Wall, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) sees where they must go.”', '“Game of Thrones” Season 4 is nearly here but before fans are lucky enough to experience the premiere episode “Two Swords” they must wait 19 long days until the arrival of April 6th!\nThe Season 4 premiere episode “Two Swords” will be followed by episode 2 “The Lion and the Rose,” which will most likely be the episode that sets the tone for the entire season.\nSimply based on the title, many fans are expecting to see the forthcoming wedding between King Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell.\nIn the promo video for Season 4 of “Game of Thrones,” Jamie is seen back in Kings Landing, however he is still missing a hand.\nRead the full synopsis for “Game of Thrones” episode 2 “The Lion and the Rose” below, “Tyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand.']"

The experience seems to have humbled him for the better — he was downright introspective in that hot tub scene with Brienne — but if he can't swing a sword, what use is Jaime? And how will he be helped by being around Cersei again?\n\nTyrion Lannister\n\nTyrion is newly wed to Sansa Stark, but if she didn't like him before, she's really not into him ever since her family got massacred in an event orchestrated by Tyrion's father. Although he sits on the Small Council as Master of Coin, he's pretty marginalized these days, and longtime secret companion Shae isn't too thrilled with him either, since he keeps telling her to get the hell out of King's Landing. Also the whole getting-married-to-Sansa thing. Plus, Joffrey, as always, particularly has it out for his uncle, who has long been one of the few people to openly defy him. Luckily, Bronn continues to climb the social ladder/hang out with Tyrion, and he's real useful in a fight.\n\nKing Joffrey Baratheon\n\nThis squealing blond turd is about to get married to Margaery Tyrell, cementing his hold on the Seven Kingdoms, even though there is literally no one on the planet who remotely tolerates him (even Cersei, who loves him despite herself, knows he's busted in the head). His main enemy is grampy Tywin, who actually pulls all the strings, but he really focuses his hate on Tyrion because that guy has slapped him in the face a bunch.\n\nMargaery Tyrell\n\nShe and her grandmother Olenna schemed her to the top of the pile, but unfortunately, that involves her marrying (and presumably having sex) with Joffrey. In the third season, they asked Sansa about him and she confirmed all their worst fears. This season, Margaery's dad Mace will also be kicking around, but from everything we heard, the ladies are the real brains in the Tyrell household.\n\nSansa Stark\n\nSigh. Poor Sansa. She's still stuck in King's Landing, after being teased last season with the prospect of marrying Loras and moving to Highgarden. (Which would have brought with it a whole other set of dissatisfactions for Sansa, of course. Not that Sansa wasn't going to invariably end up with a gay husband at some point in her life. Girls like Sansa always do.) Instead, she's married to Tyrion, who is under a lot of pressure to put a baby in her but, understandably, is refusing to rape her. The worst part of all of this? It represents an improvement in Sansa's circumstances (she used to be engaged to Joffrey, remember).\n\nBrienne of Tarth\n\nBrienne is hanging out in King's Landing, having delivered Jaime there, ostensibly to trade for the Stark children. One (Arya) is missing, and the other (Sansa) is married, plus the woman who sent her on this mission (Catelyn) is dead, so Brienne might have to find new purpose. Worth noting that she has developed a huge crush on Jaime recently, so that might count as a purpose. Also worth noting that she's not really allied with anyone besides him: Catelyn and Renly Baratheon are both dead. But maybe Margery, who watched her fight in her first scene on the show, will remember her.\n\nShae\n\nShae is moping around being jealous of Tyrion and Sansa, which shows a lack of political understanding. She continues to refuse attractive offers to leave King's Landing forever and live in luxury in the east, I suppose for pride's sake. Shae is one of the most frustrating characters on Game of Thrones.\n\nOberyn Martell\n\nNew characters alert! Oberyn Martell (Pedro Pascal) and his paramour Ellaria Sand (Indira Varma) are showing up to court this year to cause trouble. Important facts about Dorne: it's to the south of King's Landing, so it's desert-y and its people are a little swarthier. They were the only nation to resist the dragon conquering of the Targaryans hundreds of years ago, eventually joining the empire peacefully. And Oberyn's sister Elia was married to Rhaegar Targaryan, the magnificent heir of the Mad King who kidnapped Ned's sister and died at Robert Baratheon's hands in battle. Elia and her kids were horribly murdered by Tywin's terrifying acolyte, Gregor Clegane the Mountain, means there's a lot of bad blood still to be settled.\n\nPetyr Baelish aka Littlefinger\n\nStill has a crush on Catelyn Stark, and thus, Sansa. Don't trust him, though, cause he's cold as ice! Also, now a super-lord who is nominally in control of Harrenhaal. He's also trying to get Catelyn's sister Lysa, lady of the Vale of Arryn up in the mountains, to marry him. Con: she's nuts. Pro: more money for Petyr!\n\nVarys\n\nSupposedly working for Tyrion right now. What's he up to really? WHO KNOWS! HE'S A TRICKY ONE.\n\nStay tuned for the rest of the week as we check in with everyone else in the world of Westeros and beyond.

So while we wait for the Season 4 release date to near, let’s check out the latest batch of news regarding the latest “Game of Thrones” installment. HBO released the first four episode titles, which The Season 4 premiere episode which debuts in a mere 20 days is titled “Two Swords,” it will have a run time of 58 minutes. Following the “Game of Thrones” premiere episode, Season 4 will continue on April 13 with episode 2, “The Lion and the Rose,” which has a run time of 52 minutes. Following episode 2 will be “Breaker of Chains” episode 3, which runs for 4 minutes longer than its predecessor, and finally episode 4 “Oathkeeper” will premiere on April 27th and run for 54 minutes. New reports claim that the fifth episode title has been revealed and like the others this season, it is specific referring to a well-known character. The title of “Game of Thrones” Season 4 episode 5 is “First Of His Name,” which has a run time of 54 minutes.\n\nWarning spoilers for Season 4 of “Game of Thrones” ahead. Do not read any further if you do not want to know what will happen in the fifth episode of the forthcoming season.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the phrase “First of His Name,” you need to watch more of this series. But for those loyal fans who have heard it before, it can be said in reference to multiple males on the show. The phrase is a part of a royal’s title, a King of Westeros, to be more specific, that has a different name from any other King who has sat on the Iron Throne before him. Fans first heard this moniker when King Robert Baratheon was announced, and it has continued into Season 3 of the series with none other than his “son” King Joffrey Baratheron. The formula is simply really, the King is formally addressed by his subjects as ""Your Grace"" and in official events referred to his full name which is normally announced by the Royal Steward, “All hail His Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.""\n\nBut if Joffrey is already first of his name and has been for three seasons, why is this so important that episode 5 is named after it. Most likely because there is a new king in town, the title is most likely referring to Joff’s younger brother Tommen. Tommen Baratheon will take the throne after his elder brother’s death which will occur at his wedding feats in episode 2 “The Lion and the Rose.” Much like the “Red Wedding” the wedding of Joffrey and Margarey will be witness to death, however this time the Lannisters are the victims, more specifically Joffrey. The young King is enjoying his wedding feast next to his new bride, when he begins to choke. At first the court is stunned by the King’s choking, thinking that he simply ate too much pie, but they soon to begin to realize the seriousness of the situation. While clawing at his own throat in a desperate attempt to breathe, Joffrey points to his uncle Tyrion in his last moments seemingly indicating his guilt in his apparent poisoning. Tyrion empties the remainder of Joffrey’s chalice on the floor of the Red Keep and then begins to leave, although Cersei distraught and enraged orders the arrest of both Tyrion and his wife Sansa after confirming the death of her eldest son. Following this event, we are assuming based of the episode title, that Tommen’s coronation will take place in episode 5, “First Of His Name.”', '“Game of Thrones” Season 4 is steadily approaching and its starting to seem like April 6th can’t come soon enough!\nFollowing the “Game of Thrones” premiere episode, Season 4 will continue on April 13 with episode 2, “The Lion and the Rose,” which has a run time of 52 minutes.\nNew reports claim that the fifth episode title has been revealed and like the others this season, it is specific referring to a well-known character.\nThe title of “Game of Thrones” Season 4 episode 5 is “First Of His Name,” which has a run time of 54 minutes.\nFollowing this event, we are assuming based of the episode title, that Tommen’s coronation will take place in episode 5, “First Of His Name.”']"

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ consists of The Flaming Lips, Miley Cyrus, MGMT and Tame Impala. Wayne Coyne’s psychedelic line-up are already in the studio; Coyne posted this photo of Cyrus who’ll appear on the album alongside MGMT’s Andrew VanWyngarden with a remake of ‘Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds’.\n\nhttp://instagram.com/p/llPzvlpXqp/embed/\n\nIt sounds terrible. But they’re far from the first bunch of rock stars convinced they can do justice to The Beatles strange and charming concept album. In 1998 NME released a cover album for Childline called ‘Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father’ and Wet Wet Wet’s cover ‘With a Little Help from My Friends’ reached number one. In 2007 Radio 2 gathered loads of bands – Oasis, Kaiser Chiefs, The Killers, Razorlight, James Morrison, Travis and The Fratellis – to pay tribute to the album on its 40th anniversary. A couple of years later the Easy Star All-Stars released ‘Easy Star’s Lonely Hearts Dub Band.’ None of these versions have aged particularly well; no one needs a Fratelli’s version of ‘She’s Leaving Home’. But, if you had to, who would you choose for a DIY Sgt Pepper’s album? Here’s some suggestions.\n\n1. ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’\n\nThis may already exist but few could trump Jimi Hendrix’s version of the opening track. He performed it the same week the album was released to an audience that included George Harrison and Paul McCartney, who was thrilled with the tribute. “The curtains flew back and he came walking forward playing ‘Sgt. Pepper’. It’s a pretty major compliment in anyone’s book. I put that down as one of the great honours of my career.”\n\n2. ‘With a Little Help from My Friends’\n\nRingo Starr’s epic has been covered by everyone from Sesame Street to, most famously, Joe Cocker. Its ubiquity would need to be sonically smashed apart to give it power anew. I suggest Slipknot or Palma Violets.\n\n3. ‘Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds’\n\nWe can all imagine what this’ll sound like with Wayne Coyne at the helm: a trippy, swooshy, psychedelic soup that’s faithful to the original. Young Thug would be way better. The Atlanta singer/rapper has got one of weirdest and most intriguing voices that’s come out in recent years. With soulful yelps, strange hawks, whining growls and insistent rhymes, he’d put an interesting spin on LSD.\n\n4. ‘Getting Better’\n\nThe key to finding a good artist to cover is ‘Getting Better’ is an artist with a high register. And who’s got the greatest falsetto in popular music? Probably Matt Bellamy.\n\n5. ‘Fixing a Hole’\n\nA reformed Hole, obvs.\n\n6. ‘She’s Leaving Home’\n\nPoignant, gentle, disturbing and potent, ‘She’s Leaving Home’ is the keystone of Sgt. Pepper. You need an artist with a spine-tinglingly beautiful voice and since this is a hypothetical blog, I’d say the late Jeff Buckley or Nick Drake would be perfect\n\n7. ‘Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!’\n\nOne the one hand, there’s a clownish goonery to ‘Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!’ that’s somewhat charming, on the other it’s the only bum note on an otherwise perfect album. The Bee Gees made a solid attempt at a cover but it still comes off incredibly gauche. Who better, then, than Tim Hecker to work his drone magic on the track in some strange, experimental re-work?\n\n1. ‘Within You Without You’\n\nOasis’s whine-psych version is perhaps the most famous of all the covers so far. I’d go for Lorde, who’s got one of the most interesting voices in music at the moment. Fun fact: did you know Stephen Stills was so impressed with the lyrics that he had them carved on a stone monument in his yard?\n\n2. ‘When I’m Sixty-Four’\n\nLet’s take this opportunity to manifest a dream duet. I’d go for Skrillex and Prince. Funk, womp, jazz and Prince Rogers Nelson on vocals.\n\n3. ‘Lovely Rita’\n\nThe Beatles paean to a female traffic warden was actually about a real person. A warden called Meta Davies gave Paul McCartney a ticket outside Abbey Road. The track directly inspired Pink Floyd’s ‘Pow R. Toc H.’ Working in Abbey Road at the same time, they overheard and later used the voice effects and noises such as the band playing comb and paper. One of the most interesting artists working with field recordings and samples today is Jon Hopkins so I’d put him in the driving seat.\n\n4. ‘Good Morning Good Morning’\n\nBlur. It’s got be Blur. Which other band has a member with a farm? The cockerel crow and then noises from birds, a cat, a dog, a cow, a horse, a sheep, a lion, an elephant, and a group of bloodhounds (!) would be provided by Alex James’s farm. Second, Coxon could scuzz it up with his frayed guitar and Damon would provide tongue-in-cheek, drawling vocals.\n\n5. ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)’\n\n6. ‘A Day in the Life’\n\nI’m sure plenty of readers would say The Libertines did justice to one of the greatest album closers of all time for the 40th anniversary. And, yeah, it isn’t so bad. I’d like to see Courtney Barnett cover it though. She’s got a similarly surreal and twisted way of looking at the world as well as a stunning way of bringing life to a lyrical narrative. Just check out The Lemonheads cover she did for us a while back.\n\nSo who’d you pick for the ultimate 100% unofficial Sgt. Pepper covers album?', 'Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ consists of The Flaming Lips, Miley Cyrus, MGMT and Tame Impala.\nIn 1998 NME released a cover album for Childline called ‘Sgt.\nBut, if you had to, who would you choose for a DIY Sgt Pepper’s album?\nPepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’This may already exist but few could trump Jimi Hendrix’s version of the opening track.\nPepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)’6.']"

However, as for who will play this trio of young leads, there have been a ton of rumors flying around speculating about who could land those roles. Though there are many possibilities on our heroes, recently ‘Girls’ and ‘Inside Llewn Davis’ star Adam Driver was pegged as the main antagonist.

Look for sequels to ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles.""\n\n\n\nIger revealed that Pixar is developing ""Cars 3"" and ""The Incredibles 2."" The former especially seems a no-brainer, as ""Cars"" (2006) earned over $461 million worldwide and its 2011 sequel earned over $559 million ... not to mention the gargantuan revenue brought in by ""Cars"" merchandise and the ""Cars""-themed park at California Adventure.\n\nIt\'s probably not a superhero movie unless it has a sequel (or five), so it seems rather overdue that ""The Incredibles"" is getting a second installment. The original film, released in 2004, grossed over $631 million worldwide.\n\n""The Incredibles"" was directed by Brad Bird, who is currently calling the shots on one of Disney\'s super-secret live-action projects, ""Tomorrowland,"" which stars George Clooney and hits theaters on May 22, 2015. We\'re assuming he\'ll be involved in the ""Incredibles"" sequel in some capacity.\n\n3. ""Pirates of the Caribbean 5"" is still a ways on the horizon.\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the next chapter in the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, Iger said that ""there\'s creative being done"" but it has not been officially approved for production.\n\nIt\'s been slow going getting a new ""Pirates"" film in the water, with the last installment, ""On Stranger Tides,"" released in May 2011 (and which grossed over $1 billion worldwide).

You should, because we’re only 21 months away from the release of Star Wars: Episode VII.

Because clearly nothing can go wrong with pumping out film after blockbuster film of a beloved franchise.\n\nHere's what we (sort of) know:\n\nTHE ACTORS\n\n1. Lupita Nyong’o met with JJ Abrams before the Oscars, and is rumored to be in the running for the female lead, possibly as a descendent of Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\n2. Adam Driver has been all but confirmed to be the Vader-like villain.\n\n3. Breaking Bad and Friday Night Light’s Jesse Plemons has been rumored to be the male lead.\n\n4.

Jordan says he auditioned.\n\n8. Gary Oldman and Benedict Cumberbatch may have both been after the same role—and both may have been cast.\n\n9. Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill are all coming back.\n\n10. There may be a female Sith bad guy.\n\n11. There’s a search for 7-foot actors, which could signal a Wookie.\n\n12. Billy Dee Williams may return. Which means everyone wins.\n\nTHE SCRIPT\n\n13. The film was originally supposed to follow the offspring of Luke, Leia and Han, but has reportedly since been rewritten to focus on the original trilogy characters. (Time travel? JJ sure does love doing that.)\n\n14. We may finally see the Sith home planet.\n\n15. Lawrence Kasdan is a co-writer. He did The Empire Strikes Back. This is a good thing.\n\n16. The film might begin with the reconstruction of the Republic, now that the Empire has fallen.\n\n17. John Williams will compose the score. (This movie wouldn’t feel right without the “Imperial March.”)\n\n18. It was reportedly that the film will focus on twins, and “which will take a path towards darkness and which will follow in their father’s footsteps.” Which could be a reference not to Luke and Leia, but to Jacen and Jaina Solo—Han and the Leia’s kids. For those who haven’t read Star Wars fiction, Jacen eventually chooses the dark side and turns into Darth Caedus.\n\nExcited, you will get."", 'You should, because we’re only 21 months away from the release of Star Wars: Episode VII.\nBecause clearly nothing can go wrong with pumping out film after blockbuster film of a beloved franchise.\nMichael Fassbender met with JJ Abrams to discuss a role, but it probably won’t be for Episode VII.\nHugo Weaving has also reportedly met for the role of “Imperial Commander.”7.\nFor those who haven’t read Star Wars fiction, Jacen eventually chooses the dark side and turns into Darth Caedus.']"

Well, here it is: the sequel/reboot is scheduled to begin shooting in early 2015, with the locale being none other than New York City.\n\nHere's the even bigger turn of events: Ivan Reitman has stepped down and will no longer direct. Instead, he'll act as a producer on the project and will play an integral part in finding a new director.\n\nIn an interview with Deadline, Reitman coughed up some details about what's been going on with the film and why he has decided to walk away from the director's chair.\n\nThere has been all kinds of stuff, unofficially written about Ghostbusters… I’ve been reading things online for about four years, speculation on who’s writing, what they’re writing, who’s in it, who we will use, and who’s directing.

We did five movies together including both Ghostbusters.”\n\nIt's clear that the passing of Harold Ramis had at least a partial effect on Reitman's decision:\n\nWhen I came back from Harold’s funeral, it was really moving and it made me think about a lot of things.

I told them I thought I could help but let’s find a really good director and make it with him. So that’s what we’ve agreed will happen. I didn’t want all kinds of speculation about what happened with me, that is the real story.”\n\nSo there you have it.

There is a major change, though. In the wake of the death of his close friend and original Ghostbuster Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman has decided he won’t direct the film, after all. Instead, Reitman will help Amy Pascal find a new director to take over what everyone hopes will reboot what the studio considers to be one of its most important franchises.\n\nIn all the years Sony has tried to get this film up and running, Reitman has been the most stable part of the equation, long locked to direct his third installment. This included the long campaign to get Bill Murray to reprise his signature role, when it became impossible to even get him to read a script that Sony, Reitman and their other architect Dan Aykroyd were happy with. It has been clear for a while that Murray wasn’t going to be part of this, and momentum has been building. Then Ramis, a catalyst for some of the biggest film comedies of the 1970s and ’80s, passed away. That has changed everything.\n\nReitman spoke exclusively with Deadline on his decision, and I’m going to give him ample room to explain why he changed his mind after so many years of being the primary person pushing this forward.\n\n“There has been all kinds of stuff, unofficially written about Ghostbusters,” Reitman told me. “I’ve been reading things online for about four years, speculation on who’s writing, what they’re writing, who’s in it, who we will use, and who’s directing.

As the principal cast of the first two movies aged, it was generally accepted that a reboot would focus on a younger cast of ghostbusters, with the original team (with or without Bill Murray, depending on when you asked) handing the reins over. While any new film has to be treated with a huge dose of skepticism after all these years, any plans for a new entry were definitely hurt when Harold Ramis (who co-wrote and starred in the first two movies) died last month.\n\nBetter late than never?\n\nNow, Ramis\' absence won\'t be the only thing missing from the next Ghostbusters movie — Deadline has just published an extensive interview with director Ivan Reitman, who confirms that he won\'t direct the next film after the passing of his friend. ""When I came back from Harold\'s funeral, it was really moving and it made me think about a lot of things,"" Reitman says. ""I just finally met with Amy [Pascal] and Doug Belgrad [from Sony Pictures] when I got back. I said I\'d been thinking about it for weeks, that I\'d rather just produce this Ghostbusters. I told them I thought I could help but let\'s find a really good director and make it with him.""\n\nReitman also reminisced fondly on the time he spent making the first two movies with Ramis and the original cast. ""It was such an amazing time in my life 30 years ago, and I felt that way on the second film,"" he said. ""With Harold no longer with us I couldn\'t see it.""\n\nOn Sony\'s end, Pascal confirmed Reitman\'s plans to help find a new director and produce the future movie, and said that Sony was ""eager to make this film."" Despite these strong public statements about the future of the franchise, it\'s hard not to be skeptical given the never-ending talk of a movie that hasn\'t yet come to pass. However, the principal cast did reunite for a 2009 video game that was based on an old script for a third Ghostbusters movie, and it appears that the creative team has finally settled on a script penned by Etan Cohen. Reitman says shooting should begin in 2015 — even though there\'s still no official director or cast.', 'The rumors of a third Ghostbusters film have fruitlessly swirled for years upon years, with franchise co-creator and star Dan Aykroyd dropping hints and teases of a potential movie for years.\nNow, Ramis\' absence won\'t be the only thing missing from the next Ghostbusters movie — Deadline has just published an extensive interview with director Ivan Reitman, who confirms that he won\'t direct the next film after the passing of his friend.\nReitman also reminisced fondly on the time he spent making the first two movies with Ramis and the original cast.\n""It was such an amazing time in my life 30 years ago, and I felt that way on the second film,"" he said.\nReitman says shooting should begin in 2015 — even though there\'s still no official director or cast.']"
23663,http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/ghostbusters-movie-going-forward-without-ivan-reitman-sony/,entertainment,"['EXCLUSIVE: Sony Pictures is eyeing an early 2015 production start in New York on its next installment of Ghostbusters. There is a major change, though. In the wake of the death of his close friend and original Ghostbuster Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman has decided he won’t direct the film, after all. Instead, Reitman will help Amy Pascal find a new director to take over what everyone hopes will reboot what the studio considers to be one of its most important franchises.\n\nIn all the years Sony has tried to get this film up and running, Reitman has been the most stable part of the equation, long locked to direct his third installment. This included the long campaign to get Bill Murray to reprise his signature role, when it became impossible to even get him to read a script that Sony, Reitman and their other architect Dan Aykroyd were happy with. It has been clear for a while that Murray wasn’t going to be part of this, and momentum has been building. Then Ramis, a catalyst for some of the biggest film comedies of the 1970s and ’80s, passed away. That has changed everything.\n\nReitman spoke exclusively with Deadline on his decision, and I’m going to give him ample room to explain why he changed his mind after so many years of being the primary person pushing this forward.\n\n“There has been all kinds of stuff, unofficially written about Ghostbusters,” Reitman told me. “I’ve been reading things online for about four years, speculation on who’s writing, what they’re writing, who’s in it, who we will use, and who’s directing. We’d decided not to comment up till now, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do, and it was never clear what Bill was going to do. A lot of things happened in the last few months, the most significant of which was the passing of Harold, who was a very good friend who was extraordinarily influential in my career. We did five movies together including both Ghostbusters.”\n\nReitman confirmed the Murray chase, one that encompassed not one but two scripts.\n\n“The first was done by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, and me, Harold and Dan helped them on it,” Reitman said. “It was a really good script, but then it became clear that Bill really didn’t want to do another Ghostbusters and that it was literally impossible to find him to speak to for the year or two we tried to get it going. When Bill finally…well, he never actually said no, but he never said yes, so there was no way to make that film. We decided to start over again, and I started working with Etan Cohen, with Dan lending a helping hand. Harold got sick about three years ago, and we kept hoping he would get better. I kept pushing forward on the Etan Cohen and we now have a draft that is very good, that the studio is very excited about.\n\n“It’s a version of Ghostbusters that has the originals in a very minor role,” he said. “When I came back from Harold’s funeral, it was really moving and it made me think about a lot of things. I’d just finished directing Draft Day, which I’m really happy with and proud of. Working on a film that is smaller and more dramatic was so much fun and satisfying. I just finally met with Amy and Doug Belgrad when I got back. I said I’d been thinking about it for weeks, that I’d rather just produce this Ghostbusters. I told them I thought I could help but let’s find a really good director and make it with him. So that’s what we’ve agreed will happen. I didn’t want all kinds of speculation about what happened with me, that is the real story.”\n\nSony’s Pascal confirmed this. “We totally understood,” she told me. “He was thinking he might feel that way when Harold died, and then came back to us and confirmed it, that while he was excited to return and make the movie as producer, but did not feel he wanted to direct the movie. We are delighted to work with Ivan on this movie in that capacity. We love him, and he’s going to continue to play an important role. We’re very anxious to get the movie started.”\n\nThe movie should give Sony a fresh start franchise and building those is a Sony priority, from stalwart James Bond to expanding the Spider-Man universe to rebooting Men In Black, and already commissioning Richard Wenk to write a sequel of the fall release The Equalizer, with Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua game to reprise a movie whose test scores have the studio bullish.\n\nThe death of a close friend and collaborator like Ramis can only make one question a lot of things, and Reitman was left feeling that retracing his steps without Ramis being there just didn’t feel right.\n\n“It was such an amazing time in my life 30 years ago, and I felt that way on the second film,” he said. “With Harold no longer with us I couldn’t see it.” Reitman said he’s proud of the way that the film has remained vibrant, even with all the fits and starts and obstacles for production. “It really seems to have resonated, and I think a lot of adults who saw it when they were younger have shown it to their kids and they seem to respond much the same way. Sony sees this as a huge worldwide opportunity, and it is eager to make the film.\n\nReitman said they are already working on a short list of directors they’ll go out to, and then it will be time to find the new cast. “I’m not going to say how many Ghostbusters there will be in the new cast, but we are determined to retain the spirit of the original film, and I am pleased that all of this seems to have happened organically,” he said. “I’m hoping we can get started by the fall, set in New York, but given the logistics and the stuff that happens, the beginning of 2015 seems more likely.”\n\nI tell Reitman I was around New York during that first movie, when traffic had to be re-rerouted each day near Central Park because of the mayhem created by the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man and the other slimy ghouls that haunted that film.\n\n“I am proud to have a long history of closing big boulevards in New York,” said Reitman. Now he’ll just do it as producer. He’s repped by CAA.', 'EXCLUSIVE: Sony Pictures is eyeing an early 2015 production start in New York on its next installment of Ghostbusters.\nIn the wake of the death of his close friend and original Ghostbuster Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman has decided he won’t direct the film, after all.\n“There has been all kinds of stuff, unofficially written about Ghostbusters,” Reitman told me.\n“The first was done by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, and me, Harold and Dan helped them on it,” Reitman said.\n“I am proud to have a long history of closing big boulevards in New York,” said Reitman.']"

Let us know what you\'re feeling in the comments below. After many, many, many years of false starts and rumors, it\'s tremendously hard to really trust Ghostbusters 3 stories anymore, but we may now be closer than ever to seeing the film actually happen: Deadline is now reporting that Sony Pictures is moving full steam ahead with the 80s comedy sequel and plans to have cameras rolling on the production early next year. Perhaps the biggest new development, however, is in regard to who will be sitting in the director\'s chair.While it has long been planned that it would be Ivan Reitman who would end up directing Ghostbusters 3 - as he was also the man behind the first two movies - apparently that is no longer the case. Following the tragic death of star Harold Ramis, Reitman has decided that he no longer wants to direct the film himself. Instead, he will only serve as a producer and will assist the studio in finding his replacement.Reitman actually spoke with Deadline to announce his decision to step away as director on the project and the filmmaker also went into some detail about the trials and the tribulations that the project has experienced over the years. He explains what kind of role we can expect the original Ghostbusters to have in the script and that he ultimately just wasn\'t interested in taking on a blockbuster-level film. Said the filmmaker,Exactly who those original Ghostbusters will be remains a big question mark. Bill Murray has really been out of the picture since 2012 , and after Ramis passing that only leaves Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson. Even Hudson\'s connection to the project may be questionable, however. After Ramis\' death, the actor known to fans as Winston Zeddmore told a reporter , ""There can\'t be another Ghostbusters without Harold. It will be a Ghost- something, but it won\'t be... That was always my fear - that something would happen before we all got together.""As for the search for Reitman\'s replacement, the filmmaker and the studio have already been working on drafting a short list and a timetable is already being put in place.

Deadline has word that Sony Pictures is hoping to being production in New York sometime in that window, but Ivan Reitman will no longer be directing. Despite some grumbling back in 2010, the studio apparently didn\'t have a problem with bringing Reitman back into the fray to direct a new Ghostbusters, and at one time in 2012, Paramount Pictures even paused development on Reitman\'s football film Draft Day because he was reported to go shoot the sequel. Read on!\n\nBut now, with the passing of Harold Ramis still fresh in his mind (and reports of a reworked script coming down the line because of it), Reitman has decided step out from behind the camera, and will help the studio find a new director to take over what is being considered a reboot. Reitman gave a lengthy statement to Deadline about his decision saying:\n\n“There has been all kinds of stuff, unofficially written about \'Ghostbusters.\' I’ve been reading things online for about four years, speculation on who’s writing, what they’re writing, who’s in it, who we will use, and who’s directing. We’d decided not to comment up till now, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do, and it was never clear what Bill [Murray] was going to do. A lot of things happened in the last few months, the most significant of which was the passing of Harold, who was a very good friend who was extraordinarily influential in my career. We did five movies together including both \'Ghostbusters.\'”\n\nAnd then he dived into the various versions of Ghostbusters 3 that have emerged over the years:\n\n“The first was done by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, and me, Harold [Ramis] and Dan [Aykroyd] helped them on it. It was a really good script, but then it became clear that Bill really didn’t want to do another Ghostbusters and that it was literally impossible to find him to speak to for the year or two we tried to get it going. When Bill finally…well, he never actually said no, but he never said yes, so there was no way to make that film. We decided to start over again, and I started working with Etan Cohen, with Dan lending a helping hand. Harold got sick about three years ago, and we kept hoping he would get better. I kept pushing forward on the Etan Cohen and we now have a draft that is very good, that the studio is very excited about.""\n\nSo what made him decide to stick with the project even after Ramis\' death?\n\n“It’s a version of \'Ghostbusters\' that has the originals in a very minor role. When I came back from Harold’s funeral, it was really moving and it made me think about a lot of things. I’d just finished directing \'Draft Day,\' which I’m really happy with and proud of. Working on a film that is smaller and more dramatic was so much fun and satisfying. I just finally met with Amy [Pascal] and Doug Belgrad when I got back. I said I’d been thinking about it for weeks, that I’d rather just produce this \'Ghostbusters.\' I told them I thought I could help but let’s find a really good director and make it with him. So that’s what we’ve agreed will happen. I didn’t want all kinds of speculation about what happened with me, that is the real story.”\n\nSo what kind of reboot are we looking at here, and who might direct ? Unfortunately, Reitman wasn\'t ready to divulge any details saying, ""I’m not going to say how many Ghostbusters there will be in the new cast, but we are determined to retain the spirit of the original film, and I am pleased that all of this seems to have happened organically. I’m hoping we can get started by the fall, set in New York, but given the logistics and the stuff that happens, the beginning of 2015 seems more likely.” For my money, I think Sony needs to call in their 21 Jump Street and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs directors Phil Lord & Chris Miller to direct, because they seem to be able to do no wrong.

Or I should say was since Reitman has exited the helm in the wake of Harold Ramis’ death. Reitman had been on board the project for quite some time, much of which was spent attempting to sway Bill Murray to join the threequel, especially since Sony and Dan Aykroyd were pleased with the current script. Now, we’ve heard that not only will there be rewrites to that script, but that Reitman will step aside in order to help find a new director to carry the film forward. Hit the jump for more on Reitman’s departure, and why this might not be a bad thing for the film, since Sony is now eyeing a production start date early in 2015 in New York.\n\nDeadline reports that Reitman is exiting the director’s chair for Ghostbusters 3, but that the studio is now setting their sights on an early 2015 start for the film. Here’s what Reitman had to say:\n\n“There has been all kinds of stuff, unofficially written about Ghostbusters,” Reitman told me. “I’ve been reading things online for about four years, speculation on who’s writing, what they’re writing, who’s in it, who we will use, and who’s directing.

A lot of things happened in the last few months, the most significant of which was the passing of Harold, who was a very good friend who was extraordinarily influential in my career. We did five movies together including both Ghostbusters.”\n\nReitman also talked about the lengthy process to try and secure Murray, which encompassed two scripts:\n\n“The first was done by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, and me, Harold and Dan helped them on it,” Reitman said. “It was a really good script, but then it became clear that Bill really didn’t want to do another Ghostbusters and that it was literally impossible to find him to speak to for the year or two we tried to get it going. When Bill finally…well, he never actually said no, but he never said yes, so there was no way to make that film.

They already have a shortlist of directors in mind, but no names have been revealed just yet. Same goes for the cast, which they would like to start putting together this fall. Honestly, this is probably the best possible outcome from an unfortunate situation. A clean start to the sequel will allow Sony to build a new franchise around the popular property while staying true to the spirit of the original films.', '0The most consistent cog in the machine to get Ghostbusters 3 up and running over the years is arguably director Ivan Reitman.\nOr I should say was since Reitman has exited the helm in the wake of Harold Ramis’ death.\nDeadline reports that Reitman is exiting the director’s chair for Ghostbusters 3, but that the studio is now setting their sights on an early 2015 start for the film.\nHere’s what Reitman had to say:“There has been all kinds of stuff, unofficially written about Ghostbusters,” Reitman told me.\nI told them I thought I could help but let’s find a really good director and make it with him.']"
