In 2012, the rate of incidence was one in 88.\n\nNew findings released March 27 in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, include data collected by University of Alabama at Birmingham researchers who lead the Alabama Autism Surveillance project, a part of the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network.\n\nAutism spectrum disorders are a group of developmental disabilities that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. The ADDM Network data help the CDC direct research into potential risk factors and help communities direct outreach efforts to those who need it most.\n\n“We are confident that some of this increase is due to increased awareness and access to services; however, those issues don’t explain all of the increase,” Martha Wingate, Dr.PH, director of the AASP and associate professor in the UAB School of Public Health, said of the data, which were collected at 11 ADDM sites during the 2010 surveillance year.\n\n“Our study focuses on providing an estimate of children affected to help with policy development and planning for medical providers and schools, but other researchers are working hard to figure out why there is an increase,” Wingate said. “Some studies are looking at paternal age, preterm birth and other factors; but there is not one cause.”\n\nIn Alabama, the number of 8-year-olds identified was one in 175 children, compared with one in 303 in 2002. Wingate says this is lower than at some other ADDM sites, but it’s still an increase of more than 70 percent.\n\nThe study also found approximately one in 42 boys and one in 189 girls living in the ADDM Network communities were identified as having ASD. Non-Hispanic white children were approximately 30 percent more likely to be identified with ASD than were non-Hispanic black children, and they were almost 50 percent more likely to be identified with ASD than were Hispanic children.\n\n“Our biggest focus continues to be on recognizing the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities and getting children access to services early,” Wingate said. “The CDC’s “Learn the Signs. Act Early.” campaign is focused on educating providers and parents about the importance of recognizing developmental delays and getting children into the appropriate services.”\n\nAbout UABKnown for its innovative and interdisciplinary approach to education at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, the University of Alabama at Birmingham is an internationally renowned research university and academic medical center and the state of Alabama’s largest employer, with some 23,000 employees and an economic impact exceeding $5 billion annually on the state. The five pillars of UAB’s mission deliver knowledge that will change your world: the education of students, who are exposed to multidisciplinary learning and a new world of diversity; research, the creation of new knowledge; patient care, the outcome of ‘bench-to-bedside’ translational knowledge; service to the community at home and around the globe, from free clinics in local neighborhoods to the transformational experience of the arts; and the economic development of Birmingham and Alabama.

ALPROLIX is indicated for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with hemophilia B. The therapy is shown to reduce bleeding episodes with prophylactic (protective) infusions starting at least a week apart.\n\nThe approval of ALPROLIX is the first significant advance in hemophilia B treatment in more than 17 years. The therapy is clinically proven to reduce bleeding episodes with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. It is developed using a process called Fc fusion and is the first hemophilia therapy to demonstrate prolonged circulation in the body, which has been shown in adults and adolescents with hemophilia to extend the time between prophylactic infusions.\n\n""The FDA approval of ALPROLIX is a significant milestone for the hemophilia B community, and represents an important first step in our commitment to transform the care of people with hemophilia,"" said George A. Scangos, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Biogen Idec. ""ALPROLIX offers people with hemophilia B the ability to prevent or reduce bleeding episodes with prophylactic infusions starting at least a week apart. We believe this new therapy will help more people with hemophilia and their caregivers realize the benefits of this treatment approach.""\n\nThe National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) recommends routine prophylaxis as optimal for the treatment of people with severe hemophilia. Studies show people with severe hemophilia who follow this type of regimen experience fewer bleeding episodes and their related risks. Complications of bleeding episodes may range from severe swelling and pain to arthritis, joint damage and physical disability.1,2,3\n\n""Hemophilia has a significant impact on people whom it affects, throughout their lives,"" said Patrick F. Fogarty, M.D.,4 assistant professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, and director, Penn Comprehensive Hemophilia and Thrombosis Program. ""ALPROLIX addresses a critical need by allowing people with hemophilia B to maintain factor levels with prophylactic infusions once weekly or once every 10 days. We hope this will facilitate use of prophylactic therapy.""\n\nHemophilia B is a rare, chronic, inherited disorder in which the ability of a person\'s blood to clot is impaired, which can lead to recurrent and extended bleeding episodes. Therapies for hemophilia B can be administered either on a schedule to help prevent or reduce bleeding episodes (prophylaxis), or to help control a bleeding episode when it occurs (on-demand). According to NHF guidelines, traditional hemophilia B therapy requires prophylactic infusions two or more times a week.\n\n""The hemophilia community is excited about new therapy options for the prophylactic management of hemophilia B,"" said Val Bias, chief executive officer of the National Hemophilia Foundation. ""This approval is a significant step forward because it provides an important new option and expanded choice for the hemophilia B community.""\n\nThe approval of ALPROLIX is based on results from the global, Phase 3 B-LONG study, as well as interim pharmacokinetic (measurement of the presence of the therapy in a person\'s body over time) and safety data from the Phase 3 Kids B-LONG study. B-LONG study results showed that adults and adolescents with severe hemophilia B achieved prevention or reduction of bleeding episodes with prophylactic infusions at least a week apart. The study included two prophylaxis regimens - the weekly prophylaxis arm and the individualized-interval prophylaxis arm, in which the dosing interval started at once every 10 days. The overall median dosing interval with individualized-interval prophylaxis was 12.5 days; during the last six months of the study, the median interval was 13.8 days. More than 90 percent of all bleeding episodes were controlled by a single ALPROLIX infusion.\n\nNo participants in the B-LONG study developed inhibitors (neutralizing antibodies that may interfere with the activity of the therapy) to ALPROLIX. There were no reports of vascular clots or serious allergic reactions. Across the routine prophylaxis and on-demand therapy arms, adverse reactions were reported in 8.4 percent of participants. These adverse reactions included headache, oral paresthesia (abnormal sensation in the mouth), dizziness, dysgeusia (taste alteration), breath odor, fatigue, infusion site pain, palpitations, obstructive uropathy (an obstructing clot in the urinary collecting system) and hypotension (low blood pressure). Each event occurred in two or fewer study participants.\n\nAn interim analysis from an ongoing, multi-center Phase 3 pediatric study - Kids B-LONG -showed no inhibitors were detected, and the increase in half-life (a measure of the time therapy remains in the body) seen with ALPROLIX was consistent with data reported in adults and adolescents.\n\nALPROLIX was recently approved by Health Canada for the treatment of hemophilia B and is currently under review by regulatory authorities in several other countries, including Australia and Japan.\n\nBiogen Idec plans to make ALPROLIX commercially available to people with hemophilia B in the United States in early May. To help address the hemophilia B community\'s needs, Biogen Idec is committed to providing equitable access to therapy, as well as a variety of personalized assistance and resources through MyALPROLIX™ Services.', 'The approval of ALPROLIX is the first significant advance in hemophilia B treatment in more than 17 years.\n""ALPROLIX offers people with hemophilia B the ability to prevent or reduce bleeding episodes with prophylactic infusions starting at least a week apart.\nAccording to NHF guidelines, traditional hemophilia B therapy requires prophylactic infusions two or more times a week.\n""This approval is a significant step forward because it provides an important new option and expanded choice for the hemophilia B community.""\nBiogen Idec plans to make ALPROLIX commercially available to people with hemophilia B in the United States in early May.']"

Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks and other problems.In the United States, 67 million people have high blood pressure, and it resists treatment in about 10 percent of them.The new findings on denervation are likely to surprise many doctors, because previous case reports and studies had found astounding drops in blood pressure after the treatment — as much as 30 millimeters of mercury in systolic pressure, the top number in a blood pressure reading.“I think many people were anticipating there would be some degree of reduction and will be surprised there wasn’t anything,” said Dr. Deepak L. Bhatt, an author of the study and executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nBut the negative finding should not kill research into denervation, Bhatt said, because performing the procedure in a different way might work.\n\nThe idea behind denervation came from studies decades ago involving surgical procedures that did lower blood pressure — but too much, so that patients would faint when they tried to get out of bed.\n\nThe new study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, was presented at a cardiology meeting in Washington.\n\nThe earlier reports led to great enthusiasm for denervation in Europe and other parts of the world, and it has been approved in more than 80 countries and performed on thousands of patients.

This study comes on the heels of a CDC report released this week that says rates of autism diagnoses are surging far higher than they\'ve predicted. Researchers for a new study released by the New England Journal of Medicine looked at brain tissue from 11 autistic children who died and compared with with 11 children without autism. In 10 of the 11 samples from the children with autism, they found ""patches of disorganization in the cortex,"" NPR reported. These patches, or clusters of disorganized brain cells, came from the region of the brain that regulates communication, emotions and ability to function in social settings, things that can be difficult for children with autism. These parts of the brain start developing during the second trimester, said Eric Courchesne, director of the Autism Center of Excellence at the University of California, San Diego and an author of the paper. ""So something must have gone wrong at or before that time,"" Courchesne said, according to NPR. ""Because this points to the biological onset in prenatal life, it calls sharply into question other popular notions about autism."" These popular notions include the now-refuted claims, made popular by the likes of Jenny McCarthy, that vaccinations can cause autism. The CDC released a report this week that says there\'s a 30 percent increase among 8-year-olds diagnosed with autism. While the huge jump might be startling, the CDC also says this increase reflects better awareness and more accurate diagnoses. However, the number of reported cases varies widely by state. ""The number of children identified with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) ranged from 1 in 175 children in Alabama to 1 in 45 children in New Jersey,"" CDC said in its report, based on a 2010 survey. While autism rates are soaring, scientists have been scrambling to find a cause. This new study supports other research that suggests autism can begin in the brain\'s frontal region during pregnancy, but experts say it should be considered preliminary. ""But, this research provides probably some of the most elegant evidence for those two very important biological themes,"" Dr. Janet Lainhart, an autism researcher and psychiatry professor at the University of Wisconsin, told the Associated Press. The CDC report on surging rates combined with the new study that shows autism can begin in the womb shows that it is vital to begin helping kids as early as possible to try and rewire their brains, experts say. ""The most important thing for parents to do is to act early when there is a concern about a child\'s development,"" Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, chief of CDC\'s Developmental Disabilities Branch, told NBC News. ""If you have a concern about how your child plays, learns, speaks, acts or moves, take action. Don\'t wait."" This study is one of the first that included samples taken from children. Most studies have only been able to look at tissue samples from adults. Advocacy groups for autism have started a program asking for brain tissue donations to help researchers.

The differences are seen in certain brain layers. The research, led by Eric Courchesne and Rich Stoner from the University of California San Diego Autism Center of Excellence, is published in the March 27 New England Journal of Medicine. They analyzed brain tissue of children ages 2 to 15 who had died, including both those with and those without autism. By examining gene expression in the brain tissue, they were able to locate abnormal neurons in some of the brain layers. ""While autism is generally considered a developmental brain disorder, research has not identified a consistent or causative lesion,"" Dr. Thomas R. Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, noted in a written statement. ""If this new report of disorganized architecture in the brains of some children with autism is replicated, we can presume this reflects a process occurring long before birth. This reinforces the importance of early identification and intervention."" In background information, the researchers explained that during brain development, neurons within the cortex form six layers, each with different types of cells and connection patterns. The researchers looked at cellular markers and found them absent in 91 percent of the samples taken from children who had had autism. That was true of only 9 percent of the other samples. The difference was found in focal patches encompassing multiple layers of the cortex in both the frontal and temporal lobes, they said. Those are the parts of the brain that control social and emotional communication and language functions. ""Considering that disturbances in these types of behaviors are hallmarks of autism,"" the NIMH summary said, ""the researchers conclude that the specific locations of the patches may underlie the expression and severity of various symptoms in a child with the disorder."" ""Each patient\'s constellation of symptoms may depend strongly on where the patches occur and how many of them there are,"" Stoner told Reuters Health. ""I\'m hoping (the new findings) are going to drive more research in this area so we can figure out what these are and figure out what the cells are like in these regions, and start to integrate this with some of the genetic findings,"" Stoner added. Early diagnosis and treatment has been shown to help. The researchers theorize that such improvement may occur because the defect does occur in patches, which means there is normal brain tissue in between. With treatment, the other parts of the developing brain may create new connections that allow the child to ""sidestep"" some of the challenges associated with autism.

As two Indian companies are importing oil from Iran, India was expecting tough measures from the US on oil import. However, the US has extended a waiver to some countries in trade with Iran. The Indian media is claiming that India is also among those countries that include China, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, allowing them to continue buying the Iranian oil without consequences for six months.\n\nReports say that India had imported about 22 million tonnes of crude oil from Iran in 2017-18. But its plans to increase the imports to 30 million tonnes in 2018-19 were hurt by the US sanctions imposed on Iranian nuclear programme. Now the Indian firms have got a waiver from the US, allowing them to import 1.25 million tonnes a month up to March 2019. According to reports, the Indian Oil Corp will lift six million barrels of Iranian oil while the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd three million barrels in November 2018.\n\nIran, India\'s third-largest oil supplier behind Iraq and Saudi Arabia, provides 60 days of credit for purchases, a facility not available from other countries. In 2013-14, India had bought 11 million tonnes of oil from Iran and and in 2014-15, 10.95 million tonnes. The figure rose to 12.7 million tonnes in 2015-16.\n\nThe Indians have reportedly told the US that they had a concise payment mechanism with regard to oil imports from Iran. It is likely that India will make payment to Iran in terms of euro and rupees.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently said in India that the Trump administration wanted buyers of Iranian oil to end their imports though it would consider a waiver for Indian imports in this regard. The Indian foreign minister had earlier stated that her country followed sanctions imposed by the UN and not any other country. Meanwhile, the European Union is working on the creation of a special purpose vehicle to facilitate trade with Iran.\n\nAccording to some observers, the waiver to India is a retreat and humiliation of US President Trump as India has again hoodwinked the US. Moreover, the Indian media also claims that such facilitation will be till India goes to polls in 2019. Such claim is aimed at neutralizing the embarrassment due to Trump’s refusal to attend the Republic Day gathering in India.\n\nOn the other hand, CAATSA -- the Countering America\'s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act -- allows the US to hurt Moscow\'s dealings with many countries buying Russian weapons. India is vulnerable to Section 231 of the new law, which imposes sanctions on individuals and countries that deal with Russia\'s intelligence and defence sectors. The US is granting favours to India as it thinks sanctions and American interference in India\'s defence procurement policies ""will create a backlash in India and torpedo the growing strategic and defence partnership between New Delhi and Washington.""\n\nThe US backtracking on India\'s S-400 missile deal shows the impotence of CAATSA.

68124,http://www.denverpost.com/marijuana/ci_25450052/cbd-marijuana-oil-changing-game,health,"['A Colorado marijuana innovation is changing the way lawmakers in even the most conservative parts of the country talk about cannabis and is poised to create a rapid expansion in the number of states that have legalized marijuana in some way.\n\nBut many marijuana advocates view the new political campaign with skepticism, fearing it could halt their movement’s momentum.\n\nThe invention is a non-psychoactive oil made from marijuana plants that is used to treat children with severe seizure disorders. The oil is rich in a chemical called cannabidiol, or CBD, but is low in THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nSpurred by parents of epileptic children, legislatures in at least a dozen states so far this year have or will consider bills about the marijuana oil. Last week, the governor of Utah signed into law a bill legalizing possession of the oil. A bill in Alabama has passed the Legislature and is awaiting the governor’s signature. Lawmakers in Kentucky, Florida, South Carolina, Wisconsin and other states have or will consider CBD bills this year.\n\n“What the CBD movement has done, I think, is brought in the soccer moms to the discussion,” said Josh Stanley, one of a family of Colorado brothers who own a medical marijuana business and developed the oil. “It’s brought in the mainstream, and it’s brought in the conservatives.”\n\nBut, even though the bills amount to the most successful discussions ever held about marijuana legalization in some of the states where they are being considered, the nation’s largest marijuana-reform groups view them with skepticism.\n\nThe deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has criticized them as “unworkable” and without real benefits. A policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance is concerned the bills will leave other reform efforts behind.\n\n“Is it better than nothing?” asked Mason Tvert, the national spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project and one of the leaders of the marijuana legalization campaign in Colorado. “Potentially. But if it means there is no longer a pressing need for comprehensive medical marijuana legislation, these will be a net negative.”\n\nMore restrictive\n\nCurrently, 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. Because the CBD oil is derived from marijuana plants, states that legalize it will also be crosswise with federal law. But because the CBD laws are far more restrictive than typical medical marijuana laws, advocates on all sides of the issues aren’t putting states that pass them in the medical marijuana column.\n\nWhat the CBD bills have exposed is the long-standing tension within the marijuana movement.\n\nStruggling to generate interest for broader marijuana legalization in the mid-1990s, activists instead got behind more limited medical marijuana initiatives. Since then, reform campaigns have taken on a well-established multiyear pattern: medical marijuana, then dispensaries, then full legalization.\n\nBut activists have long feared that, taken to its logical conclusion, medical marijuana could be a “box canyon” for broader legalization efforts. Basically, if more refined medicines derived from marijuana are available, why should lawmakers allow people to grow pot at home?\n\nThat is exactly where many activists worry the CBD bills will take their movement — and, perhaps not coincidentally, exactly where people opposed to legalization hope it will go.\n\n“The question is not if but how,” said Kevin Sabet, the executive director of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. “How do we deliver it to families?”\n\nSabet, whose group opposes marijuana legalization, said he supports further research into and medical development of CBD treatment. But he said that should occur within the established medical processes, something he said the federal government is increasingly willing to expedite.\n\nOne pharmaceutical drug — made from 100 percent CBD derived from marijuana plants — has been cleared for clinical trials. The only lab in the country with federal approval to grow marijuana, at the University of Mississippi, will reportedly start growing more CBD-rich strains for researchers to study.\n\n“Used as pawns”\n\nSabet said using CBD bills to create interest in marijuana legalization is cynical.\n\n“I think you have a lot of people here who are being used as pawns by the broader legalization movement,” he said.\n\nTvert, however, said the cynicism lies on the other side. He points to Minnesota, where the governor has proposed a study on CBD in lieu of broad medical marijuana legalization and parents backing medical marijuana have called the move disingenuous.\n\n“It raises the question of whether these CBD-only bills are good enough,” Tvert said.\n\nEven Stanley acknowledges the bills will likely have little immediate impact.

68126,http://www.denverpost.com/marijuana/ci_25450052/marijuana-innovation-could-open-doors-other-states-some,health,"['A Colorado marijuana innovation is changing the way lawmakers in even the most conservative parts of the country talk about cannabis and is poised to create a rapid expansion in the number of states that have legalized marijuana in some way.\n\nBut many marijuana advocates view the new political campaign with skepticism, fearing it could halt their movement’s momentum.\n\nThe invention is a non-psychoactive oil made from marijuana plants that is used to treat children with severe seizure disorders. The oil is rich in a chemical called cannabidiol, or CBD, but is low in THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nSpurred by parents of epileptic children, legislatures in at least a dozen states so far this year have or will consider bills about the marijuana oil. Last week, the governor of Utah signed into law a bill legalizing possession of the oil. A bill in Alabama has passed the Legislature and is awaiting the governor’s signature. Lawmakers in Kentucky, Florida, South Carolina, Wisconsin and other states have or will consider CBD bills this year.\n\n“What the CBD movement has done, I think, is brought in the soccer moms to the discussion,” said Josh Stanley, one of a family of Colorado brothers who own a medical marijuana business and developed the oil. “It’s brought in the mainstream, and it’s brought in the conservatives.”\n\nBut, even though the bills amount to the most successful discussions ever held about marijuana legalization in some of the states where they are being considered, the nation’s largest marijuana-reform groups view them with skepticism.\n\nThe deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws has criticized them as “unworkable” and without real benefits. A policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance is concerned the bills will leave other reform efforts behind.\n\n“Is it better than nothing?” asked Mason Tvert, the national spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project and one of the leaders of the marijuana legalization campaign in Colorado. “Potentially. But if it means there is no longer a pressing need for comprehensive medical marijuana legislation, these will be a net negative.”\n\nMore restrictive\n\nCurrently, 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana. Because the CBD oil is derived from marijuana plants, states that legalize it will also be crosswise with federal law. But because the CBD laws are far more restrictive than typical medical marijuana laws, advocates on all sides of the issues aren’t putting states that pass them in the medical marijuana column.\n\nWhat the CBD bills have exposed is the long-standing tension within the marijuana movement.\n\nStruggling to generate interest for broader marijuana legalization in the mid-1990s, activists instead got behind more limited medical marijuana initiatives. Since then, reform campaigns have taken on a well-established multiyear pattern: medical marijuana, then dispensaries, then full legalization.\n\nBut activists have long feared that, taken to its logical conclusion, medical marijuana could be a “box canyon” for broader legalization efforts. Basically, if more refined medicines derived from marijuana are available, why should lawmakers allow people to grow pot at home?\n\nThat is exactly where many activists worry the CBD bills will take their movement — and, perhaps not coincidentally, exactly where people opposed to legalization hope it will go.\n\n“The question is not if but how,” said Kevin Sabet, the executive director of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. “How do we deliver it to families?”\n\nSabet, whose group opposes marijuana legalization, said he supports further research into and medical development of CBD treatment. But he said that should occur within the established medical processes, something he said the federal government is increasingly willing to expedite.\n\nOne pharmaceutical drug — made from 100 percent CBD derived from marijuana plants — has been cleared for clinical trials. The only lab in the country with federal approval to grow marijuana, at the University of Mississippi, will reportedly start growing more CBD-rich strains for researchers to study.\n\n“Used as pawns”\n\nSabet said using CBD bills to create interest in marijuana legalization is cynical.\n\n“I think you have a lot of people here who are being used as pawns by the broader legalization movement,” he said.\n\nTvert, however, said the cynicism lies on the other side. He points to Minnesota, where the governor has proposed a study on CBD in lieu of broad medical marijuana legalization and parents backing medical marijuana have called the move disingenuous.\n\n“It raises the question of whether these CBD-only bills are good enough,” Tvert said.\n\nEven Stanley acknowledges the bills will likely have little immediate impact. The Utah law, for instance, allows parents to possess the oil in that state if a neurologist has said their children will benefit from it. But the law contains no provision for growing marijuana in Utah or making the oil there. And, because it is only sold as a medical marijuana product in Colorado, people have to be Colorado residents to obtain it.\n\nStanley said his brothers are working on manufacturing the oil from low-THC plants classified as hemp — thus allowing it to be produced outside of Colorado’s complicated medical marijuana system.

Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center, has eight topics that need to be considered.\n\nHere are eight issues to research and discuss before beginning to debate full legalization of marijuana, courtesy of Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center and a co-author of “Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know.”\n\n\n\nKilmer calls his recommendations the Eight Ps.\n\n\n\nProduction: Where and how will the marijuana be grown? On existing farms? Specialty farms? Indoors? Just who grows it and how is that determined?\n\nProfit: How will it be sold? Like alcohol and tobacco, by big companies with high-powered lobbyists? By small independent growers and shops? By the state? Promotion: How will the marketing of marijuana be regulated? If the regulations are too strict, they might face free speech challenges. If they’re too loose, your child may wonder what’s wrong with smoking – or eating – marijuana. Prevention: People say legalize it, tax it and pay for prevention. “But it seems like people want to have that all at once,” says Kilmer. Communities must develop strategies for education and prevention well before they legalize marijuana. Potency: Some THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) can get you high and make you paranoid. Much of the pot sold in Colorado is pretty strong, with a THC percentage of about 10 to 20 percent, compared to 3 percent in the 1970s. Should the THC be limited, as is being discussed in the Netherlands? Another chemical in marijuana – cannabidiol, or CBD – may offset some of the effects of the THC. Should we put a limit on the ratio of THC to CBD? Purity: In addition to potency, marijuana should be tested for mold and pesticides, says Kilmer. Will products like hash oil – legal in Colorado – be allowed in E-cigarettes, tobacco products or alcohol? Price: How will the price be set? If it’s too low, more people will use marijuana –including people from neighboring states. If it’s too high, because of high taxes, there may be a black market. Permanence: When a state develops regulations, it must build flexibility into them so the laws can be changed, says Kilmer. This is particularly important if lobbyists play a role in creating laws that benefit the industry – laws those lobbyists will fight to keep in place. -- Steve Israel, Middletown (N.Y.)

Now we are beginning to see the indicators of the indirect fiscal benefit from legalization.\n\nWe heard reports of the $2.1 million raised in recreational marijuana taxes from $14 million worth of product sold in January.

According to an analysis by Priceline.com, Denver trails only Las Vegas and New Orleans in being booked for Spring Break by people with .edu (college) email addresses. Denver is more popular than traditional Spring Break locales Fort Lauderdale, Florida; South Padre Island, Texas; and Cancun, Mexico.\n\nColorado pot shops still report that about half of the IDs they check are from out-of-state, despite the lack of most anywhere for a tourist to smoke pot legally. Public consumption is banned and almost all hotels are non-smoking. But Rich Grant, spokesman for Denver\'s visitor and convention bureau, says he\'s heard of hotel guests asking about the fine for smoking in a non-smoking room, then paying the $250 up front.\n\nThen there are the upwards of 300 families who have moved or are moving to Colorado to access lifesaving CBD oil for their epileptic children. They are probably a fraction of the people who have emigrated to Colorado, many of whom are patients with PTSD and other conditions not covered by most states\' medical laws (including Colorado\'s), but who can access legal marijuana.\n\nDespite all these obvious indicators of legalization immigration and toker tourism, Grant still says ""we\'ll probably never really be able to tell"" whether marijuana\'s legality is attracting all these out-of-towners, like Doug Drumm of Syracuse, New York, who told Denver\'s Fox 31, that prior to legalization, ""We would never have stopped in Denver.

John Hickenlooper signed the new law, which will require the same packaging for edible marijuana products as would be required of other pharmaceutical products. The aim of the law is to make edible marijuana products less accessible to children who may mistake them for food or treats. ""This is an important step in Colorado\'s marijuana laws,"" a representative of A&A Global Imports said. ""The requirement for these products to be packaged in opaque childproof packaging is a sensible and rational regulation.""\n\nLawmakers and doctors alike supported this measure, citing an increase in emergency room visits as a result of accidental exposure since the new law took effect on Jan 1st. A&A\'s representatives reiterated his company\'s position on child safety. ""We support this law because marijuana is a medical treatment that should treated with all the same safety precautions that govern over-the-counter and prescription medications."" He expressed concern that allowing recreational marijuana providers loopholes to sell cannabis free of these precautions is irresponsible.

By those all-important measures, there was no significant difference between the two TAVR systems 30 days after the procedure.\n\n“Medtronic believes that physicians will look to more rigorous trials with hard clinical endpoints when evaluating these valves to provide reliable guidance on TAVR device selection,” Medtronic said in a statement.\n\nMedtronic also took issue with the method used to assess aortic valve leakage in the independent German study, calling the angiography readings “the least effective measure for determining aortic regurgitation.”\n\nThe researchers plan to follow the patients for five years to compare the longer-term health outcomes of the two groups, which is likely to yield more meaningful information.\n\n“It’s possible some of these differences might not persist over time,” said Dr. Saul Vizel, a cardiologist with Cambridge Memorial Hospital in Cambridge, Ontario, who was not involved in the study. “The jury is still out for sure, because they’re doing one-year and two-year follow-ups and people will wait for those.”\n\nDr. Patrick O’Gara, incoming president of the American College of Cardiology from Brigham & Women’s Hospital in Boston, also was not ready to declare a winner based on the German study.\n\n“I would like to see a larger trial with more endpoints,” O’Gara said. “It would be premature to overinterpret these findings.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Edwards Lifesciences had a more favorable view of the findings than Medtronic.\n\n“This independent, multi-center randomized study is consistent with the experience in Europe, where more clinicians choose Sapien XT over CoreValve for the treatment of their patients,” Edwards spokeswoman Sarah Huoh said in an emailed statement. “These data are reflective of the findings of multiple, real-world European registries.”\n\nTAVR procedures have been performed in Europe since 2007 but are relatively new in the United States. The first Sapien system gained U.S. approval in 2011, and Medtronic’s CoreValve was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January.\n\nThe CoreValve uses a smaller, potentially easier-to-maneuver, catheter than the original Sapien. Edwards expects U.S. approval of the next-generation Sapien XT with a similarly smaller catheter in the coming months.\n\nMore than 100,000 people in the United States have severe aortic stenosis, with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart surgery, making them potential TAVR candidates.\n\nIndustry analysts expect the Sapien XT and CoreValve to be important future growth drivers for Edwards and Medtronic.\n\n“We now have new valves coming out that will probably be even better,” Abdel-Wahab said. “These results can help inform the design of future devices.” (Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Rosalind Russell and Jonathan Oatis)', 'The Edwards Sapien XT uses a balloon to expand the compressed valve once it is in position in the diseased valve, while the Medtronic CoreValve has a special self expanding valve using an alloy that reacts to body heat to open.\nNO DIFFERENCE IN DEATH OR STROKE RATESBut the definitions of effectiveness used as the primary goals for the German study may be viewed as limited in value.\nVirtually all doctors who perform heart valve replacements, typically in patients aged 80 and older, agree that the most important clinical results for these procedures are rates of death and stroke.\nEdwards expects U.S. approval of the next-generation Sapien XT with a similarly smaller catheter in the coming months.\nIndustry analysts expect the Sapien XT and CoreValve to be important future growth drivers for Edwards and Medtronic.']"

A new study, published online yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the risk of death among severe aortic-stenosis patients one year after treatment was lower in those who received a prosthetic valve inserted through a catheter than in those who had the valve replaced during surgery.\n\nFewer patients with diseased aortic valves might have to face open-heart surgery.\n\nA new study, published online yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the risk of death among severe aortic-stenosis patients one year after treatment was lower in those who received a prosthetic valve inserted through a catheter than in those who had the valve replaced during surgery.\n\nThe catheter is inserted through an incision in the groin and threaded through an artery to the aorta. A stent and the prosthetic valve open when the catheter is unsheathed.\n\n�This will be available for more patients to have a less-invasive option to replace the aortic valve,� said Dr. Steven Yakubov, a co-author of the study and system chief of structural heart disease at OhioHealth.\n\n�It will absolutely change the way patients are treated.�\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the device for extreme-risk patients � those who are too sick for open-heart surgery � in January. The study Yakubov helped to lead could pave the way for FDA approval for patients who are eligible for surgery but are at high risk of dying.\n\nFDA approval could come in the next six months, he said.\n\nEach year, aortic stenosis is diagnosed in about 100,000 people. It�s a narrowing of a valve that chokes off the heart�s ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. About one-third of patients are high-risk.\n\nPatients either must live with shortness of breath and chest pain or undergo surgery to correct the problem. Stenosis can lead to heart failure.\n\nA total of 795 people were enrolled in the study at 45 centers nationwide. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to surgical aortic-valve replacement or the catheter-valve procedure.\n\nAccording to the study, 14.2 percent of patients who received the valve through a catheter died after one year, compared with 19.1 percent of those who had surgery.\n\nComplications, including stroke and death, are inherent in both the transcatheter treatment and open-heart surgery, but the risk appears to be lower with the less-invasive treatment, Yakubov said.\n\nSurgery candidates tend to be older, and in many cases have other health problems, such as kidney or lung disease, that put them at high risk, said Dr. Daniel Simon, director of the Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. �This (new procedure) really meets an unmet need,� Simon said.\n\nThe catheter-inserted replacement valve is made of cow tissue and represents the second generation of transcatheter aortic-valve replacements. The original technology required a balloon to open the valve. The new replacement expands on its own.\n\nMedtronic CoreValue makes the valve and sponsored the study.\n\nSimon said trials are underway to use the treatment for intermediate-risk patients, and he expects it to be used in one-third to half of all aortic-valve replacements within five years.\n\nOlder patients who undergo open-heart surgery to receive a replacement valve typically are hospitalized for about a week and spend months recovering, he said. Patients who undergo the new procedure can be conscious, which reduces risks associated with anesthesia, and they can leave the hospital in about three days.\n\nrrouan@dispatch.com\n\n@RickRouan', 'Fewer patients with diseased aortic valves might have to face open-heart surgery.\nFewer patients with diseased aortic valves might have to face open-heart surgery.\nAccording to the study, 14.2 percent of patients who received the valve through a catheter died after one year, compared with 19.1 percent of those who had surgery.\nThe catheter-inserted replacement valve is made of cow tissue and represents the second generation of transcatheter aortic-valve replacements.\nOlder patients who undergo open-heart surgery to receive a replacement valve typically are hospitalized for about a week and spend months recovering, he said.']"

That is about six times the number of recalls it made in all of 2013. The trucks being recalled are the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 pickups, as well as the 2015 Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe and the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL with six-speed automatic transmissions. GM said a loose fitting for the transmission's oil cooler line could allow leaks. The cars being recalled are the 2013-14 Cruze models with 1.4-liter four-cylinder engines. GM said the right-front axle half-shaft could break, cutting power to the front wheels.\n\n3 Iowa fire: A massive fire swept through a more than century-old building that was being renovated in downtown Des Moines early Saturday, causing its upper floors to collapse and authorities to close down numerous streets.

The rankings were reported in the fifth annual County Health Rankings, from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.\n\nThe same five counties were also at the top, and in the same order, in the 2013 rankings. All are in the northern or north-central part of the state, and all are in the Atlanta metropolitan area except for Oconee, which is in the Athens metropolitan area.\n\nNumbers 6 through 10 in the 2014 county rankings are Cobb, Columbia, Morgan, Coweta and Rockdale.\n\nThe five counties in the poorest health, starting with least healthy, are Clay, Taliaferro, Warren, Stewart and Turner.\n\nClay, in southwest Georgia along the Alabama line, was also ranked last among Georgia\'s 159 counties in the 2013 rankings. Stewart County was also in the bottom five last year. The county lost its lone hospital last year because of financial trouble. It was one of four to close in Georgia in the past two years. Mainly because of these closings - and the threat of others shutting down - rural health care emerged as a major issue in the recently completed state General Assembly session.\n\nGov.

The listing reflects how counties are doing on 29 factors that influence health, including smoking, obesity, high school graduation rates, employment, physical inactivity, and access to healthy foods.\n\nColumbia County has fewer adults who smoke and a lower rate of obesity than the state average. The county\'s unemployment rate, and percentage of uninsured, are much lower than the average for Georgia.\n\nMarsha Davis, associate dean at the University of Georgia\'s College of Public Health, said Wednesday that suburban counties have greater access to health care, healthy food and physical activity opportunities than rural areas.\n\n""Throughout Georgia, chronic disease and health risk factors like smoking, physical inactivity and access to health care are significant public health issues,\'\' Davis said. ""Most striking is that health outcomes and factors affecting our health differ widely through the state.""\n\nTo close the gaps between counties, she added, the state\'s public health system needs to be strengthened.\n\nThe authors of the report said that nationally, this year\'s rankings show that people living in the least healthy counties are twice as likely to have shorter lives as people living in the healthiest counties.', 'ATLANTA -- Columbia County ranked in the top 10 healthiest counties in the state, according to a 2014 ranking released Wednesday.\nForsyth is ranked the healthiest county in Georgia in 2014, followed by Fayette, Oconee, Gwinnett, and Cherokee.\nThe rankings were reported in the fifth annual County Health Rankings, from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute.\nNumbers 6 through 10 in the 2014 county rankings are Cobb, Columbia, Morgan, Coweta and Rockdale.\nThe County Health Rankings rate the overall health of nearly every county in all 50 states.']"

The treatment, called Alprolix, has been considered as the first recombinant, DNA-derived therapy for the rare disorder.\n\n""The approval of this product provides another therapeutic option for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with Hemophilia B,"" said Dr. Karen Midthun, FDA\'s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research director.\n\nThe new Hemophilia treatment has been approved on March 28. Its approval is the first important development for the said disorder treatment in over 17 years. The FDA gave an orphan-drug designation for its use, for the reason that it\'s intended for the treatment of an uncommon condition or disease.\n\n""The FDA approval of ALPROLIX is a significant milestone for the hemophilia B community, and represents an important first step in our commitment to transform the care of people with hemophilia,"" said Dr. George A. Scangos, Biogen Idec.\'s chief executive officer.\n\nNational Hemophilia Foundation\'s chief executive officer Val Bias expressed the same sentiment on the said approval.\n\n""The hemophilia community is excited about new therapy options for the prophylactic management of hemophilia B. This approval is a significant step forward because it provides an important new option and expanded choice for the hemophilia B community,"" said Bias.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the treatment will help control and prevent episodes of bleeding, manage bleeding in surgical procedures as well as reduce or prevent frequency of bleeding episodes. Said therapy has a prolonged circulation in the patient\'s body.\n\n""The safety and efficacy of Alprolix were evaluated in a multi-center clinical trial that compared each of two prophylactic treatment regimens to on-demand treatment. A total of 123 individuals with severe Hemophilia B, ages 12-71, were followed for up to a year and a half. The studies demonstrated the effectiveness of Alprolix in the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes and during perioperative management of patients undergoing a surgical procedure. No safety concerns were identified in this trial,"" explains the FDA.\n\nHemophilia B mostly affects males. Its cause points to the defects in Factor IX gene. In the United States alone, the disorder affects around 3,300 people.

If it’s successful, it could give doctors the time they need to treat patients who have been traumatically injured.\n\nHow the suspended animation technique works is this: doctors will replace the blood with a cold saline solution that will quickly drop the body’s temperature and stop most of the cellular activity.\n\nUPMC Presbyterian Hospital surgeon Samuel Tisherman said they don’t like to call the procedure suspended animation because it sounds too much like science fiction.

The animals were first sedated and then had a massive hemorrhage induced to create the effect of several gunshot wounds. The blood was replaced with either a cold saline or potassium solution that dropped their temperature to 10 degrees Celsius.\n\nDoctors treated the injuries and gradually warmed the animals up by replacing the solution with their blood. The pig’s heart would start beating and, even though the pig was “dead” for several hours, they suffered no cognitive or physical impairment.\n\nPeter Rhee, a surgeon with Tucson’s University of Arizona, assisted in developing the technique and said the definition of dead was forever altered.\n\nHe said he works every day at a place he declares people dead.

Using a rapid cooling technique, doctors will essentially ""shut off"" the patient\'s body and then bring it ""back to life"" after surgery. The procedure has never been performed on humans.\n\n“If a patient comes to us two hours after dying you can’t bring them back to life.

The technique involves doctors draining a patient’s blood and replacing it with a cold saline solution, which allows for the patient’s body to drastically cool down by about 50 degrees.\n\n""We have patients coming in from bad trauma who have a cardiac arrest. The chances we can save them are less than 10 percent. The biggest problem is that this is a race against time. The idea is to rapidly cool them to basically stop the clock,"" Dr. Samuel A. Tisherman, the surgeon who will lead the first trial, told The Huffington Post over the phone Friday.\n\nBringing down a patient’s body temperature allows for the brain and other vital organs to be sustained longer. This gives doctors more time to operate. Once surgery is complete, doctors slowly warm the body and pump back in the patient’s blood, the release notes.\n\n""The thing is, we know what we have now currently doesn’t work very well. We have patients come into our trauma center all the time, and we say \'Oh, we were so close.\' If we have something that is going to buy us more time and control bleeding and save someone we normally can’t, [we should try it],"" Tisherman told HuffPost.\n\nNow, with government approval, doctors are finally set to begin the trial on humans. But as New Scientist notes, the hospital will have to wait for the right patients to come through the door.\n\n""The ideal patient is someone who has a gun or stab wound and just before they get to the emergency department they lose their pulse, and we do our normal thing and they don’t immediately come back.

We’ve already got 3D-printed artificial limbs, lab-grown organs, and brain implants that help paralyzed people walk again; and now a hospital in Pennsylvania is about to add suspended animation to the list.\n\nLater this month, surgeons at the UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburg will attempt to save potentially fatal gunshot wound victims by rapidly cooling their bodies and placing them in a state of suspended animation — although they don’t like to call it that. Surgeons prefer the term “emergency preservation and resuscitation,” but a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. If the procedure proves effective, it will buy doctors time to fix injuries that would otherwise be fatal.\n\nThe technique involves replacing all of a patient’s blood with a cold saline solution, which quickly cools the body and slows down cellular activity to a point where it basically stops. This effectively puts the person in a state between life and death. Technically speaking, the patient isn’t alive at this point, but after doctors have treated the wound, the patient’s body can gradually be warmed up and brought back to life as the saline solution is replaced with blood.\n\nThis technique doesn’t work if a person has already been dead for a couple hours, but if it’s administered before (or even shortly after) a person passes, it gives doctors a much better shot at saving them.\n\nOr at least, that’s the theory. The process hasn’t yet been used on humans, but suspended animation was successfully tested on pigs in back in 2002. Hasan Alam, working with his colleagues at the University of Michigan Hospital, drugged up a pig, and then created a massive hemorrhage inside it to simulate the effect of a gunshot wound. After the wound was created, they then replaced its blood with a cold saline solution and brought the pig’s cells down to just 10 Celsius (50F). After the injury was treated and the saline was replaced with blood, the pig’s heart started beating on its own, and despite the pig being dead for a few hours, there was no physical or cognitive impairment.\n\nNow, it’s time to try it out on humans. UPMC Presbyterian Hospital plans to use the technique on patients who have suffered traumatic injuries (gunshots, stabs, etc.), and don’t respond to normal methods of restarting their heart. Due to the fact that these kinds of wounds are almost always fatal, and there’s currently no other treatments for such injuries, surgeons don’t need consent to attempt suspended animation.\n\nAs these types of patients come in, the technique will be used on 10 patients, and the outcome will be compared against 10 people who didn’t receive such treatment. Samuel Tisherman, the surgeon who is leading the trial, told New Scientist that they’ll then refine their technique and try it out on 10 more patients — at which point, there should be enough data to work out whether suspended animation is worth rolling out to other hospitals.\n\nEditors' Recommendations"", 'We’ve already got 3D-printed artificial limbs, lab-grown organs, and brain implants that help paralyzed people walk again; and now a hospital in Pennsylvania is about to add suspended animation to the list.\nLater this month, surgeons at the UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburg will attempt to save potentially fatal gunshot wound victims by rapidly cooling their bodies and placing them in a state of suspended animation — although they don’t like to call it that.\nSurgeons prefer the term “emergency preservation and resuscitation,” but a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\nThe process hasn’t yet been used on humans, but suspended animation was successfully tested on pigs in back in 2002.\nDue to the fact that these kinds of wounds are almost always fatal, and there’s currently no other treatments for such injuries, surgeons don’t need consent to attempt suspended animation.']"

The process of putting people into a state of suspended animation involves pumping saline into the body to replace blood. (Shutterstock*)\n\nFirst Humans to Be Placed in Suspended Animation\n\nThis week, doctors will finalize details to move ahead with the first suspended animation procedures to be performed on human beings. People will be placed in a state between life and death as a way of giving doctors extra time to work on sudden, fatal injuries.\n\nAt the UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh, Penn., the next 10 patients to meet the criteria—for example, people with fatal gunshot wounds—will be placed in suspended animation for a few hours while doctors treat them. Such patients are received at the hospital about once a month, according to New Scientist, so the first test case could come in April.\n\nSurgeon Samuel Tisherman, who is leading the trial, told New Scientist: “We are suspending life, but we don’t like to call it suspended animation because it sounds like science fiction…. We call it emergency preservation and resuscitation.”\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n1. Cold saline is pumped into the brain and heart and will flow through the arteries to the whole body, replacing all the blood.\n\n2. The patient’s body will cool dramatically, reaching a temperature of 10 degrees Celsius in about 15 minutes.\n\n3. The patient will have no blood and will not be breathing, but his or her cells can still survive for hours.\n\n4. Doctors will have a couple of hours to work on the injury before pumping new blood into the body. In a 2002 trial on a pig, the pigs heart restarted on its own and the blood flow warmed the body. If the heart does not restart, the patient will be resuscitated.\n\nThe procedure will not freeze people for years as in science fiction movies—not yet, anyway.\n\nSurgeon Peter Rhee at the University of Arizona in Tucson helped develop the technique. He told New Scientist: “After we did those experiments, the definition of ‘dead’ changed. … Every day at work I declare people dead. They have no signs of life, no heartbeat, no brain activity. I sign a piece of paper knowing in my heart that they are not actually dead. I could, right then and there, suspend them. But I have to put them in a body bag. It’s frustrating to know there’s a solution.”\n\nIn a 2010 Ted Talk, cell biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Mark Roth talked about his hopes and work on suspended animation. His method uses small amounts of hydrogen sulfide. The hydrogen sulfide binds to where oxygen usually binds in the body, thus reducing the need for oxygen. He has successfully tested this method of suspended animation on mice.\n\nHe highlighted the use of suspended animation in nature. Plant seeds and bacterial spores can remain alive in a sort of stasis for as long as 250 years. Eggs in human ovaries exist in a state of suspended animation for some 50 years. Pets stores sell bags of sea monkeys. Dump them in a tank of water, and in a week or so little shrimp will be swimming around in the tank.\n\nRoth also gave examples of cases in which humans have accidentally been put into a state of suspended animation. A skier was once trapped in an icy waterfall. She had no heartbeat and could be considered dead, but she was revived and healthy. In Canada, a 13-month-old wandered outside in nothing but a diaper in the dead of winter. She was clinically dead when she was found, but was nonetheless revived.\n\nPeople can be revived a few hours after their heart has stopped without neurological damage in many cases, said Roth. He said: “You’re not dead until you’re warm and dead.”\n\n*Image of an IV bag via Shutterstock', 'The process of putting people into a state of suspended animation involves pumping saline into the body to replace blood.\n(Shutterstock*)First Humans to Be Placed in Suspended AnimationThis week, doctors will finalize details to move ahead with the first suspended animation procedures to be performed on human beings.\nHe has successfully tested this method of suspended animation on mice.\nEggs in human ovaries exist in a state of suspended animation for some 50 years.\nRoth also gave examples of cases in which humans have accidentally been put into a state of suspended animation.']"

Surgeons at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh will be testing a new technique to save patients’ lives by placing them in a state of suspended animation, hovering within the mists between life and death. Squirm-inducing details include draining all of a patient\'s blood and replacing it with a saline solution that stops nearly all cellular activity. This process, which could be equated to inducing hypothermia, would give surgeons enough time to operate on injuries that would otherwise be fatal.\n\n""We are suspending life, but we don\'t like to call it suspended animation because it sounds like science fiction,"" Dr. Samuel Tishman, the lead surgeon in the trial told New Scientist. ""So we call it emergency preservation and resuscitation.""\n\nPossibly the wildest thing about this new technique is that clinical trial testing has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which does not require approval from the patient or the family. Since eligible patients are not likely to survive their injuries anyway, the FDA figures it’s OK for doctors to make this unusual, last-ditch effort to save a life. Once you’ve been awakened from near-death with all your blood replaced, you’ll simply be grateful… right?\n\nAnimal Testing\n\nSuspended animation was first tested by Dr. Hasan Alam and colleagues at the University of Michigan Hospital in 2002. First, the scientists sedated a group of Yorkshire pigs weighing in at 100 to 125 lbs. Next, the researchers induced a massive hemorrhage as a way to mimic the effects of gunshot wounds. Quickly, they drained the swines’ blood and replaced it with, in the first run of animals, a cold potassium solution, and in a second run, a saline solution. With either solution, the body temperature of the wounded animals cooled swiftly. Next, the doctors treated the injuries and afterward, drained the solution and restored the animals’ blood. In the first run, seven of nine animals survived. In the second run, all but one. These revived animals, no matter which method had been used, “were neurologically intact, and their capacity to learn new skills was no different than for control animals,” the authors wrote in their published research.\n\nThe scientists explain that a cool body can be kept technically alive more easily than a warm one. When a body is cooled to this extreme level, less work is required of individual cells, which need less oxygen (anaerobic glycolysis) to perform their chemical reactions at lower temperatures. Having tested the technique on pigs, it’s time for trial runs of the emergency preservation and resuscitation method on humans. Yee-ha!\n\nFor the first 10 human experiments, UPMC Presbyterian surgeons will need to identify the right patients. The perfect profile, according to Tishman, would be someone who has gone into cardiac arrest after a gunshot or some similar injury — someone who isn’t responding to attempts to restart their heart. Then surgeons will pump the saline solution into their heart and brain, and eventually through the entire body. Once this has been accomplished, the surgeons will operate on the patient now considered clinically dead: no blood, no brain activity, and no breathing. Tishman explained that his team will have about two hours to fix a patient and replace the saline solution with blood. The heart should restart by itself... if not, a patient will receive a complementary jumpstart.\n\nThe surgeons will test their technique on an initial batch of 10 non-consenting patients, compare results, and then continue, making their way forward, 10 patients at a time, until they have accumulated enough data. ""Can we go longer than a few hours with no blood flow? I don\'t know."" Tisherman told the New Scientist.

If a patient arrives with a traumatic injury, and attempts to restart their heart have failed — if they’re on the doorstep of death — they will have their blood replaced with a cold saline solution, which stops almost all cellular activity. At this point, the patient is clinically dead — but if the doctors can fix the injury within a few hours, they can be returned to life from suspended animation by replacing the saline with blood.\n\nOr at least, that’s the theory. The technique of suspended animation (or “emergency preservation and resuscitation” as non-sci-fi doctors prefer to call it) was first trialed on pigs in 2002. Hasan Alam, working with his colleagues at the University of Michigan Hospital, drugged up a pig, created a massive hemorrhage to simulate the effect of a massive gunshot wound, and then replaced its blood with a cold saline solution, cooling the pig’s cells to just 10 Celsius (50F). After the injury was treated, the pig was gradually warmed back up by replacing the saline with blood. Usually the pig’s heart started beating on its own, and despite the pig being dead for a few hours, there was no physical or cognitive impairment. Now, it’s time to try it out on humans. [Research paper: dx.doi.org/10.1067/msy.2002.125787 – “Learning and memory is preserved after induced asanguineous hyperkalemic hypothermic arrest in a swine model of traumatic exsanguination”]\n\nRoughly once a month, UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh receives a patient who has suffered a cardiac arrest after some kind of traumatic injury (gunshot, stabbing, etc.), and hasn’t responded to normal methods of restarting their heart. Because there’s currently no other kind of treatment, and because these kinds of wounds are nearly always fatal, the surgeons don’t need consent to carry out the suspended animation. The technique will be used on 10 patients, with the outcome compared against 10 people who didn’t. Samuel Tisherman, the surgeon who is leading the trial, told New Scientist that they’ll then refine their technique and try it out on 10 more patients — at which point, there should be enough data to work out whether suspended animation is worth rolling out to other hospitals.\n\nThe process is much the same for humans as it was for pigs. The first step is to replace all of the blood in the heart and brain — the two areas most sensitive to hypoxia — with with cold saline. Then, the saline is pumped around the rest of the body. After 15 minutes, the patient’s temperature reaches 10C — they have no blood, no brain activity, and they’re not breathing. Technically they’re dead — but because the metabolism of your cells slow down at low temperatures, they can survive for a few hours using anaerobic respiration (usually it’s just a few minutes). “We’ve always assumed that you can’t bring back the dead. But it’s a matter of when you pickle the cells,” said Peter Rhee, who helped developed the suspended animation technique.\n\nFor now, this process is only being used for cardiac arrests following traumatic injuries, but in the future Tisherman says he hopes to use the technique for other conditions as well. The other big question, of course, is whether this technique can be used to suspend animation for more than just a couple of hours. If I have my blood replaced with saline, and then use cryonics to cool my body down yet further, could I be “dead” for a few months or weeks or years before being warmed up again? If sci-fi has taught us anything, it’s that suspended animation (or stasis as it’s sometimes called) is one of the most potentially exciting technologies — not only for rich people trying to extend their lives, but for the possibly centuries-long journeys that our first interstellar explorers will embark upon.', 'At a hospital in Pittsburgh, surgeons are now allowed to place patients into a state of suspended animation.\nAt this point, the patient is clinically dead — but if the doctors can fix the injury within a few hours, they can be returned to life from suspended animation by replacing the saline with blood.\nThe technique of suspended animation (or “emergency preservation and resuscitation” as non-sci-fi doctors prefer to call it) was first trialed on pigs in 2002.\nBecause there’s currently no other kind of treatment, and because these kinds of wounds are nearly always fatal, the surgeons don’t need consent to carry out the suspended animation.\nBut it’s a matter of when you pickle the cells,” said Peter Rhee, who helped developed the suspended animation technique.']"

When the nations of the world committed themselves to eradicating polio in 1988, it was a goal they intended to achieve by the year 2000. But the target date slipped repeatedly. The strategic plan approved last year aims to stop transmission of all naturally-occurring ‘wild’ polio viruses by the end of this year and complete the task of eradication by 2018. The first of those objectives appears to be in jeopardy. Polio cases worldwide during 2013 recorded an 82 per cent increase over the previous year. Although the polio-endemic countries of Afghanistan and Nigeria more than halved the number of polio cases last year, Pakistan registered a 60 per cent increase. “The current situation in Pakistan is a powder keg that could ignite widespread polio transmission,” warned the Independent Monitoring Board, a body established to evaluate global eradication efforts, in a letter sent in February 2014 to the WHO Director-General, Margaret Chan. Worse still, the virus has reappeared in countries that had been free of it. Viruses from Pakistan have surfaced in the Middle East, and those from Nigeria produced a resurgence of polio in the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe virus could well find its way to more countries, and the situation is serious. Dr. Chan has called a meeting next month of an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to advise on measures to reduce the risk of further international spread. One such step could be the compulsory vaccination of travellers from polio-infected areas. India recently made it mandatory that those coming from countries with polio produce a certificate of vaccination with an oral polio vaccine. As long as the virus circulates in any part of the world, all countries free of it need to be vigilant and stop it from getting a foothold in their territory. Despite the current unpromising outlook for global polio eradication, it would be unwise to give up in despair. As recently as in 2009, almost half the world's polio cases were occurring in this country. Yet, India had its last polio case just two years later, paving the way for the South-East Asia Region’s certification. As the Americas, Western Pacific and Europe have already received such certification, four out of five children in the world now live in countries that have eliminated polio. The global community must find the will and the means to end this scourge once and for all."", ""When the nations of the world committed themselves to eradicating polio in 1988, it was a goal they intended to achieve by the year 2000.\nPolio cases worldwide during 2013 recorded an 82 per cent increase over the previous year.\nDespite the current unpromising outlook for global polio eradication, it would be unwise to give up in despair.\nAs recently as in 2009, almost half the world's polio cases were occurring in this country.\nAs the Americas, Western Pacific and Europe have already received such certification, four out of five children in the world now live in countries that have eliminated polio.""]"

It found, after 7 years, that the likelihood of death was 18 percent among patients with mild heart failure and a common condition called left bundle branch block who received CRT-D therapy. Among patients with the same condition who received a defibrillator only, the likelihood of death was close to 30 percent. Left bundle branch block results in disorganized electrical activity throughout the heart.\n\nThe finding translates into a 40 percent reduction in the risk of long-term death among patients with left bundle branch block who received CRT-D therapy.\n\nArthur J. Moss, M.D.\n\nThe study is a follow-up to the MADIT-CRT trial, which showed that early intervention with CRT-D therapy in mild heart failure patients with left bundle branch block led to a significant reduction in heart failure events, such as being hospitalized with heart failure symptoms, over 2.5 years. Study authors believe that the decrease in heart failure events helped patients live longer during long-term follow-up.\n\n“With cardiac resynchronization therapy we have the ability to slow the progression of heart failure, reduce death and increase the life span of patients,” said Arthur J. Moss, M.D., professor of Cardiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. Moss has led the MADIT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial) series of studies since 1990.\n\nCRT-D therapy combines a defibrillator, which senses dangerous heart rhythms and shocks the heart back into a normal rhythm, with cardiac resynchronization therapy, which improves the mechanical pumping action of the heart. In mild heart failure patients with left bundle branch block, the heart muscles contract against one another, not in concert with one another, as they do in a normally functioning heart. Resynchronization therapy serves as a pacing system that organizes the contractions so the heart can pump blood throughout the body more effectively, reducing heart failure and its symptoms.\n\nValentina Kutyifa, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nIn addition to Moss, Valentina Kutyifa, M.D., Ph.D., research assistant professor of Cardiology, and Helmut Klein, M.D., adjunct professor of Cardiology from the University of Rochester, and Ilan Goldenberg, M.D., professor of Cardiology at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, Israel, are senior authors on the study.\n\nThe study included close to 1700 patients who survived the initial MADIT-CRT trial. Patients received CRT-D therapy or a defibrillator and were followed for approximately 5 years after the conclusion of the 2.5-year MADIT-CRT trial. Patients were evaluated during long-term follow-up and heart failure events and deaths were recorded.\n\nThe study included patients from the U.S., Canada, Israel and several countries in Europe, including Hungary, Germany, England, Ireland, Italy, Spain, France, Denmark and the Netherlands. Kutyifa, who received her appointment as research assistant professor from the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in December 2013, played a key role in securing the involvement of many European countries, which Moss says contributes to the strength of the study.\n\nIn 2010, based on the findings from the initial MADIT-CRT trial, the FDA extended the approval of CRT-D therapy to patients with mild heart failure and left bundle branch block. The device, developed by Boston Scientific, was originally approved to treat patients with severe heart failure. Study authors believe the new data on long-term survival will be added to national and international treatment guidelines in the coming years.\n\nThe long-term MADIT-CRT follow-up study was supported by unrestricted research grants from Boston Scientific, St. Paul, Minnesota, to the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and the Israeli Association for Cardiovascular Trials.\n\nMoss holds no stock in any device company and has never been a member of any corporate speakers’ bureau. Kutyifa has nothing to disclose.', 'Device Saves Lives in Heart Failure PatientsA new study shows for the first time that cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D therapy) saves the lives of mild heart failure patients over the long term.\nThe study is a follow-up to the MADIT-CRT trial, which showed that early intervention with CRT-D therapy in mild heart failure patients with left bundle branch block led to a significant reduction in heart failure events, such as being hospitalized with heart failure symptoms, over 2.5 years.\nStudy authors believe that the decrease in heart failure events helped patients live longer during long-term follow-up.\nIn mild heart failure patients with left bundle branch block, the heart muscles contract against one another, not in concert with one another, as they do in a normally functioning heart.\nThe device, developed by Boston Scientific, was originally approved to treat patients with severe heart failure.']"

The aortic valve is one of four heart valves in the human heart and can be seriously damaged by calcification. This is a potentially serious condition that affects the moving parts of the valve and makes it less efficient.\n\nIn the past, the primary treatment for severe aortic stenosis was open heart surgery where the valve was repaired or a valve made from tissue or artificial material would be used to replace the damaged aortic valve. Today, there is a new and less invasive option called Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) that may be an option for many patients who need to have their aortic valve replaced.\n\nWhat the Aortic Valve Does\n\nTo best understand aortic valve replacement, it is important to understand what the aortic valve does. The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta and helps control the flow of blood from the heart, into the aorta and to the rest of the body. A healthy aortic valve prevents blood from leaving the heart too soon, opening only when it is time for blood to move out of the left ventricle and into the aorta. When the aortic valve is damaged and becomes narrowed, the condition is called aortic stenosis and can be very serious, as the flow of blood is no longer well-controlled or efficient.\n\nSigns of Aortic Stenosis\n\nWhen the aortic valve becomes calcified, it no longer works properly, and the heart has to work harder to pump blood to the body. Some patients with aortic stenosis experience syncope, or episodes of fainting. They may also experience chest pain, and in severe cases, the valve problem can lead to the development of another severe condition, called congestive heart failure.\n\nFatigue and intolerance of exercise are some of the early symptoms of aortic stenosis, but in severe cases, patients can be so weak that they experience an inability to walk more than a few feet. The condition can become so severe that it is life-limiting or life-threatening if left untreated, leading to the need for repair or replacement of the valve.\n\nWho Is a Candidate for TAVR Surgery\n\nThe decision as to whether to replace the aortic valve using TAVR or open heart surgery can be a tricky one, and this recommendation is usually made jointly by a cardiologist and cardiac surgeon. Today, TAVR should be strongly considered, instead of open heart surgery, for people who need to have their aortic valve replaced due to aortic stenosis, unless they are under 65 years of age, or they have a bicuspid aortic valve, or their vascular anatomy would make TAVR infeasible. Otherwise, surgical aortic valve replacement generally should be done unless their surgical risk is considered prohibitively high.\n\nProcedure\n\nFor high-risk aortic stenosis patients, TAVR surgery may be an option that provides an aortic valve repair without the physical stress of open heart surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and general anesthesia. The procedure is performed percutaneously, meaning that the “surgery” is performed by inserting instruments into the femoral artery through a small incision and gently advancing through the blood vessels until the aortic valve is reached. Patients who have had a heart catheterization will find the minimally invasive valve replacement procedure to be similar.\n\nFor the TAVR procedure, the artificial valve is bundled into a tiny package that is small enough to be moved through the blood vessel along with the instruments. When in place, the valve replacement is deployed, opening to its full size. Once the TAVR is in place, it replaces the damaged natural aortic valve and controls the release of blood from the heart.\n\nRisks\n\nThe risks of TAVR surgery are serious and should be discussed with your physician before the procedure. The risks of TAVR are similar to the risks of open heart surgery to repair or replace an aortic valve, and include the risk of stroke, blood clots, bleeding, injury to the heart in addition to the risks of anesthesia.\n\nWhen comparing patients who had an open heart repair of aortic stenosis with patients who had the TAVR procedure, the TAVR patients have a greater risk of needing a pacemaker in the year following the procedure, but they also have a slightly lower risk of bleeding and death in the year following surgery.\n\nAfter the Procedure', 'In the past, the primary treatment for severe aortic stenosis was open heart surgery where the valve was repaired or a valve made from tissue or artificial material would be used to replace the damaged aortic valve.\nToday, there is a new and less invasive option called Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) that may be an option for many patients who need to have their aortic valve replaced.\nWhat the Aortic Valve DoesTo best understand aortic valve replacement, it is important to understand what the aortic valve does.\nOtherwise, surgical aortic valve replacement generally should be done unless their surgical risk is considered prohibitively high.\nProcedureFor high-risk aortic stenosis patients, TAVR surgery may be an option that provides an aortic valve repair without the physical stress of open heart surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and general anesthesia.']"

But they could provide the Edwards sales force with a valuable marketing tool as the two companies vie for market share with their competing transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, systems.\n\nBoth systems employ a catheter to thread the new valve through an artery into place in the heart, sparing patients too frail for open heart surgery from the invasive chest cracking procedure.

By those all-important measures, there was no significant difference between the two TAVR systems 30 days after the procedure.\n\n""Medtronic believes that physicians will look to more rigorous trials with hard clinical endpoints when evaluating these valves to provide reliable guidance on TAVR device selection,"" Medtronic said in a statement.\n\nMedtronic also took issue with the method used to assess aortic valve leakage in the independent German study, calling the angiography readings ""the least effective measure for determining aortic regurgitation.""\n\nThe researchers plan to follow the patients for five years to compare the longer-term health outcomes of the two groups, which is likely to yield more meaningful information.\n\n""It\'s possible some of these differences might not persist over time,"" said Dr. Saul Vizel, a cardiologist with Cambridge Memorial Hospital in Cambridge, Ontario, who was not involved in the study. ""The jury is still out for sure, because they\'re doing one-year and two-year follow-ups and people will wait for those.""\n\nDr. Patrick O\'Gara, incoming president of the American College of Cardiology from Brigham & Women\'s Hospital in Boston, also was not ready to declare a winner based on the German study.\n\n""I would like to see a larger trial with more endpoints,"" O\'Gara said. ""It would be premature to overinterpret these findings.""\n\nNot surprisingly, Edwards Lifesciences had a more favorable view of the findings than Medtronic.\n\n""This independent, multi-center randomized study is consistent with the experience in Europe, where more clinicians choose Sapien XT over CoreValve for the treatment of their patients,"" Edwards spokeswoman Sarah Huoh said in an emailed statement. ""These data are reflective of the findings of multiple, real-world European registries.""\n\nTAVR procedures have been performed in Europe since 2007 but are relatively new in the United States. The first Sapien system gained U.S. approval in 2011, and Medtronic\'s CoreValve was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January.\n\nThe CoreValve uses a smaller, potentially easier-to-maneuver, catheter than the original Sapien. Edwards expects U.S. approval of the next-generation Sapien XT with a similarly smaller catheter in the coming months.\n\nMore than 100,000 people in the United States have severe aortic stenosis, with about one-third too ill or frail for open-heart surgery, making them potential TAVR candidates.\n\nIndustry analysts expect the Sapien XT and CoreValve to be important future growth drivers for Edwards and Medtronic.\n\n""We now have new valves coming out that will probably be even better,"" Abdel-Wahab said.

The valve is guided to the heart by a catheter, a minimally invasive procedure, and patients typically go home after only one night in the hospital.\n\nIn the study of patients who had been implanted with the valve there was no narrowing of the valve, or stenosis, after six months in some 96.7 percent of the 90 patients for whom data was available.\n\nAfter a year, there was no narrowing, significant leakage or need for additional intervention in 94 percent of patients, researchers said on Sunday.\n\n“The valves had excellent function during the first year, judged by no more than mild leakage and very few patients had narrowing of the valve,” said Dr. Aimee Armstrong of the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories, who was lead investigator for the follow-up study sponsored by Medtronic.\n\nThe mean age of patients in the trial was 20, with ages ranging from 5 to 45. The valve is made from a cow’s jugular vein that is sewn into a metal stent, and then inserted into the patient’s leg and advanced to the heart.\n\nWithin the first year of the study, eight adverse events were seen, including three cases of heart infections, two abnormal heart rhythms and one case each of bacterial infection, major stent fracture and blood clot in the lung.\n\nPatients will continue to be followed for five years.\n\nResults of the multi-center study were released at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Washington.\n\nCongenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect in the United States, affecting an estimated one million adults and 800,000 children. Many patients are born with no pulmonary valve, which carries blood from the heart’s right ventricle to the lungs, or only a very small pulmonary valve.\n\nSome patients receive a connecting tube, or conduit, early in life, to provide blood flow. The conduits, typically made from cadaver pulmonary valves, from pig valves or bioprosthetic materials, are implanted during open heart surgery and essentially bypass the missing or inadequate pulmonary valve.\n\nBut the conduits over time can become leaky and narrowed, putting stress on the right ventricle and preventing it from squeezing properly. As a result, patients can develop abnormal life-threatening heart rhythms and symptoms such as inability to exercise.\n\nAt that point, patients have traditionally required open heart surgery to replace the pulmonary valve. But such surgery, which requires cutting open the rib cage to get direct access to the heart, causes scar tissue that makes future surgery much more difficult.\n\nMedtronic’s Melody valve is meant to provide additional blood flow when conduits become faulty, and thereby delay the need for more open heart surgery.\n\n“Every time you do open heart surgery, more scar tissue develops, with more potential damage to the heart,” said lead investigator Armstrong.\n\nShe said it was too early to determine just how long the Melody valve would last, or how long it would delay the need for more open heart surgery. But she said patients in other trials have had the Medtronic valve for 5 to 7 years, with no need for surgery.\n\nTo date, over 6,000 patients have received the Melody valves, with more than half of them having congenital heart defects.

Armstrong, MD, study investigator and associate professor of pediatrics at University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital Congenital Heart Center, Ann Arbor, told Cardiology Today’s Intervention. “It confirms the initial investigational device exemption [IDE] trial that was done more than 5 years ago.”\n\nIn the nonrandomized, prospective, 10-center, post-approval study, Armstrong and colleagues aimed to confirm that the short-term hemodynamic efficacy of the Melody TPV implanted by real-world providers is equivalent to the control established in the five-center IDE trial.\n\nAimee K. Armstrong\n\n\n\nThe researchers enrolled 120 patients and implanted the valve in 100 patients, with one excluded for surgical removal in the first 24 hours due to coronary compression. Patients had a stenotic and/or regurgitant right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit of at least 16 mm at implantation. There was no age or weight limit. According to Armstrong, the mean age was 19.9 years, with the age of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization ranging from 5 to 45 years.\n\nFollow-up was 22 ± 18.9 months.\n\nArmstrong and colleagues reported a procedural success rate — defined as a peak cath gradient <35 mm Hg and no greater than mild regurgitation — of 98%.\n\nAt 6 months, researchers observed acceptable hemodynamic function in 96.7% of patients with evaluable data (lower confidence bound [LCB], 91.6%; P<.01) and 87.9% of the implanted cohort (LCB, 81.1%; P<.01), both above the performance goal of 75%. Results were maintained through 1 year (evaluable data patients, 94.3%; implanted cohort, 82.8%).\n\nRight ventricular outflow tract mean gradient was reduced by more than half at 1 year (n=85) vs. baseline (n=97; 15.1 ± 7.1 mm Hg vs. 33.3 ± 14.1 mm Hg). Also at 1 year, 87.7% of patients had no or trace pulmonary regurgitation compared with 8.1% at baseline.\n\nAdditional 1-year data revealed 100% of patients were free from catheter reintervention, 98% were free from reoperation and 96.9% were free from TPV dysfunction.\n\nArmstrong attributed the higher rate of freedom from TPV dysfunction in the post-approval study vs. the IDE study (96.9% vs. 93.5%) to a particular technique used by the operators.\n\n“What we found was that if we pre-stent with another type of stent prior to putting in the Melody valve, we decreased the risk for fracture,” she said. “We did more pre-stenting in this post-approval study than in the IDE trial, and I think that is what led to the difference [in valve dysfunction].”\n\nThe Melody TPV received FDA approval with a humanitarian device exemption in 2010.\n\nThe valve is intended to delay time until surgery is needed and reduce the number of open-heart surgeries over a patient’s lifetime.

Different from surgery, transcatheter placement (via the patient\'s groin) of aortic valve prostheses requires either a self-expandable or balloon-expandable system. A direct comparison of these 2 systems has not been previously performed, according to background information in the article.\n\nMohamed Abdel-Wahab, M.D., of the Segeberger Kliniken, Bad Segeberg, Germany, and colleagues with the CHOICE trial, randomly assigned patients with aortic stenosis (narrowing) who met other criteria to receive either a balloon-expandable valve (n = 121) or self-expandable valve (n = 120). Device success was defined by several measures, including successful vascular access and deployment of the device and retrieval of the delivery system, correct position of the device, and performance of the heart valve without moderate or severe regurgitation (backflow of blood through the valve).\n\nThe researchers found that device success occurred in 116 of 121 patients (95.9 percent) in the balloon-expandable group and 93 of 120 patients (77.5 percent) of patients in the self-expandable group. This difference was attributed to a lower frequency of more-than-mild aortic regurgitation (4.1 percent vs 18.3 percent) and the less frequent need for implanting more than 1 valve (0.8 percent vs 5.8 percent) in the balloon-expandable valve group.\n\nBleeding and vascular complications were not significantly different between groups. Cardiovascular mortality at 30 days was 4.1 percent in the balloon-expandable valve group and 4.3 percent in the self-expandable valve group. Need for placement of a new permanent pacemaker was less frequent in the balloon-expandable valve group.\n\n""With an accumulating body of evidence linking more-than-mild aortic regurgitation and consequently device failure with a worse clinical outcome after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the findings of the CHOICE trial may have important clinical implications. Notably, at short-term follow-up, improvement of heart failure symptoms was more frequently observed with the balloon-expandable valve, whereas minor stroke rates were numerically higher. Nevertheless, long-term follow-up of the CHOICE population should be awaited to determine whether the observed differences in device success will translate into a clinically relevant overall benefit for the balloon-expandable valve,"" the authors write.\n\nFurther investigation is needed to determine which valve examined in this study will provide better long-term survival rate and better quality of life, write E. Murat Tuzcu, M.D., and Samir R. Kapadia, M.D., of the Cleveland Clinic, in an accompanying editorial.\n\n""Continued efforts at understanding the risks and benefits of TAVR particularly in relation to patient characteristics, and long term outcomes are imperative for continued progress and refinement of these revolutionary devices. Additional rigorous randomized trials, like the CHOICE trial, will provide the quality of evidence necessary to ensure optimal use and optimal patient outcomes from TAVR.""\n\nExplore further Repeat sternotomy for aortic valve replacement safe option for octogenarian patients', 'Among patients undergoing aortic valve replacement using a catheter tube, a comparison of two types of heart valve technologies, balloon-expandable or self-expandable valve systems, found a greater rate of device success with the balloon-expandable valve, according to a JAMA study released online to coincide with presentation at the 2014 American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions.\nTranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a new option for patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve and as an effective alternative treatment method to surgical aortic valve replacement in selected high-risk patients.\nCardiovascular mortality at 30 days was 4.1 percent in the balloon-expandable valve group and 4.3 percent in the self-expandable valve group.\nNeed for placement of a new permanent pacemaker was less frequent in the balloon-expandable valve group.\nNotably, at short-term follow-up, improvement of heart failure symptoms was more frequently observed with the balloon-expandable valve, whereas minor stroke rates were numerically higher.']"

We\'d rather prevent them than treat them, and to cut into that number would be something. – Dr. Jeffrey Anderson\n\nMURRAY — Most treatments for heart attacks are reactive, opening blocked arteries and prescribing medication, and, then, hoping it doesn\'t happen again.\n\nBut researchers at Intermountain Medical Center may have identified a biological process that could help doctors predict when a heart attack is imminent, helping to prevent the potentially deadly episode.\n\nThe new study requires validation with a larger sample study, but lead researcher Oxana Galenko said the findings are ""significant.""\n\n""All of us have friends and relatives who didn\'t have any warning signals prior to having a heart attack, nothing to indicate that it would happen,"" she said. ""That shouldn\'t have to happen.""\n\nA new discovery involving tiny genetic fragments — pieces of the body\'s messengers, ribonucleic acid — reveal that something happens in the blood chain about two to six weeks prior to a heart attack.\n\n""There are changes in the levels of the blood,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Anderson, director of cardiovascular research at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute.\n\nDuring a heart attack, one of the coronary arteries that feeds blood into the heart becomes completely blocked, preventing necessary oxygen and nourishment from reaching the heart muscle. When this happens, the heart muscle dies and never recovers, resulting in heart failure or death.\n\nResearchers discovered that when the genetic information of DNA is communicated to the rest of the body using messenger ribonucleic acid, there is a noticeable decline in the levels of two markers — microRNA 122 and 126.\n\nGalenko said the discovery was made possible by examining and comparing samples from 30 people who coincidentally had their blood drawn two to six weeks prior to being admitted for a heart attack.\n\nThe blood samples are part of the Intermountain Heart Study Registry, a blood bank that is one of the largest of its kind, Anderson said. The bank contains 30,000 DNA samples that can be drawn upon for research.\n\nResearchers are now reaching out to health care networks across the country to get access to similar samples, and they hope there are enough patients who got tested before having a heart attack, which would help to validate their study.\n\n""It\'s not normal to see patients every two weeks to draw blood samples,"" Anderson said, adding that the Utah discovery may help to develop a system similar to the finger-stick blood-sugar test for diabetes that can be done at home and indicate whether a trip to the doctor or further medical action is necessary.\n\nDoctors, he said, can communicate a ballpark idea of a person\'s risk for heart attack, using cholesterol and blood pressure levels, as well as a person\'s age and overall health. But there\'s no test available to predict imminent heart attacks.\n\n""There are 1 million to 1.5 million heart attacks every year,"" Anderson said. ""We\'d rather prevent them than treat them, and to cut into that number would be something.""\n\nResearchers presented the results of the study at the 2014 American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in Washington, D.C. on Sunday.\n\nThe discovery of the genetic marker joins a handful of others identified by Intermountain researchers in the past couple years, including blood markers that could predict mortality, life expectancy, depression and heart disease in some patients.\n\nGalenko said the discovery opens doors for researchers, helping them understand what might cause heart attack events.\n\n""It\'s still so new,"" she said.

Inflammation is often associated with injury (i.e., sprained ankle), infection (i.e., strep throat), and auto-immune diseases (i.e., rheumatoid arthritis). However, it has been shown that inflammation is also a risk factor for heart disease.\n\n“There are at least two benefits evident from this study,” said J. Brent Muhlestein, MD, lead researcher and co-director of cardiovascular research at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute. ”First, a new marker of heart attack or stroke may help us to more effectively identify which patients are at risk. Second, now that we know GlycA and GlycB are important predictors of heart disease, we’ll seek to understand more about the physiology of these proteins – what causes them to increase and how we can we treat elevated levels.”\n\nLevels of GlycA and GlycB were determined from a blood test called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which was developed to determine the number of lipid particles contained in different cholesterol parameters.\n\nTesting for GlycA and GlycB by NMR spectroscopy uses signals that arise from the binding of glucose molecules to a variety of circulating inflammatory proteins, especially fibrinogen, α1-antichymotrypsin, haptoglobin-1, α1-antitrypsin, complement C3 and α1-acid glycoprotein.\n\nLike C-reactive protein, one of the most well-known and studied inflammatory markers shown to be associated with cardiovascular disease, GlycA and GlycB are acute phase proteins with plasma concentrations that increase or decrease in response to changes in the levels of inflammation throughout the body.\n\nThis is one of the first studies ever to evaluate the association of GlycA and GlycB to cardiovascular disease. In this study, almost 3,000 patients who underwent heart catheterization to determine the presence of coronary artery disease with a minimum of five years of follow-up were evaluated.\n\nOf the 48 percent of heart patients who died, suffered a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure during follow-up, the majority had significantly higher baseline levels of GlycA and GlycB. Specifically, those with levels in the top 25 percent were more than 30 percent more likely to have an adverse cardiovascular event compared to those with levels in the lowest 25 percent, even after other risk factors were taken into account.\n\n“The next step will be to determine how GycA and GlycB correlate with, or are independent of, other common inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein,” said Dr. Muhlestein.\n\nOther members of the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute research team include: Jeffrey L. Anderson, MD, and Heidi T. May, PhD, MSPH.', 'These newly identified markers of inflammation, GlycA and GlycB, have the potential to contribute to better understanding of the inflammatory origins of heart disease and may be used in the future to identify a heart patient’s future risk of suffering a heart attack, stroke, or even death.\nHowever, it has been shown that inflammation is also a risk factor for heart disease.\n”First, a new marker of heart attack or stroke may help us to more effectively identify which patients are at risk.\nThis is one of the first studies ever to evaluate the association of GlycA and GlycB to cardiovascular disease.\nOf the 48 percent of heart patients who died, suffered a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure during follow-up, the majority had significantly higher baseline levels of GlycA and GlycB.']"

Now six of his relatives and two others exposed to him are being kept in isolation at a hospital.\n\nHealth officials warn that the arrival of Ebola in this sprawling city of some 2 million people with an international airport could spell disaster. Among the poorest countries in the world, Guinea has severely limited medical facilities and a large population living in slums where the virus could spread quickly.\n\n“Poor living conditions and lack of water and sanitation in most parts of Conakry poses a serious risk of this epidemic spiraling into a crisis,” said Ibrahima Toure, country director for the aid group Plan International.\n\nPanic already has grown among residents since the government announced the Conakry cases late Thursday on national TV. While most days up to 300 patients seek treatment at Donka Hospital, less than 100 came on Friday as news spread that the Ebola patients were being quarantined there.\n\n“My daughter is sick and coughing but I prefer to keep her at home. I wouldn’t set foot inside Donka Hospital for anything in the world right now,” said Djalikatou Balde, a teacher.\n\nInternational aid groups like Doctors Without Borders and Plan International are trying to educate Guineans about how the disease is spread, and working to identify and isolate anyone who may have been exposed. There is no cure for the disease and the virus strain in Guinea has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent. Some 111 people have fallen ill already and authorities in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone are also investigating suspected cases.\n\n“Above all, we must avoid widespread panic,” said Marie-Christine Ferir, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. “That is why it is so important to spread correct information so people understand the disease and how to protect themselves.”\n\nMedical teams have been traveling on foot to villages where cases have been reported. The number of people possibly contaminated expanded exponentially when the Conakry patient traveled some 300 miles (430 kilometers) across the country in search of help.\n\nThe Ebola virus causes severe hemorrhagic fever in patients, in some cases leading to grisly deaths as patients bleed both internally and externally. Its initial symptoms — high fever, headache and weakness — can mimic malaria.\n\nJoseph Gbaka Sandouno, a program unit manager with Plan International in the village of Gueckedou, said it’s been especially difficult for people to stay calm after having witnessed “frightening scenes where people have died with severe bleeding.”\n\n“People are getting desperate as every other day somebody is dying,” he said, noting that 51 of the deaths had taken place there. “People are saying only God can save us now.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal contributed to this report.', 'CONAKRY, Guinea – Ebola, one of the world’s most deadly viruses, has spread from a remote forested corner of southern Guinea to the country’s seaside capital, raising fears that the disease, which causes severe bleeding and almost always death, could spread far beyond this tiny West African nation’s borders.\nAmong the poorest countries in the world, Guinea has severely limited medical facilities and a large population living in slums where the virus could spread quickly.\nWhile most days up to 300 patients seek treatment at Donka Hospital, less than 100 came on Friday as news spread that the Ebola patients were being quarantined there.\nThere is no cure for the disease and the virus strain in Guinea has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent.\nThe Ebola virus causes severe hemorrhagic fever in patients, in some cases leading to grisly deaths as patients bleed both internally and externally.']"
70041,http://www.theherald.com.au/story/2185656/ian-kirkwood-unearthing-pots-value/\?cs=308,health,"['IN this space back in January, I wondered how the US state of Colorado would go with its experiment in legalising cannabis. As ABC TV’s The World This Week reported yesterday, pot might be legal at a state level but it remains illegal under federal statutes. It’s only because President Barack Obama has pledged not to enforce federal law that the Colorado shops can ply their trade. And what a trade it is. Business is booming, to the point where the Colorado government expects to receive $US50million ($54million) or more this year in taxes, and governments around the world are reportedly taking notice. The Colorado experiment grew out of that state’s early acceptance of shops that sold marijuana on “medical” grounds, something that the US Drug Enforcement Agency is unsurprisingly unhappy with, calling it “reckless and irresponsible”. The American Medical Association is expressing similar sentiment and recently voted to retain its long-standing position that “cannabis is a dangerous drug and as such, is a public health concern”. Interestingly, that same medical association recognises that marijuana does have some medicinal value, voting in 2009 to overturn a 72-year-old policy that stated otherwise. So what is its medicinal value then? As the medical association said back in 2009, trials showed it could reduce pain and increase appetite. Its use in minimising nausea associated with chemotherapy has been widely noted. But much bigger claims are being made nowadays for medical marijuana, not the least of which is that the complex array of cannabinoid chemicals produced by the plant have potentially far-reaching impacts as anti-cancer agents. I have to say when I was told about this recently, it came as something of a surprise. I was well acquainted with the claims of marijuana as an adjunct to cancer treatment. But I knew nothing about marijuana as a “cancer cure” and remain extremely wary of such claims, especially given the history of bogus cancer treatments and the sheer and understandable desperation of those seeking a “miracle cure” for themselves or someone close. But after looking at a series of scientific papers and experiments involving cannabinoid treatment of various tumours, it looks to me like something worthy of greater attention. In very, very simplified terms, the “cannabis against cancer” argument runs like this. Marijuana contains more than 100cannabinoids, the main two being tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and cannabidiol or CBD. The psychoactive side of marijuana – its ability to get people “stoned” – is triggered by heating. Eat the plant cold, according to its adherents, and you get the medical effects without the psychotropic side-effects. The anti-cancer effect is believed to come mostly through CBD, which has been shown in trials to slow or stop the growth of various cancers by encouraging a process known as programmed cell death or “apoptosis” in the relevant tumours. Interestingly, the human body has cannabinoid receptors, and recent scientific studies have shown that endocannabinoids – internally generated cannabinoids in other words – are present in breast milk. For pot-loving hippies, this is all the proof they need to declare marijuana as a wonder plant with the ability to rid the world of many of its ills. Separating the social and cultural sides of marijuana from its potential medical uses is probably one of the biggest problems its supporters will face in their drive to have their claims taken seriously. I have to say that the parcel of articles and scientific papers, and patient testimonies I have been sent by believers in the cause raise a number of questions worth investigating. Despite the countless millions of dollars that have been thrown at cancer research in recent decades, overall death rates are said to be largely unchanged, although clearly we have made big progress in the manageability of various cancers. If a plant with marijuana’s properties were discovered tomorrow, it would be hailed as a miracle plant and a global effort would begin to unlock its secrets. So why isn’t more being done to investigate? Or am I being led up the garden path? Feedback is welcomed.\n\nhttps://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/storypad-3ZMaZUzN3dKuM6vrzTJmtN/f7970fbd-d2f3-45ee-8b74-4736fcbce8e7.jpg/r3_1_1198_676_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg', 'IN this space back in January, I wondered how the US state of Colorado would go with its experiment in legalising cannabis.\nIt’s only because President Barack Obama has pledged not to enforce federal law that the Colorado shops can ply their trade.\nInterestingly, that same medical association recognises that marijuana does have some medicinal value, voting in 2009 to overturn a 72-year-old policy that stated otherwise.\nI was well acquainted with the claims of marijuana as an adjunct to cancer treatment.\nEat the plant cold, according to its adherents, and you get the medical effects without the psychotropic side-effects.']"

According to an article by USA Today, the head of the Colorado Health Department, Dr. Larry W0lk, announced Friday that his agency would be conducting investigations into caregivers that grow above their limit to make sure that they can provide physician justification for \'medical necessity\' waivers.\n\nThe good news is they are not planning on shutting them down altogether. Instead, if they can\'t provide the justifications, they will have to apply to become commercial growers. Unlike a commercial grower, a caregiver doesn\'t have to pay licensing fees, or undergo criminal background checks, or pay taxes on their operation since they are supposed to not be making any profits - only receiving reimbursements for their expenses.\n\nAt least one caregiver is not happy.

I\'m curious to see how this plays out.

Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center, has eight topics that need to be considered.\n\nHere are eight issues to research and discuss before beginning to debate full legalization of marijuana, courtesy of Beau Kilmer, co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center and a co-author of “Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know.”\n\n\n\nKilmer calls his recommendations the Eight Ps.\n\n\n\nProduction: Where and how will the marijuana be grown? On existing farms? Specialty farms? Indoors? Just who grows it and how is that determined?\n\nProfit: How will it be sold? Like alcohol and tobacco, by big companies with high-powered lobbyists? By small independent growers and shops? By the state? Promotion: How will the marketing of marijuana be regulated? If the regulations are too strict, they might face free speech challenges. If they’re too loose, your child may wonder what’s wrong with smoking – or eating – marijuana. Prevention: People say legalize it, tax it and pay for prevention. “But it seems like people want to have that all at once,” says Kilmer. Communities must develop strategies for education and prevention well before they legalize marijuana. Potency: Some THC (the active ingredient in marijuana) can get you high and make you paranoid. Much of the pot sold in Colorado is pretty strong, with a THC percentage of about 10 to 20 percent, compared to 3 percent in the 1970s. Should the THC be limited, as is being discussed in the Netherlands? Another chemical in marijuana – cannabidiol, or CBD – may offset some of the effects of the THC. Should we put a limit on the ratio of THC to CBD? Purity: In addition to potency, marijuana should be tested for mold and pesticides, says Kilmer. Will products like hash oil – legal in Colorado – be allowed in E-cigarettes, tobacco products or alcohol? Price: How will the price be set? If it’s too low, more people will use marijuana –including people from neighboring states. If it’s too high, because of high taxes, there may be a black market. Permanence: When a state develops regulations, it must build flexibility into them so the laws can be changed, says Kilmer. This is particularly important if lobbyists play a role in creating laws that benefit the industry – laws those lobbyists will fight to keep in place. -- Steve Israel, Middletown (N.Y.)

A study of more than 3.5 million Americans finds that married people are less likely than singles, divorced or widowed folks to suffer any type of heart or blood vessel problem.\n\nThis was true at any age, for women as well as for men, and regardless of other heart disease risk factors they had such as high cholesterol or diabetes, researchers found.\n\n“It might be that if someone is married, they have a spouse who encourages them to take better care of themselves,” said Dr. Jeffrey Berger, a preventive cardiologist at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York.\n\nBut “we can’t prove by any means cause and effect,” he said.\n\nThis is the largest look at marriage and heart health, said Dr. Carlos Alviar, a cardiology fellow who led the study with Berger. Previous studies mostly compared married to single people and lacked information on divorced and widowed ones. Or they just looked at heart attacks, whereas this one included a full range from clogged arteries and abdominal aneurysms to stroke risks and circulation problems in the legs.\n\nResearchers used health questionnaires that people filled out when they sought various types of tests in community settings around the country from an Ohio company, Life Line Screening Inc. Some of these screening tests, for various types of cancer and other diseases or conditions, are not recommended by leading medical groups, but people can still get them and pay for them themselves.\n\nThe study authors have no financial ties to the company and are not endorsing this type of screening, Berger said. Life Line gave its data to the Society of Vascular Surgery and New York University to help promote research.\n\nThe results are from people who sought screening from 2003 through 2008. Their average age was 64, nearly two-thirds were female and 80 percent were white. They gave information on smoking, diabetes, family history, obesity, exercise and other factors, and researchers had blood pressure and other health measures.\n\nThe study found:\n\n—Married people had a 5 percent lower risk of any cardiovascular disease compared to single people. Widowed people had a 3 percent greater risk of it and divorced people, a 5 percent greater risk, compared to married folks.\n\n—Marriage seemed to do the most good for those under age 50; they had a 12 percent lower risk of heart-related disease than single people their age.\n\n—Smoking, a major heart risk, was highest among divorced people and lowest in widowed ones. Obesity was most common in those single and divorced. Widowed people had the highest rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and inadequate exercise.\n\nResearchers don’t know how long any study participants were married or how recently they were divorced or became widowed. But the results drive home the message that a person’s heart risks can’t be judged by physical measures alone — social factors and stress also matter, said Dr. Vera Bittner, a cardiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nShe heads the heart disease prevention committee of the American College of Cardiology. The study results were released on Friday ahead of presentation this weekend at the group’s annual meeting in Washington.\n\n“We don’t really have a clear explanation” for why marriage may be protective, Bittner said.\n\n“You may be more willing to follow up with medical appointments,” take recommended drugs, diet and exercise if you have a spouse, she said.\n\n© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Marriages are good for your physical as well as your mental health. And now, a study has also established scientific evidences into it.\n\nA new study has found that married couples are less likely to develop heart diseases than those who are single, divorced and widowed.\n\nThe researchers carried study on 3.5 million adults in America and found heart diseases were less likely to develop in them.\n\nThe researchers at New York University’s Langone Medical Center says, married people have a significantly decreased risk of developing heart problems than their widowed, single or divorced counterparts.\n\nStudy author Dr. Carlos Alviar, an NYU Langone cardiology fellow, said that this first of its kind study provides the most comprehensive look at the relation between relationship status and cardiovascular disease.\n\n“Most of the studies done earlier compared married to unmarried without making a distinction between types of marital statuses and mostly focused on one type of cardiovascular disease. We had information that could compile all of this in a comprehensive way,” Alviar said while highlighting the good aspects of the study.\n\nFor their study, the researchers analyzed rates of four types of cardiovascular disease in people in the age group 21 and 99.\n\nThe four types of cardiovascular disease include:\n\nCoronary Artery Disease: This is the most common form of heart disease and occurs when arteries leading to the heart become clogged, often causing a heart attack.\n\nCerebrovascular Disease: This affects circulation of blood flow to the brain.\n\nAbdominal Aortic Aneurysms: This is a form of aneurysm occurring below the chest usually due to hardened arteries.\n\nPeripheral Artery Disease:, This is a condition in which fatty plaque buildup decreases the flow of blood from the heart to the legs.\n\nDuring the study, the researchers found that marriage can have a protective effect for heart health. The findings of the study say, married people had a 5 percent decreased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to unmarried people.\n\nPeople who were divorced or widowed was associated with a greater likelihood of vascular disease compared with being single or married. Divorce was linked with a higher risk of any vascular disease.\n\nFor people age 50 and younger, marriage is associated with 12 percent lower odds of any vascular disease, but this dropped to 7 percent for those ages 51 to 60 and only 4 percent for those age 61 and older.\n\nExplaining the link between heart woes and marriages, Alviar said, “People who have a spouse might be more compliant with medical appointments, screening processes, more compliant with medications and a healthy lifestyle as opposed to people who are by themselves. And being alone also produces not only psychological stress but physical stress, and that might be a risk factor. Studies show married people have lower levels of inflammation in the blood vessels and inflammation can lead to blockages.”\n\nThe findings are scheduled to be presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 63rd Annual Scientific Session in Washington.', 'A new study has found that married couples are less likely to develop heart diseases than those who are single, divorced and widowed.\nThe researchers carried study on 3.5 million adults in America and found heart diseases were less likely to develop in them.\nFor their study, the researchers analyzed rates of four types of cardiovascular disease in people in the age group 21 and 99.\nThe four types of cardiovascular disease include:Coronary Artery Disease: This is the most common form of heart disease and occurs when arteries leading to the heart become clogged, often causing a heart attack.\nThe findings of the study say, married people had a 5 percent decreased risk of cardiovascular disease compared to unmarried people.']"

The team found that marriage cuts cardiovascular disease risk and it was consistently low for married people regardless of their gender, age and other health complications.\n\nIn other words, marriage might be an independent factor associated with heart health.\n\nThe study findings are hardly new. Previous research has shown that married people have better chances of surviving a heart attack and having a long, healthy life than their single peers. Being married also increases chances of surviving cancer and lowers risk of early death in men diagnosed with HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe strength of this study is that it is based on data from millions of people living in different parts of the U.S. Researchers found that being married was linked with a 5 percent reduced risk of cardiovascular disease than being single. Also, younger couples (those under the age 50 years) had a 12 percent lower risk of heart problems when compared with their single/divorced peers. The difference in cardiovascular risk narrowed with age; with older couples having a seven percent lower chance of suffering from heart problems.\n\n""Our survey results clearly show that when it comes to cardiovascular disease, marital status does indeed matter,"" said senior study investigator and NYU Langone cardiologist Jeffrey Berger, MD.\n\nBerger said that the study results suggest that doctors might need to pay attention to the health of single, divorced people.\n\n""If one of my patients is recently widowed or divorced, I\'m increasingly vigilant about examining that patient for signs of any type of cardiovascular disease and depression,"" he added.\n\nWhy Marriage cuts Heart Disease Risk?\n\nAccording to Berger, marriage might provide a physical and emotional support system during illness and stress.\n\nOther research has shown that men who are married are more likely to undergo health examinations than single men. Also, married men are more likely to exercise and eat healthy than their single brethren.\n\n""Married people can look after each other, making sure their spouse eats healthy, exercises regularly, and takes medication as prescribed,"" Berger said in a news release. ""A spouse can also help keep doctors\' appointments and provide transportation, making for easier access to health care services.""\n\nThe study was funded by NYU Langone and the findings will be presented at the scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology.', 'Married people have lower risk of heart diseases than their single or divorced peers, according to a new study.\nThe team found that marriage cuts cardiovascular disease risk and it was consistently low for married people regardless of their gender, age and other health complications.\nResearchers found that being married was linked with a 5 percent reduced risk of cardiovascular disease than being single.\nThe difference in cardiovascular risk narrowed with age; with older couples having a seven percent lower chance of suffering from heart problems.\nWhy Marriage cuts Heart Disease Risk?']"

""And now we\'re recognizing that it may be as important as traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.""\n\nNarula said that there are several reasons why this is the case.\n\n""Married couples help each other to eat better, exercise, avoid smoking and alcohol. They serve as a buffer for stressful life events for each other,"" she said. ""They encourage each other to take their medications. To go to doctor\'s appointments and they may even recognize symptoms that their partners doesn\'t.""\n\nFor example, when someone has sleep apnea, which can indicate higher risk for heart attack and stroke, they may not know they are snoring until their spouse lets them know.\n\nNarula said that doctors should ask their patients about their marriage status as part of every appointment to get a feel for what is happening in their lives, saying ""life changes happen throughout your course of time with a patient.""\n\n""Every doctor in training, we\'re taught to get a social history, which means to get a sense of our people,"" she explained. ""Are they single, divorced? Do they live alone? And patients often look at you and wonder why you\'re asking that, but it\'s because it plays into what\'s going on at home in your emotional and family life, and how well you\'re taking care of yourself.""\n\nShe said that it\'s not just being married that counts, but the quality of the union, especially for women.\n\n""We know that if the marriage is not good it can increase stress.

Yet doctors don’t want to miss one — about 2 percent of patients having heart attacks are mistakenly sent home.\n\nPeople may feel reassured by being admitted to a hospital so doctors can keep an eye on them, but that raises the risk of picking up an infection and having expensive care they’ll have to pay a share of, plus unnecessary tests.\n\nThe study included nearly 15,000 people who went to the Karolinska University hospital with chest pains over two years. About 8,900 had low scores on a faster, more sensitive blood test for troponin, a substance that’s a sign of heart damage. The test has been available in Europe, Asia and Canada for about three years, but it is not yet available in the United States.\n\nThe patients were 47 years old on average and 4 percent had a previous heart attack. About 21 percent of them wound up being admitted.\n\nResearchers later looked back to see how the blood test and electrocardiogram would have predicted how they fared over the next month.\n\nThey figured that in order to find one heart attack in patients like this, 594 would have to be admitted — a huge waste of resources.\n\nA test like this would be “enormously useful,” and the study’s results are “almost too good to be true,” said Dr. Judd Hollander, an emergency medicine specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHe believes the test should be available in the U.S. and that the amount of evidence that regulators are requiring to approve it is too high.\n\nDr. Allan Jaffe, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, said the problem is not what the test rules out, but what it might falsely rule in.

This study comes on the heels of a CDC report released this week that says rates of autism diagnoses are surging far higher than they\'ve predicted. Researchers for a new study released by the New England Journal of Medicine looked at brain tissue from 11 autistic children who died and compared with with 11 children without autism. In 10 of the 11 samples from the children with autism, they found ""patches of disorganization in the cortex,"" NPR reported. These patches, or clusters of disorganized brain cells, came from the region of the brain that regulates communication, emotions and ability to function in social settings, things that can be difficult for children with autism. These parts of the brain start developing during the second trimester, said Eric Courchesne, director of the Autism Center of Excellence at the University of California, San Diego and an author of the paper. ""So something must have gone wrong at or before that time,"" Courchesne said, according to NPR. ""Because this points to the biological onset in prenatal life, it calls sharply into question other popular notions about autism."" These popular notions include the now-refuted claims, made popular by the likes of Jenny McCarthy, that vaccinations can cause autism. The CDC released a report this week that says there\'s a 30 percent increase among 8-year-olds diagnosed with autism. While the huge jump might be startling, the CDC also says this increase reflects better awareness and more accurate diagnoses. However, the number of reported cases varies widely by state. ""The number of children identified with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) ranged from 1 in 175 children in Alabama to 1 in 45 children in New Jersey,"" CDC said in its report, based on a 2010 survey. While autism rates are soaring, scientists have been scrambling to find a cause. This new study supports other research that suggests autism can begin in the brain\'s frontal region during pregnancy, but experts say it should be considered preliminary. ""But, this research provides probably some of the most elegant evidence for those two very important biological themes,"" Dr. Janet Lainhart, an autism researcher and psychiatry professor at the University of Wisconsin, told the Associated Press. The CDC report on surging rates combined with the new study that shows autism can begin in the womb shows that it is vital to begin helping kids as early as possible to try and rewire their brains, experts say. ""The most important thing for parents to do is to act early when there is a concern about a child\'s development,"" Dr. Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, chief of CDC\'s Developmental Disabilities Branch, told NBC News. ""If you have a concern about how your child plays, learns, speaks, acts or moves, take action. Don\'t wait."" This study is one of the first that included samples taken from children. Most studies have only been able to look at tissue samples from adults. Advocacy groups for autism have started a program asking for brain tissue donations to help researchers.

This new estimate is roughly 30 percent higher than previous estimates reported in 2012 of 1 in 88 children (11.3 per 1,000 eight year olds) being identified with an autism spectrum disorder. The number of children identified with ASD ranged from 1 in 175 children in Alabama to 1 in 45 children in New Jersey.\n\nThe surveillance summary report, “Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder among Children Aged 8 Years – Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 11 Sites, United States, 2010,” was published today in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Researchers reviewed records from community sources that educate, diagnose, treat and/or provide services to children with developmental disabilities. The criteria used to diagnose ASDs and the methods used to collect data have not changed.\n\nThe data continue to show that ASD is almost five times more common among boys than girls: 1 in 42 boys versus 1 in 189 girls. White children are more likely to be identified as having ASD than are black or Hispanic children.\n\nLevels of intellectual ability vary greatly among children with autism, ranging from severe intellectual challenges to average or above average intellectual ability. The study found that almost half of children identified with ASD have average or above average intellectual ability (an IQ above 85) compared to a third of children a decade ago.\n\n“Community leaders, health professionals, educators and childcare providers should use these data to ensure children with ASD are identified as early as possible and connected to the services they need,” said Coleen Boyle, Ph.D., M.S. hyg., director of CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.\n\nThe report also shows most children with ASD are diagnosed after age 4, even though ASD can be diagnosed as early as age 2. Healthy People 2020, the nation’s 10-year health objectives, strives to increase the proportion of young children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental delays who are screened, evaluated, and enrolled in early intervention services in a timely manner.\n\n“The most important thing for parents to do is to act early when there is a concern about a child’s development,” said Marshalyn Yeargin-Allsopp, M.D., chief of CDC’s Developmental Disabilities Branch. “If you have a concern about how your child plays, learns, speaks, acts, or moves, take action. Don’t wait.”\n\nIf you suspect that your child may have ASD:\n\nTalk to your child’s doctor about your concerns.\n\nAt the same time, call your local early intervention program or school system for a free evaluation.\n\nIt’s never too late to get help for your child.\n\nCDC’s “Learn the Signs. Act Early.” program has joined with others across the federal government to promote developmental and behavioral screening through the Birth to 5: Watch Me Thrive campaign, which will be launched today. The program will help families look for and celebrate milestones; promote universal screenings; identify delays as early as possible; and improve the support available to help children succeed in school and thrive alongside their peers.\n\n“More needs to be done to identify children with autism sooner,” said Boyle. “Early identification is the most powerful tool we have right now to make a difference in the lives of children with autism.”\n\nThrough the Affordable Care Act, more Americans will have access to health coverage and to no-cost preventive services, including autism screening for children at 18 and 24 months.

But she says the CDC is actively participating in additional autism research.\n\n“This study does not look at the question of why this is occurring. However, we believe that some of this is due to the way children are identified, diagnosed and receive services within these communities.”\n\nDr. Michael Morrier is a senior associate of psychiatry in behavioral sciences at the Emory Autism Center.\n\n“The number didn’t specifically surprise me, but what did surprise me is that we’re still getting more and more kids.

Much of the increase is believed to be from a cultural and medical shift, with doctors diagnosing autism more frequently, especially in children with milder problems.\n\n""We can\'t dismiss the numbers, but we can\'t interpret it to mean more people are getting the disorder,"" said Marisela Huerta, a psychologist at the New York-Presbyterian Center for Autism and the Developing Brain in suburban White Plains, N.Y.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the latest estimate yesterday. The Atlanta-based agency said its calculation means autism affects roughly 1.2 million Americans younger than 21. Two years ago, the CDC put the estimate at 1 in 88 children, or about 1 million.\n\nThe cause or causes of autism are still unknown. Without a blood test or other medical tests for it, diagnosis is not an exact science. It\'s identified by making judgments about a child\'s behavior.\n\nYesterday\'s report is considered the most comprehensive on the frequency of autism. Researchers gathered data in 2010 from areas in 11 states � Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.\n\nThe report focused on 8-year-olds because most autism is diagnosed by that age. The researchers checked health and school records to see which children met the criteria for autism, even if they hadn\'t been formally diagnosed. Then the researchers calculated how common autism was in each place and overall.\n\nThe CDC started using this method in 2007 when it came up with an estimate of 1 in 150 children. Two years later, it went to 1 in 110. In 2012, it went to 1 in 88.\n\nLast year, the CDC released results of a less reliable calculation � from a survey of parents � which suggested as many as 1 in 50 children have autism.\n\nExperts aren\'t surprised by the growing numbers, and some said all it reflects is that doctors, teachers and parents are increasingly likely to say a child with learning and behavior problems is autistic. Some CDC experts said screening and diagnosis are clearly major drivers but that they can\'t rule out some actual increase, as well.\n\n""We cannot say what portion is from better diagnosis and improved understanding versus if there\'s a real change,"" said Coleen Boyle, the CDC official overseeing research into children\'s developmental disabilities.\n\nFor decades, autism meant kids with severe language, intellectual and social impairments and unusual, repetitious behaviors. But the definition has gradually expanded and now includes milder, related conditions.\n\nOne sign of that: In the latest study, almost half of autistic kids had average or above-average IQs. That\'s up from a third a decade ago and can be taken as an indication that the autism label is more commonly given to higher-functioning children, CDC officials acknowledged.\n\nAside from that, much in the latest CDC report echoes earlier findings. Autism and related disorders continue to be diagnosed far more often in boys than girls and in whites than blacks or Hispanics. The racial and ethnic differences probably reflects white communities\' greater focus on looking for autism and white parents\' access to doctors because there\'s no biological reason to believe whites get autism more than other people, CDC officials said yesterday at a news briefing.\n\nOne change CDC officials had hoped to see but didn\'t was a drop in the age of diagnosis. Experts said a diagnosis can now be made at age 2 or even earlier. But the new report said the majority of children continue to be diagnosed after they turn 4.\n\n""We know the earlier a child is identified and connected with services, the better,"" Boyle said.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement yesterday, saying the nation needs to step up screening for the condition and research into autism\'s causes.\n\n""It\'s critical that we as a society do not become numb to these numbers,"" said Susan Hyman, head of the group\'s autism subcommittee.', ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the latest estimate yesterday.\nTwo years ago, the CDC put the estimate at 1 in 88 children, or about 1 million.\nThat's up from a third a decade ago and can be taken as an indication that the autism label is more commonly given to higher-functioning children, CDC officials acknowledged.\nAside from that, much in the latest CDC report echoes earlier findings.\nOne change CDC officials had hoped to see but didn't was a drop in the age of diagnosis.""]"

About 1 in 59 children in the United States have ASD, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It’s four times more likely to occur in boys than in girls. The data are drawn from a 2014 survey of 325,483 children in 11 different states, conducted by the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network.\n\nBehind the dramatic increase The results of the 2014 survey show a 16 percent increase in the total prevalence of ASD compared with the previous survey, which was conducted in 2012. During that time, the rate of autism prevalence was 1 in 68 children. This is a major jump in the rate from 2000, when it was just 1 in 150 children, according to the CDC . However, experts say that the increasing prevalence of ASD in the CDC’s latest report has more to do with better monitoring and diagnosis of the disorder, rather than a de facto rise in the number of children who have ASD. “We’re getting better at identifying under-unidentified populations, so it’s not as if the numbers are rising. It’s more that everyone is going to the number that it should be,” Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, told Healthline. Historically, rates of ASD in the United States have been highest among white children compared with black or Hispanic children. In 2006, for example, the prevalence of ASD among white children was 30 percent higher than black children, and nearly 70 percent higher than Hispanic children. This didn’t make a lot of sense, said Wiznitzer. Doctors questioned why the disorder would so disproportionately affect one ethnic group of children. What they discovered was that ASD prevalence tends to be higher among residents of neighborhoods with higher socioeconomic status. These residents are more likely to have access to quality healthcare.', 'Share on Pinterest The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States has jumped again — but the real story is behind the numbers.\nAbout 1 in 59 children in the United States have ASD, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nDuring that time, the rate of autism prevalence was 1 in 68 children.\nHistorically, rates of ASD in the United States have been highest among white children compared with black or Hispanic children.\nWhat they discovered was that ASD prevalence tends to be higher among residents of neighborhoods with higher socioeconomic status.']"

For the third time in the report\'s history, Louisville, Kentucky was ranked number one (up from fifth place last year).\n\nOther cities in the top 10 included Dallas, Texas; Richmond, Virginia; and Birmingham, Alabama.\n\n""We should point out that even Colorado Springs, Colorado, which came in last at 100, is considered bad for allergies,"" noted Mike Tringale, Senior Vice President of External Affairs for AAFA. ""There are 320 metropolitan areas in the country and these are the 100 that have the right mix of factors to be considered ‘allergy capitals\' - i.e., the most challenging for certain allergy sufferers.""\n\nThe factors that go into the rankings are the area\'s pollen score, allergy medicine utilization and the number of board-certified allergists. The pollen score, which is provided to AAFA by IMS Health, reflects recorded pollen/mold spore levels, the predicted prevalence for certain types of pollens/molds over the most recent spring season and the duration of the peak season for the most allergenic pollen types. It also considers the percentage of people in the area who are affected by those pollens.\n\nThe medicine utilization score considers the sale of prescription, over-the-counter and behind-the-counter allergy medication sales per patient during the most recent spring season.\n\nThe last factor calculates the number of board-certified allergy and immunology specialists per every 10,000 patients. Weights are applied to each factor and a composite final score is calculated for each metropolitan area.\n\nNearly 45 million Americans have allergies, and they account for more than 17 million outpatient office visits a year, primarily in the spring and fall, according to the CDC. The number of allergy sufferers has been increasing steadily since the early 1980s across all age, sex and racial groups.\n\nTringale said that increase can be linked directly to a rise in pollen production. ""We co-produced a report three years ago that showed that spring starts two weeks earlier than it did 20 years ago and produces a higher concentration of pollen. It might be because recent increases in environmental carbon dioxide make plants grow bigger and thus pollinate more,"" he said.\n\nAnother anomaly this year was the overlap of spring with winter, which AAFA has dubbed ""Spwinter."" Signs of spring and buds on trees began appearing as early as February, but winter conditions continued to wreak havoc, too, causing record rain or snow and temperature changes of nearly 50 degrees in just one day. According to AAFA\'s press release: ""This combination of Spring and Winter, along with extreme precipitation, means an increased presence of mold in some areas as well as intermittent tree pollination, all of which can trigger allergic reactions.""\n\nDr. Clifford Bassett, assistant clinical professor at NYU\'s School of Medicine and an ambassador for AAFA, added that the types of trees common in most metropolitan areas are also contributing to the increase in allergy problems. ""I refer to this as the ‘battle of the sexes.\' Decades ago, we had more insect-pollinated female trees. Now in many cities, we have more wind-pollinated male trees, which pack a more intense release of allergy-causing seasonal allergies.""\n\nTringale pointed out that the South and Southeast usually rank highest in AAFA\'s Spring Allergy report (as they did this year) and that the focus moves to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic in the fall. That is because tree pollens are highest in spring, grass pollens are highest in summer and weeds dominate in the fall.\n\nTringale told Reuters in a phone interview that knowing this gives perspective and makes you realize that no place is totally safe. ""No matter where you live, you could be affected by allergies. It depends what you\'re allergic to. As we like to say, ‘don\'t move; improve.\'""\n\nHe added: ""We recommend taking a proactive approach. Once you know what you\'re allergic to and when those triggers tend to occur, you will be able to approach your allergies prophylactically and possibly prevent your symptoms rather than trying to treat them after they\'ve made you miserable.""\n\nBassett agreed: ""Getting tested is invaluable in order to develop an individualized ‘allergy action plan\' and to help prevent and reduce seasonal allergies.""\n\nThe full Spring report is available at www.AllergyCapitals.com.

75814,http://ent.about.com/b/2014/03/31/spring-allergy-hype.htm,health,"[""Millions of Americans suffer from various types of allergies. Sometimes symptoms are so severe that they become debilitating, interfere with your quality of life, or can even increase your risk of dying from an anaphylactic reaction.\n\nIf other treatments have been unsuccessful, you may be considering allergy shots (also called immunotherapy). But do allergy shots really work? Are they worth the risk? Here's what you need to know before choosing immunotherapy.\n\nTesting for Allergens\n\nIf you haven't done so already, before starting treatment with allergy shots, your doctor will first run tests to find out the exact substance (or substances) that you are allergic to. If your allergy is a substance in the environment, such as certain types of pollen or pet dander, you may be eligible for allergy shots. Food allergies, however, are not currently treated with allergy shots.\n\nShots to Desensitize You to Your Allergy Triggers\n\nThe substances you are allergic to are called allergens or triggers. Once it's determined what you are allergic to, immunotherapy involves a series of repeated injections of that allergen. The theory is that by exposing your body to the allergen, it will become desensitized to the substance (versus automatically launching the immune response).\n\nSo, do allergy shots work? The short answer is yes, but not for everyone. Allergy shots are not a treatment option that should be taken lightly. There are many considerations, including a substantial time commitment, the risk of an allergic reaction to the shots, and the possibility that only some of your symptoms may be cured, or none at all.\n\nWhile new options are becoming available (such as sublingual drops) that mitigate some of the inconveniences of immunotherapy, these options are still new and not available for everyone.\n\nBuild Up and Maintenance\n\nCompleting immunotherapy may mean you'll have to go to the doctor's office two or more times per week for several months. The treatment is broken up into two phases called the build-up phase and the maintenance phase. During the build-up phase, you are given increasing amounts of the allergen 1-2 or more times per week. This phase lasts 3-6 months.\n\nThe second phase is called the maintenance phase. During the build-up phase, your doctor will determine the best dose of medication (allergen) for you. This is your maintenance dose, which is what you'll receive for the remaining allergy shots and what your doctor feels you respond to best. The good news is that during the maintenance phase, you will only need to get shots every 2-4 weeks. The maintenance phase lasts about three years.\n\nRisks\n\nThere is always the chance that you could have an allergic reaction to an allergy shot, which could lead to anaphylaxis and even death. It may seem a bit like tempting fate to give someone a substance you know they react to, but you only receive very small amounts staggered over a long period.\n\nSerious reactions are rare, but you should be sure to only undergo immunotherapy when administered by a qualified allergist/immunologist. These doctors have equipment in their offices for treating allergic reactions. If you are going to have a reaction to the shot, it will happen within about 30 minutes, so many physicians will have you stay at the office for about a half hour after receiving the shot.\n\nAllergy Shots Don't Always Work\n\nThe results of immunotherapy vary widely from one person to another, with some people completely cured and some individuals showing little to no benefit. Almost all patients experience, at the least, a reduction in symptoms. Even if your allergies go away completely, there is always the possibility that they will return, and you will require another round of allergy shots.\n\nImmunotherapy can be a blessing for many people who suffer from allergies, but as you can see, it is not a treatment to be taken lightly. You may wish to ask yourself some of the following questions before making a decision.\n\nDo I have the time, and am I willing to spend that time getting allergy shots?\n\nCan I afford allergy shots?\n\nHow many months of the year do my allergies affect me?\n\nHow serious are my symptoms?\n\nAre my allergies decreasing my quality of life?\n\nHave I tried other treatments?"", 'If other treatments have been unsuccessful, you may be considering allergy shots (also called immunotherapy).\nBut do allergy shots really work?\nIf your allergy is a substance in the environment, such as certain types of pollen or pet dander, you may be eligible for allergy shots.\nSo, do allergy shots work?\nDo I have the time, and am I willing to spend that time getting allergy shots?']"

Because its grains are larger and heavier than some other types of tree pollen, it tends to drop to the ground or onto whatever lies between it and the ground and is significantly less likely to enter the respiratory system of an allergy sufferer, experts say.\n\nTrees such as oak, elm and maple trees, however, release microscopically tiny grains of pollen that float through the air.\n\nThey are easily breathed in, which is where the trouble begins.\n\nThat\'s not to say that no one suffers from pine pollen allergies - but they are comparatively rare, doctors say.\n\nThose who suffer from severe pollen allergies never enjoy the annual spring onslaught, but many say their noses and sinuses are telling them that this year\'s tree pollen season is a doozy.\n\nBeaumont resident Maria Montiel, 63, said she is allergic to many different kinds of pollen.\n\n""I have to be really careful when I go out,"" she said after getting allergy shots at Dr. Ranjit Singh\'s clinic. ""I think it\'s been worse this year than years before.""\n\nThe unusually cold winter that seemed to go on and on this year could be behind the sudden massive release of pollen. More specifically, it\'s probably due to the fact that temperatures rather abruptly began to rise, said Estelle Levetin, a biology professor at the University of Tulsa.\n\nBecause of the cold, late Southeast Texas winter, pollination, which normally starts gradually and eases in over several weeks, occurred suddenly, sending trees into a frenzy of pollination, as if to make up for lost time.\n\nThe fact that winter also brought plentiful rainfall also did not hurt the trees\' pollen-generating abilities, Levetin said.\n\nHowever, she said, the ways of plants are still a bit mysterious to the scientists who study their ways. The amount of pollen floating around is the result of many environmental factors, including rainfall, temperature, wind and other events that affect plants in ways not always easy to predict or even understand.\n\nDoctors at the AFC/Doctors Express clinic in Beaumont doctors reported an influx of patients suffering from allergies, due to high pollen counts.\n\nSingh, a Beaumont physician specializing in allergies and asthma, also was busy Friday seeing patients seeking relief from pollen woes.\n\nBeaumont resident Mary Ann Johnson, 73, was there for a follow-up visit. Two weeks ago, Johnson said she was so congested she couldn\'t breath through her nose at all.\n\nJohnson, who suffers from both asthma and pollen allergies, was so miserable she drove down to Port Arthur to see Singh at his office there rather than wait to see him on his Beaumont office days.\n\nSingh treated her with a nasal steroid and antibiotics, and she was pleased to report that her symptoms were under control.\n\n""He always fixes me up - always!"" she said. ""I told him, thanks to you, I feel good today.""\n\nOf course, in Southeast Texas, allergies and sinus problems seem to flourish year-round. When one season ends, another one starts, between tree pollen, grass, ragweed, mold and dust mites, as well as man-made allergens.\n\nDana Carter of China suffers from various allergies, including pollen, dust mites and perfume.\n\nIn addition, her workplace, Sanitary Supply Company, deals in different types of aerosols that exacerbate her symptoms.\n\nCarter takes medication as well as receiving immunotherapy, more commonly known as allergy shots.\n\n""I haven\'t had a round of bronchitis since getting the shots!"" she said.\n\nSCMoore@BeaumontEnterprise.com Twitter.com/Daily_Tiger', ""SETX physicians reporting influx of allergy-related patientsMaria Montiel of Beaumont gets an allergy shot from Belinda Posey, a nurse in Dr. Ranjit Singh's office.\nHigh pollen counts as the unusually cold winter finally gave way to warmer temperatures have sent ... more Photo: Sarah Moore Photo: Sarah Moore Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close SETX physicians reporting influx of allergy-related patients 1 / 3 Back to GalleryIt's not the pollen you can see that causes the problems.\nThat's not to say that no one suffers from pine pollen allergies - but they are comparatively rare, doctors say.\nThe unusually cold winter that seemed to go on and on this year could be behind the sudden massive release of pollen.\nDoctors at the AFC/Doctors Express clinic in Beaumont doctors reported an influx of patients suffering from allergies, due to high pollen counts.""]"

This geographical spread is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic,"" said Lugli.Doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, water and sanitation experts, anthropologists, as well as over 40 tons of equipment have been flown in to fight the epidemic. By week\'s end, there will be over 60 field workers on the ground who have experience with Ebola and the hemorrhagic fever it causes.One of the field workers\' main objectives is to identify those potentially infected. Epidemiologist Michel Van Herp explained that ""To stop the outbreak, it is important to trace the chain of transmission. All contacts of patients likely to have been contaminated should be monitored and isolated at the first sign of infection.""He said the particular strain of Ebola has been identified as the Zaire strain, ""the most aggressive and deadly,"" that kills more than 9 in 10 patients.Neighboring Liberia has confirmed two cases of the virus. One of those cases was confirmed dead. Sierra Leone and Senegal have no confirmed cases, and Senegal closed its border with Guinea, temporarily shutting down marketplaces that drew thousands from multiple countries.There is no vaccine or cure for Ebola, and it is initially transmitted to humans from wild mammals.

To date, Guinean health authorities have recorded 122 suspected patients and 78 deaths. Other cases, suspected or diagnosed, were found in Sierra Leone and Liberia. MSF continues to strengthen its teams on the ground in Guinea. By the end of the week, there will be around 60 international fieldworkers who have experience in working on haemorrhagic fever. The group will be divided between Conakry and the other locations in the south-east of the country. Among the fieldworkers are doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, water and sanitation experts, as well as anthropologists. In addition, more than 40 tonnes of equipment has been flown into the country to enable MSF teams to curb the spread of the disease. “MSF has intervened in almost all reported Ebola outbreaks in recent years, but these outbreaks much more geographically contained and involved more remote locations, as opposed to urban areas. The vast geographic spread of the Guinea outbreak is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic,” said Lugli. This is the most aggressive and deadly known form of the virus. It kills more than nine out of 10 patients In Conakry, MSF has strengthened the support for the isolation of patients located at the referral hospital of Donka, in collaboration with the Guinean health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO). Currently, several patients in other health structures are still hospitalised under non-optimal conditions and it is imperative that isolation be improved and reinforced in the coming days. The teams are also looking for a suitable place to set up a new facility to further support local health authorities. At the same time, MSF has already begun to identify people who may have been in contact with confirmed Ebola patients. The search and screening of potential new patients, and if necessary, their isolation is the only way to break the chain of transmission of the virus. There is currently no vaccine against or established successful treatment for Ebola. “In the Guinea outbreak it is the Zaire strain of Ebola virus. This is the most aggressive and deadly known form of the virus. It kills more than nine out of 10 patients,” said Michel Van Herp, an MSF epidemiologist currently in Guekedou. “To stop the outbreak, it is important to trace the chain of transmission. All contacts of patients likely to have been contaminated should be monitored and isolated at the first sign of infection.” “It is important that the Guinean authorities and the WHO help medical facilities put in place all necessary hygiene measures,” said Van Herp. •Date: 1st April 2014 • Africa •Type: Article • Topic: Pandemic planning Sign up for Continuity Briefing, our weekly roundup of business continuity news.

File picture: Youssouf Bah Conakry - Guinea faces an Ebola epidemic on an unprecedented scale as it battles to contain confirmed cases now scattered across several locations that are far apart, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said on Monday. The warning from an organisation with experience of tackling Ebola in Central Africa comes after Guinea's president appealed for calm as the number of deaths linked to an outbreak on the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone hit 80. The outbreak of one of the world's most lethal infectious diseases has spooked a number of governments with weak health systems, prompting Senegal to close its border with Guinea and other neighbours to restrict travel and cross-border exchanges. Figures released overnight by Guinea's health ministry showed that there had been 78 deaths from 122 cases of suspected Ebola since January, up from 70. Of these, there were 22 laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola, the ministry said. “We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country,” said Mariano Lugli, coordinator of MSF's project in Conakry.\n\nThe organisation said it had been involved in nearly all other recent Ebola outbreaks, mostly in remote parts of Central African nations, but Guinea is now fighting to contain the disease in numerous locations, some of which are hundreds of kilometres apart.\n\n“This geographical spread is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic,” Lugli added.\n\nThe outbreak of Ebola - which has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent - has centred around Guinea's southeast. But it took authorities six weeks to identify the disease, allowing it to spread over borders and to more populated areas.\n\nUp to 400 people are identified as potential Ebola contacts in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, Tarik Jasarevic, spokesman for the UN’s World Health Organisation (WHO), told Reuters. “We need find where these people are and check on them,” he said.\n\nCases were last week confirmed in Conakry, bringing the disease, which was previously limited to remote, lightly populated areas, to the seaside capital of two million people.\n\nGuinea's President Alpha Conde late on Sunday appealed for calm. “My government and I are very worried about this epidemic,” he said, ordering Guineans to take strict precautions to avoid the further spread of the disease.\n\n“I also call on people not to give in to panic or believe the rumours that are fuelling people's fears,” he added.\n\nLiberia has recorded seven suspected and confirmed cases, including four deaths, the WHO said. Health authorities on Monday said a female Ebola patient from Lofa County was admitted to Firestone hospital outside the Liberian capital Monrovia.\n\nHealth Minister Walter Gwenigale said authorities were trying to trace the taxi driver who brought her to the hospital.

It\'s the most lethal outbreak since the virus was discovered almost 40 years ago.\n\nEbola has infected more than 6, 500 people across five West African countries and killed more than 3,000.\n\nThe spread of the disease comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) met in an emergency session in Geneva to decide whether to declare an international crisis.\n\nWhat is Ebola?\n\nThe Ebola is a virus that causes the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans. It is one of the most deadly diseases in the world, with a case fatality rate of up to 90 per cent.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, Ebola first occurred in 1976 in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nIn the beginning, the symptoms of Ebola are similar to that of people who have the flu, said Dr Myrto Schaefer, Director of the Medical Unit at Doctors Without Borders in Australia.\n\nAfter an incubation period of about two to 21 days, the virus can cause headaches, severe fevers and muscle pain.\n\nAs the disease progresses, it can then lead to haemorrhagic fevers, which causes internal and external bleeding, for example bloody diarrhoea and bleeding from the nose.\n\nHow common is the disease?\n\nEbola is rare, but when it occurs, it can cause up to 90 per cent of infected patients to die.\n\n""It’s not a common disease, but whenever and wherever it occurs, it is an emergency,"" said Dr Schaefer. ""Therefore we have to act rapidly.""\n\nHow is it transmitted?\n\nEbola is transmitted through human-to-human contact via bodily fluids, for example by sneezing, blood contact, secretions and so on.\n\n""It’s a very contagious disease. Together with the Ministry Health and the WHO, we look for any kind of symptom and isolate them when it’s necessary,"" said Dr Schaefer.\n\nHow do you treat Ebola?\n\nEbola has no known cure. There are no treatments and no vaccines that can be used.\n\nDr Schaefer said the only thing doctors can do is treat the patient symptomatically and isolate them to prevent the further spread of disease. By doing so, doctors are able to reduce Ebola\'s very high mortality rate.\n\n""There is no specific curative treatment, like an antibiotic. So what we can do is treat the patient symptomatically, ensure that they’re not suffering, replace fluids that they’re losing,"" she said.\n\n""And at the same time, make sure the community is protected – which means that any patients that arrive in our facilities are put out in isolation tents.\n\n""On top of that we have to be careful with regards to health care providers, that they are correctly protected and wearing everything from goggles, gloves, aprons, boots in order not to get infected themselves.""\n\nIs there a way to prevent or reduce the risk of Ebola?\n\nAs there is no vaccine or treatment for Ebola, people need to be quarantined immediately to contain the spread of the disease.\n\n""As soon as you identify one case, you start isolating and containing the disease from spreading,"" Dr Schaefer said.\n\nShe said previous Ebola outbreaks occurred in remote areas in the DRC and Uganda, which made it easier to contain. However in Guinea, the epidemic has now reached Conakry, the nation’s capital.\n\n""I hope the worst case scenario won’t happen. But we’re talking about a very deadly strain of the virus, we’re talking about a weak health system, we’re talking about a highly contagious disease, and we’re talking about a big city,"" said Dr Schaefer. ""There is also a risk, of course, of panic spreading.""\n\nRaising awareness of the disease in the community is one way to reduce the transfer of Ebola. The WHO recommends that during an outbreak, public health workers need to educate the community about:\n\nReducing the risks of wildlife-to-human infections and the handling of raw meat.\n\nReducing the risks of human-to-human transmission via close contact with infected persons.\n\nContaining and quarantining the disease, especially regarding the proper and safe burial of people who have died from Ebola.\n\nListen: Q&A with Dr Myrto Schaefer, Director of the Medical Unit at Doctors without Borders in Australia.\n\nIs it safe to travel during an outbreak?\n\nThe risk of infection for travelers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with the body fluids or secretions of an infected patient, according to the WHO.', 'Ebola has infected more than 6, 500 people across five West African countries and killed more than 3,000.\nThe Ebola is a virus that causes the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, Ebola first occurred in 1976 in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nEbola is transmitted through human-to-human contact via bodily fluids, for example by sneezing, blood contact, secretions and so on.\nContaining and quarantining the disease, especially regarding the proper and safe burial of people who have died from Ebola.']"

It now reportedly involves 122 people, of which 78 have died. Additional cases have been reported in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which border Guinea.\n\nThe disease caused by the virus is dramatic and awful. It starts with flu-like symptoms – a fever, sore throat, extreme tiredness and muscle pain. Within a few days, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea develop.\n\nWhile all this is happening, the virus is also attacking the internal organs, particularly the liver and kidneys. As these organs start to fail, the patient starts to bleed and eventually succumbs to dehydration and blood loss. Of the roughly 2,200 recorded cases of Ebola to date, around 1,500 infected people have died.\n\nA family of viruses\n\nThe Ebola virus itself was first discovered in 1976, but it’s one of a group of viruses that cause a similar syndrome known as viral hemorrhagic fevers.\n\nWhile Ebola virus is mainly found in Central Africa (the current outbreak in Guinea is far west of previous outbreaks), other viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever are distributed more widely – Lassa fever (West Africa), hantavirus (east Asia), Junin (Argentina), Crimean-Congo (mainly Central Asia and eastern Europe). Dengue virus, commonly found across the tropics (particularly Asia), can, on rare occasions, cause a similar syndrome.\n\nThere are five strains of Ebola and they vary in terms of how infective and lethal they are. The most significant outbreaks are associated with the Sudan and Zaire strains; the latter is implicated in this outbreak.\n\nThe largest outbreak involved 425 people in 2000 in Uganda, and the 2003 outbreak in Congo had a mortality of 90%, making it one of the most dangerous viral infections described. Nonetheless, in absolute numbers Ebola is regarded as uncommon, even compared to some other viral haemorrhagic fevers. And it’s almost insignificant compared to some of the major health problems in the region.\n\nEbola is thought to originate in fruit bats and initial cases in humans result from contact with infected animals, including chimpanzees, gorillas and monkeys. But outbreaks like the current one occur because of human-to-human spread.\n\nHow it spreads\n\nThe good news, if there is any, is that spread of the virus is controllable, and it’s probably not as infectious as you might think from watching films about virus outbreaks.\n\nUnlike SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which spread quickly from contact with droplets and contamination of the environment and was difficult to control even in developed countries such as Singapore and Canada, Ebola requires contact with infected body fluids. This means it only generally spreads to close contacts of infected people – mainly family members, health-care workers and people involved with preparing bodies for burial.\n\nThe World Health Organization only recommends “standard precautions” to stop people coming into close contact with the secretions of infected patients. This includes wearing gloves, gown, face mask and eye protection, ensuring hand disinfection and setting up systems to manage assessment, patient care, and cleaning and waste disposal.\n\nAll this may sound rather simple – after all, standard precautions are what’s generally recommended for all patients in Australian hospitals. But the challenges involved in caring for patients in outbreaks are significant.\n\nPeople with viral haemorrhagic fever bleed and vomit, and these fluids are potentially infectious. Training for health-care workers, particularly in areas where Ebola has previously been unknown, is unlikely to adequately prepare them for recognising or caring for infected patients, or for the strict infection control procedures required to prevent spread.\n\nContaining the outbreak\n\nAnd there’s a bigger problem still; Ebola infections tend to occur in places where the health infrastructure is extremely limited.\n\nI was once told that no patient with Ebola had ever had a chest X-ray. Not because it wasn’t relevant (in some haemorrhagic fevers, leakage of fluid into the lungs can be an important finding) but because infections always occur in places without the capacity to do a chest X-ray, one of the most basic of medical tests.\n\nThat lack of capacity tends to affect all efforts to control disease outbreaks. Guinea, where the current outbreak is occurring, is also reportedly battling measles, cholera and meningitis.\n\nBut all is not lost. The medical aid organisation, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), is airlifting in teams and resources to control this Ebola outbreak. It has expertise in these areas through involvement with previous such emergencies.\n\nThe organisation has noted that this outbreak poses particular difficulties as cases are being recognised in multiple places in the region, which are also far apart, complicating efforts to control the epidemic.

The number of suspected cases is now up to 122 in Guinea, with 78 deaths among them, according to a press release from Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders). Reuters says that the county\'s health ministry reported that 22 of these cases were confirmed as Ebola by laboratory tests. Many of these cases are in southeastern regions of the country, but it appears the virus is spreading. Suspected cases have shown up in central Guinea and the capital city of Conackry, on the coast, but also in parts of neighbouring nations Liberia and Sierra Leone, which share a border with those regions worst hit by the virus so far.\n\nIn the press release, Mariano Lugli, the coordinator of MSF\'s efforts in Conakry, said that the epidemic was ""of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country.""\n\n""This geographical spread is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organizations working to control the epidemic,"" he added.\n\n[ Related: Scale of Guinea\'s Ebola epidemic unprecedented, says aid agency ]\n\nIn Liberia, there have been several suspected cases reported, with seven samples tested so far, and two people have died (one confirmed as infected by the Ebola virus). According to the WHO, as of March 26, another 27 people were under medical followup. To the east, in Sierra Leone, there are another five suspected cases. According to the reports, all of the people suspected of being infected visited Guinea recently.\n\nEbola is one of the most infectious and dangerous viruses we know of, capable of killing up to 9 out of every 10 people that are infected. This is because someone infected can appear symptom-free for up to three weeks while the virus takes hold, after which they quickly develop severe symptoms of hemorrhagic fever, including weakness, extremely high fever, headaches, muscle pain and conjunctivitis (pink eye), followed by vomiting, diarrhea and, in some cases, a rash. By the time the infected show symptoms, though, it can often be too late, as the virus, having gone unnoticed by the immune system for all that time, causes blood clots which can block up major organs and cause massive internal bleeding.\n\nThe strain that is currently responsible for the outbreak in Guinea and the surrounding area is one that was first seen in Zaire in 1976, and is apparently the deadliest of the known Ebola strains. Although researchers still don\'t know for sure what species is the natural \'reservoir\' for the virus, it\'s suspected that fruit bats are the most likely source. The virus is transmitted to humans by coming into contact with infected animals, typically when the animals are butchered as a food source. It is usually spread among populations of people due to poor hygiene, or due to cultural practices — like the very personal, and highly respectful funeral practice of washing the deceased by hand — that make it very easy for people to come into contact with the virus.\n\nWorse yet, there is no known cure or vaccine for the Ebola virus. Once contracted, the symptoms can be treated, and this can help the victim survive, but it is really up to the body at that point, whether it will survive or not.\n\n[ More Geekquinox: A shred of hope after UN\'s damning report on climate change ]\n\nEven though Ebola is so deadly, containing the disease is relatively easy. If, instead, Ebola was an airborne virus, like influenza (or possibly even the Black Death), it could be spread very quickly just by being in the vicinity of an infected person. Such a hypothetical virus could lead to the doomsday pandemics that often show up in post-apocalyptic fiction.\n\nFortunately (if anything about this deadly virus could be labeled as \'fortunate\'), since Ebola is only spread by direct contact with bodily fluids (blood, mucus, sweat, urine and even breast milk), it only requires a quarantine of those infected, education about preventing exposure, and preventing people from performing the traditional hand-washing of the bodies of people who have died from the virus (at least for as long as the outbreak persists). That\'s what organizations like Doctors without Borders do in these cases. They quarantine the area, identify who is infected, and do everything they can from there to prevent it from spreading.\n\nStory continues', ""The number of suspected cases is now up to 122 in Guinea, with 78 deaths among them, according to a press release from Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders).\nReuters says that the county's health ministry reported that 22 of these cases were confirmed as Ebola by laboratory tests.\nTo the east, in Sierra Leone, there are another five suspected cases.\nAccording to the reports, all of the people suspected of being infected visited Guinea recently.\nWorse yet, there is no known cure or vaccine for the Ebola virus.""]"

Health officials in Liberia are following 27 contacts of the patients.\n\nSuspected cases in Liberia have triggered several response actions, the WHO said. Officials have beefed up infection prevention and control practices at the Foya Hospital, provided extra personal protective equipment to protect health workers and support isolation measures. Health workers are also receiving training on how to safely manage patients with suspected Ebola illness.\n\nLiberia has a national task force that is leading the response efforts, which include assistance from several partners including the WHO, the International Red Cross, and a handful of other organizations.\n\nIn other developments, Sierra Leone and Liberia have both scaled down the number of suspected cases reported earlier. Liberia has three suspected case-patients who were from Guinea's Gueckedou prefecture and died in Liberia. Sierra Leone has two suspected fatal cases, both of whom had traveled to Guinea before they got sick.\n\nCases in Guinea reach 122\n\nIn Guinea, 10 more suspected Ebola infections have been reported, with the number of suspected and confirmed cases at 112, including 70 deaths, the WHO said. On Twitter today, however, Hartl put the country's outbreak count at 122 suspected and confirmed cases, with 78 deaths.\n\nFour of the latest suspected cases-patients are from the country's capital of Conakry, but most illnesses have been reported in three prefectures in the forested southeastern part of the country. Two of the newest suspected cases involve healthcare workers, which the WHO said highlights the need to strengthen infection prevention and control practices in medical facilities.\n\nSo far 24 cases have been confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing, which includes 11 from Conakry, and 13 from two prefectures where the outbreak is centered: Gueckedou (6) and Macenta (7).\n\nGuinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone all have active emergency committees, prepared their Ebola outbreak response plans, and conducted needs assessments, the WHO said, adding that it and its partners are continuing to response outbreak response activities.\n\nSenegal-Guinea border closed\n\nElsewhere, Senegal has closed its border with Guinea to curb the spread of the Ebola outbreak, the Associated Press (AP) reported today.\n\nThe news came in a Mar 29 announcement from Senegal's interior ministry, which also said authorities in the southern region of Kolda temporarily shuttered a weekly market that draws large crowds from its West African neighbors, which include Guinea, Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nThe WHO has said it does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone, based on the current outbreak information.\n\nThe outbreak, first announced on Mar 23, is the first in West Africa and involves the highly lethal Zaire strain of the Ebola virus, which hasn't been implicated in an outbreak since 2008. The disease jumps from infected wildlife to humans and can then spread through secretions in close-contact scenarios.\n\nHealth officials have said it's unlikely, but not impossible, that travelers would be infected, but they have warned medical workers in other countries to be alert for those returning home from tropical countries with symptoms such as fever, headache, and diarrhea.\n\nSee also:\n\nMar 30 WHO statement on Liberia cases\n\nMar 30 WHO statement focusing on Guinea cases\n\nGregory Hartl Twitter feed\n\nMar 30 AP story"", 'WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl today on Twitter said that Liberia has seven suspected and confirmed cases, four of them fatal.\nSo far, the Foya district in Lofa County is the only area of Liberia reporting confirmed or suspected Ebola cases.\nHealth workers are also receiving training on how to safely manage patients with suspected Ebola illness.\nIn other developments, Sierra Leone and Liberia have both scaled down the number of suspected cases reported earlier.\nGuinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone all have active emergency committees, prepared their Ebola outbreak response plans, and conducted needs assessments, the WHO said, adding that it and its partners are continuing to response outbreak response activities.']"

Of these, there were 22 laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola, the ministry said.\n\n“We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country,” said Mariano Lugli, coordinator of MSF’s project in Conakry.\n\nThe organisation said it had been involved in nearly all other recent Ebola outbreaks, mostly in remote parts of central African nations, but Guinea is now fighting to contain the disease in numerous locations, some of which are hundreds of kilometres apart.\n\n“This geographical spread is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic,” Lugli added.\n\nThe outbreak of Ebola - which has a fatality rate of up to 90 percent - has centred around Guinea’s southeast. But it took authorities six weeks to identify the disease, allowing it to spread over borders and to more populated areas.\n\nUp to 400 people are identified as potential Ebola contacts in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, Tarik Jasarevic, spokesman for the U.N.’s World Health Organization (WHO), told Reuters. “We need find where these people are and check on them,” he said.\n\nAPPEAL FOR CALM\n\nCases were last week confirmed in Conakry, bringing the disease, which was previously limited to remote, lightly populated areas, to the seaside capital of 2 million people.\n\nGuinea’s President Alpha Conde late on Sunday appealed for calm. “My government and I are very worried about this epidemic,” he said, ordering Guineans to take strict precautions to avoid the further spread of the disease.\n\n“I also call on people not to give in to panic or believe the rumours that are fuelling people’s fears,” he added.\n\nLiberia has recorded seven suspected and confirmed cases, including four deaths, WHO said. Health authorities on Monday said a female Ebola patient from Lofa County was admitted to Firestone hospital outside the Liberian capital Monrovia.\n\nHealth Minister Walter Gwenigale said authorities were trying to trace the taxi driver who brought her to the hospital. Health sources told Reuters the patient later died but there was no official confirmation.\n\nSierra Leone has reported five suspected cases, none of which have been confirmed.\n\nOfficials there on Monday forbid the entry of corpses for burial from across the country’s northern border with Guinea, Chief Medical Officer Brima Kargbo told Reuters.\n\nKargbo said border screening had been introduced. Travellers are being asked where they are coming from and whether they or anyone they had been in contact with had fallen ill, he said.\n\nSenegal, another neighbour of Guinea’s, closed its land border over the weekend and has suspended weekly markets near the border to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nA spokesperson for Orange telecommunications company said it had postponed a music concert with Senegalese singer Youssou N’Dour scheduled in Conakry at the weekend due to the outbreak.\n\nRegional airline Gambia Bird delayed the launch of services to Conakry, due to start on Sunday, because of the outbreak.\n\nIf the deaths are all confirmed as Ebola, a disease that leads to vomiting, diarrhoea and external bleeding, it would be the most deadly epidemic since 187 people died in Luebo, in Congo’s Kasai Orientale province, in 2007.

This phase is often followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rashes, kidney and liver failure and internal and external bleeding. The most serious cases are placed in intensive care and put on a drip to combat dehydration. No cure or vaccine is available, except for yellow fever. Ebola outbreaks have had mortality rates as high as 90 percent.\n\n- The main viruses causing the fever\n\nFour of the five known Ebola virus strains - Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Tai Forest - as well as Lassa, Marburg, Crimean-Congo and yellow fever, the best-known and oldest cause of hemorrhagic fever.\n\n- Means of transmission\n\nThese viruses are spread by direct contact with blood, body fluids or tissues of the infected. However, some scientists suspect the possibility of contamination through the respiratory tract. Funeral rituals in which relatives and friends touch the body of the dead play an important role in transmission, as does handling dead or living animals carrying the virus.\n\n- Viruses in Guinea\n\nThe Lassa virus is endemic throughout west Africa, and is present in Guinea alongside Ebola, but experts say yellow fever and Crimean-Congo are also likely culprits. The Ebola species detected in Guinea is Zaire, the most virulent.\n\nThis is the first Ebola outbreak among humans in west Africa. There was an epidemic of Tai Forest Ebola among chimpanzees in Ivory Coast in 1994, and a scientist who contracted the virus during an autopsy was treated in Europe without spreading it.\n\nExperts have voiced astonishment that the Zaire strain—first observed in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo 38 years ago—has made the ""substantial leap"" to Guinea. Ebola outbreaks tend to be localised because, with the onset of symptoms occurring two to 21 days after infection, most victims have time to spread it too far before they are immobilised.\n\n- Has the peak of the epidemic been reached?\n\nSince the beginning of January, 78 people have died among 122 identified cases of haemorrhagic fever. Ebola has been detected in 22 samples from patients so far. The fever first appeared in southern Guinea, then spread to the centre of Guinea before showing up in the capital, Conakry.\n\nTwo cases of Ebola have been confirmed in Liberia from seven suspected cases and there are six suspected cases in Sierra Leone, none confirmed.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), which coordinates the fight against the spread of epidemics, says the spread from southern Guinea has made predicting how the epidemic will play out impossible.\n\n- Measures to prevent the spread\n\nAid agencies and Guinean health officials are focusing on prevention, education of at-risk populations on how to stay safe and isolation of patients. Experts say the quick identification of new samples is imperative, and mobile laboratories have been set up operational in Conakry and the southern town of Guekedou, according to the WHO.\n\nExplore further Liberia confirms first Ebola cases\n\n© 2014 AFP', 'The viral haemorrhagic fever epidemic raging in Guinea is caused by several viruses which have similar symptoms—the deadliest and most feared of which is Ebola.\nNo cure or vaccine is available, except for yellow fever.\n- The main viruses causing the feverFour of the five known Ebola virus strains - Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Tai Forest - as well as Lassa, Marburg, Crimean-Congo and yellow fever, the best-known and oldest cause of hemorrhagic fever.\n- Viruses in GuineaThe Lassa virus is endemic throughout west Africa, and is present in Guinea alongside Ebola, but experts say yellow fever and Crimean-Congo are also likely culprits.\nExplore further Liberia confirms first Ebola cases© 2014 AFP']"

Ian Lipkin, MD, the director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia\'s Mailman School of Public Health, told Business Insider.\n\nThe outbreak is causing particular concern, even among those who have been on the front lines of previous outbreaks.\n\n""We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country,"" Mariano Lugli, coordinator of MSF\'s project in Conakry, told Reuters.\n\nEbola is usually contained within a small, rural area, but in the Guinea outbreak, it took six weeks to identify the virus. At that point, it had already been found in multiple, far-flung locations within the country. That makes it much more challenging to control.\n\nIt has now spread to the country\'s capital, Conakry, to neighboring Liberia, and possibly to Sierra Leone, Reuters reported. Conakry is a port city of 2 million, and residents of West Africa are already terrified. Senegal, another neighboring country, closed its border to crossings by land.\n\nThe symptoms of Ebola often include uncontrollable bleeding, and the deadliest strains of the virus kill up to 90% of people infected. Most outbreaks are successfully contained, but the geographic spread of Ebola in Guinea has some people worried.\n\nThe first thing to realize: It\'s not that easily spread. Peter Piot, one of the the scientists who discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, has emphasized that it\'s not like a highly contagious flu. As he wrote in The Independent:\n\nFundamentally, Ebola is easy to contain. It\'s not a question of needing high technology. It\'s about respecting the basics of hygiene, and about isolation, quarantine and protecting yourself — in particular protecting healthcare workers, because they are very exposed.\n\nIt\'s really ""a disease of poverty and neglect of health systems,"" he writes. It often spreads when hospital workers or mourners come into contact with bodily fluids like blood and vomit, when hospitals use unsanitized needles, or when people handle or eat the meat of infected animals, like bats.\n\nBut part of what makes this Ebola outbreak alarming is that recent outbreaks have been in East Africa, and no one can say why it is suddenly in West Africa.\n\n""This is a virus that is highly unpredictable,"" Piot told Reuters. ""This time it popped up in Guinea where it has never been detected before. Why there? Why now?""\n\nNobody can say for sure, but ""people and wild animals dont respect geographic boundaries,"" Lipkin noted, proposing three potential explanations for the spread into Guinea: ""a human was infected elsewhere and traveled to Guinea, infected bushmeat was acquired elsewhere and brought into Guinea, or infected animals moved into Guinea and [were] hunted by humans.""\n\nEbola\'s emergence in East Africa and its spread to Conakry is a cause for serious concern — the virus does not usually ""jump"" from place to place. But right now there\'s not yet reason to fear that it will not be successfully contained, especially with international effort now focused on doing just that. A suspected case of a Canadian who had recently travelled to Liberia turned out to be a false alarm, for example.\n\nAt this point, Guinea says it has isolated those infected.\n\nSo could Ebola ever travel to the U.S.?\n\n""Anything is possible,"" Lipkin told Business Insider. ""However, it’s unlikely.""\n\nThis post was updated to add information from Dr. Lipkin and from Reuters\' latest report.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore From Business Insider\n\n', ""Guinea is battling to contain an outbreak of Ebola, which currently includes 122 suspected cases and 78 deaths, not all of which are confirmed to be the deadly virus.\nEbola is usually contained within a small, rural area, but in the Guinea outbreak, it took six weeks to identify the virus.\nMost outbreaks are successfully contained, but the geographic spread of Ebola in Guinea has some people worried.\nPeter Piot, one of the the scientists who discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, has emphasized that it's not like a highly contagious flu.\nBut part of what makes this Ebola outbreak alarming is that recent outbreaks have been in East Africa, and no one can say why it is suddenly in West Africa.""]"

More than 70 people in the Western African nation have died from the virus — which causes vomiting, diarrhea, and external bleeding — and 11 deaths have also been confirmed in neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\n“We are facing an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen in terms of the distribution of cases in the country,” Mariano Lugli, the emergency coordinator for the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, noted.\n\nThe Ebola virus was first discovered in the 1970s in central Africa. There are several different strains of the virus, each named after the region where they originated. The so-called Zaire virus, which is the strain currently infecting people in Western Africa, kills about 90 percent of the people who contract it.\n\nThere is no vaccine currently available for the deadly virus, and no cure. So far, at least four health care workers have died while working to contain the Ebola outbreak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning because the virus has made its way to Conakry, the capital of Guinea, where hundreds of thousands of people live in close quarters. Previous Ebola outbreaks have mainly been concentrated in rural parts of central African countries, where the virus has been easier to contain. This is also the furthest west that the Zaire strain has ever been documented. Authorities in Guinea have launched an investigation to try to determine the source of the outbreak.\n\nFurthermore, residents of West African nations face significant barriers to health services; some countries in the region average less than ten physicians per 100,000 inhabitants. As Reuters points out, “one of the most lethal infectious diseases known to man could be spreading in an impoverished region ill-equipped to cope.”\n\nOfficials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are monitoring the situation and may eventually step in to assist with the work on the ground. The agency may help by compiling educational materials for people who live in regions affected by the recent outbreak.\n\n“A lot of the education process is helping people understand if someone is sick they need to go to the hospital so people can be treated in a setting where they have equipment to protect themselves and others,” Dr. Barbara Knust, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s viral special pathogens branch, told Fox News. “We also stress that if someone dies, funeral arrangements have to be made in a way that people preparing body for funeral are protected — wearing gloves, using disinfectant and other measures.”\n\nAs health officials are scrambling to contain the current outbreak, they’re not ruling out the possibility that Ebola could spread further. Last week, a Canadian man who recently traveled to West Africa was hospitalized, sparking some speculation that the virus had made its way to the Americas. Since then, however, tests have determined that he’s not actually infected with the deadly virus. In response to that scare, the CDC has developed guidelines in case an infected traveler brings Ebola to the U.S.', 'Health officials are warning that Guinea is currently facing an “unprecedented epidemic” of the Ebola virus, a highly contagious infectious disease that the country may not have the resources to combat.\nThe Ebola virus was first discovered in the 1970s in central Africa.\nSo far, at least four health care workers have died while working to contain the Ebola outbreak.\nFurthermore, residents of West African nations face significant barriers to health services; some countries in the region average less than ten physicians per 100,000 inhabitants.\nLast week, a Canadian man who recently traveled to West Africa was hospitalized, sparking some speculation that the virus had made its way to the Americas.']"

Residents of West Africa are already terrified, but anyone who has read ""The Hot Zone"" fears it will only get worse.\n\nThe symptoms of Ebola often include uncontrollable bleeding, and the deadliest strains of the virus kill up to 90% of people infected. Yet most outbreaks are successfully contained. Is the current outbreak any different?\n\nFundamentally, Ebola is easy to contain. It\'s not a question of needing high technology. It\'s about respecting the basics of hygiene, and about isolation, quarantine and protecting yourself - in particular protecting healthcare workers, because they are very exposed.\n\nThe first thing to realize: It\'s not that easily spread. Peter Piot, one of the the scientists who discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, has emphasized that it\'s not like a highly contagious flu. As he wrote in The Independent\n\nIt\'s really ""a disease of poverty and neglect of health systems,"" he writes. It often spreads when hospital workers or mourners come into contact with bodily fluids like blood and vomit, when hospitals use unsanitized needles, or when people handle or eat the meat of infected animals, like bats.\n\nBut part of what makes this Ebola outbreak alarming is that recent outbreaks have been in East Africa, and no one can say why it is suddenly in West Africa.\n\n""This is a virus that is highly unpredictable,"" Piot told Reuters. ""This time it popped up in Guinea where it has never been detected before. Why there? Why now?""\n\nEbola\'s emergence in East Africa and its spread to Conakry is a cause for serious concern - the virus does not usually ""jump"" from place to place. But right now there\'s not yet reason to fear that it will not be successfully contained, especially with international effort now focused on doing just that. A suspected case of a Canadian who had recently travelled to Liberia turned out to be a false alarm, for example.\n\nAt this point, Guinea says it has isolated those infected.', 'Guinea is battling to contain an outbreak of Ebola, which currently includes 122 suspected cases and 78 deaths , not all of which are confirmed to be the deadly virus.\nResidents of West Africa are already terrified, but anyone who has read ""The Hot Zone"" fears it will only get worse.\nThe symptoms of Ebola often include uncontrollable bleeding, and the deadliest strains of the virus kill up to 90% of people infected.\nPeter Piot, one of the the scientists who discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, has emphasized that it\'s not like a highly contagious flu.\nBut part of what makes this Ebola outbreak alarming is that recent outbreaks have been in East Africa, and no one can say why it is suddenly in West Africa.']"

It has now spread to the densely populated capital of Conakry after an infected person traveled there, proposing a greater risk than when the virus was limited to the country’s less crowded villages. Senegal also closed its border with Guinea to prevent disease spread, and will implement sanitary checks on flights between Guinea’s capital and Dakar.\n\nNearly six weeks passed before authorities began to identify the outbreak as Ebola, allowing for the virus to spread. As of Friday, 24 samples have tested positive for Ebola, with two confirmed cases in Liberia, and suspected cases in Sierra Leone. The patients in both Sierra Leone and Liberia had traveled to Guinea.\n\nWhen victims contract Ebola, they experience fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. After that, the symptoms advance to vomiting, diarrhea rash, and poor kidney and liver function. Sometimes a patient will also experience internal and external bleeding. As TIME reported last week, there is no known cure or vaccine for Ebola; symptoms can only be managed. Typically patients are dehydrated, so they are given oral or intravenous fluid containing electrolytes. They are also quarantined so that they don’t infect others. Most of the time the virus is contained because patients die relatively quickly, making it difficult for the disease to travel too far, too quickly.\n\n“An Ebola outbreak is always something of concern because it’s highly contagious and we don’t have a vaccine,” says WHO media spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic in Guinea. “On the other hand, we know this disease. It’s not the first time we’ve seen it so we know the measures we can take. It’s not a new disease.”\n\nJasarevic says clinical management is the first priority for containing the disease, followed by disease surveillance. “We need to find the people who have been infected. Incubation is a few days, so we need to check who infected people have come in contact with, find those people, and see how they feel.”\n\nWHO is helping to coordinate outbreak control in Guinea by offering expertise, clinical care, laboratory diagnosis, and data management. They have also brought two labs to Guinea to diagnose samples. Treatments and vaccines are currently under development, but most have not been tested in humans and it could be a long time before any are proven effective.\n\nThe original host of Ebola is unknown, but it most likely came from an animal. Bats are generally considered to be the culprit. Humans become infected from contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected animals. Human-to-human transmission is harder, but possible through contact with bodily fluids of infected people. Health workers without proper protection, as well as people in burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with bodies, are at risk.\n\n“We are telling the people here that, yes, this disease is dangerous and we don’t have a treatment, but you can protect yourself and we are working with health authorities to implement measures we know are effective,” says Jasarevic.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.', 'Health officials in the West African country of Guinea report that the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever has killed a suspected 78 people.\nSenegal also closed its border with Guinea to prevent disease spread, and will implement sanitary checks on flights between Guinea’s capital and Dakar.\nNearly six weeks passed before authorities began to identify the outbreak as Ebola, allowing for the virus to spread.\nAs of Friday, 24 samples have tested positive for Ebola, with two confirmed cases in Liberia, and suspected cases in Sierra Leone.\n“An Ebola outbreak is always something of concern because it’s highly contagious and we don’t have a vaccine,” says WHO media spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic in Guinea.']"

A new report from heath authorities in Guinea where the outbreak began and is centered, now puts the confirmed Ebola death toll at 78, up from 70 over the weekend, with two additional Ebola deaths now confirmed in neighboring Liberia, as the disease spreads at an alarming rate.\n\nOn March 5, the Canada-based pharmaceutical company Tekmira announced that its potential Ebola cure now known as TKM-Ebola had received fast-track status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The anti-viral drug has proved to be a cure for Ebola when tested on monkeys infected with the “Zaire strain” of Ebola.\n\nThe highly lethal Zaire strain, researchers believe, is the virus responsible for the current West Africa Ebola outbreak. But in clinical trials, the Tekmira Ebola cure allowed all of the infected monkeys who received the drug to survive, according to the company’s own literature.\n\nWith no cure available, an Ebola outbreak can have a fatality rate as high as 90 percent. The current outbreak at last report was running at a 64 percent fatality rate.\n\nBut even though the Tekmira Ebola cure and several other Ebola drugs are in the works, there is currently no confirmed cure for Ebola, or vaccine to prevent the virus from causing the deadly and grotesque Ebola Hemmorrhagic Fever disease. That’s simply because drugmakers see no money in it.\n\nFrightening as they are, Ebola outbreaks — which have been known for only 40 years — are rare. They usually affect only impoverished areas of Africa and because they are so lethal, patients tend to die before they can travel and spread the virus, so an outbreak generally burns out after a short period.\n\n“If you count all the cases of Ebola since the discovery, it’s below 10,000, so it’s definitely not of commercial interest,” said Stephan Guenther of Germany’s Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine.\n\nThe Tekmira Ebola cure is being developed under a $140 million contract with the U.S. Defense Department, which fears Ebola could be used as a biological warfare weapon. The Center For Disease Control and Prevention lists Ebola along with smallpox and anthrax as “Class A” bioterrorism agent.\n\nThe San Diego-based company Mapp Biopharmaceutical is developing a similar drug with money from the Defense Deprtament and the National Institute of Health. The Mapp Ebola cure, MB-003 is a “cocktail” of antibodies which in trials prevented all Ebola-infected monkeys from dying if they were given the drug within an hour after exposure to the Ebola virus.\n\nOf monkeys that received the Mapp drug within 48 hours, two of every three survived.\n\nOver the weekend, the Ebola outbreak reached the teeming Guinea capital of Conakry, a congested city of 2 million, when an infected patient and his family traveled there looking for health care — raising the specter of an outbreak that could spiral out of control and even reach beyond Africa’s shores. With the West Africa Ebola outbreak already called “an epidemic of a magnitude never before seen,” by Mariano Lugli of Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, the race for an Ebola cure has taken on a whole new urgency.', 'The anti-viral drug has proved to be a cure for Ebola when tested on monkeys infected with the “Zaire strain” of Ebola.\nThe highly lethal Zaire strain, researchers believe, is the virus responsible for the current West Africa Ebola outbreak.\nWith no cure available, an Ebola outbreak can have a fatality rate as high as 90 percent.\nBut even though the Tekmira Ebola cure and several other Ebola drugs are in the works, there is currently no confirmed cure for Ebola, or vaccine to prevent the virus from causing the deadly and grotesque Ebola Hemmorrhagic Fever disease.\nThe Tekmira Ebola cure is being developed under a $140 million contract with the U.S. Defense Department, which fears Ebola could be used as a biological warfare weapon.']"

By the end of the week, there will be around sixty international field workers who have experience in working on haemorrhagic fever divided between Conakry and south-east of the country.\n\nAmong the field workers are doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, water and sanitation experts as well as anthropologists. In addition, more than 40 tons of equipment have been flown into the country to try to curb the spread of the disease.\n\n“MSF has intervened in almost all reported Ebola outbreaks in recent years, but they were much more geographically contained and involved more remote locations. This geographical spread is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic,” said Lugli.\n\nIsolation the only way to break chain of tranmission\n\nIn Conakry, MSF has strengthened the support for the isolation of patients located at the referral hospital of Donka, in collaboration with the Guinean health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO). Other patients in other health structures are still hospitalised in non-optimal conditions and isolation must be reinforced in the coming days.\n\nThe teams are also looking for a suitable place to set up a new structure to further support local health authorities. At the same time, MSF has already begun to identify people who may have been in contact with existing patients. The search for potential new patients, and if necessary, their isolation is the only way to break the chain of transmission of the virus. There is currently no vaccine against or treatment for Ebola.\n\nIn the last two weeks in the southeast of the country, in the towns of Guekedou and Macenta, MSF rapidly deployed teams and established two structures for the isolation of patients. Raising awareness and identifying new cases is ongoing with the help of the community. In this region, the isolation of patients who have been identified will help control the spread of the virus.\n\n'most aggressive and deadly strain of virus'\n\n“In Guinea, it is the Zaire strain of Ebola virus. This is the most aggressive and deadly. It kills more than 9 out of 10 patients,” said Michel Van Herp, an MSF epidemiologist currently in Guekedou.\n\n“To stop the outbreak, it is important to trace the chain of transmission. All contacts of patients likely to have been contaminated should be monitored and isolated at the first sign of infection.”\n\nTo date, Guinean health authorities have recorded 122 suspected patients and 78 deaths. Other cases, suspected or diagnosed, were found in Sierra Leone and Liberia.\n\n“It is important that the Guinean authorities and the WHO help medical facilities put in place all necessary hygiene measures,” said Van Herp."", ""Conakry / Brussels / Geneva, 31 March 2014 – With eight confirmed cases of Ebola reported in the capital Conakry, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is facing an unprecedented epidemic in terms of the distribution of cases now scattered in several locations in Guinea.\nThis geographical spread is worrisome because it will greatly complicate the tasks of the organisations working to control the epidemic,” said Lugli.\nThe teams are also looking for a suitable place to set up a new structure to further support local health authorities.\nIn this region, the isolation of patients who have been identified will help control the spread of the virus.\n'most aggressive and deadly strain of virus'“In Guinea, it is the Zaire strain of Ebola virus.""]"

People who ate at least seven portions of fruit and vegetables each day were 42 per cent less likely to die from any cause over the course of the study.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that canned and frozen fruit increased the risk of dying by 17 per cent, and fruit juice was found to have no significant benefit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe findings suggest that the five-a-day recommendation, suggested by the World Health Organisation and backed by the Government and NHS, is not adequate - although only 30 per cent of people manage to eat that amount.\n\nExperts said that even seven-a-day was not enough and that 10 would be the optimum number, as the protective effect continued to increase with higher consumption.\n\nThe study’s lead author, Dr Oyinlola Oyebode of UCL’s department of epidemiology and public health, said: ‘‘The clear message here is that the more fruit and vegetables you eat, the less likely you are to die at any age. My advice would be, however much you are eating now, eat more.’’\n\nHealth experts called on the Government to subsidise the cost of fruit and vegetables, which they suggested could be paid for by taxing sugary foods.\n\nThe five-a-day guidelines were based on World Health Organisation recommendations issued in 1990, which advised consuming 400g of fruit and vegetables each day to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, type-two diabetes and obesity.\n\nProf Simon Capewell, of the department of public health at the University of Liverpool, said the advice should be 10 portions a day. ‘‘Humans are designed to be omnivorous: a handful of nuts, seeds, fruit and the occasional antelope. We’re not meant to be eating junk food.’’\n\nResearchers examined the eating habits of 65,000 people in England between 2001 and 2013.\n\nThey found that seven helpings a day of fruit or vegetables could reduce a person’s overall risk of premature death by 42 per cent when compared with people who ate just one whole portion.\n\nPeople who ate between five and seven portions a day had a 36 per cent reduced risk of death, those who ate three to five portions had a 29 per cent decreased risk and those who ate one to three helpings had a 14 per cent reduced risk.\n\nThose with the highest intakes were also 25 per cent less likely to die from cancer and 31 per cent less likely to die from heart disease.\n\n‘‘We need to urgently examine seriously the proposal to increase recommended intake to seven a day,’’ said Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. ‘‘To implement a seven-a-day message would be really challenging for many in society and would require governmental support such as subsidising the cost of fruit and vegetables, perhaps by taxing sugar-rich foods.’’\n\nThe study also found that vegetables were far more beneficial than fruit.

However, each piece of fruit only lowered the chance of death by 4 per cent.\n\nThe authors said the findings lent support to the Australian government’s advice of ‘‘two plus five’’ a day, which encourages people to eat two helpings of fruit and five of vegetables.

Turns out eating one apple isn\'t enough. A new study suggests people who eat up to seven servings of fruit and vegetables a day can cut their risk of premature death by 42% - and that vegetables may be more important than fruit to your overall health.\n\nThe study, conducted by scientists in the United Kingdom, was published online Monday in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.\n\nThe study\n\nResearchers looked at data from more than 65,000 adults over age 35 who participated in the Healthy Surveys for England study between 2001 and 2008.\n\n\n\nHSE surveyors had asked participants about their fruit and vegetable consumption during a 24-hour time period. Portion sizes were defined by the UK\'s Department of Health to be about 80 grams (equivalent to just under 3 ounces). The new study authors compared this nutrition information to mortality data for the group over the following eight or so years.\n\nThe results\n\nThe participants ate an average of 3.8 servings of fruit and vegetables per day. Older, non-smoking women tended to eat more than other demographic groups. Produce consumption was also linked to participants\' body mass indexes; those who ate more fruit and vegetables tended to have a lower BMI.\n\nThe researchers found that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables can be protective against cancer, heart disease and all other causes of death. Eating at least seven servings was best, but each serving increase was associated with a lower risk of death.\n\nTo make sure they weren\'t counting people who were seriously ill at the time of the survey, researchers excluded deaths that occurred in the year following the data collection. When they did so, they found that people who ate at least seven daily servings of fruit and vegetables had a 42% lower risk of death from all causes during the study\'s follow-up period than those who ate less than one daily serving.\n\nWhen researchers broke it down by cause of death, veggie lovers had a 25% lower risk of dying from cancer, and a 31% lower risk of dying from heart disease or stroke during that same period.\n\nVegetables seemed to provide a greater health benefit than fruit. Eating more than three or four servings of fruit daily didn\'t increase a study participant\'s chance of survival, the study authors concluded.\n\nStudy limits\n\nHSE surveyors only recorded one day of each study particpant\'s fruit and vegetable consumption. On that day, the participant could have eaten more or less produce than they would normally consume.\n\nResearchers also did not include participants\' total caloric intake, salt consumption or fat consumption in their analysis.\n\nAs the study authors say, their data shows a ""strong association, but not necessarily a causal relationship.""\n\nTakeaway\n\nEat more vegetables. Even if you, like many of the study participants, believe you\'re eating an overall healthy diet, you ""need to aim higher,"" according to an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nThis study follows previous research presented at the American College of Cardiology\'s annual session last week. Dr. Michael Miedema and his colleagues found that women who ate eight to nine servings of fruit and vegetables in their 20s were 40% less likely to have dangerous plaque in their arteries in their 40s.\n\n""There is value in knowing how the choices we make early in life have lifelong benefits,"" Miedema said in a press release.\n\nSo fill up on salad.

These volunteers answered questions about their eating habits. This, in turn, revealed that those who ate more fruit and vegetables were less likely to die than those who didn\'t eat greens.\n\nYet not all vegetables and fruit are created equal, according to Saga. It turns out that fresh or dried fruit is best; tinned and frozen fruit, in contrast, actually increases the risk of death by 17 percent. In addition, salad particularly was useful in lowering death risk; it contributed to a 13 percent risk reduction per portion, according to the Financial Express.

""Whatever your starting point, it is always worth eating more fruit and vegetables.""\n\nVegetables trump fruit?\n\nEach daily serving of fresh vegetables was linked with a 16-percent reduction in a person\'s risk of dying, while each serving of fresh fruit was linked with a 4-percent reduction in risk of death.\n\n""Vegetables have a larger effect than fruit, but fruit still makes a real difference,"" Oyebode said.\n\nHowever, each serving of canned or frozen fruit increased the risk of death by 17 percent. Because the researchers did not distinguish between frozen and canned fruit, they cannot say whether one or both types of fruit were responsible for the effect. However, they noted that canned fruit is much more popular than frozen fruit in Europe.\n\nThe high levels of sugar found in canned fruit may outweigh the benefits of the fruit, Oyebode said.\n\nStill, the researchers noted the study found associations, and cannot prove that fruits and vegetables were solely responsible for the reduced risk of death, or that canned fruit increases the risk of death. The study did not take into account people\'s total calorie intake or salt consumption, which may affect the link.\n\nIt\'s also possible that people with poor access to fresh fruit and vegetables experience other factors that increase their risk of dying, such as health conditions or stressful lives, the researchers said.\n\nPolicy implications\n\nThe findings agree with dietary recommendations in the United States, which say that people who eat 2,000 calories daily should consume nearly nine servings of fruits and vegetables (2 cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables, with a half-cup being one serving), according to Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nHowever, people\'s actual consumption of fruits and vegetables often falls short of guidelines. In the study, people in England said they ate just under four servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and a 2013 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that Americans eat less than three portions a day.\n\n""With increasing evidence of their health benefits, policy-makers may need to consider broader initiatives to promote fruit and vegetable consumption, particularly vegetables and salad,"" the researchers wrote March 31 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.\n\nIn order to help individuals in poor areas, policies should seek not only to educate people, but also to increase access to fruits and vegetables, the researchers said.\n\nCopyright 2014 LiveScience, a TechMediaNetwork company.

Or needing a drink.\n\nThank goodness that some pieces of dietary advice never change. ""Get your five a day"" is as sure and as steady as health advice can be – after all, it\'s based on solid scientific facts, right?\n\nA study examining how fruit and veg consumption affects mortality could be about to slay a sacred cow of food advice, suggesting five portions of fruit and veg a day is just not a high enough target.\n\nFirst of all, a mea culpa: as a food scientist, I and some of my colleagues can sometimes be the source of this confusing advice. By publishing articles examining the various benefits of different diets, foods and nutrients, we inadvertently provide a stream of material to feed the hunger for food fads.\n\nVery often, these ideas are based on good scientific results, but when our scientific language is turned into the stuff real people can understand, some of the caveats, the warnings and the uncertainties get lost in translation.\n\nThere\'s little doubt with this one – this is a really excellent study. It may seem like a no-brainer to suggest that eating more fruit and vegetables is good for you. Indeed, lots of work has been done to link high-fruit-and-veg diets with a lowered risk of cardiovascular disease, which can cause heart attacks or strokes. But this is one of the first studies to show clearly that a diet high in fruit and vegetables lowers the risk of premature death.\n\nThere are some unanswered questions: the researchers raise an interesting perspective – that people who ate more frozen or tinned fruit seemed more likely to die than those who ate less. Cue another odd piece of advice: ""Tinned fruit causes death"", perhaps? Well, no. The question arises because of the method used. The researchers were not able to distinguish between the two, making it impossible to make a distinction in later analyses.\n\nPerhaps more significantly is the suggestion that this is the end of five-a-day. Of course, those who have lived abroad will tell you it is not a hard-and-fast rule. In Denmark it\'s six. In Canada they suggest between seven and 10. In Japan, it\'s 17.\n\nMost British people don\'t even eat five portions a day. Be honest: how many did you have yesterday? The average is two portions of fruit and 1.5 of vegetables. So any efforts that will encourage people to eat more fruit and veg are welcome.\n\nBut messing with the sacred cows of health advice is dangerous: we run the risk of undermining the strength of such messages. If officials change advice every time there is new health data, the risk is that scientists begin to lose credibility and people who are most in need of improving their diet give up.\n\nGunter Kuhnle is a lecturer in nutritional biochemistry at the University of Reading', '""Get your five a day"" is as sure and as steady as health advice can be – after all, it\'s based on solid scientific facts, right?\nA study examining how fruit and veg consumption affects mortality could be about to slay a sacred cow of food advice, suggesting five portions of fruit and veg a day is just not a high enough target.\nVery often, these ideas are based on good scientific results, but when our scientific language is turned into the stuff real people can understand, some of the caveats, the warnings and the uncertainties get lost in translation.\nIt may seem like a no-brainer to suggest that eating more fruit and vegetables is good for you.\nBut messing with the sacred cows of health advice is dangerous: we run the risk of undermining the strength of such messages.']"

Public health experts suggest today in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health that the UK’s ‘five-a-day’ target is outdated and could even be amended to ‘ten-a-day’.\n\n\n\nResearchers at University College London analysed data on 65,226 participants aged at least 35 years in the 2001-08 Health Surveys for England, to examine the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular mortality. Mean daily intake was less than four portions – just 2.3 of fruit and 1.5 of vegetables – and only a quarter of people ate at least five portions.\n\n\n\nAfter adjusting for age, sex, social class, education, body mass index, alcohol consumption and physical activity, they found that the more fruit and vegetables people ate, the lower the all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular mortality. People who ate at least seven portions of fruit and vegetables daily had 42% lower all-cause mortality, 31% lower CVD mortality, and 25% lower cancer mortality than people who ate less than one portion daily (excluding deaths within a year of baseline); increasing vegetable and salad intake had a greater effect than increasing fruit intake.\n\n\n\nThe study authors said: “Fruit and vegetable consumption was significantly associated with reductions in cancer and CVD mortality, with increasing benefits being seen with up to more than seven portions of fruit and vegetables daily for the latter. Consumption of vegetables appeared to be significantly better than similar quantities of fruit. When different types of fruit and vegetable were examined separately, increased consumption of portions of vegetables, salad, fresh and dried fruit showed significant associations with lower mortality.”\n\n\n\nHowever, they added that people who ate more frozen/canned fruit had significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality. Doctors from the Division of Public Health and Policy at the University of Liverpool suggest in their commentary** that this could be because the data didn’t separately record frozen and tinned fruit, and processed fruit tends to have a higher sugar content.\n\n\n\nThey also call for a revision of current dietary guidance, which counts high-sugar foods such as dried and canned fruit, smoothies and juices as part of the 5-a-day target. They write: “The beneficial effect on CVD specific mortality was dose-related, with no obvious threshold up to more than seven portions.

Alarmingly for some who thought they were doing the right thing, tinned and frozen fruit may not be helpful at all.\n\nThe latest wisdom – guaranteed to raise a groan from those already perplexed over stories of suspect sugars and dodgy fats – arises from a study carried out by experts at University College London, who analysed the eating habits of 65,000 people, revealed through eight years of the Health Survey for England, and matched them with causes of death.\n\nThe clear finding was that eating more fresh fruit and vegetables, including salads, was linked to living a longer life generally and in particular, to a lower chance of death from heart disease, stroke and cancer.\n\nEating at least seven portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day was linked to a 42% lower risk of death from all causes. It was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cancer and 31% lower risk of heart disease or stroke. Vegetables seemed to be significantly more protection against disease than eating fruit, they say.\n\nThere was a surprise finding – people who ate canned or frozen fruit actually had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer.\n\nThe authors, Dr Oyinlola Oyebode and colleagues from the department of epidemiology and public health at UCL, said they were unsure how to interpret the findings on canned or frozen fruit . It could be that people eating canned fruit may not live in areas where there is fresh fruit in the shops, which could indicate a poorer diet.\n\nAlternatively, they could be people who are already in ill-health or they could lead hectic lifestyles. There is also another possibility: frozen and tinned fruit were grouped together in the questions, but while frozen fruit is considered to be nutritionally the same as fresh, tinned fruit is stored in syrup containing extra sugar. More work needs to be done to see whether sweetened, tinned fruit is in fact the issue, the researchers say.\n\nOyebode and colleagues took into account the socio-economic background, smoking habits and other lifestyle factors that affect people\'s health. What they have found, they say, is a strong association between high levels of fruit and vegetable consumption and lower premature death rates – not a causal relationship.\n\nBut the strength of the study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, is in the big numbers and the fact that the data comes from the real world – not a collection of individuals who had a particular health condition or occupation, but a random selection.\n\nThe ""five a day"" advice was launched by the government in 2003, after the World Health Organisation advised in 1990 that our minimum daily intake of fruit and vegetables should be 400g a day.\n\nFrance and Germany also recommend five a day, while the US abandoned the numbers in favour of a ""fruit and veggies – more matters"" campaign in 2007. But Australia advises people to eat substantially more. In 2005, the Australian government launched ""Go for 2+5"", meaning two 150g portions of fruit and five 75g portions of vegetables. That is 675g, the equivalent in the UK of 8.5 portions.\n\nOyebode said she thought the Australian example was probably the one to follow. ""I think it makes a lot of sense,"" she said. ""It is aiming for more and the balance is two fruit and five veg. From our study it looks like vegetables are better than fruit. But I don\'t feel very strongly that the guidelines should be changed because the majority of people know they should eat five a day and only 25% manage that.""\n\nChanges in policy, she said, would be needed to improve the UK score. ""Anything that could increase the accessibility and affordability of fruit and vegetables would be very helpful, such as working with corner shops to make sure they stock them,"" she said. Petrol stations could also offer fruit and vegetables and maybe the Healthy Start scheme – which gives families on less than £16,000 vouchers for fruit and vegetables – could be extended.\n\nOther experts agreed that the study was sound and representative of the population, but cautioned that in a study of the habits of people in the real world, it is hard to take full account of complications, such as education, smoking habits and people failing to tell the exact truth about their diet. ""A key outstanding question is whether this [reduced risk of disease] is entirely attributable to these specific foods, or whether they are acting as a marker of a broader dietary pattern associated with improved health,"" said Professor Susan Jebb of the Nuffield department of primary care health sciences, University of Oxford.', 'Alarmingly for some who thought they were doing the right thing, tinned and frozen fruit may not be helpful at all.\nEating at least seven portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day was linked to a 42% lower risk of death from all causes.\nIt was also associated with a 25% lower risk of cancer and 31% lower risk of heart disease or stroke.\nThere is also another possibility: frozen and tinned fruit were grouped together in the questions, but while frozen fruit is considered to be nutritionally the same as fresh, tinned fruit is stored in syrup containing extra sugar.\nMore work needs to be done to see whether sweetened, tinned fruit is in fact the issue, the researchers say.']"

76055,http://gulfnews.com/news/world/make-that-seven-portions-a-day-and-mostly-vegetables-1.1312230,health,"['London: Five portions of fruit and vegetables a day — a familiar mantra for those concerned about their own and their children’s health — may not, after all, be enough, according to a new report by scientists, who suggest we should instead be aiming for seven a day, and mostly vegetables at that. Alarmingly for some who thought they were doing the right thing, tinned and frozen fruit may not be helpful at all.\n\nThe latest wisdom — guaranteed to raise a groan from those already perplexed over stories of suspect sugars and dodgy fats — arises from a study carried out by experts at University College London, who analysed the eating habits of 65,000 people, revealed through eight years of the Health Survey for England, and matched them with causes of death.\n\nThe clear finding was that eating more fresh fruit and vegetables, including salads, was linked to living a longer life generally and in particular, to a lower chance of death from heart disease, stroke and cancer.\n\nEating at least seven portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day was linked to a 42 per cent lower risk of death from all causes. It was also associated with a 25 per cent lower risk of cancer and 31 per cent lower risk of heart disease or stroke. Vegetables seemed to be significantly more protection against disease than eating fruit, they say.\n\nThere was a surprise finding — people who ate canned or frozen fruit actually had a higher risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer.\n\nThe authors, Dr Oyinlola Oyebode and colleagues from the department of epidemiology and public health at UCL, said they were unsure how to interpret the findings on canned or frozen fruit. It could be that people eating canned fruit may not live in areas where there is fresh fruit in the shops, which could indicate a poorer diet.\n\nAlternatively, they could be people who are already in ill health or they could lead hectic lifestyles. There is also another possibility: frozen and tinned fruit were grouped together in the questions, but while frozen fruit is considered to be nutritionally the same as fresh, tinned fruit is stored in syrup containing extra sugar. More work needs to be done to see whether sweetened, tinned fruit is in fact the issue, the researchers say.\n\nOyebode and colleagues took into account the socioeconomic background, smoking habits and other lifestyle factors that affect people’s health. What they have found, they say, is a strong association between high levels of fruit and vegetable consumption and lower premature death rates — not a causal relationship.\n\nBut the strength of the study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, is in the big numbers and the fact that the data comes from the real world — not a collection of individuals who had a particular health condition or occupation, but a random selection.\n\nThe “five a day” advice was launched by the government in 2003, after the World Health Organisation advised in 1990 that our minimum daily intake of fruit and vegetables should be 400g a day.\n\nFrance and Germany also recommend five a day, while the US abandoned the numbers in favour of a “fruit and veggies — more matters” campaign in 2007. But Australia advises people to eat substantially more. In 2005, the Australian government launched “Go for 2+5”, meaning two 150g portions of fruit and five 75g portions of vegetables. That is 675g, the equivalent in the UK of 8.5 portions.\n\nOyebode said she thought the Australian example was probably the one to follow. “I think it makes a lot of sense,” she said. “It is aiming for more and the balance is two fruit and five veg. From our study it looks like vegetables are better than fruit. But I don’t feel very strongly that the guidelines should be changed because the majority of people know they should eat five a day and only 25 per cent manage that.”\n\nChanges in policy, she said, would be needed to improve the UK score. “Anything that could increase the accessibility and affordability of fruit and vegetables would be very helpful, such as working with corner shops to make sure they stock them,” she said. Petrol stations could also offer fruit and vegetables and maybe the Healthy Start scheme — which gives families on less than £16,000 vouchers for fruit and vegetables — could be extended.\n\nOther experts agreed that the study was sound and representative of the population, but cautioned that in a study of the habits of people in the real world, it is hard to take full account of complications, such as education, smoking habits and people failing to tell the exact truth about their diet. “A key outstanding question is whether this [reduced risk of disease] is entirely attributable to these specific foods, or whether they are acting as a marker of a broader dietary pattern associated with improved health,” said Professor Susan Jebb of the Nuffield department of primary care health sciences, University of Oxford.', 'London: Five portions of fruit and vegetables a day — a familiar mantra for those concerned about their own and their children’s health — may not, after all, be enough, according to a new report by scientists, who suggest we should instead be aiming for seven a day, and mostly vegetables at that.\nEating at least seven portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day was linked to a 42 per cent lower risk of death from all causes.\nIt was also associated with a 25 per cent lower risk of cancer and 31 per cent lower risk of heart disease or stroke.\nThere is also another possibility: frozen and tinned fruit were grouped together in the questions, but while frozen fruit is considered to be nutritionally the same as fresh, tinned fruit is stored in syrup containing extra sugar.\nIn 2005, the Australian government launched “Go for 2+5”, meaning two 150g portions of fruit and five 75g portions of vegetables.']"

""Fruit and veggies - more matters"" is the key message in the US, while Australia adopts a ""Go for 2 + 5"" slogan that encourages people to eat five vegetables and two pieces of fruit a day.\n\nIn the UK, where the new study by researchers from University College London (UCL) was carried out, the Department of Health recommends ""Five-a-day.""\n\nBut the findings of the new study are so persuasive, that the authors are pushing for the UK Department of Health to rethink their recommended intake of five-a-day.\n\n""We all know that eating fruit and vegetables is healthy, but the size of the effect is staggering,"" says lead author Dr. Oyinlola Oyebode, of UCL\'s Department of Epidemiology & Public Health.\n\nDr. Oyebode and her team analyzed lifestyle data from annual national health surveys for England between 2001 and 2008. The data of more than 65,000 randomly selected people aged 35 and over went into the study.\n\nOn average, survey respondents reported eating just under four portions of fruit and vegetables the previous day. During the monitoring period of the study, 4,399 of the tracked people (6.7% of the sample) had died.\n\nSeven portions of fruit or veg a day led to 42% lower risk of death\n\nShare on Pinterest Eating 2-3 portions of vegetables a day was linked with 19% lower risk of death, while an equivalent intake of fruit only provided a 10% lower risk of death.\n\nThe researchers worked out what effect fruit and vegetable intake had on the respondents\' risk of death. They found that people who ate at least seven portions a day had a 42% lower risk of death from all causes.\n\nThe seven-a-day group specifically also had a 31% lower risk of death caused by heart disease and stroke, and a 25% lower risk of death from cancer.\n\nVegetables seem to offer more protective benefits than fruit. Eating 2-3 portions of vegetables a day was linked with 19% lower risk of death, while an equivalent intake of fruit only provided a 10% lower risk of death.\n\nThe researchers found that the protective benefits of fruit extend to fresh and dried fruit, but not frozen or tinned fruit, which actually increased risk of death by an alarming 17%. The researchers hypothesize that the added sugars in processed fruit are behind this jump in risk.\n\nThe study also did not detect any significant benefit from fruit juice.\n\n""I am not sure why there was no direct benefit found from fruit juice,"" Dr. Oyebode told Medical News Today. ""Certainly fruit juice is full of micronutrients and currently in the UK we are advised that we can count up to one portion of fruit juice towards our five-a-day.""\n\n""Other experts have suggested that due to the lack of fiber and high sugar content in fruit juice, it should no longer be considered healthy. Our results do suggest that fruit juice doesn\'t offer the same health benefits that fresh and dried fruit offer and this may add weight to the opinion that it should not count toward the five-a-day.""\n\nConsequently, Dr. Oyebode argues that the UK\'s five-a-day guideline - which also includes tinned fruit and smoothies as valid components of the diet - needs to be revised.\n\nHow can policy changes encourage us to eat more fruit and veggies?\n\nHowever, Dr. Oyebode told us that the Australian ""Go for 2 + 5"" guideline may not be effective in the UK, as currently the majority of UK adults already eat less fruit and vegetables than recommended in the UK five-a-day guideline.\n\nShe identifies some other policies that national and local government could use instead to increase fruit and vegetable consumption:\n\nWorking to ensure access to fruit and vegetables (""There are sometimes few shops selling fresh produce in deprived areas, so-called \'food deserts,\'"" said Dr. Oyebode)\n\nWorking with retailers so that cheaper fruit and vegetables are prominently displayed\n\nRegulation or monitoring of school food contracts to ensure that children are exposed to and develop a taste for fruit and vegetables\n\nRegulation or monitoring of workplace catering contracts\n\nNegotiating with fast food providers to include a piece of fruit with each meal as standard.\n\n""I am not a policy expert,"" Dr. Oyebode said, ""but we know that health education tends to be followed by people who already take good care of their health. Those who are most vulnerable, most disadvantaged and most at risk are probably not currently eating five-a-day and will not eat more just because the government changes its message to seven-a-day.""\n\nRecently, Medical News Today reported on research demonstrating that updated US Department of Agriculture guidelines on school lunches had resulted in a significant increase in fruit and vegetable consumption in American students.', 'Recommendations for how many portions of fruit and vegetables people should eat varies from country to country.\nSeven portions of fruit or veg a day led to 42% lower risk of deathShare on Pinterest Eating 2-3 portions of vegetables a day was linked with 19% lower risk of death, while an equivalent intake of fruit only provided a 10% lower risk of death.\nThey found that people who ate at least seven portions a day had a 42% lower risk of death from all causes.\nThe seven-a-day group specifically also had a 31% lower risk of death caused by heart disease and stroke, and a 25% lower risk of death from cancer.\nEating 2-3 portions of vegetables a day was linked with 19% lower risk of death, while an equivalent intake of fruit only provided a 10% lower risk of death.']"

But in a surprising finding, eating tinned and frozen fruit appeared to increase the risk.\n\nCurrent NHS guidance, which is in turn based on advice from the UN’s World Health Organization, states that every person in Britain should try to have five different 80g portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\n\nDownload the new Indpendent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\nExamining the eating habits of 65,000 people in England between 2001 and 2013, the researchers from University College London (UCL) found that people who ate seven or more portions daily had a 42 per cent reduced risk of death overall compared to those who managed just one.\n\nFresh vegetables were found to have the strongest protective effect, followed by salad and then fruit. Overall, vegetables pack more of a protective punch than fruit, the authors said.\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. In an accompanying editorial, public health doctors from the University of Liverpool said the findings prompted the question: “Is it perhaps now time for the UK to update the ‘five a day’ message to ‘ 10 a day’?”\n\nThe doctors added that as a maximum recommended daily amount of fruit and vegetables “could not easily be defined”, the Government’s current five a day guide “might provide a false reassurance and risk complacency” among people who already ate that amount. “They need to aim higher,” they added.\n\n“We all know that eating fruit and vegetables is healthy, but the size of the effect is staggering,” said the study’s lead author Dr Oyinlola Oyebode of UCL’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health. “The clear message here is that the more fruit and vegetables you eat, the less likely you are to die at any age.”\n\nThe research suggested that vegetables are more effective at warding off an early death than fruit. Two to three daily portions of vegetables resulted in a 19 per cent lower risk of death among those studied, compared with 10 per cent for the equivalent amount of fruit.\n\nIn Australia, official health advice encourages people to eat two helpings of fruit and five portions of vegetables a day. The authors said their findings suggested that the “two plus five” diet was a sensible approach.\n\nThe most controversial finding was that tinned and frozen fruit increased a person’s risk of death by 17 per cent, which the authors suggested may be down to the high amounts of sugar contained in many brands, cancelling out the positive effect of the fruit itself.\n\n“Most canned fruit contains high sugar levels and cheaper varieties are packed in syrup rather than fruit juice,” Dr Oyebode said. “The negative health impacts of the sugar may well outweigh any benefits.”\n\nHowever, other scientists raised concerns about reading too much into the link because the researchers were not able to rule out other aggravating factors, such as poor access to fresh groceries or pre-existing health conditions.\n\nDr Gunter Kuhnle, a food scientist from the University of Reading, said: “It’s possible that eating tinned fruits are an indicator of high sugar intake, but it might also be a marker of poverty or lower socioeconomic class.

The higher the intake of fruit and vegetables, the greater the protective effects.\n\nThey found that eating at least seven daily portions was linked to a 42% lower risk of death from all causes, 25% lower for cancer and 31% lower for heart disease or stroke.\n\nThe figures suggested that vegetables may be more protective than fruit, with two or three daily portions linked to a 19% lower risk of death, compared with a 10% lower risk for the equivalent amount of fruit.\n\nThe study findings also implied that even those who do get their recommended quota need to eat more.\n\nThe authors said: “We have shown that those eating seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables daily have the lowest risk of mortality from any cause. The majority of adults knew they were recommended to eat ?ve portions daily but stated barriers to improving their diet including difficulty in changing habits, lack of time, cost, lack of motivation and eating what they were given.\n\n“Even among participants who perceived their own diet as ‘very healthy’, over 50% ate less than ?ve portions of fruit and vegetables daily. Fruit and vegetable consumption is\n\ninversely related to household income. With increasing evidence of their health benefits, policy-makers may need to consider broader initiatives to promote fruit and vegetable consumption.”\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, academics from the Division of Public Health and Policy at the University of Liverpool, said: “Benefits continue to increase up to at least seven a day. Indeed, a maximum recommended amount of daily fruit and vegetable consumption could not easily be defined.\n\n“Consequently, the UK ‘five a day’ campaign offers a target which is pragmatic, but one which might provide a false reassurance and risk complacency in the quarter of the population that already hits this target. They need to aim higher.”\n\nRecent figures show that just a third of adults in Wales reported eating five or more portions of fruit and vegetables the previous day, prompting concerns about increasing the recommendation.\n\nProfessor Peter Elwood, of Cardiff University’s School of Medicine and leader of the 35-year Caerphilly cohort study, which looked at lifestyle changes and their effects on long-term health, said a ‘seven-a-day’ diet may be too difficult for people to follow.\n\nHe said: “Our experience with the Caerphilly cohort study has shown how unlikely it is that anyone will follow a 'seven-a-day' routine.\n\n“When our study started nearly four decades ago, we defined a healthy diet in terms of fruit and vegetable intake, together with less than 30% of calories from fat. A difficulty, however, was that only 15 men out of the 2,500 we studied ate five portions of fruit and vegetables per day. o we had to lower the criterion, and accepted three or more portions as ‘healthy’. People’s attitudes over time haven’t really changed.”\n\nDietitian Sioned Quirke also said she was concerned that increasing the recommendation would be unsuccessful.\n\nShe said: “The recommendation for fruit and vegetables is actually between five and 10 a day, but when the guidelines were first launched it was decided that for the general population we would have to go for the lowest value.\n\n“For some people even five a day is difficult and although I agree that eating seven is probably better for your health, when some people don’t even eat one portion it does seem very unrealistic. When it comes to psychology, the smaller the goal, the easier it is to achieve. For some it is an achievement to have one portion a day but the further you push that target away from their reach then the less likely they will be to try.\n\n“There’s a whole host of benefits that people would get from eating more fruit and vegetables, but it’s only when you start listing what it can prevent that it starts to hit home.\n\n“It’s also not just about the vitamins and minerals either, it’s about the fibre which can help with lots of common, everyday problems.”"", 'The analysis revealed that eating fruit and vegetables was associated with a lower risk of death overall, as well as deaths from heart disease, stroke and cancer.\nThey found that eating at least seven daily portions was linked to a 42% lower risk of death from all causes, 25% lower for cancer and 31% lower for heart disease or stroke.\nThe figures suggested that vegetables may be more protective than fruit, with two or three daily portions linked to a 19% lower risk of death, compared with a 10% lower risk for the equivalent amount of fruit.\nThe authors said: “We have shown that those eating seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables daily have the lowest risk of mortality from any cause.\n“Even among participants who perceived their own diet as ‘very healthy’, over 50% ate less than ?ve portions of fruit and vegetables daily.']"

The research, which involved a 12-year study, also found that vegetables were four times healthier than fruit. The study, by University College London, found that eating large quantities of fruit and vegetables significantly lowered the risk of premature death. People who ate at least seven portions of fruit and vegetables each day were 42 per cent less likely to die from any cause over the course of the study. The researchers also discovered that canned and frozen fruit increased the risk of dying by 17 per cent, and fruit juice was found to have no significant benefit. The findings suggest that the five-a-day recommendation, suggested by the World Health Organisation and backed by the Government and NHS, is not adequate - although only 30 per cent of people manage to eat that amount. Experts said that even seven-a-day was not enough and that 10 would be the optimum number, as the protective effect continued to increase with higher consumption. The study’s lead author, Dr Oyinlola Oyebode of UCL’s department of epidemiology and public health, said: ‘‘The clear message here is that the more fruit and vegetables you eat, the less likely you are to die at any age. My advice would be, however much you are eating now, eat more.’’ Health experts called on the Government to subsidise the cost of fruit and vegetables, which they suggested could be paid for by taxing sugary foods. The five-a-day guidelines were based on World Health Organisation recommendations issued in 1990, which advised consuming 400g of fruit and vegetables each day to lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, type-two diabetes and obesity. Prof Simon Capewell, of the department of public health at the University of Liverpool, said the advice should be 10 portions a day. ‘‘Humans are designed to be omnivorous: a handful of nuts, seeds, fruit and the occasional antelope. We’re not meant to be eating junk food.’’ Researchers examined the eating habits of 65,000 people in England between 2001 and 2013. They found that seven helpings a day of fruit or vegetables could reduce a person’s overall risk of premature death by 42 per cent when compared with people who ate just one whole portion. People who ate between five and seven portions a day had a 36 per cent reduced risk of death, those who ate three to five portions had a 29 per cent decreased risk and those who ate one to three helpings had a 14 per cent reduced risk. Those with the highest intakes were also 25 per cent less likely to die from cancer and 31 per cent less likely to die from heart disease. “This is exciting research in cancer prevention,"" said Australian Cancer Council Nutrition Program Manager, Clare Hughes. ""We know that eating the right amount of fruit and vegetables has a protective effect, but this large scale research shows the more fruit and veg that are consumed, the better chance you have of preventing cancer,” Current Health Statistics show 51% of adults in NSW consume the right amount of fruit, while just 9% eat five serves of vegetables. ‘‘We need to urgently examine seriously the proposal to increase recommended intake to seven a day,’’ said Naveed Sattar, professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow. ‘‘To implement a seven-a-day message would be really challenging for many in society and would require governmental support such as subsidising the cost of fruit and vegetables, perhaps by taxing sugar-rich foods.’’ The study also found that vegetables were far more beneficial than fruit. Each portion of vegetables lowered the risk of death by 16 per cent. However, each piece of fruit only lowered the chance of death by 4 per cent. The authors said the findings lent support to the Australian government’s advice of ‘‘two plus five’’ a day, which encourages people to eat two helpings of fruit and five of vegetables. Dr Alison Tedstone, the group’s director of diet and obesity, said: ‘‘Our focus remains on increasing overall consumption of fruit and vegetables to meet current recommendations.’’ The study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.

So say the authors of a large study, which found that people who ate seven or more portions of fruit and vegetables a day had a lower risk of dying during the seven-year study period than those who ate just five.\n\nWe have long known that people who eat more fruit and vegetables tend to live longer, but not why that is or how much is optimal. According to the World Health Organization, people should aim for 400 grams a day, which the UK government translates into five 80-gram portions.\n\nOyinlola Oyebode of University College London and colleagues looked at data from more than 65,000 adults who had taken part in a large public health survey in England, and linked this to national death records. People were divided into five groups, depending on how many portions of fruit and vegetables the survey showed they had eaten on the day prior to taking the survey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn line with other research, those who reported eating more fruit and vegetables were less likely to die of any cause by the end of the study, after an average period of 7.5 years.\n\nThose who ate the most fruit and vegetables – seven or more portions a day – had a 42 per cent lower risk of death than those who ate less than one portion. Those who ate between five and seven portions had a 36 per cent lower risk.\n\nUpping the intake\n\nBased on the findings, Oyebode says there is a need for more initiatives improving access to affordable fruit and veg, so people increase their intake.\n\nBut Catherine Collins, a dietician at St George’s Hospital in London, says the results may have been biased by the fact that people who eat more fruit and vegetables tend to be more financially well off and have healthier lifestyles in other ways. “I don’t think they can totally exclude [such biases] from their data. So it isn’t necessarily a causal relationship,” she cautions.\n\nAustralia already recommends seven portions a day , and breaks that down into two portions of fruit and five of vegetables. In the US the advice is that about half of your plate of food should consist of fruit and vegetables.\n\nThe study also showed that vegetables carried more health benefits than fruit. So, should the UK raise recommendations from five to seven?\n\nGood fruit, bad fruit\n\nSuch a high target might put unhealthy eaters off altogether, says Collins. But Marion Nestle of New York University says: “This isn’t a matter of it being off-putting or not – it is a matter of what the data show.”\n\nThere are other ways to promote uptake that go beyond portion recommendations, says Oyebode. For instance, working with retailers so that cheaper fruit and vegetables are prominently displayed, and regulating or monitoring school food to ensure that children are exposed to such foods.\n\nThe study also suggested that not all sources of fruit are healthy. People who ate canned or frozen fruit had a higher risk of dying by the end of the study – an extra 17 per cent risk per daily portion.\n\nOyebode says that as it is more common to eat tinned fruit than frozen in the UK, the explanation could be that it often has added sugar. But Collins says that because canned fruit is bought more frequently by those on lower incomes, that might be a statistical anomaly and not a real health effect. It could be that people who eat a lot of canned fruit also eat other processed foods that might be bad for their health.\n\nThe study did not explore the mechanisms behind the health benefits of fruit and veg. It could be down to their vitamin and mineral content. Other explanations include the benefits arising from the fibre content of plants.\n\nJournal reference: Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, DOI: 10.1136/jech-2013-203500', 'The more fruit and veg, the merrier (Image: Hiroshi Watanabe/Getty)Forget five a day – you should be aiming for seven or more portions of fruit and veg.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, people should aim for 400 grams a day, which the UK government translates into five 80-gram portions.\nAustralia already recommends seven portions a day , and breaks that down into two portions of fruit and five of vegetables.\nIt could be that people who eat a lot of canned fruit also eat other processed foods that might be bad for their health.\nThe study did not explore the mechanisms behind the health benefits of fruit and veg.']"

And she said the negative health impacts of the sugar may well outweigh any benefits.\n\nAn accompanying editorial suggests that it may be time for the NHS to rethink the “five-a-day” message – while the authors also suggest it may be time for the NHS to review its guidance on tinned fruit and fruit juice.\n\nBut some have questioned the findings of the research, saying that other dietary factors were not taken into account and those who eat large amounts of fruit and vegetables are likely to have a healthy diet in general.\n\nOthers also raised concerns about the finding on tinned and frozen fruit, saying that in the survey researchers were not able to distinguish between the two.\n\nDr Gunter Kuhnle, food scientist from the University of Reading, said: “The researchers were not able to distinguish between the two in their survey, making it impossible to make a distinction in later analysis.\n\n“It’s possible that eating tinned fruits are an indicator of high sugar intake, but it might also be a marker of poverty or lower socio-economic class. As there is no data, it’s simply not possible to speculate.”', 'EXPERTS are now recommending people eat seven portions of fruit and vegetables a day, instead of just five.\nThe NHS currently advises that every person has five different 80g portions of fruit and vegetables a day.\nBut a new study suggests that eating seven or more helpings of fruit and veg a day can reduce a person’s risk of dying of cancer by 25 per cent.\n“The clear message here is that the more fruit and vegetables you eat, the less likely you are to die at any age.\nVegetables have a larger effect than fruit, but fruit still makes a real difference.']"

Eating seven or more portions reduces the specific risks of death by cancer and heart disease by 25% and 31% respectively. The research also showed that vegetables have significantly higher health benefits than fruit.\n\nThis is the first study to link fruit and vegetable consumption with all-cause, cancer and heart disease deaths in a nationally-representative population, the first to quantify health benefits per-portion, and the first to identify the types of fruit and vegetable with the most benefit.\n\nCompared to eating less than one portion of fruit and vegetables, the risk of death by any cause is reduced by 14% by eating one to three portions, 29% for three to five portions, 36% for five to seven portions and 42% for seven or more. These figures are adjusted for sex, age, cigarette smoking, social class, Body Mass Index, education, physical activity and alcohol intake, and exclude deaths within a year of the food survey.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, found that fresh vegetables had the strongest protective effect, with each daily portion reducing overall risk of death by 16%. Salad contributed to a 13% risk reduction per portion, and each portion of fresh fruit was associated with a smaller but still significant 4% reduction.\n\n""We all know that eating fruit and vegetables is healthy, but the size of the effect is staggering,"" says Dr Oyinlola Oyebode of UCL\'s Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, lead author of the study. ""The clear message here is that the more fruit and vegetables you eat, the less likely you are to die at any age. Vegetables have a larger effect than fruit, but fruit still makes a real difference.

The survey did not distinguish between canned and frozen fruit so this finding is difficult to interpret. Canned fruit products are almost four times more popular than frozen fruit in Europe*, so it is likely that canned fruit dominated this effect.\n\n""Most canned fruit contains high sugar levels and cheaper varieties are packed in syrup rather than fruit juice,"" explains Dr Oyebode.

(GM - Get Report) may be lower today after the House Energy & Commerce Committee released information yesterday from a Delphi Automotive (DLPH) investigation that GM had authorized faulty ignition switches for its 2002 vehicles even though the parts appeared not to meet GM\'s own requirements.\n\nThe shares are down 0.81% to 34.73 in premarket trade.\n\nThis comes before GM CEO Mary Barra is expected to testify before the panel this week about the switches, which have been tied to about 13 deaths.\n\nMust Read: Warren Buffett\'s 10 Favorite Stocks\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months. Learn more.\n\nTheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL MOTORS CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n""We rate GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM) a BUY. This is driven by a few notable strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance and growth in earnings per share. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nDespite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 5.1%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 3.0%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company\'s bottom line, improving the earnings per share.\n\nNet operating cash flow has significantly increased by 291.54% to $3,058.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, GENERAL MOTORS CO has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of 31.31%.\n\nThe debt-to-equity ratio is somewhat low, currently at 0.85, and is less than that of the industry average, implying that there has been a relatively successful effort in the management of debt levels. Although the company had a strong debt-to-equity ratio, its quick ratio of 0.85 is somewhat weak and could be cause for future problems.\n\nThe stock has risen over the past year as investors have generally rewarded the company for its earnings growth and other positive factors like the ones we have cited in this report. The stock\'s price rise over the last year has driven it to a level which is somewhat expensive compared to the rest of its industry. We feel, however, that other strengths this company displays justify these higher price levels.\n\nGENERAL MOTORS CO has improved earnings per share by 5.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, GENERAL MOTORS CO reported lower earnings of $2.35 versus $2.93 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.74 versus $2.35).

However, girls had lower levels of “good cholesterol,” the high-density lipoprotein.

In 2013, more than 90,000 breast lift procedures were performed by ASPS member surgeons.\n\n""Many women are looking for a youthful breast by using the tissue they already have,"" said ASPS President Robert X. Murphy, Jr., MD.\n\nAccording to the new statistics, women between the ages of 30-54 made up nearly 70 percent of the breast lift procedures performed in 2013. ""The breast lift procedure is way up in my practice,"" said Anne Taylor, MD, an ASPS-member plastic surgeon in Columbus, Ohio. ""More women are coming to us who\'ve had children, whose breast volume has decreased and who are experiencing considerable sagging,"" she said. ""For many of them, we are able to get rid of excess skin and lift the breasts back up where they\'re supposed to be.""\n\nKim Beckman of Casstown, Ohio is one of the women who went to Dr. Taylor. ""Childbirth, breastfeeding and aging takes a toll on the body,"" she said. ""I finally decided one morning that I was going to lose weight and get healthy.""\n\nBeckman started eating right and exercising and, even though she lost more than 75 pounds, she still wasn\'t completely satisfied. ""From the waist down, I was happy with what I saw. But from the waist up, I knew that there was still something I needed to do in the chest area.""\n\nLike many women, Beckman had lost volume in her breasts over the years, and after losing weight, had considerable sagging. ""In those situations, there\'s really no other way to get the breast lifted back up without the breast lift surgery,"" said Dr. Taylor.\n\n""The ideal candidate for a breast lift is a woman who has a good amount of breast tissue left, who doesn\'t necessarily want to have implants,"" said Dr. Murphy. ""Many women aren\'t sure if they are a candidate for this type of surgery, but a simple pencil test can tell them if they are,"" he said.\n\nTo perform the pencil test, a woman simply places a pencil under her breast. ""If the breast tissue holds the pencil in place against the chest, that implies that there\'s a hanging nature to the breast that can be fixed with a lift."" said Dr. Murphy.\n\nThough she eventually opted for implants, too, the idea of starting with a surgery that only used her natural tissue appealed to Kim Beckman. ""I\'m a nurse myself,"" said Beckman, ""so I put a lot of consideration into anything medical, especially when it comes to surgical intervention.""\n\n""Now that I\'ve had the procedure, I feel confident. I\'m wearing clothes that I never really thought that I would wear. I\'ve worn a bikini on the beach and I\'m comfortable. I didn\'t feel the need to cover up in a towel or throw on a t-shirt to walk down the beach with my husband. I feel good."" she said.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics from ASPS, fewer than 53,000 breast lifts were performed in 2000. Last year there were 90,006, an increase of 70 percent since 2000, marking the first time that number has eclipsed 90,000.\n\nBreast augmentation remains the most popular plastic surgery procedure for women. In 2013, there were 290,224 breast augmentation surgeries performed by ASPS member surgeons. That represents a growth of 37% since 2000, just under half the rate of breast lifts.\n\n###\n\nFor more statistics on trends in plastic surgery including gender, age, regional, national average fees and other breakouts, refer to the ASPS 2013 National Clearinghouse of Plastic Surgery Procedural Statistics report at PlasticSurgery.org/Stats.

He practiced for weeks with spiky hair but once he showed up to practice with his hair dyed bright pink, the high school junior was promptly barred from West Iron County High School track meets by his coach and then the school’s principal for violating the school’s grooming and appearance policy.\n\nOther students from the school and from neighboring towns have now rallied in support, wearing pink clothing and dying their hair the same color.\n\nIn an email to ABC News, Christopher Thomson, superintendent of the West Iron County Public Schools, wrote: ""[We] support the needs of the students to express themselves, as long as their expression does not interfere with the educational process.

Though her parents approved her shorn locks, Caprock Academy would not allow her to attend classes and sent her home. The school later overturned the decision saying that her close-cropped hairstyle violated policy but exceptions could be made for extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast October, 11-year-old Trevor Foster of Columbus, Ind., was barred from competing in school sports for shaving his head into a pink Mohawk in honor of breast cancer awareness month.

Some are embracing this idea, while some are still struggling. We want kids to do the right thing and clearly this young man was trying to do the right thing by standing up in solidarity for his mother,"" McCarthy said.\n\nHowever, McCarthy suggested that misunderstandings can be avoided if students inform their school of their intentions.

But the track team coach did not mind the student wearing a mohawk, it’s when it was dyed pink that it suddenly became a distraction, and Barker was then banned from competing unless he shaved himself.\n\nIn a related report by The Inquisitr, a HOA forced a breast cancer survivor to remove her pink ribbon from inside her own ribbon because it supposedly violated homeowners rules and offended people.\n\nThe story began when Barker’s mother, Wendy Pawlicki, made this suggestion:\n\n“You know what you should do for me? You should dye your hair pink and make a Mohawk for me.”\n\nSo in this case it was the parent, not the child, who came up with the idea for supporting her during her cancer fight. It also was not the hairstyle since Mike had worn a mohawk for weeks without incident. But when his hair became pink the school suddenly decided he did match up to their grooming and appearance policy:\n\n“[My coach] told me I can’t have pink hair with Mohawk to support my mom with breast cancer. I want this to change. That’s my goal.”\n\nBoth the coach and the principal told Mike he would need to shave or he could not compete. In response, other students protested the pink mohawk ban by showing up to school sporting the same style. So all of these students were not allowed to compete in the track meet and students from other schools began supporting Mike’s mother.\n\nRegardless, the school is standing firm behind their decision and they released this statement:\n\n“The West Iron County Public Schools supports the needs of the students to express themselves, as long as their expression does not interfere with the educational process.

Sara Lugger made a wager, and did everything in her power to win - and ended up losing in the process. Losing 140 pounds, that is, after taking out a series of bets on DietBet, a weight loss motivation site that hosts games (public and private) to see users power towards a healthier BMI.\n\nIn the ninth grade, Lugger had been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and was prescribed a steroid, prednisone, to manage her condition. While on prednisone, weight management became increasingly difficult, with Lugger eventually becoming obese. Years later, in 2004, Lugger's colitis was fixed by surgery, and she was no longer dependent on the prednisone that caused her to gain weight. However, being overweight for such a significant stretch of her life, weight loss didn't necessarily come easily, and the poor eating and exercise habits she'd picked up over the course of her colitis couldn't just be shaken off.\n\nIt wasn't until her 34th birthday in 2013 that she resolved to lose the weight for good. Weighing in at 342 pounds with a BMI of 50 (well beyond the 'obese' threshold of 30), Lugger signed up for DietBet after seeing her friend, Christie Williams, succeed with the site.\n\nDietBet involves a series of games, starting with the four-week challenge to lose four percent of your body weight. It has a large roster of celebrity followers who start their own game rounds, including Biggest Loser trainer Jillian Michaels. And, to keep members accountable, photos are required of each weigh in, with an algorithm designed to keep pick up any irregularities in the images. It's not just weight loss at stake, but money, too - each game includes small bets that you forfeit if you do not meet the target. If you're joining a bigger pool, the eventual winnings become even higher, with everybody who meets the target taking home a slice of cash. The financial incentive is just a small part of the system, though, with the camaraderie of the online community proving to be Lugger's favorite part of the challenge - though the $330 she took home surely sweetened the deal.\n\nA physical therapist by trade, Lugger was able to use equipment at work for second workout of the day (yes, day), so that she was still able to socialize after work. Clearly, her discipline paid off, with Lugger going from a size 28 to a size 12, and now eating an estimated 1200 calories per day - ideal for maintaining her new physique.\n\nShe's also discovered a passion for basketball. After years of turning down courtside excursions with her friends because she couldn't fit comfortably in the seats, she's now an avowed Detroit Pistons fan - with a new lease on life.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The regulatory agency\'s decision is expected in the first half of 2015.\n\nAdditionally, the same FDA panel also voted to unanimously recommend approval for Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\'s (CBST) investigational antibiotic Sivextro.

A decision from the agency is expected by June 20, according to Cubist.\n\nInvestors were buoyed by the news. Shares of Cubist closed at $73.15, up 4.3 percent on the Nasdaq exchange.\n\nThe company, viewed by many analysts as the nation’s top maker of antibiotics, has been moving to expand its lineup of drugs through internal research as well as acquisitions.\n\nLast fall, Cubist reported positive late-stage clinical trial results for ceftolozane/tazobactam, an antibiotic from its own labs that targets a potentially large market in urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. That treatment is expected to be submitted for review by US regulators in the coming weeks and to European officials later this year.\n\nCubist, which has 1,000 employees, including 600 at its Lexington headquarters and research campus, has not had a new drug approved since the FDA backed its blockbuster antibiotic Cubicin in 2003.\n\nIt acquired the Sivextro compound last September when it purchased Trius Therapeutics Inc., the San Diego biotechnology company that developed the medicine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time of the Trius takeover, Cubist said it was also buying Optimer Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Jersey City, N.J., a smaller company that developed its own antibacterial drug, Dificid. Cubist paid a combined $1.2 billion for the two acquisitions.\n\nCubist has projected that peak sales of the two acquired antibiotics will range from $600 million to $1 billion annually. But it has not broken down sales projections for Sivextro, which will compete with an existing Pfizer Inc. drug, Linezolid, as well as the generic drug Vancomycin, to treat deep-tissue skin infections as well as Gram-positive infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA.\n\nIn most cases, patients will initially be given Sivextro intravenously at a hospital and then, in a “step down,” in pill form at home.\n\nGilman said patients will take Sivextro once daily for six days, compared with a regimen of twice a day for 10 days for Linezolid and several times a day for Vancomycin.\n\nAlthough the generic medicine is cheaper, it is generally administered intravenously in the hospital, so patients can save on hospital costs by using Sivextro instead, he said.\n\nOne analyst projected peak sales of Sivextro would be $300 million to $400 million annually. But much will depend on the label that Cubist negotiates with the FDA, which will govern which patients can be prescribed the treatment.\n\n“Long term, we believe the significant dosing and important safety advantages will bear out and allow [Sivextro] to make inroads,” Michael J.

In the unanimous 14 – 0 decision, the AIDAC found that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of SIVEXTRO for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) was provided.\n\nSIVEXTRO is a once daily oxazolidinone being developed for both intravenous (I.V.) and oral administration for the treatment of serious infections caused by certain Gram-positive bacteria, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The Company’s New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA for SIVEXTRO is based on positive data from two global Phase 3 clinical studies, which met the primary and secondary endpoints defined by the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\n“We are very pleased with the strong endorsement from AIDAC members, and recommendation of approval for tedizolid, now known in the U.S. as SIVEXTRO. We are encouraged by the recognition that there is a need for more treatment options for patients to address serious skin infections,” said Steven Gilman, Ph.D., Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer of Cubist Pharmaceuticals. “We look forward to the FDA’s final review of SIVEXTRO and decision.”\n\nThe AIDAC recommendation is not binding on the FDA, but will help inform the FDA as it completes its Priority Review of the NDA for SIVEXTRO, which has an assigned action date of June 20, 2014. More information about the AIDAC meeting is available on the FDA website here.\n\nAdditionally, the EMA recently accepted for review the Company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for the investigational antibiotic, for which Cubist is seeking approval for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI). A decision from the European Commission (EC) is expected during the first half of 2015.\n\nTedizolid phosphate (formerly TR-701), now known in the U.S. as SIVEXTRO, is a novel oxazolidinone antibiotic drug candidate that is rapidly converted in vivo by phosphatases to the microbiologically active moiety TR-700. TR-700 acts by binding to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. Tedizolid is being developed for both I.V. and oral administration in the potential treatment of ABSSSI, also referred to ascSSTI. Tedizolid is also being investigated for potential use in nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia [HABP] and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia [VABP]). Two Phase 3 studies, conducted in the U.S., Europe and other regions worldwide, in ABSSSI and cSSTI demonstrated that tedizolid 200 mg once daily for six days was statistically non-inferior to 10 days of linezolid 600 mg twice daily for the primary efficacy endpoints. Secondary endpoints were also met. In these studies, the adverse event rates were similar for both tedizolid and linezolid treated patients. Gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) were the most commonly reported in both treatment groups.\n\nFor more infectious disease news and information, visit and “like” the Infectious Disease News Facebook page and the Outbreak News This Week Radio Show page', 'PRESS RELEASECubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee (AIDAC) voted to recommend approval of Cubist’s investigational antibiotic SIVEXTRO™ (tedizolid phosphate).\nIn the unanimous 14 – 0 decision, the AIDAC found that substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of SIVEXTRO for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) was provided.\nand oral administration for the treatment of serious infections caused by certain Gram-positive bacteria, including those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).\n“We are very pleased with the strong endorsement from AIDAC members, and recommendation of approval for tedizolid, now known in the U.S. as SIVEXTRO.\nTedizolid is also being investigated for potential use in nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia [HABP] and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia [VABP]).']"

Cubist also sells another anti-infective, Cubicin, which generated global sales of more than $1 billion in 2013.\n\nPanelists said they had some concerns about the potential for dalbavancin to cause liver problems, especially in patients with underlying liver disease, and recommended the company be required to conduct additional safety studies once the drug is on the market.\n\nThey also urged the FDA to work with the company to develop guidelines for patient follow-up after the initial dose has been given to ensure patients receive the critical second dose.\n\n“I’m wondering how many people will get a shot of this, go out the door and never come back,” said Dr. Michael Neely, a panelist and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe urged that Cubist’s drug be studied for safety over a longer period than that studied in the trial.\n\nCubist, based in Lexington, Massachusetts, acquired tedizolid with its 2013 purchase of Trius Therapeutics for about $704 million.

A decision from the agency is expected by June 20, according to Cubist.\n\nInvestors , of coursewere buoyed by the news. Shares of Cubist closed at $73.15, up 4.3 percent on the Nasdaq exchange.\n\nThe company, viewed by many analysts as the nation’s top maker of antibiotics, has been moving to expand its lineup of drugs through internal research as well as acquisitions.\n\nLast fall, Cubist reported positive late-stage clinical trial results for ceftolozane/tazobactam, an antibiotic from its own labs that targets a potentially large market in urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. That treatment is expected to be submitted for review by US regulators in the coming weeks and to European officials later this year.\n\nCubist, which has 1,000 employees, including 600 at its Lexington headquarters and research campus, has not had a new drug approved since the FDA backed its blockbuster antibiotic Cubicin in 2003.\n\nIt acquired the Sivextro compound last September when it purchased Trius Therapeutics Inc., the San Diego biotechnology company that developed the medicine.\n\nAt the time of the Trius takeover, Cubist said it was also buying Optimer Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Jersey City, N.J., a smaller company that developed its own antibacterial drug, Dificid. Cubist paid a combined $1.2 billion for the two acquisitions.\n\nCubist has projected that peak sales of the two acquired antibiotics will range from $600 million to $1 billion annually. But it has not broken down sales projections for Sivextro, which will compete with an existing Pfizer Inc. drug, Linezolid, as well as the generic drug Vancomycin, to treat deep-tissue skin infections as well as Gram-positive infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA.\n\nIn most cases, patients will initially be given Sivextro intravenously at a hospital and then, in a “step down,” in pill form at home.\n\nGilman said patients will take Sivextro once daily for six days, compared with a regimen of twice a day for 10 days for Linezolid and several times a day for Vancomycin.\n\nAlthough the generic medicine is cheaper, it is generally administered intravenously in the hospital, so patients can save on hospital costs by using Sivextro instead, he said.\n\nOne analyst projected peak sakes sales of Sivextro at would be $300 million to $400 million annually.

In their case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted the groups\' request for an injunction blocking the rules from taking effect for the schools and colleges.\n\n\n\nThe Catholic groups\' main case is pending before the federal appeals court, with arguments in that court scheduled for May 8, so the groups\' decision to seek further Supreme Court intervention ""before judgment"" was a bit of a long shot.\n\nThe Obama administration told the justices in a brief that because the Catholic schools had won an injunction, ""there is no basis for short-circuiting the normal course of appellate review"" by granting an appeal before judgment.\n\n\n\nAnd on Monday, the justices declined without comment to hear the schools\' case at this point.\n\n\n\nIn a separate case involving a group home in Denver operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor religious order, a federal appeals court had denied an injunction blocking the contraceptive-coverage requirement. That led to a New Year\'s Eve order by Justice Sonia Sotomayor that temporarily blocked the rules from applying to the Little Sisters. A few weeks later, the full Supreme Court issued an order that said the Little Sisters could receive the religious accommodation as long as the group informed the federal government in writing (instead of having to fill out the specific government form). That case remains pending in a lower court.\n\n\n\nLast week, the court heard arguments on whether for-profit corporations can raise religious objections to the contraceptive-coverage requirement, in the case of Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores Inc. (No. 13-354). It is virtually a certainty that after the federal appeals courts have had a chance to rule on the merits of the religious organizations\' objections, one or more of those cases will make it back to the high court.\n\n\n\n', ""The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an early-stage appeal from a group of Roman Catholic schools on whether religiously affiliated non-profit organizations must comply with the so-called contraceptive-coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile the Affordable Care Act exempts churches from the requirement, other religious organizations, including schools, colleges, and nursing homes, are not exempt.\nSome religious organizations accepted the accommodation, but many did not, leading to a flurry a lawsuits against the administration.\n; and Mary of Nazareth Roman Catholic Elementary School in Darnestown, Md.\nAnd on Monday, the justices declined without comment to hear the schools' case at this point.""]"

Those on medical therapy alone lost four percent.\n\n- Quality of life -\n\nMeanwhile, people who did not undergo surgery reported no improvements in quality of life, according to eight measures including body pain, general health, energy and fatigue.\n\nGastric bypass patients reported five improvements and sleeve patients reported two. There were no major complications among those who underwent the surgeries.\n\nGastric bypass involves reducing the stomach to below three percent of its natural volume, then connecting a new gastric pouch that bypasses the stomach and goes straight to the intestine.\n\nIn sleeve gastrectomy, part of the patient\'s stomach is removed to reduce its volume by about 75 percent.\n\nGastric bypass outperformed the sleeve gastrectomy in the study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Cleveland Clinic and Ethicon, a division of pharmaceutical giant Johnson and Johnson which sells surgical products for weight loss.\n\nAmit Khera, associate professor at the University of Texas Southwest Medical Center, who was not involved in the study, described the research as ""important"" because it addresses the longer-term benefits from surgery versus counseling and weight loss attempts alone.\n\n""In the surgical arm, it does seem to be quite durable,"" he told reporters.\n\n""Normalizing blood sugar seems to be retained at three years. That is a really important observation.""\n\nOn the other hand, people who did not have surgery showed early improvements in their blood sugar, dropping close to the target of 7.5 in the first year.\n\nBut that group was back up to 8.4 percent in year three.\n\nThe study, called the Surgical Treatment and Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial, is designed to follow its patients for a total of five years.', ""Fewer than half of adults with diabetes are able to get their blood sugar under control with medication, experts say.\nThe gastric bypass group lost on average a quarter of their body weight while the sleeve gastrectomy patients shed 21 percent.\nGastric bypass patients reported five improvements and sleeve patients reported two.\nIn sleeve gastrectomy, part of the patient's stomach is removed to reduce its volume by about 75 percent.\nOn the other hand, people who did not have surgery showed early improvements in their blood sugar, dropping close to the target of 7.5 in the first year.""]"

The STAMPEDE (Surgical Therapy And Medications Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently) trial was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented today at the Annual Scientific Session of the American College of Cardiology in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe study also shows that bariatric surgery patients experienced an improvement in quality of life and a reduction in the need for cardiovascular medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol compared to those receiving medical therapy. As a result, patients in the surgery groups used less cardiovascular and glucose-lowering medications -- 5 to 10 percent were on insulin compared to 55 percent of the patients in the medical therapy group.\n\nObesity is the main trigger for type 2 diabetes. Given that an estimated one in every three adults in the United States is obese, health experts developed the term ""diabesity"" to talk about this epidemic. According to the American Diabetes Association, as many as one in three American adults will have diabetes in 2050 if present trends continue.\n\n""We see patients whose lives are ravaged by diabetes. At the three-year mark, this study shows that bariatric surgery is more effective with persistent benefits noted up to 3 years for treating type 2 diabetes in moderate and severely obese patients when compared to medical therapy,"" said Sangeeta Kashyap, M.D., one of the lead investigators and an endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic\'s Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute. ""More than 90 percent of the patients who underwent bariatric surgery were able to lose 25 percent of their body weight and control their diabetes without the use of insulin and multiple diabetes drugs.""\n\nTo date, the STAMPEDE study is the largest randomized trial with one of the longest follow-ups comparing medical therapy with bariatric surgery. The trial initially involved 150 overweight patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The patients were divided into three groups: 1) Fifty patients received intensive medical therapy only, including counseling and medications; 2) Fifty patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and received medical therapy; 3) Fifty patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy and received medical therapy.\n\nEffectiveness was gauged by the percentage of patients who achieved blood sugar control, defined in this study as hemoglobin HbA1c level of less than or equal to 6.0 percent -- a more aggressive target than the American Diabetes Association\'s guidelines. HbA1c is a standard laboratory test that reflects average blood sugar over three months.\n\nAt the three-year mark, more patients in the gastric bypass group (37.5 percent) achieved blood sugar control without the use of any diabetic medications compared with the other two groups -- 5 percent of the patients in the medical therapy group and 24.5 percent of the patients in the sleeve gastrectomy group. This correlates with a weight loss five to six times greater on average for patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with those in the intensive medical therapy group.\n\n""The three-year data confirm that bariatric surgery maintains its superiority over medical therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in severely obese patients,"" said lead investigator Philip Schauer, M.D., Director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. ""Moreover, data show that bariatric surgery is as effective in treating type 2 diabetes in patients with mild obesity. That\'s why Cleveland Clinic health insurance plan now covers bariatric surgery for its members with mild obesity and uncontrolled diabetes.""\n\nAfter three years, researchers were also able to evaluate the impact of diabetes and obesity on the patients\' quality of life using a validated questionnaire (SF-36, Rand Corp.). Data show significant improvements in five of eight mental and physical domains for patients in the gastric bypass group and two of eight domains for the patients in the sleeve gastrectomy group. There was no improvement in the medical therapy group.\n\n""We looked at quality of life, because ultimately it is all about helping our patients live a healthier, happier life,"" said Dr. Schauer. ""When compared to sleeve gastrectomy and medical therapy, gastric bypass patients achieved greater weight loss, were on fewer medications, had a higher success rate in controlling their diabetes, and an improved quality of life.""\n\nIn addition, new data looked at kidney function, measured by the amount of albumin in the urine and a marker of kidney damage due to diabetes. Albumin level was significantly lower in the gastric bypass group only.\n\nCleveland Clinic researchers have been at the forefront of research in this field. In addition to leading the STAMPEDE trial, pioneering Cleveland Clinic-led research includes a study showing for the first time that bariatric surgery can markedly improve type 1 diabetes, with some patients reducing their insulin intake by more than 60 percent. The results were published in the March 2014 issue of Diabetes Care.\n\nA substudy of STAMPEDE, published in Diabetes Care in 2013, found that gastric bypass surgery reverses diabetes by uniquely restoring pancreatic function in moderately obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.

It’s a blessing that you don’t have to take medicine, that you are healthier, that you feel good, that you look fantastic.”\n\nThe surgery is expensive, but as Schauer said, so is treating diabetes and all its complications.\n\n“So in that regard, I think that surgery will factor in as a viable and efficient and economically advantageous treatment,” he said.\n\nSchauer also found that patients who had the surgery had better blood pressure results, and they could reduce the amount of medicine they used to control it.

Almost half of the estimated direct medical costs for diabetes in the US are attributed to treating complications from the disease, of which Emergency Department visits only accounts for a small portion.\n\nIt is widely understood that the best way to manage diabetes is to maintain tight blood glucose control. One of the silver linings to this epidemic is how rapidly over the past ten years the quality, safety, convenience, and availability of diabetes treatment has improved.\n\nIn 2004, most glucometers required 5 microliters of blood for the meter to return a reading. If your finger did not produce enough blood, another area would need to be pricked. With this amount of pain and work required, even the most motivated patient could become incompliant and increase their risk in co-morbidities. Without internal memories, patients wrote their readings in a journal and reviewed with their doctor what all those inaccurate numbers meant. The cumbersome nature of this process meant that fewer patients tested.\n\nToday, diabetes sufferers can use glucose monitors linked to an iPhone app, requiring as little blood as .32 microliters, wirelessly coordinate data. Other technological advances include “patch” pumps such as the disposable Omnipod that can be worn discretely and managed wirelessly through a device that looks similar to a smartphone. Integrated continuous feedback loops between glucose monitors and insulin pumps allow constant visibility for the wearer into the necessary dosage of insulin, as close to an artificial pancreas as we have.\n\nFurther research has shown even more promising blood glucose management options, such as a contact lens that can monitor glucose levels in tears, potentially with the capability to close the feedback loop to insulin pumps and corresponding medical devices without a finger prick.\n\nThese advances should never be viewed outside of their context. The only reason companies have invested in the research resulting in these innovations is the worsening health crisis. In a perfectly healthy world, we there would be no market for these miracle devices.\n\nOur world is, however, not perfectly healthy. It also isn’t perfectly regulated and there are still obstacles that dissuade companies from investing in solving this crisis. These obstacles include the medical device tax a cost that is ultimately borne by consumers and directly impacts funds available for companies to invest in research and development.\n\nReducing or eliminating the medical device tax for devices specifically designed to improve the health of those suffering from diabetes will increase the money that that diabetes-focused companies are able to invest into future research. Lessening the debilitating effects of diabetes is just as urgent a priority as stemming the rise of obesity.\n\nColangelo is executive director of Consumers’ Research. Consumers’ Research was founded in 1929 as a product testing and consumer advocacy organization and publishes a bi-monthly magazine on consumer topics.', 'Eliminating this quarter-billion dollar cost is a matter of getting the right medical devices in the hands of diabetics.\nThis includes creating a better regulatory and tax environment producing products that help those afflicted with diabetes.\nIt is widely understood that the best way to manage diabetes is to maintain tight blood glucose control.\nThese obstacles include the medical device tax a cost that is ultimately borne by consumers and directly impacts funds available for companies to invest in research and development.\nReducing or eliminating the medical device tax for devices specifically designed to improve the health of those suffering from diabetes will increase the money that that diabetes-focused companies are able to invest into future research.']"

So it makes sense to try to figure out whether the surgery could help control diabetes, too.\n\nSo far the answer is yes, at least for some people and for three years. But surgery doesn\'t work for everyone, and the long-term implications remain unclear.\n\nMore than one-third of the people who had gastric bypass surgery met glycemic control targets three years out, compared with 24 percent who had a different type of bariatric surgery called sleeve gastrectomy. And just 5 percent of people in a group treated with medication alone were able to meet that standard.\n\nIt\'s one of the first randomized controlled trials to look at bariatric surgery as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes, which affects 23 million adults.\n\nStill, almost three-quarters of the people who had surgery didn\'t meet the study\'s target of normal blood sugar, or 6 percent on an A1C test. And some of the people who had surgery still needed to use glucose-lowering drugs, including insulin.\n\n""Even though they did not achieve that target, they did get a lot better,"" says Dr. Philip Schauer, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, who led the study. The people who had surgery lowered their blood glucose levels 2.5 percentage points, on average, compared with 0.6 points for the people who didn\'t get surgery.\n\nThe people who lost the most weight and those who had been diagnosed with diabetes no more than three years before surgery did best, Schauer tells Shots. ""If you want to achieve a long-term remission, intervene sooner rather than later,"" he says.\n\nThe results were presented at a meeting of cardiologists in Washington, D.C., and published online Monday by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThough the study is focused on bariatric surgery, it also shows just how hard it is to manage diabetes with drugs alone.\n\nThe 50 people in the medication-only group were working with endocrinologists at the Cleveland Clinic and almost certainly getting more medical attention than most people with diabetes.\n\nStill, after losing weight and getting their blood glucose levels as low as 7.5 percent, by Year 3 their average level was up to 8.4 percent. ""These folks were already on three drugs at the start of the trial, and many of them had more medications added to the daily regimen,"" Schauer says. ""These a limit to how many medications a person can take in a day.""\n\nThis trial will continue for two more years.

As a result, patients in the surgery groups used less cardiovascular and glucose-lowering medications – 5 to 10 percent were on insulin compared to 55 percent of the patients in the medical therapy group.\n\nObesity is the main trigger for type 2 diabetes. Given that an estimated one in every three adults in the United States is obese, health experts developed the term ""diabesity"" to talk about this epidemic. According to the American Diabetes Association, as many as one in three American adults will have diabetes in 2050 if present trends continue.\n\n""We see patients whose lives are ravaged by diabetes. At the three-year mark, this study shows that bariatric surgery is more effective with persistent benefits noted up to 3 years for treating type 2 diabetes in moderate and severely obese patients when compared to medical therapy,"" said Sangeeta Kashyap, M.D., one of the lead investigators and an endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic\'s Endocrinology & Metabolism Institute. ""More than 90 percent of the patients who underwent bariatric surgery were able to lose 25 percent of their body weight and control their diabetes without the use of insulin and multiple diabetes drugs.""\n\nTo date, the STAMPEDE study is the largest randomized trial with one of the longest follow-ups comparing medical therapy with bariatric surgery. The trial initially involved 150 overweight patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The patients were divided into three groups: 1) Fifty patients received intensive medical therapy only, including counseling and medications; 2) Fifty patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery and received medical therapy; 3) Fifty patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy and received medical therapy.\n\nEffectiveness was gauged by the percentage of patients who achieved blood sugar control, defined in this study as hemoglobin HbA1c level of less than or equal to 6.0 percent – a more aggressive target than the American Diabetes Association\'s guidelines. HbA1c is a standard laboratory test that reflects average blood sugar over three months.\n\nAt the three-year mark, more patients in the gastric bypass group (37.5 percent) achieved blood sugar control without the use of any diabetic medications compared with the other two groups—5 percent of the patients in the medical therapy group and 24.5 percent of the patients in the sleeve gastrectomy group. This correlates with a weight loss five to six times greater on average for patients who underwent bariatric surgery compared with those in the intensive medical therapy group.\n\n""The three-year data confirm that bariatric surgery maintains its superiority over medical therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in severely obese patients,"" said lead investigator Philip Schauer, M.D., Director of the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute. ""Moreover, data show that bariatric surgery is as effective in treating type 2 diabetes in patients with mild obesity. That\'s why Cleveland Clinic health insurance plan now covers bariatric surgery for its members with mild obesity and uncontrolled diabetes.""\n\nAfter three years, researchers were also able to evaluate the impact of diabetes and obesity on the patients\' quality of life using a validated questionnaire (SF-36, Rand Corp.). Data show significant improvements in five of eight mental and physical domains for patients in the gastric bypass group and two of eight domains for the patients in the sleeve gastrectomy group. There was no improvement in the medical therapy group.\n\n""We looked at quality of life, because ultimately it is all about helping our patients live a healthier, happier life,"" said Dr. Schauer. ""When compared to sleeve gastrectomy and medical therapy, gastric bypass patients achieved greater weight loss, were on fewer medications, had a higher success rate in controlling their diabetes, and an improved quality of life.""\n\nIn addition, new data looked at kidney function, measured by the amount of albumin in the urine and a marker of kidney damage due to diabetes. Albumin level was significantly lower in the gastric bypass group only.\n\nCleveland Clinic researchers have been at the forefront of research in this field. In addition to leading the STAMPEDE trial, pioneering Cleveland Clinic-led research includes a study showing for the first time that bariatric surgery can markedly improve type 1 diabetes, with some patients reducing their insulin intake by more than 60 percent. The results were published in the March 2014 issue of Diabetes Care.\n\nA substudy of STAMPEDE, published in Diabetes Care in 2013, found that gastric bypass surgery reverses diabetes by uniquely restoring pancreatic function in moderately obese patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.\n\nFurther research is needed to continue to advance the study of bariatric surgery as a treatment option for patients with diabetes.\n\nExplore further Study shows long-term effects of bariatric surgery in patients with Type 2 diabetes', 'To date, the STAMPEDE study is the largest randomized trial with one of the longest follow-ups comparing medical therapy with bariatric surgery.\n""Moreover, data show that bariatric surgery is as effective in treating type 2 diabetes in patients with mild obesity.\nThat\'s why Cleveland Clinic health insurance plan now covers bariatric surgery for its members with mild obesity and uncontrolled diabetes.""\nFurther research is needed to continue to advance the study of bariatric surgery as a treatment option for patients with diabetes.\nExplore further Study shows long-term effects of bariatric surgery in patients with Type 2 diabetes']"

Eating seven or more portions reduces the specific risks of death by cancer and heart disease by 25% and 31% respectively. The research also showed that vegetables have significantly higher health benefits than fruit.\n\nThis is the first study to link fruit and vegetable consumption with all-cause, cancer and heart disease deaths in a nationally-representative population, the first to quantify health benefits per-portion, and the first to identify the types of fruit and vegetable with the most benefit.\n\nCompared to eating less than one portion of fruit and vegetables, the risk of death by any cause is reduced by 14% by eating one to three portions, 29% for three to five portions, 36% for five to seven portions and 42% for seven or more. These figures are adjusted for sex, age, cigarette smoking, social class, Body Mass Index, education, physical activity and alcohol intake, and exclude deaths within a year of the food survey.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health, found that fresh vegetables had the strongest protective effect, with each daily portion reducing overall risk of death by 16%.

There was the Famous Five, the Jackson 5 and the five main characters from Friends (c’mon, you don’t count Phoebe, do you?).\n\nBut apparently five isn’t good enough. According to advice issued this week by health experts at two British universities, the magic number needs an upgrade when it comes to how many fruit and vegetables we eat each day.\n\nUniversity College London and the University of Liverpool are encouraging us to increase our ‘five a day’ to prolong our existence. Instead of getting through a quintet of fruit and veg every 24 hours, they believe we should be having seven or even ten portions in that period.\n\nUsing figures from the Health Survey for England, the researchers examined the eating habits of more than 65,000 people, and found that those who ate seven or more portions of fruit and veg were less at risk of death from cancer, heart disease and other conditions. Those who eat at least seven portions reduced their overall risk of death from any cause by 42%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Have you had your ten-a-day? Five-a-day ‘not enough’\n\nThe research goes slightly further than guidelines laid down more than ten years ago by Public Health England. Although it advises that we should eat ‘at least’ five a day, this is the first time health experts have started talking about seven and above off the back of such detailed research.\n\nThe study’s lead author, Dr Oyinlola Oyebode from UCL, said the impact of eating that much fruit and veg is ‘staggering’, while Professor Simon Capewell at the University of Liverpool said it was time to update the health message from ‘five a day’ to ‘ten a day’.\n\nWhile that kind of change may be some way off – Public Health England said it has no plans to alter its guidelines – the research has reignited the debate around our daily food consumption.\n\nThe push to up our fruit and veg intake is a noble one, particularly when it has been shown to save lives, but there is concern that we need to be able to walk before we try to run. The reality is that two-thirds of us are still short of the current target – most Britons’ daily encounter with their five-a-day comes in the shape of a game of Fruit Ninja on their commute home. Should we really be shooting for the stars of eating ten portions a day when we can’t even manage five?\n\nThe guidelines in Britain followed those issued by the World Health Organization at the beginning of the 1990s. It is recommended that should each eat at least five 80g portions of fruit and veg a day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Australia, they already have a ‘2 & 5’ campaign, asking people to eat at least two portions of fruit and five helpings of vegetables each day. But are we being a little too optimistic by talking about similar figures here?\n\nNutritionist Azmina Govindji, spokeswoman for the British Dietetic Association, believes we need to concentrate on taking one step at a time with our eating habits.\n\nShe said that instead of thinking in terms of ‘five-a-day’ or ‘seven-a-day’ or ‘ten-a-day’, that we should each concentrate on simply having one more portion of fruit and veg than normal.\n\n‘The more fruit and veg you eat, the better protected you are. But we’ve got to be practical and realistic. We’re struggling to get people to eat five a day. The UK population is averaging two, maybe three, a day – so if you’re going to suddenly start increasing your recommendations to say seven or ten, how unrealistic would that be? People would perhaps feel they’re never going to achieve that so they just don’t bother.’\n\nInstead, she advised: ‘Add one more to your daily amount. If you have one more, then you are making a difference.’\n\nHowever, Govindji said the UCL study had raised awareness of Britain’s eating issue.\n\n‘Nutrition is an evolving science, so it’s always good to get something new that comes out about something that we’ve talked about for 20 years.’\n\nTom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College London, doesn’t think we need to eat more than five portions a day based on the new research, adding that people often over-report how much fruit and veg they consume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘If they say they are eating seven to eight portions a day, they probably are only eating five,’ he said.\n\nAnd anyway, there may not be room for any more fruit and veg. Not only is our time pretty tight, so are our waistbands.\n\n‘Most people eat about 1,000g of food a day, plus drinks on top,’ said Prof Sanders. ‘If you ate ten portions a day that would be 800g – it would fill you up. We do not have enough meals to stuff more vegetables in. People need to eat less, particularly of high calorie foods, and fruit and vegetables can displace some of these.’\n\nHe said we should avoid pickled vegetables because of their salt content and take no more than one glass of fruit juice a day because of its sugar levels. But what will we eat in the future?\n\n‘We will eat more food of plant origin – not just vegetables but also beans, potatoes, nuts and cereals and less meat,’ said Prof Sanders. ‘Frozen vegetables are a good buy and do not differ in nutritional quality from fresh, which is useful if you are living on budget. Bananas are very cheap, high in potassium, and a good substitute for biscuit snacks. Potatoes should be included with vegetables and not put in the same class as cereals. They are nutritious and healthy, especially if boiled in their skins or baked.’', 'Those who eat at least seven portions reduced their overall risk of death from any cause by 42%.\nShould we really be shooting for the stars of eating ten portions a day when we can’t even manage five?\nIt is recommended that should each eat at least five 80g portions of fruit and veg a day.\nAdvertisementAdvertisementIn Australia, they already have a ‘2 & 5’ campaign, asking people to eat at least two portions of fruit and five helpings of vegetables each day.\nAdvertisement‘If they say they are eating seven to eight portions a day, they probably are only eating five,’ he said.']"

Fresh vegetables reduced overall premature death risks by 16 percent. Fresh fruit reduced this risk by 4 percent.\n\n“Vegetables have a larger effect than fruit, but fruit still makes a real difference.

When you’re making that morning smoothie, throw in a few extra pieces of fruit…and a handful of kale or spinach as well. The sweet and fruity taste will actually mask the flavor of the vegetables.\n\nEat more soup for lunch. Water-based soups are a great, and filling, way to incorporate more vegetables in your diet.\n\nEat a salad with dinner. Not only will you fill up on healthy vegetables, but eating a salad before your main course will help prevent you from overeating anything that comes afterwards.\n\nChange up your greens. Instead of light green veggies, such as iceburg lettuce, switch things up and build your salads with kale and spinach, which pack more of a nutritional punch.\n\nEat dessert.

Seven servings of fruits and veggies a day can reduce the risk of any cause of death.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services recommends a minimum five servings of fruits and vegetables daily--three of vegetables and two for fruit. The University College London recently conducted a comprehensive study involving over 65,000 people and their results suggest the minimum fruit and vegetable servings should be increased to seven.\n\nUsing data from the Health Survey for England, Oyinlola Oyebode and her research team found that seven-plus servings of fruits and vegetables per day reduced the risk of death in general by 42%. The data included 65,000 people over the course of seven and a half years, between 2001 and 2008.\n\nThe researchers examined mortality rates in general as well as cancer, heart disease, stroke, and premature death rates. Seven plus servings of fruits and vegetables were found to reduce the risk of death from cancer by 25% and heart disease by 31%. Even minimal consumption of these food groups revealed benefits. Those who consumed only 1-3 servings per day were 14% less likely to die.\n\nOverall, vegetables had a greater positive effect than fruits. Fresh vegetables possessed the strongest protective effects, followed by salad and fruit. But both food groups contain antioxidants, micronutrients, and fiber, which are all important for maintaining good health, says Dr. Oyebode. A ""serving"" equates to about three ounces, or a large handful, an important measurement to keep in mind.\n\n""Vegetables have a larger effect than fruit, but fruit still makes a real difference,"" she said in this Forbes article. If you\'re happy to snack on carrots or other vegetables, then that is a great choice but if you fancy something sweeter, a banana or any fruit will also do you good.""\n\nThe researchers note that these findings do not require you to increase your fruit and vegetable intake. By noting the importance of these food groups, they hope people will realize how important fruits and vegetables are for the everyday diet.

Increasing the amount of these foods cuts the chances of dying from cancer by a quarter, and cardiovascular-related deaths by one-third.\n\nRisk of death by any cause over the course of the study was reduced by:\n\n14% by eating one to three portions of fruit or vegetables per day\n\n29% for three to five\n\n36% for five to seven\n\n42% for seven or more (up to around ten portions a day)\n\nAlthough, the study shows that an increase in fruits and vegetables is beneficial to health, the British government says its “five-a-day” advice is sufficient as many people struggle to achieve even this goal. Professor Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, said promoting a seven-a-day message would be “really challenging”. “It would require governmental support such as subsidizing the cost of fruit and vegetables, perhaps by taxing sugar-rich foods, and making available high quality products to all in society,” he said.\n\nDr. Alison Tedstone, of Public Health England, said the study was “interesting” but it seemed “premature” to raise the recommended fruit and vegetable intake, because two thirds of people were not eating five or more portions a day. People “tend to understand this five-a-day message,” she said. “I think we should keep it simple and stay as we are. We are working very hard to improve the availability of fruit and vegetables, as we see it as absolutely integral to somebody’s health to choose those five a day,” she added.\n\nVictoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, also said people were still struggling to meet the existing target of at least five a day. “While you may not be getting your five a day, there’s no reason to give up and stop trying as this study showed there were health benefits for every extra portion of fruit and veg people ate,” she said.\n\nExperts claim that other lifestyle factors, such as not smoking or drinking excessively, also account for a drop in mortality, not just fruit and vegetable consumption. Professor Tom Sanders, at the School of Medicine, King’s College London, said it was “already known” that people who said they ate lots of fruit and vegetables were health conscious, educated, and earned a higher level of income. Researchers from University College said they took these factors into account when they formed their conclusions, but still found that increasing fruit and vegetables had a sufficient impact on overall health.\n\nAt present, only one in four Britons manages to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and just one in ten teenagers. Lead author Dr Oyinlola Oyebode, of UCL’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, said the effect was “staggering.” “The clear message here is that the more fruit and vegetables you eat, the less likely you are to die at any age. Vegetables have a larger effect than fruit, but fruit still makes a real difference. However, people shouldn’t feel daunted by a big target like seven.

The association with reduced mortality risk was slightly stronger for vegetables (2 to 3 portion, HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-0.89) than for fruit (2 to 3 portions, HR 0.90; 95% 0.82-0.98).\n\nFruit and Veggie Consumption Too Low\n\nResearchers analyzed self-reported lifestyle data for more than 65,000 randomly selected adults who participated in national health surveys in England between 2001 and 2008. Mortality data through the first quarter of 2013 were also analyzed, and the median time of follow-up was 7.7 years.\n\nSurvey respondents ate, on average, just under four portions of fruits and vegetables in the day prior to the survey and more than 50% reported eating less than five portions, the researchers noted.\n\nMarion Nestle, PhD, an author and professor in the department of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University, said she was somewhat surprised by the strength of the mortality benefit reported by the researchers, but not by the fact that the average consumption of fruits and vegetables was relatively low.\n\n""Most Americans say they consume around three servings of fruits and vegetables (daily), and at least one of those servings is white potatoes,"" she told MedPage Today in an email exchange. ""So what we learn from this study is that eating vegetables is good for health, which we knew, and that eating more of them is better. Ten may be ideal, but even five is a great improvement.""\n\nCanned Fruits Linked to Increased Mortality\n\nWhen Oyebode and colleagues considered different types of fruits and vegetables in the adjusted model, salad (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91, P<0.001), fresh fruit (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.93-0.96, P<0.001) and dried fruit (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.81-0.95, P=0.002) all showed significant associations with reduced mortality, while eating more frozen and canned fruit was significantly associated with a greater all-cause mortality (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.07-1.29, P<0.001).\n\nThe researchers suggested that people who eat more canned and frozen fruit may have less access to fresh fruits and vegetables and they noted that canned fruit often contains high amounts of added sugar. Frozen fruit is generally considered as nutritious as fresh, but the survey did not distinguish between processed frozen and canned fruits and vegetables.\n\nA major study limitation cited by the researchers was the self-reported measurement of fruit and vegetable intake at a single point in time, and they noted that the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and reduced mortality was not necessarily causal.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, physicians Chris Kypridemos, Martin O\'Flaherty, and Simon Capewell of the University of Liverpool cited several results from the study that could help ""inform professionals, policy makers, and journalists.""\n\nThe finding that of lower mortality risk for each additional portion of vegetables eaten, versus fruit, is important for directing policy, as is the finding that cancer-specific mortality was reduced in association with higher fruit and vegetable consumption, they noted.\n\nSeven Servings Better Than Five\n\nBut the result with perhaps the biggest potential implication for policy makers was that the association continued to grow with vegetable and fruit consumption of up to seven servings a day. In the U.K., the U.S., and elsewhere, many guidelines suggest five servings a day as a target minimum goal.\n\nNestle noted that it is not particularly hard to eat a variety of vegetables every day and even seven or more servings may be a reasonable goal.\n\n""Standard serving sizes are half a cup for the most part and easy to manage,"" she noted. ""An important feature of healthful diets is variety -- a mixed salad takes care of most.

[6 Easy Ways to Eat More Fruits and Vegetables]\n\nEating fewer than seven servings was also beneficial, although the protective effect was not as strong: People who ate one to three servings were 14 percent less likely to die during the study; those who ate three to five servings were 29 percent less likely to die, and those who ate five to seven servings were 36 percent less likely to die, compared to people who ate less than one serving.\n\nThe findings held even after the researchers took into account factors that may affect people\'s risk of dying, such as cigarette smoking, body mass index and physical activity level.\n\nAlthough eating seven or more servings a day was linked with the most benefits, ""People shouldn\'t feel daunted by a big target like seven,"" study researcher Oyinlola Oyebode, of the University of California, Los Angeles, said in a statement. ""Whatever your starting point, it is always worth eating more fruit and vegetables.""\n\nVegetables trump fruit?\n\nEach daily serving of fresh vegetables was linked with a 16-percent reduction in a person\'s risk of dying, while each serving of fresh fruit was linked with a 4-percent reduction in risk of death.\n\n""Vegetables have a larger effect than fruit, but fruit still makes a real difference,"" Oyebode said.\n\nHowever, each serving of canned or frozen fruit increased the risk of death by 17 percent. Because the researchers did not distinguish between frozen and canned fruit, they cannot say whether one or both types of fruit were responsible for the effect. However, they noted that canned fruit is much more popular than frozen fruit in Europe.\n\nThe high levels of sugar found in canned fruit may outweigh the benefits of the fruit, Oyebode said.\n\nStill, the researchers noted the study found associations, and cannot prove that fruits and vegetables were solely responsible for the reduced risk of death, or that canned fruit increases the risk of death. The study did not take into account people\'s total calorie intake or salt consumption, which may affect the link.\n\nIt\'s also possible that people with poor access to fresh fruit and vegetables experience other factors that increase their risk of dying, such as health conditions or stressful lives, the researchers said.\n\nPolicy implications\n\nThe findings agree with dietary recommendations in the United States, which say that people who eat 2,000 calories daily should consume nearly nine servings of fruits and vegetables (2 cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables, with a half-cup being one serving), according to Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nHowever, people\'s actual consumption of fruits and vegetables often falls short of guidelines. In the study, people in England said they ate just under four servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and a 2013 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that Americans eat less than three portions a day.\n\n""With increasing evidence of their health benefits, policy-makers may need to consider broader initiatives to promote fruit and vegetable consumption, particularly vegetables and salad,"" the researchers wrote on March 31 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.\n\nIn order to help individuals in poor areas, policies should seek not only to educate people, but also to increase access to fruits and vegetables, the researchers said.\n\nFollow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner.

79321,http://www.medicaldaily.com/7-servings-fruits-and-vegetables-day-keeps-death-bay-which-has-more-protective-effect-273554,health,"['Many of us recall our parents hovering over our shoulder at the kitchen table and repeatedly saying, “Eat your fruits and vegetables.” Although they nagged, they were right because when it comes to fruits and vegetables, more matters. Eating plenty of produce helps reduce the risk of many diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and some cancers. Now, a study published in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health has found eating seven or more servings of these healthy foods per day will ward off the risk of all death-related causes by almost half.\n\n“The higher the intake of fruit and vegetables, the greater the protective effects seemed to be,"" wrote the researchers, according to the press release. Furthermore, eating more fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk of death, overall, and deaths from heart disease/stroke and cancer. The American Heart Association suggests those who have a daily intake of 1,600 to 2,000 calories should get four to five servings of fruits and vegetables per day. However, the average American consumes — without counting potatoes — a total of just three servings of fruits and vegetables a day.\n\nPrior to the latest study, scientific research has shown a modest or no-benefit association with fruits and vegetables and cancer risk. Although a diet rich in these foods has been linked to good health, many of the studies that established this association were conducted on people who were already likely to be health conscious, and tended to only be locally representative of a population.\n\nThe team of researchers at the University of Liverpool in the UK sought to unveil if England’s recommended daily portions of fruits and veggies benefits the health of the general English population. They analyzed lifestyle data for more than 65,000 randomly selected adults aged at least 35 or older from the national health surveys for England between 2001 and 2008. The deaths among the sample size were recorded for an average of 7.5 years.\n\nThe participants were visited by an interviewer who collected demographic and socioeconomic data, health and health-related behaviors, measures on their height and weight, and even had a nurse to take waist circumference, blood pressure, blood samples, and medication use. On average, the survey respondents ate just under four portions of fruit and vegetables the previous day. During the study period 4,399 people, or 6.7 percent of the sample died.\n\nThe findings revealed those who ate at least seven daily portions of fruits and vegetables had a 42 percent lower risk of death from all causes, such as cancer and heart disease/stroke, after excluding deaths within the first year of the monitoring period. However, not all fruits and vegetables are created equal when it comes to their protective effects. Two to three daily portions of vegetable intake was linked to a 19 percent lower risk of death, compared with a 10 percent lower risk for the equivalent amount of fruit, says the press release. Each portion of salad or vegetables seemed to confer a 12 to 15 percent lower risk of death.\n\nSurprisingly for the researchers, a portion of frozen/tinned fruit seemed to increase the risk of death by 17 percent, as they found no evidence of significant benefit from fruit juice, canned, and frozen fruit. Canned fruit products are almost four times more popular than frozen fruit in Europe, according to the CBI market survey for the European Union market for frozen fruit and vegetables.\n\n""Most canned fruit contains high sugar levels and cheaper varieties are packed in syrup rather than fruit juice,"" said Dr. Oyinlola Oyebode of UCL\'s Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, lead author of the study, in the press release. ""The negative health impacts of the sugar may well outweigh any benefits.”\n\nDue to this finding, the researchers suggest the current dietary guidance, which includes the consumption of dried or tinned fruit, smoothies, and fruit juice as legitimate ways of reaching the “5-a-day” goal in England, might need to be revised. ""150 ml of freshly squeezed orange juice (sugar 13 g); 30 g of dried figs (sugar 14 g); 200 ml of a smoothie made with fruit and fruit juice (sugar 23 g) and 80 g of tinned fruit salad in fruit juice (sugar 10 g)...contain a total of some 60 g of refined sugar,"" they wrote. ""This is more than the sugar in a 500 ml bottle of cola.""\n\nOverall, the findings imply that even those who meet their recommended quota, may need to eat more fruits and veggies to ward off their risk of death. The study warrants further investigations into the effects of different types of fruit and vegetables. Eating fruits and vegetables is associated with a decreased mortality rate without displacing other foods from a person’s diet.\n\nSource: Gordon-Dseagu V, Mindell JS, Oyebode O, et al.

Allergies symptoms getting worse or flaring up sooner this year? You may be able to blame the wet winter we had. In the Jacksonville area, Channel 4 Meteorologist Blake Mathews says we had nearly four more inches of rain from January 1 to March 26, than we did last year. That\'s not counting the rain we\'ve had over the past couple of days. That wet weather has set the stage for a potentially bad allergy season.\n\n""We\'re a little worried that maybe it might be a bad allergy season, only because we had a lot of precipitation over the winter. And when you have a lot of precipitation, obviously, you have more water in the soil and plants can grow better. So, you get more plants, equals more pollen,"" explained Dr. Rachel Szekely who treats allergy patients at Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSzekely says she\'s seeing patients already feeling the effects. They\'re coming in complaining of itchy watery eyes, runny noses, and of course, sneezing. She says your best defense is to start taking your allergy medication now. It\'s important to get out in front of your symptoms because once they get really bad, they become difficult to control.\n\nPollen forecast | Worst cities for allergies\n\nYou should also keep in mind that pollen is worst at dusk and dawn. Szekely says rain, like we\'ve been seeing, will help wash some of the pollen away, but it will also bring about another concern.\n\n\n\n""The people with pollen allergies usually get better when it rains or the ground is damp. However, people who have mold allergy have a problem with that because the mold spores are in the air,"" she said.\n\nSzekely adds that keeping your windows closed and running the air conditioning, even on days that aren\'t so hot, can help keep allergens at bay.\n\nAnd as Channel 4\'s George Winterling often advises, you can also try rinsing off your shoes and taking a quick shower after being outside to keep pollen from lingering inside the home.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com.

The new robots are ""a technological leap forward in replacing large-incision abdominal surgeries (open surgery) with a minimally invasive approach,"" according to the press release.\n\nThe shares jumped 13% to $495.25 in morning trading, given that the new robots are no doubt positive for the company and stock. But what it means for growth remains unclear.\n\n""A key question will be whether \'new technology\' is in fact at the crux of Intuitive Surgical\'s slowing procedure growth and system placement trends in recent quarters or whether the headwinds Intuitive Surgical is facing in its growth deceleration are more structural (and long-lasting) in nature,"" writes Leerink Swann analyst Richard Newitter. ""[G]iven capital equipment purchase headwinds in the market broadly, right now it is unclear to us how many incremental systems sales the new robot will drive at this early stage, and whether the features of the new robot will in fact help drive higher utilization into new surgery areas that previously were not occurring.""\n\nWhile the company may see some sales jump in the near term, as hospitals delayed purchases waiting for a new system, the market for high-end robots has already been well saturated by Intuitive Surgical. And the latest da Vinci, given its high price point, will likely only be used to upsell current clients. It doesn\'t address the many hospitals that have not acquired robots due to price pressures.\n\nThe da Vinci robots cost several million dollars to purchase and hundreds of thousands of dollars to maintain. It may not be a surprise then, amid an environment of belt-tightening in the health-care industry, that 2013 marked the first time sales of Intuitive Surgical\'s robots fell. The company declined to provide sales guidance for the current year on its fourth-quarter conference call in January.\n\nS&P Capital IQ analyst Phillip Seligman reiterated a Strong Sell rating on the stock following the fourth-quarter report, writing that ""Intuitive Surgical expects da Vinci procedure count will grow 9%-12% in 2014, vs. 2013\'s 16% gain, but did not provide volume or revenue guidance, which we view as disappointing. Indeed, amid procedure deceleration despite the rise in general surgery, and hospital capital expenditure constraints...system sales may decline.""\n\nBarron\'s has long been skeptical about Intuitive Surgical. The shares are down more than 14% since an article early last year that questioned its growth prospects. (See Feature, ""Robots in Search of Added Employment,"" Jan. 26, 2013.) And this column warned of more problems to come last autumn. (See Barron\'s Take, ""Intuitive Surgical Not Cutting It,"" Oct. 22, 2013.) Shares are up 30% since then.\n\nYet at 32 times expected 2014 earnings per share, Intuitive Surgical is approaching 2013 valuation levels. And its expected long-term earnings growth rate is just 7%.\n\nGranted, international markets, while more price-sensitive than the U.S., represent a large runway for growth. And a floor exists for the stock given its monopoly and the razor-razorblade nature of its business.

We strive to provide the most advanced, least invasive option for surgery, and we are working hard to make minimally invasive surgery the standard of care.""\n\nWith the U.S. introduction now underway, Intuitive Surgical will be seeking regulatory clearances to market the da Vinci Xi System around the world.\n\nEfficient Anatomical Access, Crystal Clear 3D-HD Visualization\n\nBy enabling efficient access throughout the abdomen and chest, the da Vinci Xi System expands upon core da Vinci System features, including wristed instruments, 3D-HD visualization, intuitive motion, and an ergonomic design. As with all da Vinci Surgical Systems, the da Vinci Xi System\'s immersive 3D-HD vision system provides surgeons a highly magnified view, virtually extending their eyes and hands into the patient.\n\nCompared to prior da Vinci Systems, the da Vinci Xi System\'s key features include:\n\n* A new overhead instrument arm architecture designed to facilitate anatomical access from virtually any position. * A new endoscope digital architecture that creates a simpler, more compact design with improved visual definition and clarity. * An ability to attach the endoscope to any arm, providing flexibility for visualizing the surgical site. * Smaller, thinner arms with newly designed joints that offer a greater range of motion than ever before. * Longer instrument shafts designed to give surgeons greater operative reach.\n\nIn addition, the da Vinci Xi System is built to be compatible with Intuitive Surgical\'s Firefly™ Fluorescence Imaging System. While it is not currently available, we plan to seek regulatory clearance for use of Firefly Imaging with the da Vinci Xi System. This technology is currently available as an option with the da Vinci Si™ model, and it is used to provide the surgeon with additional visual information in a variety of surgical procedures by enabling real-time visualization and assessment of vessels, bile ducts and tissue perfusion.\n\nA System Designed For the Future\n\nThe da Vinci Xi System is an expandable technology platform that is designed to accommodate and seamlessly integrate a range of current technologies in areas such as imaging, advanced instruments and anatomical access, as well as future innovations.\n\nTo provide hospitals with choices to match their needs, Intuitive Surgical will continue to offer the current da Vinci Si System, which addresses a broad span of procedure complexity, and the da Vinci Si-e™ System, a lower-cost system suited for less complex surgeries.\n\nFor more information about the da Vinci Xi Surgical System, visit intuitivesurgical.com.', ""The da Vinci Xi System has broader capabilities than prior generations of the da Vinci System.\nAs with all da Vinci Surgical Systems, the da Vinci Xi System's immersive 3D-HD vision system provides surgeons a highly magnified view, virtually extending their eyes and hands into the patient.\nCompared to prior da Vinci Systems, the da Vinci Xi System's key features include:* A new overhead instrument arm architecture designed to facilitate anatomical access from virtually any position.\nIn addition, the da Vinci Xi System is built to be compatible with Intuitive Surgical's Firefly™ Fluorescence Imaging System.\nFor more information about the da Vinci Xi Surgical System, visit intuitivesurgical.com.""]"

The stock has a beta of 0.61 and a short float of 5.6% with 5.18 days to cover. Shares are up 13.3% year-to-date as of the close of trading on Friday.\n\nTheStreet Quant Ratings rates Intuitive Surgical as a buy . The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, notable return on equity, good cash flow from operations, expanding profit margins and growth in earnings per share. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.\n\nISRG has no debt to speak of therefore resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of zero, which we consider to be a relatively favorable sign. Along with this, the company maintains a quick ratio of 4.48, which clearly demonstrates the ability to cover short-term cash needs.\n\nThe return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Health Care Equipment & Supplies industry and the overall market, INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC's return on equity exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.\n\nNet operating cash flow has slightly increased to $229.10 million or 5.47% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC has also modestly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of 2.80%.\n\nThe gross profit margin for INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC is currently very high, coming in at 72.21%. Regardless of ISRG's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, ISRG's net profit margin of 28.84% significantly outperformed against the industry.\n\nINTUITIVE SURGICAL INC reported flat earnings per share in the most recent quarter. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. However, we anticipate underperformance relative to this pattern in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC increased its bottom line by earning $16.73 versus $15.96 in the prior year. For the next year, the market is expecting a contraction of 10.6% in earnings ($14.95 versus $16.73).\n\nYou can view the full Intuitive Surgical Ratings Report .\n\nHighlights from the ratings report include:"", ""Trade-Ideas LLC identified Intuitive Surgical ISRG ) as a pre-market leader candidate.\nCurrently there are 7 analysts that rate Intuitive Surgical a buy, 4 analysts rate it a sell, and 6 rate it a hold.\nThe gross profit margin for INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC is currently very high, coming in at 72.21%.\nDespite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, ISRG's net profit margin of 28.84% significantly outperformed against the industry.\nDuring the past fiscal year, INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC increased its bottom line by earning $16.73 versus $15.96 in the prior year.""]"

The arms can even be disconnected and reconnected mid-procedure if the doctors feel like swapping them around. According to Paul Millman, the company\'s Vice President of product development, a surgeon could disconnect the arm, rotate the whole boom a 180 degrees and reattach it in just a minute or two. Further, the endoscope used to see what\'s inside the body is far easier to set up and supposedly delivers sharper and more defined three-dimensional images. It can also now be attached to any arm, which lets the surgeon scope out the surgical area with more flexibility. The arms of the da Vinci themselves are now smaller, thinner and have a greater range of motion. Even the instrument shafts -- the sleeves that are inserted inside the incision -- are longer so that surgeons can probe further than before.\n\n""Say a surgeon is removing cancer in the uterus... He or she might need to explore other areas like near the diaphragm, or the stomach... there are different sites where the cancer is likely to spread,"" says Millman. ""With the new robot, you can now excise that cancer right in the same procedure."" He adds, ""Our goal is to take away the barriers from using this technology. We\'re removing steps and complications where we can."" As the FDA has just granted clearance to the da Vinci Xi, you probably won\'t see it in your local hospital any time soon.
