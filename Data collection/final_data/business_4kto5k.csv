13026,http://www.thestreet.com/story/12530333/1/is-the-stock-market-too-high-on-low-rates.html,business,"[""In the last week of February, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged concern over the strength of the economy in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. If you assumed that one of the nation's top economic officials expressing doubts about economic growth would be unsettling to the stock market, you would be wrong.\n\nIn love with low interest rates\n\nStocks instead rallied on news of Yellen's testimony -- such is the upside-down logic of stock prices and interest rates.\n\nThe reason the stock market liked Yellen's comments was that it raised the possibility that the Fed would slow the tapering of its quantitative easing program, thereby holding long-term interest rates down for a while longer.\n\nLow rates can be stimulative. Low interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, and thus easier to spend. However, whether Fed policy has succeeded in stimulating the economy is a matter of some debate. The Bureau of Economic Advisors recently downgraded its estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 to a real annual rate of 2.4 percent. This is quite a drop from the original estimate of 3.2 percent, and an even bigger plunge from the third quarter's growth rate of 4.1 percent. Once again, the economy has failed to sustain any momentum. Low rates make stocks look good by comparison. Technically, this has to do with using a lower interest rate to discount the value of future earnings. More intuitively, any investor can relate to the fact that low rates drive people toward the stock market. Savings account rates are near zero, and Treasury bond yields are less than 4 percent. Among conventional asset classes, stocks are the only option offering a solid chance for growth and beating inflation.\n\nYield comparison\n\nThe market has two reasons to applaud low interest rates:\n\nThe relative attractiveness of stocks is illustrated when you look at stocks in terms of yield. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 is about 2 percent -- certainly much better savings account rates and even most long-term CD rates , though not as high as long bond yields. However, since stocks do not pay out all of their earnings, stock analysts generally look at earnings yield (essentially, the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) more than dividend yield in valuing stocks.\n\nCurrently, the earnings yield on stocks is 5.7 percent, much higher than bank rates or bond yields. At the end of the 1990s, the earnings yield on stocks was 3.3 percent. At the time, 30-year Treasury yields were about 6.4 percent; today Treasury yields are down around 3.8 percent."", ""In love with low interest ratesStocks instead rallied on news of Yellen's testimony -- such is the upside-down logic of stock prices and interest rates.\nThe reason the stock market liked Yellen's comments was that it raised the possibility that the Fed would slow the tapering of its quantitative easing program, thereby holding long-term interest rates down for a while longer.\nLow rates can be stimulative.\nLow interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, and thus easier to spend.\nMore intuitively, any investor can relate to the fact that low rates drive people toward the stock market.""]"

Short -- less than three pages double-spaced -- it nevertheless conveyed what Chair Yellen brings to the table.\n\nHer remarks began with a few standard points about the mission of the Federal Reserve. In speaking of her own and the Fed\'s mission, she promised ""to help restore the health of the economy and promote a strong and stable financial system."" She noted that substantial progress had been made in the past several years, but that much remained to be done to achieve the twin goals of the Federal Reserve -- full employment and stable prices. She noted that ""the economy continues to operate considerably short of these objectives.""\n\nShe moved on to mention the steps the Board has taken to strengthen financial regulation and the steps it will take to implement the Dodd-Frank Act. She promised to continue former Chairman Bernanke\'s movement toward making the Federal Reserve more transparent and accountable through further improving communication with the public. These remarks echo those by Bernanke in 2010, when he emphasized the need for stronger regulation of the banking system to prevent another crisis and the role of improved communication with the public in restoring the public\'s faith in the banking system.\n\nBut there were also several parts of the speech that revealed something about where her passions lie, and how the Yellen era at the Fed is likely to differ from previous tenures.\n\nChair Yellen described the oath of office that she had just taken as ""a public promise to carry out [her] duties guided by no interest other than the public interest.""\n\nThen, she devoted the second-longest paragraph in her speech to extolling the skills and dedication of the ""men and women"" on the Fed\'s staff, emphasizing their integrity, tireless work, creativity and perseverance.\n\nFinally, in the climax of her speech she brought home the importance of the Fed\'s work to the average American, closing with this promise and an evocative description of what achieving that promise means to an unemployed worker:\n\nI promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and challenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy. The unemployment rate represents millions of individuals who are eager to work but struggling to provide for themselves and their families. When we make progress toward our goals, each job that is created lifts this burden for someone who is better equipped to be a good parent, to build a stronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation.\n\nFor me, an economist who has dedicated my life to advancing the status of women, experiencing first-hand Janet Yellen\'s elevation to this leadership position -- making her arguably the most powerful woman in the world -- was deeply moving.\n\nIndeed, the swearing-in ceremony -- in which her oath and speech were joyfully acknowledged by cheers and applause from the gathered guests and the many staff members crowding every inch of the Fed\'s atrium, balcony and sweeping stairways -- epitomized the rationale for the struggle to win such high for places for women. They often bring a different perspective to leadership, based on a lifetime of difference. A difference that tends to put people first.', 'Last week, at her ceremonial swearing in at the imposing atrium of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., Janet Yellen gave a remarkable speech.\nHer remarks began with a few standard points about the mission of the Federal Reserve.\nShe promised to continue former Chairman Bernanke\'s movement toward making the Federal Reserve more transparent and accountable through further improving communication with the public.\nBut there were also several parts of the speech that revealed something about where her passions lie, and how the Yellen era at the Fed is likely to differ from previous tenures.\nChair Yellen described the oath of office that she had just taken as ""a public promise to carry out [her] duties guided by no interest other than the public interest.""']"

Financial markets are in a renewed risk-off phase, with bond yields and equity markets falling. This resulted, in part, from more evidence of a softening in Chinese activity. But more recently it has followed Ukrainian developments. These look set to maintain the tone for the coming week, particularly with Sunday’s planned referendum. The coming week also sees the latest FOMC meeting, where forward guidance may change; the prospect of a rebound in US surveys; and the UK Budget.\n\n\n\nUkrainian crisis reaches key stage... The Ukrainian situation is delicately poised with a Crimean referendum planned for Sunday. There has been precious little sign of the hoped for “de-escalation” to date and EU officials have warned that a referendum could prompt further sanctions from Western governments. In turn these risk Russian retaliation. Markets will follow developments, but any signs of escalation may be most visible in crude oil and other energy prices as well as further risk-off moves in markets.\n\n\n\nFed to adjust guidance ... The coming week sees the FOMC’s latest policy meeting. We expect the Fed to continue to taper its asset purchases by a further $10bn, taking QE down to $55bn/month. A number of Fed speakers have discussed the high threshold for changing this path leaving any other outcome a major surprise. However, more uncertainty surrounds the Fed’s guidance. With unemployment at 6.7%, the Fed’s promise not to tighten policy before unemployment reaches 6.5% is close to expiry. The Committee have publicly discussed possible next steps and we think there is a good chance that Fed Chairwoman Yellen will use this month’s press conference to set out the next stages. The Fed has a number of options, but we suspect that, like the Bank of England, it will adopt more qualitative guidance and avoid another quantitative target. Unlike the Bank, the Fed also publishes FOMC participants forecasts of the policy rate. This will be a useful tool to reinforce any new forward guidance message. Markets will also watch the publication of the first of March’s surveys over the coming week. Extreme weather began to recede in March, and these surveys could signal a rebound in activity.\n\n\n\nUK Budget to avoid pre-election hype... Chancellor Osborne presents his latest Budget on Wednesday. With a General Election scheduled for next May, this will be the last Budget to meaningfully impact the economy before then. However, we expect the Chancellor to dash any hopes of pre-election stimulus. A recovery-inspired improvement in the headline public finances has done little to narrow a still elevated structural deficit. The Chancellor has promised a Budget of “hard truths”. We expect a fiscally neutral Budget helping to promote business investment and export potential.\n\n\n\nThe end of UK forward guidance? ... Before the Budget, the UK releases labour market figures. We expect employment growth to have slowed, but the unemployment rate is a closer call: we expect the rate to fall to 7.1%, but see it on the cusp of 7.0%, which would bring the first phase of the Bank’s guidance to a close (something we think will happen next month). With Governor Carney and MPC member Weale revealing differences in view this week, we will watch March’s MPC minutes for a fuller description of any divergences in views on the Committee.\n\n\n\nFinal euro area inflation the only highlight... Markets will pay closer attention than usual to final estimates of Euro area inflation on Monday. Otherwise the EU leaders’ summit should pass with little attention outside potential developments in the Ukraine.', 'A Crimean referendum on Sunday risks escalating tensions and impacting energy marketsFed tapering policy on course, but possible adjustment to forward guidanceUK Budget to avoid pre-election hype, delivering fiscally neutral, targeted measuresEmerging markets weigh on sentiment ...

13040,http://www.americanthinker.com/2014/03/food_price_inflation_scares_the_fed.html,business,"['Food Price Inflation Scares The Fed\n\nStock markets around the world fell today, led by the 246 point dive, or 1.5%, for the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 1.9% drop for German stock market index. Analysts generally pointed to worries about a shrinking Chinese lending and the potential trade war between Russia and the West, but I am more concerned that since the beginning of 2014 food prices have skyrocketed. The Federal Reserve must be concerned that their international support for “cheap money policies” to stimulate economic growth may be funding commodity speculation that is driving prices higher and creating wide spread misery. If the Fed decides to raise interest rates to dampen speculation, I believe stock and commodity prices are in for a hard fall. Margin debt on stocks is now higher than at its last peak in 2008, right before the stock and commodity markets crashed. This willingness to speculate on margin may also explain the big jump in food prices since the first of the year as shown below:\n\nCattle Hogs Grains Milk Coffee Over the next couple of months, the rise in wholesale commodity prices is going to start hitting consumer pocketbooks very hard. More worrisome, the rising price action will encourage morecommodity futures speculators to jump in and continue the rapid price escalation. If the Fed does not get ahead of this coming tsunami of greed, they will be in a similar situation as when food prices took off in 2008. In April of 2008, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that rising food prices could have terrible consequences for the world, including the risk of war. IMF Managing Director Dominque Strauss-Kahn called for action to keep inflation in check: ""Food prices, if they go on like they are doing today” ... “the consequences will be terrible,""… “Hundreds of thousands of people will be starving” ... “(leading) to disruption of the economic environment,”especially for developing nations where the bulk of their income is spent on the bare necessities for survival. Strauss-Hahn emphasized food inflation could destroy 10 years of development progress and spark social unrest: “As we know, learning from the past, those kind of questions sometimes end in war.” It is well known that the Great Credit Crunch of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed was caused by a build-up of speculative borrowing and investing after the 9/11 terrorist attack. What is not very well understood is that the Fed was forced to stop cutting interest rates during the financial crisis because of raging food price inflation The economic impacts of 9/11 threatened to drive America into a deep recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan began deeply cutting interest rates on September 17, 2001, which made it increasingly cheaper to borrow money. The cheap money policy led to strong growth, especially in the interest-sensitive housing sector as Americans started taking on more and more debt and stock and commodity investors took on more leverage. Despite inflation picking up, the Fed waited until 2004 to begin raising rates. Although the Fed moved up rates through 2005, investor frenzy continued as sub-prime lenders in 2006 actually increased the amount of money flowing to speculative investors. As the economy slowed rapidly in mid-2007, the Fed began slowly cutting rates. After Bear Stearns filed for bankruptcy on March 31, 2008, the Fed started cutting rates faster.But as the result of their experience with the stimulus features of 9/11 “cheap money policies”, speculators increased borrowing to buy more stocks and commodities on margin. The buying pressure sent food costs up over 30% and resulted in panic cries from the IMF and poor countries around the world for the Fed to stop driving up inflation and food prices by cutting interest rates. From April through August the Fed held its lending rate steady.But on September 15, 2008 the huge brokerage firm Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Over the next year, numerous financial institutions declared bankruptcy. Even major banks such as J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Citibank were all pushed to the brink. The cascading failures eventually culminated in the Fed’s bailout of AIG, and the government’s nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. There will always be international controversies that analysts try to associate with price movements in the stock markets, but seldom have international events had more than a temporary impact. The banking problems in China are significant and the Ukraine Crisis has increased international tension. But if their “cheap money policies” are now funding speculators that are driving up food prices, the Federal Reserve is going curb lending and drive up interest rates. Having failed to be vigilant against food inflation during the last economic crisis, the Federal Reserve may overreact this time.

Just chair.\n\n\n\nThis is consistent with her low-key professional advance to what some might consider the pinnacle of financial power. Although Yellen has done barrier-breaking work examining the pay gap between men and women, her way has always been to ignore gender issues or to address them obliquely. Instead, she seems to have preferred letting her achievements speak for themselves, while presumably counting on others to notice.\n\n\n\nJanet Yellen to succeed Ben Bernanke as Fed chair: what switch means for U.S.\n\nStill, while it\'s tempting to conclude from her success that this is all any woman needs to prosper, it\'s worth paying attention to some other key attributes that supported Yellen\'s rise.\n\nFirst, she had a strongly supportive spouse -- (Nobel Laureate) economist George Akerlof -- who worked in her field and understood how it worked. She moved for his job over their respective careers, but he also moved for hers. No one took a back seat. Smart women have no hope of being treated as an equal at work if they aren\'t treated that way at home. The supportive spouse is not just a logistical, but rather a psychological necessity.\n\nSecond, Yellen had a number of strong female allies. At Harvard University, where she once taught, Yellen collaborated with another rare female economist, Rachel McCulloch. They didn\'t spend their time lamenting the absence of women in their department, or the unlikelihood of tenure. Instead, the pair produced five papers together. Later on, Laura Tyson, who headed President Clinton\'s Council of Economic Advisers, recommended Yellen for the Fed.\n\n\n\nMoreover, it\'s arguable that Yellen would never have gotten a chance to lead the Fed had it not been for the active and vocal support of other women who were prepared to argue publicly that President Obama\'s first choice -- Lawrence Summers -- would not be acceptable.\n\n\n\nIn other words, it\'s seductive for women to imagine that just working hard is enough to make it to the top. This is what one senior lawyer recently described to me as the ""Cinderella myth."" The more pragmatic truth is that men and women alike need strong allies and collaborators -- people who notice them and want to encourage and are willing to fight for them when doing so for themselves would be counterproductive.\n\nWhen Yellen insists on the title of chair, she reminds us that leadership roles should have no gender attached to them -- not male, not female. Having experienced no small degree of sexism in her own career path, she appears to have no appetite for perpetuating it.\n\n\n\nIn this, she\'s entirely consistent with most of the female leaders I\'ve known, studied and profiled. When women run their own businesses, they typically create companies in which men and women alike can thrive. It\'s just another reason why we should celebrate the accession of women to power -- because everyone wins.', ""Although Yellen has done barrier-breaking work examining the pay gap between men and women, her way has always been to ignore gender issues or to address them obliquely.\nJanet Yellen to succeed Ben Bernanke as Fed chair: what switch means for U.S.\nLater on, Laura Tyson, who headed President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, recommended Yellen for the Fed.\nWhen Yellen insists on the title of chair, she reminds us that leadership roles should have no gender attached to them -- not male, not female.\nWhen women run their own businesses, they typically create companies in which men and women alike can thrive.""]"

But that tells only half the story: just as important for American families and businesses is how quickly the Fed will hike borrowing costs, and how high.\n\nThe Fed has telegraphed that the first rate rise is likely to come around the middle of next year, as long as the U.S. economy keeps healing, and policymakers are increasingly describing how the first tightening cycle in more than a decade will play out. It is an issue that Yellen, who took over as chair of the central bank last month, will almost certainly have to address after a policy meeting next week.\n\nThe plan for now is for a series of modest rate increases that do not risk sending the economy into relapse, according to Fed policymakers who have discussed it in recent weeks.\n\nWhile an unexpected jump in inflation or a dangerous asset bubble could force its hand, the central bank is likely to deliver a dovish message of patience when it comes to removing its extraordinary monetary stimulus.\n\n“What I’m anticipating is that the gradual rise in rates would acknowledge that there are still conditions out there that are sub-optimal,” Dennis Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed, said in an interview last week.\n\n“I can in no way predict exactly the conditions at that time,” he added. But “I don’t expect when we get to that point that we’re likely to have to move the policy rate up in large chunks to get it high fast.”\n\nAs with its easing cycle, the Fed will be in uncharted territory when the time comes to tighten.

The median forecast pointed to the third quarter.\n\n""You are looking at an unemployment rate that probably gets below 6 percent by the second half of 2015 and that\'s within a hair\'s breadth of full employment,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. ""It will start to push up wage growth by that period.""\n\nThe poll forecast the jobless rate averaging 6.4 percent this year. This suggests that as early as the second quarter of this year, the unemployment rate could breach the 6.5 percent level that Fed officials have said would trigger discussions over when to raise interest rates from near zero.\n\nPolicymakers, however, have made it clear that interest rates will remain low for a while even if the threshold for the unemployment rate is met and they are considering ways to revamp their forward guidance.\n\n""I think their commitment will be tested. They may start to raise interest rates sooner than the markets expect,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody\'s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe jobless rate was forecast falling to an average of 5.9 percent in 2015. Back in February, it had been estimated averaging 6.6 percent this year and 6.0 percent in 2015. The unemployment rate was at 6.7 percent last month.\n\nIn a vote of confidence in the economy, the Fed in December announced plans to scale back the amount of bonds it buys each month to help keep interest rates low, with the expectation it would wind down by the program by year end.\n\nAt that meeting, it dropped its purchases to $75 billion from $85 billion. It announced a further $10 billion reduction in January and is expected to announce another similar cut at its March 18-19 policy meeting.\n\nLABOR MARKET SLACK EASING\n\nWith slack in the labor market easing, wage growth is expected to accelerate later this year after being largely sluggish since the recovery started almost five years ago. A shortage of skilled workers in some industries is one reason.\n\nThe survey forecast nonfarm payrolls averaging 200,000 jobs per month in the second quarter after being held back by an unusually cold winter early in the year. First quarter job growth was forecast averaging 162,000 jobs per month.\n\nHowever, rising wages probably will not translate into a build-up in inflation as slowing growth in emerging markets puts downward pressure on commodity prices. Anticipated dollar strength is also expected to help curb inflation pressures.\n\nThe survey forecast consumer prices, excluding food and energy, staying below the Fed\'s 2 percent target through 2014.\n\nThe core Consumer Price Index was seen averaging 2 percent in the first quarter of 2015 and holding that level for the next two quarters.\n\nDespite a slow start as unusually cold weather took its toll, growth is expected to average 2.7 percent this year, which would be one of the strongest years since 2005 and a noticeable step up from last year\'s 1.9 percent.\n\nGross domestic product was forecast expanding at a 3.0 percent annual rate in the second quarter and sustaining that brisk pace for the rest of the year. First-quarter growth was estimated at a 1.9 percent pace. The economy grew at a 2.4 percent rate in the final three months of 2013.\n\nIn February\'s poll, GDP growth had been forecast at a 2.2 percent pace for the first three months of the year and at a 2.8 percent rate for April-June quarter.\n\nConsumers are expected to be the main drivers of growth, emboldened by higher wages, and rising house and stock market prices. The drag from fiscal policy is expected to be lighter this year.\n\n""There is a lot pent-up demand for autos and housing.

The trick for Yellen will be re-crafting the statement without changing expectations in markets, which currently don`t see a rate rise until midway through next year.\n\n""This is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6.5 percent threshold because it`s not really providing any great value,"" William Dudley, the influential president of the New York Fed, said last week. ""I`d rather do it before we reach the threshold rather than after.""\n\nFed officials have chalked up recent signs of economic weakness to unusually severe winter weather, and they appear intent to move ahead with another $10 billion reduction in their monthly bond-buying stimulus, taking it down to $55 billion.\n\nThat leaves a revamping of the forward guidance on rates as the focal point for debate when officials gather on March 18-19.\n\nThey will issue a policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on March 19. A half hour later, Yellen, the Fed`s former vice chair, will conduct her first news conference as head of the world`s most influential central bank.\n\nThe Fed will also release updated forecasts from its 17 policymakers for economic growth, inflation and unemployment. Most importantly, officials will revise their predictions for when they will finally begin to raise rates after more than five years of holding them close to zero.\n\nEVANS RULE\n\nAs it stands, the Fed has said it would not consider a rate rise until well after the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent, as long as inflation remains contained.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what will replace this guidance, which is the brainchild of Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, a stalwart Yellen ally who himself has acknowledged the thresholds have outlived their usefulness.\n\n""We have had discussions on the way to formulate the next vintage of this guidance for some time,"" Evans said on Monday. ""I can`t predict to you when we will pull the trigger.""\n\nWhat is clear is that the Fed will look well beyond the jobless rate in gauging the health of the labor market and deciding when to raise rates.\n\nYellen has emphasized the need to examine ""a broad range of indicators,"" including the number of part-time workers who want full-time work and the percentage of long-term unemployed.\n\n""The unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic for the state of the labor market,"" she told lawmakers last month.\n\nBut a clear message can be complicated to convey.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed publishes a ""spider chart"" plotting a range of data that, to the initiated, shows an overall improvement in labor conditions (http://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/labormarket/?d=1&s=tw)\n\nand the New York Fed this week released its own ""eight faces"" of the job market graphic to track a number of key indicators (http://www.newyorkfed.org/labor-conditions/).\n\n""The art in this is conveying information that helps people plan and financial markets align their expectations with ours,"" Dennis Lockhart, head of the Atlanta Fed, told Reuters last week.\n\nLabor market gauges are not the only things the Fed will be watching in making a judgment on when to raise rates.\n\nAs the jobless rate declined close to the Fed`s threshold, the central bank began to emphasize the low level of inflation, which is running well under its 2 percent target. It could redouble that emphasis as a way to underscore its commitment to keeping rates low for some time to come.\n\nUnder Yellen`s predecessor Ben Bernanke, the Fed`s post-meeting statement swelled in verbiage as the central bank packed increasingly more information into its written communications.\n\nGiven the difficulty of laying out clear guidance, that trend may be headed for a reversal under Yellen.', 'Fed officials have chalked up recent signs of economic weakness to unusually severe winter weather, and they appear intent to move ahead with another $10 billion reduction in their monthly bond-buying stimulus, taking it down to $55 billion.\nThat leaves a revamping of the forward guidance on rates as the focal point for debate when officials gather on March 18-19.\nEVANS RULEAs it stands, the Fed has said it would not consider a rate rise until well after the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent, as long as inflation remains contained.\n""The unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic for the state of the labor market,"" she told lawmakers last month.\nGiven the difficulty of laying out clear guidance, that trend may be headed for a reversal under Yellen.']"

To do this, many or all of the products featured here are from our partners. However, this doesn’t influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own.\n\nBy Jeff Stoffer\n\nLearn more about Jeff on NerdWallet’s Ask an Advisor\n\nLast month I talked about the rising cost of a favorite bottle of French wine. Only six dollars thirty years ago, the same bottle now costs $20. Assuming steady inflation, it could cost over $60 in 2044. I joked that the solution to the inflation problem is not to drink more wine now while it’s cheap. A friend responded, “That made me laugh, until I realized I might not be able to afford it in the future!”\n\nThe effects of inflation really hit home when we stop working and expenses increase faster than income. You might ask, how do I “know” inflation will continue in the future. Last month, I cited some statistics on historical inflation. This month, I’d like to examine some of the factors driving inflation.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve wants our economy to experience inflation. You may have heard the terms “quantitative easing” and “zero interest rate policy.” In plain English they mean, respectively, “printing money” and “keeping interest rates really low.” These policies, implemented in response to the recent financial crisis, are intended to restore growth and to battle deflation, the risk that prices fall (which is a much worse can of worms.) While they have helped avert a nasty deflationary spiral, employment growth is still insufficient. The Fed intends to continue these policies until the desired effect is achieved: more jobs and higher inflation.\n\nThe federal government also wants to encourage inflation. In the downturn it borrowed money to stimulate growth in the economy. Over time inflation decreases the value of the money borrowed. Inflation is good for borrowers and bad for lenders (bondholders.) Think of the bottle of wine. I borrow $20 to buy a bottle today. I pay interest every year (like a bond) and pay back the principal, $20, years later. By the time I pay it back, the $20 doesn’t buy as much as it did when I borrowed it, due to inflation. From the government’s point of view, inflation functions to reduce the debt burden. Pretty clever, huh?\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve and the government use inflation to their advantage, it hurts savers, bondholders and those living on “fixed incomes.” The effect is called “financial repression.” People who were doing OK living on the interest from savings and CD’s know well what this term means.

13062,http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/the-economy/articles/How-Much-Slack-US-Economy-Inflation/3/11/2014/id/54115,business,"['This article originally appeared on institutionalinvestor.com on March 5, 2014.To fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and full employment, the Federal Reserve has been guided by the Taylor rule since the 1990s. The Taylor rule goes something like this: The appropriate short-term interest rate (set by the central bank) is a function of the slack in the labor market and the difference between actual inflation and the inflation target. Until the Great Recession of 2008, the unemployment rate was a good-enough indicator of the labor slack. Hence, the Fed could set interest rates simply based on core inflation and the unemployment rate. Thanks to this framework, the Fed managed to be successful on the employment front, but even more so on the price stability front.But the situation has changed recently. On one hand, inflation was painfully low in 2013; on the other, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply. Which part of the dual mandate should the Fed favor?Some observers are arguing that the drop in the unemployment rate should result in earlier rate hikes. Writers of a few Fed blogs are citing a recent study from Robert Gordon of Northwestern University. They claim that short-duration unemployment (less than 26 weeks) is the best indicator of labor slack, and that since it has already fallen below prerecession averages (see Figure 1 below), the economy is at risk of overheating.\n\nMeanwhile, in her testimony to US Congress, freshly appointed Fed Chair Janet Yellen went in the opposite direction, saying there was probably more slack in the economy than what a naive look at the unemployment rate would indicate: ""Those out of a job for more than six months continue to make up an unusually large fraction of the unemployed, and the number of people who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job remains very high. These observations underscore the importance of considering more than the unemployment rate when evaluating the condition of the US labor market.""\x9dBoth sides have a legitimate point of view, but ""Gordon versus Yellen""\x9d is a bit like ""Ali versus Frazier.""\x9d They\'re both seasoned heavyweights. That the two can have such a stark difference of opinion about the unemployment rate underscores its questionable nature as an indicator. Most likely Yellen will have the last word, but she might also have her own agenda. Would she really be concerned by a bit too much inflation due to a tighter labor market?Based on PIMCO\'s bottom-up analysis, our outlook for 2014 inflation has core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) moving up to 1.6% year-over-year at the end of 2014, compared with the current 1.2% rate. Longer term, it really depends on what the Fed does.Since the unemployment rate may or may not be the right measure of output slack, it\'s not a reliable indicator for conducting monetary policy. We\'ll know (with a lag) if the economy has reached the end of the cyclical downturn when inflation picks up. Hence the Fed will have to choose between being behind the curve (waiting to see inflation actually pick up) and risking a hawkish mistake.The last time it chose to ignore weak inflation prints and started to discuss monetary policy tightening, Mihir Worah and I warned that the Fed would end up doing more quantitative easing to compensate for its hawkish mistake. That same month, Chairman Bernanke announced that when ""asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7%.""\x9d Now the Fed is still expanding its balance sheet while the unemployment rate is well below 7%.PIMCO expects that, balancing the risks between a hawkish mistake and some inflation overshoot, Yellen will choose the latter, especially since inflation has undershot the Fed\'s mandate by so much in recent years. Since 2009, inflation as measured by PCE has averaged 1.4%. Given a medium-term inflation target of 2.0%, inflation could average 2.6% for the next five years to catch up. Basically, we believe Yellen could wait for core PCE to move back to a solid 2% before she hikes the rate. Since the unemployment rate is an unreliable measure, we believe inflation should guide monetary policy. But it\'s up to the inflation jury to decide.In the meantime, investors can position their portfolios to benefit from this monetary policy framework. Shorter-duration assets should be ""safer""\x9d than longer-duration assets because they benefit from the low-for-longer policy rate stance, while longer duration will likely suffer from inflation uncertainties. We expect that strategies seeking carry from curve steepeners will perform well. The inflation premium should rise and, importantly, inflation uncertainties mean real assets should be less volatile than nominal ones.', ""Until the Great Recession of 2008, the unemployment rate was a good-enough indicator of the labor slack.\nHence, the Fed could set interest rates simply based on core inflation and the unemployment rate.\nOn one hand, inflation was painfully low in 2013; on the other, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply.\nSince the unemployment rate is an unreliable measure, we believe inflation should guide monetary policy.\nBut it's up to the inflation jury to decide.In the meantime, investors can position their portfolios to benefit from this monetary policy framework.""]"

Consequently, the Lakemaid Brewing Company has developed its very own beer-delivery drone.\n\nLakemaid has posted a video of its successful and interesting project, showing how it delivered a 12-pack of its popular frosty Winter Lager to an ice fishing location near Lake Millie Lacs.\n\nThe drone had the 12-pack strapped to it and took off to the delivery spot, successfully carrying its package to the desired destination. The video sparked mixed reactions, however. While some found it very cool and would love to have their beer delivered by a drone, others have expressed concerns regarding privacy, as droned are often used for military surveillance purposes.\n\nAside from concerned citizens, the FAA is among the most prominent forces against this whole drone delivery project. The FAA has very strict rules when it comes to unmanned flying vehicles, and Lakemaid's effort was deemed illegal, according to a report.\n\nMore specifically, the use of delivery drones per se is not illegal, but the FAA's restrictions are quite strict. Drones should not fly over 400 feet high, and should not fly over populated areas, for instance. The devices must weigh less than 55 pounds and can be used for delivery, but not for commercial purposes.\n\nWhile we're sure it was quite recreational to see a drone deliver a 12-pack of beer, there is a strong commercial factor in this equation. This puts Lakemaid's effort in violation of the FAA's restrictions. Consequently, the brewery has received a cease and desist order from the FAA, citing the violations in question.\n\nAs it turns out, beer delivery by drone may not be an option available in the very near future, but you can't say Lakemaid hasn't tried. Moreover, despite all criticism and FAA warnings, Lakemaid surely got some good publicity.

That means drones with which Amazon.com wants to deliver packages might win approval faster than unmanned cargo jets.\n\nAn FAA rule requires aircraft to see and avoid other aircraft, but drones lack that ability. The next generation of detection systems using GPS require aircraft to transmit their position and speed, but fitting all aircraft with the systems will be expensive, Jack Langelaan, an associate professor of aerospace engineering at Penn State University, said.\n\n""Until this is solved I don\'t expect to see regular flights of large, unmanned cargo planes in the national airspace,"" Langelaan said by email.\n\nAt Griffiss International Airport in Rome, N.Y., a research consortium will study avoidance technology. Griffiss is one of six sites that the FAA selected at the end of 2013 to conduct research that will help develop procedures for permitting flights of commercial drones.\n\nLarry Brinker, the executive director of NUAIR Alliance, the organization overseeing the effort at Griffiss, is a former cargo pilot. He said FedEx and United Parcel Service have expressed interest in drones. The Cessna Caravans that air freighters use on regional hops could be modified to fly without pilots when regulations allow, Brinker said.\n\nLangelaan said colleagues at universities around the country hope drones will help them take measurements in the atmosphere, inside the mouth of volcanoes and inside storm clouds that will swirl into tornadoes.\n\nDrones also might help take surveys of wildlife, wetlands and minelands.\n\nEnergy companies think drones can monitor pipelines and power plants.\n\nLocal governments can keep tabs on land use from the air, whereas realtors can show properties with videos that drones take.\n\nNews organizations could use drones to compile traffic reports, and filmmakers have used drones in movies.\n\nIn 2011 a filmmaker was flying a radio-controlled plane that was made of Styrofoam and weighed 4½ pounds over the University of Virginia to take video and photos for advertisements.\n\nThe FAA fined him $10,000, but an administrative law judge with the National Transportation Safety Board dismissed the fine on March 6.\n\nIn the ruling, the judge faulted the FAA\'s reasoning, which he said would have led to unintended consequences such as regulating paper airplanes or balsa-wood gliders. The ruling briefly cast doubt on the FAA\'s authority to regulate drones, but the FAA appealed and obtained a stay until the full board hears the case.\n\nkjackson@standardspeaker.com', 'Live video of wildfires from drones could help ground crews plan attacks and protect themselves.\nLast year, the agency also let public safety agencies fly drones weighing less than 4.4 pounds during daylight if the drones fly below 400 feet and stay within sight of the operator.\nOther countries let businesses fly drones sooner.\nAn FAA rule requires aircraft to see and avoid other aircraft, but drones lack that ability.\nNews organizations could use drones to compile traffic reports, and filmmakers have used drones in movies.']"

The system denies basic services to those who relocate without permission, fanning social unrest.\n\n\n\nChina\'s leaders, however, will make it easier for rural migrants to obtain residency status in smaller cities, with the intention of helping to unlock the nation\'s huge potential domestic demand.

China plans to raise this to 60 per cent of the total population by 2020 - on a par with that of developing countries with similar per capita income levels as China and lower than the average of 80 per cent for developed countries.\n\nXinhua said the plan states that regular railways will cover cities with more than 200,000 residents by 2020 and high-speed railways will connect those with more than half a million residents.\n\nChina's urbanisation first picked up pace with market reforms in the early 1980s. By 2011, half the country's population had moved into cities. However, a rigid, decades-old household registration system that assigns either urban or rural status under the old planned economy means tens of millions of migrants officially remain residents of their rural hometowns and have limited education, health and pension benefits in the cities, fuelling discontent nationwide.\n\nXinhua said only 35.7 per cent of the country's people had urban status by the end of 2013 and the full claims to public urban services that this entails. It said the plan calls for residents with city status to account for about 45 per cent of the total population by 2020."", ""The plan says rural residents employed in cities will see their incomes rise, increasing consumption, while investment in urban infrastructure, public service facilities and housing will drive economic development.\nAt present, permanent urban residents make up 53.7 per cent of the population of almost 1.4 billion.\nBy 2011, half the country's population had moved into cities.\nXinhua said only 35.7 per cent of the country's people had urban status by the end of 2013 and the full claims to public urban services that this entails.\nIt said the plan calls for residents with city status to account for about 45 per cent of the total population by 2020.""]"

13110,http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/65597-Amazon-Raises-Fee-for-Prime-Shipping,business,"['After floating the idea that it might raise the fee for Prime shipping to $119 from the current $79, Amazon settled on a $20 increase, to $99 per year. In states where Amazon collects sales tax, the fee will be over $100 because Amazon charges sales tax on the service. The increase becomes effective for those signing up as new subscribers on March 20 and on April 17 for renewing subscribers. This is the first price increase since the service launched in 2005. The special student price increases from $39 to $49. Amazon announced the increase to it subscribers via email messages.\n\nWhy Did Amazon Increase the Fee?\n\nAmazon could add $500 million to its bottom line if it does not lose too many customers. It needs this revenue because of its thin margins. Despite the fee increase, shipping will still be a net loss for the company. Brokerage service BGC analyst Colin Gillis wrote in a research note, ” The shipping losses the company incurs to help drive revenue remain a barrier to profitability…Shipping losses are growing at approximately 23% YoY [year over year], and the losses were approximately 2x the shipping revenue in the December quarter….Even if shipping revenue in the most recent quarter increased 40% to $1.59 billion, shipping losses would still be 47% greater than the losses.”\n\nMost orders over $35 will continue to be eligible for free shipping for people who do not belong to the Prime program. However, Prime includes much more than just shipping. Since starting the subscription service, Amazon has added unlimited access to over 40,000 movies and TV episodes via Prime Instant Video. It also provides access to more than 500,000 books for borrowing from the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. To placate customers who may consider leaving because of the fee hike, Amazon is likely to soon roll out a streaming music service similar to Apple’s iTunes Radio. And over the past few years, the company has hinted that it is working on a set-top television box to compete with Roku.\n\nWall Street Reaction\n\nAs the increase became public on the morning of May 13, the stock rose to its second highest value this year, $382. However, by day’s end the stock had fallen to $371. The analyst community is split on whether this is an increase that loyal Prime customers will be willing to absorb or if customers will leave the program in droves. One competitor jumped into the fray quickly. On the same day Amazon revealed the fee increase, online merchant ShopRunner announced its intention to lure Amazon Prime customers by offering a free one-year membership to its own $79 shipping service. (See “Amazon Prime, ShopRunner Forcing Faster Free Shipping,” our article last Fall, for more.)\n\nAnalysts state that Prime members spend twice as much as other Amazon shoppers, well over $1,200 a year. Those Amazon customers who are interested only in free shipping and not streaming entertainment or Kindle books may be more willing to leave the Prime service and take their chances with free shipping on orders over $35. While Amazon has never revealed how many Prime subscribers it has, analyst estimates put the number at 20 to 25 million.\n\nThird Party Sellers\n\nOn the Amazon Sellers’ Forum, Amazon Marketplace sellers have discussed the potential price increase for months. Some believe that they will lose customers as a result of the increase as people abandon Prime. But others expect most customers to take the increase in stride. It turns out that sellers are enthusiastic customers on Amazon as well as sellers and one said, “I did the math on my hard good orders for 2013 the other day. I paid .13 per shipment via Prime for shipping. I wasn’t kidding when I said I buy almost everything on Amazon.”\n\nIt will be difficult to determine if Amazon loses Prime subscribers because the company does not report membership figures. The company is betting that those who are in the habit of buying frequently on Amazon may find it difficult to kick the habit.', 'After floating the idea that it might raise the fee for Prime shipping to $119 from the current $79, Amazon settled on a $20 increase, to $99 per year.\nDespite the fee increase, shipping will still be a net loss for the company.\nOn the same day Amazon revealed the fee increase, online merchant ShopRunner announced its intention to lure Amazon Prime customers by offering a free one-year membership to its own $79 shipping service.\n(See “Amazon Prime, ShopRunner Forcing Faster Free Shipping,” our article last Fall, for more.)\nThose Amazon customers who are interested only in free shipping and not streaming entertainment or Kindle books may be more willing to leave the Prime service and take their chances with free shipping on orders over $35.']"

13120,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/15/is-amazon-prime-worth-99-a-year.aspx,business,"['If you haven\'t checked your email inbox this week (or opened a newspaper or turned on a television), you\'re probably going to be in for a shock: Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is raising the price of Amazon Prime.\n\nSo it would appear Jeff Bezos wasn\'t bluffing. As you may recall, the Amazon CEO warned investors last month that, in order to keep up with the rising costs of ""fuel and transportation,"" plus the continuous building out of Amazon\'s digital libraries for Kindle e-book sharing and video viewing, the company was probably going to have to raise the cost of Prime.\n\nFor nine long years, Amazon has held the price of its two-day free delivery service at a steady $79 per year, even as time, and inflation, marched merrily along. The popularity of Prime has helped grow Amazon\'s sales strongly, but its cost has been a big contributor to the fact that, with a net profit margin of less than 0.4%, Amazon is about nine times less profitable than Wal-Mart -- and makes even less profit per dollar of goods sold than does Bezos\' supposedly beleaguered rivals at Best Buy.\n\nRaising the annual cost of Prime by $20 to $99 might not change that. Or it might. It all depends on how customers react.\n\n$99? It\'s a bargain!\n\nThe way I look at it, you can think of Amazon Prime in one of two ways:\n\nAs an all-you-can-eat two-day free delivery subscription, with Kindle lending and video streaming fringe benefits, or\n\nAs an alternative to Netflix for video streaming, with book borrowing and free shipping on the side.\n\nEither way, Prime passes muster. According to a widget set up by our friends at Slate.com, your average Amazon shopper saves money on deliveries with Prime (at the new price) so long as he or she makes at least 25 orders from Amazon a year. This is assuming that the orders you place would cost only the minimum charge of $3.99 per delivery, though. In truth, one single delivery of a bulky, heavy item, needed quickly, can cost enough to justify a Prime subscription all on its own.\n\nMeanwhile, viewed as a video streaming service, Prime\'s new price of $99 a year is almost identical to the yearly cost of a $7.99-per-month subscription to Netflix. It only takes one order for free delivery of an actual, physical product from Amazon to make Prime a better bargain than Netflix.\n\nThat\'s the view from a customer\'s perspective. From an investor\'s point of view, though, Amazon\'s in a stickier wicket.\n\n$99? Never!\n\nAccording to the company, ""tens of millions"" of customers now subscribe to Prime. Taking a conservative view of that boast, let\'s assume that there are 20 million paying Prime customers out there today, paying Amazon $1.58 billion for Prime service annually.\n\nWere all 20 million to stick around and pay the $20 price hike on Prime, Amazon would receive a $400 million boost in revenue -- which would presumably drop straight to the bottom line, more than doubling the company\'s annual profit. This is almost certainly what investors, who have bid up Amazon shares by about 2% since the Prime price hike was announced, are hoping will happen.\n\nBut here\'s the thing: According to a recent survey of Amazon Prime customers that was commissioned by investment bank UBS, 42% of members will likely cancel their Prime memberships in response to the service\'s $20 price hike. Again, applying this percentage to a presumed 20 million Prime members, this means it\'s at least possible Amazon could see revenue decline as a result of the price hike, rather than rise.\n\nRemove those 42% of Prime members from the revenue stream and, even with the price hike, Amazon could end up taking in as little as $1.15 billion in Prime revenue -- a 28% decline.\n\n(In case you\'re curious, I\'ve run similar calculations assuming that Amazon Prime actually has 30 million or even 40 million members; the conclusion is the same. In fact, the more Prime members Amazon has, the bigger the risk of lost revenue if those customers follow through on their threat and drop their Prime subscriptions).\n\nFoolish takeaway\n\nThere are of course caveats to these calculations. For example, Amazon often boasts that Prime members spend more on its website than do non-Prime members. Accordingly, each Prime member lost could have an even bigger impact on Amazon\'s annual sales numbers than the calculations above suggest, focusing as they do solely on the effect on Prime revenue.\n\nConversely, if Prime members drop the service but keep on shopping -- and paying more for shipping -- Amazon\'s revenue loss could be much smaller than we fear.\n\nAll I can say for certain at this point is that the investors who have been bidding up Amazon shares steadily following the Prime price hike announcement may not be seeing the whole picture. Even if Prime is still a good deal for Amazon\'s customers, the risks for shareholders may be greater than they seem.', ""Taking a conservative view of that boast, let's assume that there are 20 million paying Prime customers out there today, paying Amazon $1.58 billion for Prime service annually.\nRemove those 42% of Prime members from the revenue stream and, even with the price hike, Amazon could end up taking in as little as $1.15 billion in Prime revenue -- a 28% decline.\n(In case you're curious, I've run similar calculations assuming that Amazon Prime actually has 30 million or even 40 million members; the conclusion is the same.\nIn fact, the more Prime members Amazon has, the bigger the risk of lost revenue if those customers follow through on their threat and drop their Prime subscriptions).\nFor example, Amazon often boasts that Prime members spend more on its website than do non-Prime members.""]"

It’s the first price increase since Amazon rolled out the service in 2005.\n\nThe move could please investors at a time when Amazon continues to face pressure to boost its bottom line after years of furious growth. As more Americans shop online, Amazon has spent heavily to expand its business into new areas – from movie streaming to e-readers and groceries – often at the expense of its profit.\n\nBut the price increase also threatens to scare away online shoppers who tend to resist fee increases. The company, which warned in January it would probably raise the price of Prime by $20 to $40, is bolstering the membership program by adding items available for two-day shipping and rolling out a greater selection of streaming TV shows and movies.\n\nStill, online shoppers don’t always react favorably to price increases – for example, when Netflix tried to raise its annual subscription fee in 2011. The online video streaming service had to do an about-face after widespread customer backlash and a jarring stock plunge of 80 percent from its highs.\n\nSocial media was buzzing Thursday after Amazon announced the price increase. Prime users’ comments fell equally on either side of the fence between those who didn’t mind the increase and those who planned to stop using the program.\n\nNick Begley ordered from Amazon 53 times last year, everything from Curious George books for his toddler to a car phone charger. Begley, 33, says he shops at Amazon more since joining Prime in 2012 and is hooked on the convenience.\n\n“It’s my go-to retail site,” says the resident of Salisbury Mills, N.Y. “$79 was a great price, but $99 is not enough for me to give it up.”\n\nRick Valente, who lives in Boston, felt the opposite way. After learning of the increase, he checked how much he actually uses Amazon: He realized Prime wasn’t worth it for him.\n\n“It was never worth it to begin with, and it definitely isn’t worth it with the price increase,” says Valente, 25.\n\nAmazon stressed in an email to members Thursday that it has not raised the price on Prime in nine years even though fuel and transportation costs have increased, it’s added new services, and the number of products available for two-day shipping has grown to 20 million from 1 million.\n\nThe company doesn’t disclose how many Prime members it has but said in December that it has “tens of millions” of members worldwide.\n\nAnalysts say that if Prime users are turned off by the increase, it could have a significant impact on Amazon’s business. Since it was introduced, Prime has increased customers’ appetite for speedy and reliable service, said Jordy Leiser, CEO of StellaService, which tracks customer service. Although Amazon doesn’t release data, analysts say Prime members are more loyal and spend more money on the site than non-Prime subscribers.\n\n“The intersection of consistency and convenience for these customers has attracted so many people,” Leiser says.\n\nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge, who estimates there are about 23 million U.S. prime members, says he doesn’t expect the continued growth of Prime members to slow despite the price increase.\n\nInvestors, who along with analysts have been split on whether heavy investment at the expense of profit is the best strategy for Amazon, kept shares nearly flat on Thursday. After rising slightly in the morning, shares slipped 2 cents to $370.62 later in the day. The stock is down 7 percent since the beginning of the year.\n\n“Some investors will continue to voice concern about Amazon’s seemingly endless appetite for investment,” said Citi Investment Research analyst Mark May in a client note. “We, on the other hand, continue to believe these investments make sense of driving long-term growth and greater absolute profits … over time.”', 'Amazon is betting that shoppers will pay $20 more for its popular Prime two-day free shipping and video streaming service of movies and TV shows.\nIt’s the first price increase since Amazon rolled out the service in 2005.\nThe company doesn’t disclose how many Prime members it has but said in December that it has “tens of millions” of members worldwide.\nAlthough Amazon doesn’t release data, analysts say Prime members are more loyal and spend more money on the site than non-Prime subscribers.\nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge, who estimates there are about 23 million U.S. prime members, says he doesn’t expect the continued growth of Prime members to slow despite the price increase.']"

In our view, Amazon Prime helps to amplify the first two drivers, and as such, we see little likelihood of meaningful churn from the price increase.

13129,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/15/the-new-amazon-prime-price-increase-is-a-risky-mov.aspx,business,"['In late January, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) CFO Tom Szkutak told investors that Amazon was thinking about raising the Amazon Prime price by $20-$40 this year. This week, the company confirmed that the price of a Prime subscription will rise by $20 to $99, starting next week for new sign-ups and next month for renewals.\n\nAmazon shareholders seemed to like the move, sending Amazon stock up on a down day for the market. However, while the Prime price increase should improve Amazon\'s earnings somewhat, that won\'t necessarily lead to good results for shareholders. Any decrease in Amazon\'s revenue growth from people who drop Prime could cause severe multiple contraction, more than offsetting earnings growth.\n\nThe case for a price increase\n\nWhen Szkutak announced the potential price increase in late January, he stated that Prime usage and shipping costs have been rising for years. However, in the program\'s nine-year history, Amazon had never raised the price. A price increase would offset Amazon\'s rising Prime-related expenses.\n\nMany analysts -- including The Motley Fool\'s own David Hanson -- think virtually all current Prime members will accept the price increase. Bullish analysts argue that Prime customers get a lot of value out of the service.\n\nFurthermore, $99 is a very reasonable price considering all of the features that come with a Prime membership, including free two-day shipping on most items, free access to books in the Kindle Lending Library, and more than 40,000 streaming movies and TV episodes through Prime Instant Video.\n\nIf everybody is willing to pay an extra $20, then there is no downside to raising prices. In fact, by demonstrating its long-term pricing power, Amazon would give investors greater certainty about its ability to deliver huge profits in the decades ahead.\n\nThe flip side\n\nHowever, what if some current Prime members aren\'t willing to pay an extra $20 a year? Many Amazon Prime members have stated that they won\'t renew if the price increases.\n\nIt\'s true that people often don\'t follow up on their stated intentions from a survey. However, these surveys have found that about half of all Prime members would not renew at a higher price.\n\nIf just 10% of Amazon\'s Prime membership base decides to drop the service rather than pay more, this would have a noticeable impact on revenue growth. The law of large numbers is already starting to cut into Amazon\'s growth rate. Any loss of Prime subscribers would aggravate this trend.\n\nTo be clear, the risk isn\'t that Amazon\'s revenue suddenly stops growing. However, analysts are currently expecting the company to post revenue growth of approximately 20% for the next two years. If Amazon\'s revenue growth instead drops to 15% by next year, the stock would probably warrant a lower earnings multiple.\n\nA Prime price increase might bring in an extra $300 million to $400 million of ""free"" revenue next year, according to analyst Mark Mahaney. After tax, that would add around $0.40-$0.50 to Amazon\'s earnings -- not very much at all compared with Amazon\'s roughly $370 stock price. The downside risk from multiple contraction is a lot greater than the upside from profit growth.\n\nA familiar sight\n\nThe gushing about Amazon\'s price increase from bullish analysts reminds me of the 2011 Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) price increase. By now, many people may have forgotten that Netflix stock peaked at more than $300 the day after Netflix announced its price increase. At the time, analysts were bullish on the potential for higher prices to boost Netflix\'s profit margins.\n\nNetflix stock eventually made it back to $300 (and beyond), but only after investors got a huge scare -- and many probably dumped their Netflix stock when it was well below its July 2011 high. Analysts simply underestimated how many customers would drop Netflix over a $6-a-month (or 60%) price increase.\n\nOf course, Amazon is not raising the Prime price by 60%. While its 25% price increase is risky, a 50% increase to $119 would have been far more likely to chase away subscribers. Still, the ""Netflix 2011"" scenario may repeat itself in miniature with Amazon over the next year or two. A slowdown in revenue growth below 20% could make a lot of investors more wary of Amazon\'s sky-high valuation.\n\nFoolish conclusion\n\nAmazon\'s decision to raise the Prime membership price should boost the company\'s profitability, but not in a ""game-changing"" way. On the other hand, if enough people drop Prime that Amazon\'s revenue growth slows, Amazon stock could take a big hit, as its valuation is driven by investors\' expectations for rapid revenue growth.\n\nThus, while there is potential upside for Amazon investors if revenue growth continues without a blip, the potential downside is a lot more significant. Amazon\'s decision to raise the Prime price is the riskiest move it has made in many years.', ""In late January, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) CFO Tom Szkutak told investors that Amazon was thinking about raising the Amazon Prime price by $20-$40 this year.\nHowever, while the Prime price increase should improve Amazon's earnings somewhat, that won't necessarily lead to good results for shareholders.\nMany analysts -- including The Motley Fool's own David Hanson -- think virtually all current Prime members will accept the price increase.\nA familiar sightThe gushing about Amazon's price increase from bullish analysts reminds me of the 2011 Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) price increase.\nWhile its 25% price increase is risky, a 50% increase to $119 would have been far more likely to chase away subscribers.""]"

When existing Prime members have their subscriptions run out, they will pay $99, while Amazon Student members will pay $49. However, if customers sign up for Prime within the next seven days they can lock in the lower rate of $79 for the first year.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said it could generate an additional $460 million in revenue for the company, as the company continues to add subscribers. ""Purchases are habitual and are not impacted by seasonality for Prime members at this point.""\n\n\n\nWATCH: Amazon Hikes Amazon Prime Price for First Time in Nine Years\n\nSome have considered the move controversial, suggesting that raising the price of Prime 25% will cause mass defections to other services, including Netflix (NFLX - Get Report), which competes with Prime from a content perspective. Amazon Prime also offers users free, two-day shipping on goods ordered from Amazon\'s Web site.\n\nTheStreet conducted a survey earlier this year, when the company announced it was first considering raising the price of the service. Of the more than 1,000 people surveyed between Jan. 31, 2014 and Feb. 2, 2014, 70.1% of respondents said ""no"" when asked if they thought the service was worth having at a higher price, regardless of whether they currently use it or not. Just 13% of the sampling subscribed to Prime.\n\nOthers have done surveys as well, and found similar results. UBS partnered with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners and found that while 94% of consumers would review at the $79 annual fee, that number dropped sharply with a price increase. Only 58% of those surveyed would renew if the price rose by $20, and just 24% said they would renew their memberships if the price rose by $40, to $119 annually. At the time of the survey, Amazon was considering raising the price between $20 and $40.\n\n""Our survey results call into question our prior views about the value that a broad set of consumers are applying to the current iteration of Amazon Prime,"" UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note, downgrading the stock.\n\nAmazon has never fully disclosed the exact number of Amazon Prime users it has, but Macquarie analyst Ben Schacter recently confirmed with Amazon that it had more than 20 million members without being more specific.\n\nThe move comes as Amazon is getting ready to introduce a set-top bo to compete with others in the marketplace, including ones from Apple (AAPL - Get Report), Google (GOOG - Get Report) and Roku.

13137,http://www.nasdaq.com/article/amazon-hikes-prime-fee-to-99-analyst-blog-cm335532,business,"[""E-Commerce giant Amazon.com ( AMZN ) has announced an increase in its prime membership annual fee to $99 from $79, representing a 25% hike.\n\nAmazon's Prime service that provides two-day free shipping was priced at $79 since its launch in 2005. Recently, Amazon beefed up the service with the addition of online video streaming and the kindle library. Amazon's kindle library includes above 500,000 Kindle titles and more than 40,000 movies and TV episodes for streaming via Prime Instant online video.\n\nThe move comes as Amazon is facing intense bottom-line pressure. The increase in shipping costs and fuel price hike forced the company to raise the price. In the last reported quarter, the company's net shipping expenses surged 19% to $1.21 billion. The price hike could negatively impact subscriber growth amid significant competition from Netflix ( NFLX ).\n\nThe prime service has been expanding considerably over the years, with new Prime membership signups exceeding more than the company's expectations during peak periods in December. Seeing the strong demand for the service, Amazon could increase the prices without affecting growth to a great extent. Though the number of prime subscribers has not been revealed, analysts expect the online retail giant has 20 to 25 million prime members in the U.S.\n\nThis strategic move could help Amazon to improve its top line and margin profile while still generating healthy growth in the future. Additionally, the company's partnerships with major film studios and production houses have helped it to expand its content portfolio faster than its rivals.\n\nAlso, Amazon is rumored to be launching a television set-top box (STB) which will stream video content. The STB will not only compete directly with Apple Inc. 's ( AAPL ) Apple TV but also with similar products from Roku Inc. and Boxee Inc., as well as gaming consoles from Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) and Sony Corp. that offer video programming.\n\nWe believe the company's ever expanding content portfolio will continue to attract subscribers despite the price rise.\n\nHowever, significant competition from eBay, Google and other online retailers remain a matter of concern. Additionally, Amazon's continuing investments in fulfillment centers could hurt profitability, going forward.\n\nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nAPPLE INC (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nAMAZON.COM INC (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nMICROSOFT CORP (MSFT): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nNETFLIX INC (NFLX): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."", ""E-Commerce giant Amazon.com ( AMZN ) has announced an increase in its prime membership annual fee to $99 from $79, representing a 25% hike.\nAmazon's Prime service that provides two-day free shipping was priced at $79 since its launch in 2005.\nThe prime service has been expanding considerably over the years, with new Prime membership signups exceeding more than the company's expectations during peak periods in December.\nSeeing the strong demand for the service, Amazon could increase the prices without affecting growth to a great extent.\nAPPLE INC (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportAMAZON.COM INC (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis ReportMICROSOFT CORP (MSFT): Free Stock Analysis ReportNETFLIX INC (NFLX): Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.""]"

The People's Bank of China (PBoC) said Saturday it would allow the yuan to move up or down two percent daily - double the previous one percent - either side of a mid-point set under the guidance of the bank, which says it polls market makers. The yuan was trading at 6.1625 to the dollar by early afternoon Monday, the first trading day after the reform, compared with Friday's close of 6.1502, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System. Analysts said the move to widen the band would introduce greater volatility in trading on the national foreign exchange market, but stressed the central bank could still exercise control over the yuan. “We view this move as another major step in the direction of allowing the market to play a more important role in exchange rate setting,” investment bank Goldman Sachs said in research note released Monday.\n\nBut it added: “If the PBoC wish they can still move the rate in the direction they want, since this band only affects how much (the) rate can move intra-day.”\n\nPolicymakers have pledged to move gradually towards full convertibility of the yuan - also known as the renminbi -\n\nallowing it to be freely bought and sold, and bringing with it the uncontrolled movement of funds in and out of China.\n\nChina keeps a tight grip on its capital account - investment and financial transactions, rather than those related to trade -\n\non worries that unpredictable flows of funds could harm the economy and reduce its control over it.\n\nBeijing has widened the trading band previously, most recently moving from 0.5 percent to one percent in 2012.

This decision is possibly another sign that Beijing is gradually lessening the central bank's intervention and increasing the role of market forces.\n\n\n\nAccording to Richard Kelly, Head of European Rates and FX Research at TD Securities, the move “comes as little surprise beyond just the timing given the moves to clear out speculators in recent weeks.”\n\n\n\nThe string of disappointing data coming out of China recently, with a wider than estimated trade deficit are also weighing on the yuan as they “perhaps provide some fundamental rationale to give the authorities in China a credible platform to induce CNY volatility,” the RBS team of analysts suggest, adding that “they also increase the risk associated with potential excesses in the Chinese financial system.”\n\n\n\nNevertheless, concerns about systemic risk are not high, as it is expected that Chinese authorities have the situation under control and that they would prevent any serious fallout.\n\n\n\nEconomic data\n\n\n\nSingapore published non-oil domestic exports (NODX) numbers on Sunday, which showed a year-on-year 9.1% increase, above consensus of a 7.1% rise.

They doubled the band. On Monday, Yuan continued its trend lower.\n\nOn Saturday, the PBOC announced they would widen the band for their currency from +/-1 percent to two percent. This means the currency will fluctuate two percent above or under the midpoint fixed by the bank. As you can see in the chart below, USD/CNY weakened even further and continues its downtrend capital flowing in and out of the country along with sentiment in China weakens.\n\nUSD/CNY\n\nAs China’s economy continues to weaken further over the next months, the cost of capital should weaken as well. This means the exchange rate is likely to weaken further and volatility is likely to increase. Exchange rates are often set by short term cash flows in and out of a country. Export growth, should also benefit from a weaker currency. Domestic demand, like investments, along with reform initiatives should help the economy in the long term. It will not be surprising if the USD/CNY breaks below $6 some point in 2014.\n\nThis Move was Priced In\n\nThe move to widen the trading ban was expected with any change in the USD/CNY priced in. This is evident as the Yuan broke off its steady bullish trend and began falling. It has lost nearly two percent since the beginning of February. This weakening was a demonstration from policy makers who are ready to be more relaxed to freeing the currency up to market pressures. One step closer to a free floating currency. By allowing the Yuan to weaken, policy makers sent a message to speculators who thought the currency was a one way bet. They also sent a signal that they are confident in China’s ability to withstand and survive any policy reforms they PBOC and government are going to allow.\n\nWe should see the currency fall sharply this year as money moves out of China. For the year, we could see it depreciate another 6 to 6.5 percent.\n\nThis is not a Bad thing For China’s Economy\n\nThis is due to money invested in China finding new asset classes to invest in. As the exchange price with the Yuan decreases, the export industry in China is likely to benefit. We have seen exports, for February, falling to their lowest levels since the global financial crisis. However, this move is not beneficial with helping China rebalance from an export and investment economy to one that is consumption driven.\n\nThis is a positive move for China a step in the right direction. We should be cautious as it is unlikely the PBOC will continue to relax its grip on the currency if it falls off sharply. The last time the bank widened the band was back in April of 2012. The Yuan weakened at first then strengthened. After its initial dip, it rose almost five percent versus the U.S. Dollar. The big change from last time, is sentiment. More and more analysts consider the sentiment more bearish and are bracing themselves for China to fall below their target 7.5 percent growth this year.\n\nBinary Option Take for the Day\n\nWe should see volatility in the Yuan. Its steady rise higher or lower is no longer a sure bet which makes investors more and more eager to trade this currency. The question remains how much the PBOC is willing to allow market forces to dictate exchange price. Right now, sentiment is bearish.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nIs the PBOC finally keeping its promise to reform its policy on the Yuan? While a step in the right direction, the Chinese Currency is far from being market driven or allowed to float freely. What is your take? Do you think the PBOC will relax its grip even more over the next year?', 'The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has made good on its promise to widen the trading band on the Yuan (CNY) this past weekend.\nOn Saturday, the PBOC announced they would widen the band for their currency from +/-1 percent to two percent.\nBy allowing the Yuan to weaken, policy makers sent a message to speculators who thought the currency was a one way bet.\nAs the exchange price with the Yuan decreases, the export industry in China is likely to benefit.\nDiscussion:Is the PBOC finally keeping its promise to reform its policy on the Yuan?']"

Thanks to the guiding hand of the Chinese state, the renminbi today is about 25 percent stronger than it was in July 2005, when China scrapped the currency’s fixed peg to the dollar in favor of a steady, crawling appreciation.\n\nFor the past nine years, each business day at 9 in the morning, government workers in the blandly named Building No. 30 in Shanghai’s Pudong financial district have published a benchmark number that tells the world what their country’s currency will be worth that day, compared with the US dollar.\n\nHONG KONG — One of the surest bets on China is starting to look a bit shaky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut recent developments suggest such strengthening is no longer the certainty it once appeared to be, and Beijing is taking pains to show that China’s currency is not just a one-way bet. This year, the renminbi has reversed course, weakening 1.6 percent against the dollar. And Saturday, the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, said that beginning Monday, it would allow the currency to climb or fall as much as 2 percent per day against the dollar, compared with 1 percent previously.\n\nWidening the trading band “will further drive away speculators betting on a one-way appreciation of the Chinese yuan, thanks to the possible bigger and more frequent exchange rate fluctuations,” Tan Yaling, president of the China Forex Investment Research Institute, told Xinhua, the state-run news agency, on Sunday.\n\nYuan is another name for the renminbi.\n\nThis newfound volatility and uncertainty over the currency are just one area where, despite recent economic data suggesting that growth is decelerating to its slowest pace in over a decade, China is pushing ahead with a campaign of wide-ranging financial overhauls. If carried out, they are likely to redefine the nation’s state-driven growth model and to reverberate in economies far beyond China’s borders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreeing up interest rates, internationalizing the currency, and modernizing the financial system are all on the agenda.\n\nOn Thursday, China’s premier, Li Keqiang, said the government’s top priority for the year was to push ahead with financial overhauls. Economic growth could come in above or below the official target of 7.5 percent, he said, which would represent a slowdown from the 7.7 percent rise in gross domestic product last year.\n\nRegardless of this, China will “carry out the reforms without hesitation,” Li pledged, adding a warning that “in the course of reforms, the vested interests will be shaken and some people’s cheese will be moved.”\n\nA key risk for companies and countries that do business with China is not that Beijing will balk at restructuring its economy if growth slows beyond a certain point; it is that policy makers will stay the course.\n\nOver the years, China’s investors and trade partners have come to rely on what amounts to a “Beijing put,” an option that provides assurance that a minimum level of growth will be attained.

Markets around the world are getting spooked, from Australian iron ore miners to the luxury fashion houses of Europe to US scrap exporters.\n\nThis month, a small producer of solar panels based in Shanghai failed to pay the interest on a bond worth $163 million. It was the first default in China’s onshore corporate bond market in recent history, and it sent shock waves through global copper markets.\n\nInvestors are worried that Chinese buyers who imported copper purely for financing purposes could be forced to sell, and prices of the metal have plummeted on fears that hundreds of thousands of tons of copper could begin to flood global markets as a result.\n\nSo far, the Chinese leadership is showing no signs that it shares these fears. Indeed, analysts have said that allowing a struggling company to default instead of rushing in with a government bailout is a necessary form of near-term pain if China’s 8.5 trillion renminbi corporate bond market is to mature and develop over the long term.\n\nStill, policy makers made it clear that by stepping back from the market, the government was not stepping out of the picture entirely.\n\n“Market participants should view fluctuations in the exchange rate rationally and respond proactively,” China’s central bank said in a statement posted on its website Saturday. “Of course, if the exchange rate sees large or abnormal swings, the central bank will carry out the necessary adjustments and supervision in order to protect the normal floating exchange rate of the renminbi.”', 'HONG KONG — One of the surest bets on China is starting to look a bit shaky.\nAdvertisementBut recent developments suggest such strengthening is no longer the certainty it once appeared to be, and Beijing is taking pains to show that China’s currency is not just a one-way bet.\nOn Thursday, China’s premier, Li Keqiang, said the government’s top priority for the year was to push ahead with financial overhauls.\n“Market participants should view fluctuations in the exchange rate rationally and respond proactively,” China’s central bank said in a statement posted on its website Saturday.\n“Of course, if the exchange rate sees large or abnormal swings, the central bank will carry out the necessary adjustments and supervision in order to protect the normal floating exchange rate of the renminbi.”']"

For the most part, economic circles are greeting the move with a yawn, though the consensus is that this could slow (or just maybe even stop) the Chinese currency\'s long, upward crawl in the near term.\n\nFirst of all, there seems to be agreement that this isn\'t a very big deal in the grand scheme of things. This, because the central bank will still set its desired ""parity rate"" (the level that determines the center of each day\'s trading band, now widened to 2% above or below the parity rate).\n\nSociété Générale China economist Wei Yao says: ""Widening the band is a relatively easy promise to deliver. The more difficult and more meaningful one is for the People\'s Bank of China to really let go its control over the exchange rate.""\n\nLikewise, Capital Economics chief Asia economist Mark Williams says: ""If the PBOC was really confident that the renminbi [another name for the yuan] was now close to its market value, it would leave the reference rate to the market. But that still, apparently, remains a step too far.""\n\nWhile the move may be small potatoes to some, many economists also say it\'s not completely without consequence. Generally, they see the change to the trading band as more likely to weigh on China\'s currency than to send it rising faster.\n\nAlthough Standard Chartered said the wider band ""does not have direct implications for medium-term yuan appreciation or depreciation dynamics,"" it adds that the change makes their previous target for the yuan look ""a little aggressive.""\n\nAs a result, StanChart now sees the dollar buying 6.02 yuan at the end of the third quarter, up from 5.98 yuan previously. On the other hand, the bank\'s year-end projection remains at 5.92 yuan.\n\nOver at Daiwa, they\'re taking a stronger view that the yuan will now weaken — you can read the details of this argument in Craig Stephen\'s ""This Week in China"" column.\n\nJ.P. Morgan also sees a weaker yuan, but just for the near term (they keep their year-end forecast at 5.95 yuan). They note that the last time the trading band was widened in 2012, the yuan fell in value for a short while. And certainly, we\'ve seen some pullback for the yuan this month already.\n\nOf course, any weakening in the Chinese currency helps Chinese exporters, and J.P. Morgan says a softer yuan would also stop those pesky hot-money inflows that has worried the PBOC recently. So maybe this is a good thing, for China at least.\n\n(This post originally appeared as part of MarketWatch\'s Asia Markets live blog.)\n\n— Michael Kitchen\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter at @KitchenNews\n\nFollow The Tell @thetellblog', ""As expected, China has widened the daily trading band for the yuan's value against the dollar.\nGenerally, they see the change to the trading band as more likely to weigh on China's currency than to send it rising faster.\nAs a result, StanChart now sees the dollar buying 6.02 yuan at the end of the third quarter, up from 5.98 yuan previously.\nJ.P.

Beijing doubled the currency’s trading band, which now means the renminbi can move up to 2% on either side of the PBoC’s daily reference rate. This theoretically means that market forces will play a greater role in determining the value of the currency.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the implied volatility of the yuan spiked higher today, rising to an 18-month high as the offshore yuan faltered in early trade. Later in the session, CNY opened around 0.12% lower against the dollar.\n\nHowever, the overall implications of this move may not be as pronounced as today’s volatility suggests. After all, the PBoC still sets a reference rate every day and that rate doesn’t have to take into account the daily moves of the yuan within its trading band. In other words, when it comes to determining the value of the renminbi, the ability of the currency to move around in its trading band comes a distant second to the PBoC’s morning fixing.\n\nFurthermore, recent events highlight the fact that the PBoC remains firmly in control of the yuan. Over the last month or so the currency has been steadily declining in value, which at first glance may suggest that the market took control of the currency, but the decline was engineered by the PBoC, with the central intervening in the FX market to give the impression that the yuan isn’t a one-way bet – the currency has been on a broad upward trajectory since it was de-pegged from the US dollar in 2005.\n\nNonetheless, the move to widen the trading band may have short-term implications for the yuan, as evidenced by today’s volatility. This, combined with the PBoC’s desire to show that the yuan isn’t a one-way bet, may drive away speculators that got used to the idea of a forever appreciating yuan, thereby weakening it.\n\nSoftness in recent Chinese economic data also doesn’t bode well for the renminbi in the near-term. It raises concerns about growth, thereby encouraging the PBoC to weaken the yuan to support the economy. In saying that, it is likely to be a very gradual weakening as the PBoC attempts to maintain currency stability, hence its may only allow a slow increase in USDCNY’s reference rate.', 'Beijing doubled the currency’s trading band, which now means the renminbi can move up to 2% on either side of the PBoC’s daily reference rate.\nThis theoretically means that market forces will play a greater role in determining the value of the currency.\nAfter all, the PBoC still sets a reference rate every day and that rate doesn’t have to take into account the daily moves of the yuan within its trading band.\nIn other words, when it comes to determining the value of the renminbi, the ability of the currency to move around in its trading band comes a distant second to the PBoC’s morning fixing.\nNonetheless, the move to widen the trading band may have short-term implications for the yuan, as evidenced by today’s volatility.']"

The change is effective from Monday.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“This is a major step towards building more market-oriented exchange rate mechanisms in China, signifying a gradual withdrawal by the central bank from regular intervention in the foreign exchange market,” said Fu Qing, head of foreign exchange trading at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai.\n\n“However, with more volatility in the yuan’s exchange rate created by the reform, Chinese companies will face an uphill task learning how to hedge their currency risks.” Many market participants have long viewed the yuan as a one-way appreciation bet. Authorities are trying to change that by demonstrating that it is now more of a genuine market that can go up and down like any other.\n\n“The People’s Bank of China will continue to increase the two-way flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate fundamentally stable within reasonable and balanced levels,” the PBOC said in a statement on its website.\n\nA PBOC spokesman in a separate statement said that the new flexibility would help improve efficiency and increase the decisive role of the market to allocate resources.\n\nThe widening of the band had been broadly expected after the yuan fell in value from mid February through early March.

Traders suspected that the central bank, working through state banks, pushed the currency down to try to force those speculating on appreciation to unwind their positions. The idea was to leave the market more balanced between buyers and sellers to reduce the chances of dramatic moves once the trading band was widened. The central bank\'s clamp down came after it had guided the yuan to rise 2.9 percent against the dollar in 2013, far outperforming other emerging economy currencies and surprising markets, which had not been so bullish. That rally encouraged capital to flow into the country betting on a steady increase in Chinese interest rates, which made Chinese assets relatively attractive given the weakness of the dollar. Many Chinese importers even inflated their receipts to bring in more cash to speculate on the yuan, which repeatedly and massively distorted the country\'s trade figures in certain months.\n\nHowever, since the beginning of 2014, the central bank\'s action has pushed the currency down 1.6 percent. While that is not a major move for many currencies, for the yuan it marked a bigger slide than the currency posted over six months during the Greek debt crisis in 2012. Moving markets In pushing the yuan lower, the risk was that traders bullish on the yuan would see the weaker levels as a buying opportunity. However, foreign exchange traders said that the yuan continued to fall in recent weeks and stay closer to the central bank\'s midpoint, even though state-owned banks had stopped intervening, indicating many bulls had been shaken out of the market. A senior money manager for an international investment fund in Shanghai, who spoke off the record because of the sensitivity of relations with regulators, said that the wider trading band would likely discourage foreign investors.\n\n""It\'s what China needs to do, and the smart money says, OK, this is great, this is two way, we\'ll have more money coming in and out. But for the next tier of investor, they see China as very hairy still, not a lot of transparency, and the only news is bad news. They don\'t look at this as good news they just look at it as more volatility."" Currency analysts said the shake out of bullish positions cleared the way for the PBOC to widen the trading band without worrying that the currency would immediately leap to test the upper limits of the new range. ""Conditions for a band widening were ripe,"" said Li Heng, economist at Minsheng Securities in Beijing. Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo in Shanghai, said that allowing the yuan to trade in a wider range each day and so respond more to market forces would make the currency more attractive internationally. ""China needs to internationalise the yuan and a 1 percent fluctuation cannot adequately reflect market demand for and supply of the yuan,"" said\n\nBeijing wants to expand the Chinese currency\'s footprint beyond Hong Kong, where more than 80 percent of yuan trade settlement transactions are handled, and foster greater confidence among offshore businesses to adopt the yuan, also known as the renminbi, as a currency for trade. Its efforts have paid dividends so far, with the yuan already overtaking the euro to become the second-most used currency in trade finance, data from global transaction services organisation SWIFT showed. The central bank\'s announcement follows rising concerns about the implications of slowing growth in China, with some warning that Beijing might have to ease up on the pace of long-term structural market reforms aimed at migrating China to a more sustainable model. ""That the central bank chose to widen the band right now shows, in some ways, that it is confident about the economy,"" Shenyin Wanguo\'s Li said. How the wider band will play into Beijing\'s efforts to reduce debt and wasted investment while maintaining enough growth to keep employment stable is an open question.\n\nAlthough widening the trading band is aimed at introducing more two-way price swings into the market, the last change in April 2012 - doubling the band to 1 percent - largely failed to do so. Instead, the spot price consistently traded near its strongest permissible level after briefly heading lower following the band widening. ""The market will welcome the PBOC\'s move, but it will also ask one question,"" said a trader at a European bank in Shanghai. ""The yuan\'s midpoint is now the base rate for the currency\'s daily movements. That means if the PBOC sets the midpoint far off from market rates, the market actually has no role in deciding the yuan\'s exchange rate."" Reuters', '""The People\'s Bank of China will continue to increase the two-way flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate, keeping the exchange rate fundamentally stable within reasonable and balanced levels,"" the PBOC said in a statement on its website.\nThe widening of the band had been broadly expected after the yuan fell in value from mid February through early March.\nHowever, since the beginning of 2014, the central bank\'s action has pushed the currency down 1.6 percent.\nMoving markets In pushing the yuan lower, the risk was that traders bullish on the yuan would see the weaker levels as a buying opportunity.\n""That the central bank chose to widen the band right now shows, in some ways, that it is confident about the economy,"" Shenyin Wanguo\'s Li said.']"

The last time the People’s Bank widened the trading band on the renminbi was in April 2012, when the band was widened from 0.5% to 1%. Prior to that, the band was last widened from 0.3% to 0.5% in May 2007.\n\nMoves such as this matter. The bank has long said that it wants the renminbi to become an international currency, but it has been unwilling to let the currency trade freely. During the financial crisis, many economists and politicians called for China to loosen its control on the renminbi and allow it to strengthen. That would have had the effect of raising the prices for the country’s exports, giving the manufacturing industries in other countries — like the United States — a price advantage the market.\n\nFurther widening of the renminbi’s trading band is unlikely to have much effect on currency exchange rates. A currency price change of more than 2% a day is a rare thing. What the bank’s next move will be is anybody’s guess, and ours is that it will remove entirely its daily fixed reference rate and allow the country’s currency to float freely. That is not likely to happen for a few years, though, as the country assesses the impact of this latest change.\n\nThe widening of the trading band should also signal to the country’s investors that the government is going to take its thumb off the scales and allow the free market to play a larger role in setting prices. Removing currency controls entirely would take away the advantages that state-owned enterprises, big exporters and the government itself have in the Chinese economy.\n\nThe yuan gained 2.9% in 2013 and closed at 6.1502 to the dollar on Friday. Since the beginning of the year, the currency has slipped nearly 2%. Its largest single swing was a drop of 0.86% on February 28, the biggest one-day decline since 2007.\n\nChina’s GDP growth last year totaled 7.7%, and the country is aiming for GDP growth of 7.5% this year. But if the yuan continues to appreciate, hitting that target gets harder. In a note, JPMorgan economists led by Zhu Haibin wrote that yuan depreciation, “could support exports, and capital outflow will drain domestic liquidity and open the window for reserve-requirement ratio cuts by the PBOC.” Bloomberg News reported that Zhu also cut his 2014 growth estimate for Chinese GDP from 7.4% to 7.2%.', 'The People’s Bank of China on Saturday expanded the trading band on the price it fixes for renminbi.\nBeginning Monday, the currency trading band is being doubled, from 1% to 2% on either side of the central bank’s daily reference rate.\nFurther widening of the renminbi’s trading band is unlikely to have much effect on currency exchange rates.\nA currency price change of more than 2% a day is a rare thing.\nChina’s GDP growth last year totaled 7.7%, and the country is aiming for GDP growth of 7.5% this year.']"

The change is effective from Monday.\n\nThe central bank had doubled the trading band to 1pc from 0.5pc in April 2012.\n\nMany market participants have long viewed the yuan as a one-way appreciation bet. Authorities are trying to change that by demonstrating that it is now more of a genuine market that can go up and down like any other.\n\n“This is a major step towards building more market-oriented exchange rate mechanisms in China, signifying a gradual withdrawal by the central bank from regular intervention in the foreign exchange market,” said Fu Qing, head of foreign exchange trading at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai.\n\n“However, with more volatility in the yuan’s exchange rate created by the reform, Chinese companies will face an uphill task learning how to hedge their currency risks.”\n\nThe widening of the band had been broadly expected after the yuan fell in value from mid February through early March. Traders suspected that the central bank, working through state banks, pushed the currency down to try to force those speculating on appreciation to unwind their positions.\n\nThe idea was to leave the market more balanced between buyers and sellers to reduce the chances of dramatic moves once the trading band was widened.\n\nThe central bank guided the yuan to rise 2.9pc against the dollar in 2013, far outperforming other emerging economy currencies and surprising markets, which had not been so bullish.\n\nThe rise encouraged capital to flow into the country betting on a steady increase in Chinese interest rates, which made Chinese assets relatively attractive given the weakness of the dollar.\n\nMoving markets\n\nIn pushing the yuan lower, the risk was that traders bullish on the yuan would see the weaker levels as a buying opportunity.\n\nHowever, foreign exchange said that the yuan continued to fall in recent weeks and stay closer to the central bank’s midpoint, even though state-owned banks had stopped intervening, indicating many bulls had been shaken out of the market.\n\nIndeed, a senior money manager for an international investment fund in Shanghai, who spoke off the record because of the sensitivity of relations with regulators, said that the move will likely discourage foreign investors.\n\n“It’s what China needs to do, and the smart money says, OK, this is great, this is two way, we’ll have more money coming in and out. But for the next tier of investor, they see China as very hairy still, not a lot of transparency, and the only news is bad news. They don’t look at this as good news they just look at it as more volatility.”\n\nAnalysts said allowing the yuan to trade in a wider range each day and so respond more to market forces would make the currency more attractive internationally.\n\n“China needs to internationalise the yuan and a 1pc fluctuation cannot adequately reflect market demand for and supply of the yuan,” said Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo in Shanghai.\n\n“That the central bank chose to widen the band right now shows, in some ways, that it is confident about the economy,” he said.—Reuters', 'SHANGHAI: China’s central bank doubled the daily trading band for the yuan on Saturday, underscoring efforts to add more volatility and risk to the currency to make it more responsive to market forces.\nThe People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said the exchange rate will be allowed to rise or fall 2 per cent from a daily midpoint rate it sets each morning.\nThe central bank had doubled the trading band to 1pc from 0.5pc in April 2012.\nThe idea was to leave the market more balanced between buyers and sellers to reduce the chances of dramatic moves once the trading band was widened.\n“That the central bank chose to widen the band right now shows, in some ways, that it is confident about the economy,” he said.—Reuters']"

Bigger one-day swings only make that sort of bet more risky.\n\n""The currency could overshoot on the weak side for a while,"" said Liu Li-Gang, an economist at ANZ. ""The PBOC\'s intention was to penalize speculators, and it will work.""\n\nMr. Liu expects the exchange rate to reach 6.20 or 6.25 to the dollar within the next week, compared with 6.14 now, as speculators flee the market. A higher number indicates a weaker yuan because one dollar buys more Chinese currency.\n\nThe central bank\'s official line is that the yuan is fairly valued, with no fundamental pressure in either direction. ""There is no basis for big appreciation of the renminbi,"" the bank said in an announcement as it widened the band, adding that ""there is no basis for big depreciation"" either.\n\nMany in the market would disagree. ""I see plenty of structural drivers pointing to strengthening,"" said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS, pointing to China\'s persistent trade surplus and investment inflows.\n\nLast year, China\'s trade surplus--the difference between exports and imports--came to a whopping $238 billion, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. The country also attracted $171 billion in foreign direct investment, SAFE said, and $72 in financial inflows. All of those things put upward pressure on the currency.\n\nThe only thing that could really undermine China\'s currency in the long term is capital moving out of the country. The government has strict controls on that, with residents limited to taking $50,000 abroad--plenty for shopping trips to London, but peanuts in the world of international financial flows.\n\nThere are ways around that, for the enterprising. Bitcoin is an open wound in China\'s capital controls. So are the junket operations that smuggle money out through Macau casinos.\n\nBut law-abiding citizens are still largely limited to the domestic property and stock markets. With China\'s stock exchange consistently among the world\'s worst performers, that has meant the nation\'s savings are largely held in real estate.\n\nIf China made it easier for its citizens to invest money abroad, some of those pent-up savings would quickly flow out. With less cash chasing property, the domestic housing market could take a pummeling. So could the yuan.\n\nMr. Liu at ANZ thinks loosening up China\'s capital controls is long overdue. ""The longer they wait, the harder it will be,"" he said.\n\nChina\'s government says it wants a flexible currency and a more open capital account. But real flexibility and openness would come at a price.\n\n-- Richard Silk.

The People\'s Bank of China said it would allow the yuan to move 2% above or below a rate it sets every day for the currency against the U.S. dollar, up from 1% now, in a move that will mean the yuan will behave a little more like major currencies.\n\nThe policy move, which takes effect Monday, still lets the PBOC keep its thumb on the foreign exchange scale, knowing the currency won\'t move more than 2% away from where it wants it on any given day.\n\nThe central bank was widely seen as preparing the market for just such a move when it let the currency slip repeatedly last month. Still, the central bank managed to surprise more than a few people with the timing of its announcement -- just before dinner hour on Saturday night. One analyst referred to this as ""PBOC style"" with the central bank showing that it still could shake things up just a little when it wanted.\n\nThe PBOC, which last expanded the band to 1% from 0.5% in April of 2012, said that this was part of its effort to make the exchange rate more market-based, and that it would continue to push ahead with this effort. It also said this did not mean either a big depreciation -- or appreciation for the currency -- in the future and it added that Chinese companies were already better prepared to deal with somewhat greater yuan fluctuations.\n\nIt also said it would withdraw from routine intervention in the foreign exchange market.\n\nAnalysts generally applauded the move -- which had been already been touched on in Premier Li Keqiang\'s work report delivered at the opening of the annual session of parliament this month.\n\nFollowing are some of comments from analysts (edited for style and length):\n\n-----\n\n""This was a good time to widen the trading band.

""This can effectively avoid a big appreciation or depreciation of the yuan\'s exchange rate immediately following the move.""\n\nThey added that central bank will probably push ahead with the introduction of new foreign exchange-related products, relax some restrictions on fund movements under the capital account and it might raise its ceiling on domestic bank deposit interest rates this year.\n\n(Editor\'s explanatory note: Domestic bank deposit rates are currently capped at 1.1 times a benchmark rate set by the central bank. Liberalized interest rates and relaxed capital account restrictions are seen as key parts of a package of inter-related financial reforms).\n\n---\n\n""Today\'s band widening strengthens the PBOC\'s signal that the one-way bet on the yuan is over and we should expect more yuan/dollar volatility going forward,"" Lu Ting, economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note to clients.\n\n""We believe the PBOC won\' stop here, but further band widening is of little meaning. A much more important and meaningful reform is to change the rule on setting the daily fixing of yuan/dollar.

""They will probably withdraw gradually.""\n\n""The PBOC has been signaling that it was moving in this direction.

The move isn\'t a big surprise, but it is viewed as another significant step toward a freer-floating currency at the same time concerns are on the rise over a possible credit crunch and a slowdown of the world\'s second-largest economy.\n\nChina has been seen guiding the yuan lower since the beginning of 2013. Analysts say China wants to discourage market participants from engaging in a popular strategy known as a carry trade, in which traders sell a low-interest currency, such as the U.S. dollar, and use it to buy higher-yielding currencies, such as the yuan, and other assets.

Indeed, analysts at Societe Generale had noted that the yuan rose nearly 3% against the dollar and 7% in nominal effective exchange-rate terms in 2013. The yuan has fallen around 1.6% versus the dollar since the beginning of this year, ending Friday at 6.15 per dollar.

Australian vessels scoured the southern Indian Ocean and China offered 21 of its satellites to help Malaysia in the unprecedented hunt.\n\nWith no wreckage found in one of the most puzzling aviation mysteries of all time, relatives of those on the Boeing 777 have been left in an agonizing limbo.\n\nInvestigators say the plane was deliberately diverted during its overnight flight and flew off-course for hours. They haven’t ruled out hijacking, sabotage, or pilot suicide, and they are checking the backgrounds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.\n\nMalaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out that it might be discovered intact.\n\n“The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope,” Hishammuddin said at a news conference.\n\nMalaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words heard from the plane by ground controllers — “All right, good night” — were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. Had it been a voice other than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, it would have clearest indication yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off-course.\n\nMalaysian officials said earlier that those words came after one of the jetliner’s data communications systems — the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System — had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying to deceive ground controllers.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nHowever, Ahmad said that while the last data transmission from ACARS — which gives plane performance and maintenance information — came before that, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off, making any implications of the timing murkier.\n\nThe new information opened the possibility that both ACARS and the plane’s transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traffic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also suggests that the message delivered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the severed communications.\n\nAirline pilots in the United States cautioned against reading too much into what little is known so far about the actions of the Malaysia Airlines crew.\n\n“You can’t take anything off the table until everything is on table, and we don’t even have an aircraft,” said Boeing 737 pilot Mike Karn, president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations.\n\nAuthorities have pointed to the shutdown of the transponders and the ACARS as evidence that someone with a detailed knowledge of the plane was involved. But Bob Coffman, an airline captain and former 777 pilot, said that kind of information is probably available on the Internet.\n\nAuthorities confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot’s home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot in what Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar initially said were the first police visits to those homes.\n\nBut the government, which has come under criticism abroad for missteps and foot-dragging in releasing information, issued a statement Monday contradicting that account, saying police first visited the pilots’ homes as early as March 9, the day after the flight disappeared.\n\nCoffman said the flight simulator could signify nothing more than the pilot’s zeal for his job.\n\n“There are people for whom flying is all consuming,” he said, noting some pilots like to spend their off-duty hours on simulators at home, commenting on pilot blogs or playing fighter-pilot video games.\n\nAlthough Malaysian authorities requested that all nations with citizens aboard the flight conduct background checks on them, it wasn’t clear how thoroughly they were doing such checks at home. The father of a Malaysian aviation engineer aboard the plane said police had not approached anyone in the family about his 29-year-old son, Mohamad Khairul Amri Selamat, though he added that there was no reason to suspect him.\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.

13257,http://hollywoodlife.com/2014/03/16/flight-370-hijacking-malaysia-airlines-pilots-involved-signoff/,business,"['A deeper investigation into what happened the moments before Flight 370 disappeared has revealed that a pilot spoke to Malaysian air traffic control without hinting at any signs of trouble AFTER the plane’s signaling system had been disabled. The revelation leaves only two options — either one of the pilots (or both) were in charge of hijacking the plane, or they were forced to play along by someone else.\n\nIn one of the strangest revelations in the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370’s disappearance, new information shows that one of the pilots, either Zaharie Ahmad Shah or Fariq Abdul Hamid, said “Alright, goodnight” to Malaysian air traffic controls after communication devices were disabled — but the pilot did not indicate that there was anything wrong with flight. So what does this mean?\n\nMalaysia Flight: Pilot Had To Have Been Part Of Hijacking\n\nIt had already been determined that Flight 370’s signaling system had been disabled manually, but on March 15 Malaysia’s defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, confirmed that the system, which reports date about the plane’s equipment, had been turned off before the pilots’ last known contact with air traffic controllers, according to the New York Times.\n\n[hl_ndn videoid=”25720591″]\n\nThis revelation has raised even more suspicion that one or both of the pilots were involved in hijacking the plane, because in any normal circumstance, a pilot would presumably relay that his aircraft’s systems were down — or on a more extreme level, that the plane was being hijacked. But the fact that there was a content verbal signoff after systems had already turned off suggests that whoever gave the signoff was trying to mislead air traffic control.\n\n[hl_ndn videoid=”25720391″]\n\nIt’s become more and more apparent that whoever was in control of Flight 370 wanted it to disappear. And the complexity of the operation — turning off the plane’s communication devices, diverting course, giving a signoff — is so high, that experts and U.S. officials believe the pilots — or just one of them — had to be involved.\n\nThe other possibility, however, is that the pilots were compelled to carry out this complex plan by someone who had taken over the plane.\n\nZaharie Ahmad Shah: Did He Hijack Flight 370?\n\nAs of now, the pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah seems to be the most likely suspect. After investigators began looking more intently at the two pilots on March 14, it was reportedly discovered that Zaharie is a fanatical, political activist who opposes the Malaysian government, according to Mail Online.\n\nZaharie allegedly attended the trial of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim just hours before Flight 370 was set to take off. Anwar was sentenced to five years in prison in a court decision that has since been called unjust by many. In light of this new information, many fear that Zaharie may have hijacked Flight 370 as a form of political protest.\n\nAdditionally, Zaharie’s wife and three children reportedly moved out of the family home just one day before the flight’s takeoff, leading many to suggest that this tragedy may have been Zaharie’s catatonic reaction to the turmoil in his personal life.\n\nThese are all questions that do not have answers yet, though — just theories. So stay tuned for further developments.\n\n— Andrew Gruttadaro\n\nFollow @AndrewGrutt\n\nMore Flight 370 News:', '[hl_ndn videoid=”25720391″]It’s become more and more apparent that whoever was in control of Flight 370 wanted it to disappear.\nAs of now, the pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah seems to be the most likely suspect.\nZaharie allegedly attended the trial of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim just hours before Flight 370 was set to take off.\nIn light of this new information, many fear that Zaharie may have hijacked Flight 370 as a form of political protest.\n— Andrew GruttadaroFollow @AndrewGruttMore Flight 370 News:']"

Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.\n\nA search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the plane, covering an area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nAirline chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane\'s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.\n\nSuspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane - an informal ""all right, good night"" - was spoken after the tracking system, known as ""ACARS"", was shut down.\n\n""Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,"" Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.\n\nThat was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.\n\nThe last transmission from the ACARS system - a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane\'s status - had been received at 1.07 a.m., as the plane crossed Malaysia\'s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.\n\n""We don\'t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,"" Ahmad Jauhari said. ""It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.""\n\nFOCUS ON CREW\n\nThe plane vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia\'s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian authorities believe that someone on board shut off its communications systems as the plane flew across the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nMalaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.\n\nAsked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry,\n\nMalaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: ""We are looking at it."" But it was only one of the possibilities under investigation, he added.\n\nIntensive efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the airplane had not, as of Monday, turned up any information linking anyone to militant groups or anyone with a known political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the aircraft, U.S. and European security sources said.\n\nOne source familiar with U.S. inquiries into the disappearance said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the ACARS system.\n\nMany experts and officials say while the jet\'s transponder can be switched off by flicking a switch in the cockpit, turning off ACARS may have required someone to open a trap door outside the cockpit, climb down into the plane\'s belly and pull a fuse or circuit breaker.\n\nWhoever did so, had to have sophisticated knowledge of the systems on a 777, according to pilots and two current and former U.S. officials close to the investigation.\n\nMalaysian police special branch officers searched the homes of the captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid, in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the international airport on Saturday.\n\nAmong the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.\n\nA senior police official familiar with the investigation said the flight simulator programmes were closely examined, adding they appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practice flying and landing in different conditions.\n\nA second senior police official with knowledge of the investigation said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group.', 'No trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard.\nInvestigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.\nThat was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 a.m., as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace.\nMalaysian authorities believe that someone on board shut off its communications systems as the plane flew across the Gulf of Thailand.\nMalaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.']"

13269,http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2014/03/16/searchers-relying-on-satellite-data-to-find-plane,business,"['By JOAN LOWY, Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Finding a missing Malaysia Airlines plane may hinge on whether searchers can narrow down where they need to look using satellite data that is inexact and has never been used for that purpose before, search and rescue experts say.\n\nAuthorities now believe someone on board the Boeing 777 shut down part of the aircraft\'s messaging system about the same time the plane with 239 people on board disappeared from civilian radar. But an Inmarsat satellite was able to automatically connect with a portion of the messaging system that remained in operation, similar to a phone call that just rings because no one is on the other end to pick it up and provide information. No location information was exchanged, but the satellite continued to identify the plane once an hour for four to five hours after it disappeared from radar screens.\n\nBased on the hourly connections with the plane, described by a U.S. official as a ""handshake,"" the satellite knows at what angle to tilt its antenna to be ready to receive a message from the plane should one be sent. Using that antenna angle, along with radar data, investigators have been able to draw two vast arcs, or ""corridors"" — a northern one from northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. The plane is believed to be somewhere along those arcs.\n\nAir crash investigators have never used this kind of satellite data before to try to find a missing plane, but after pursing other leads it\'s the best clue left.\n\n""The people that are doing this are thinking outside the box. They\'re using something that wasn\'t designed to be used this way, and it seems to be working,"" said William Waldock, who teaches accident investigation at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona. ""In terms of search and rescue, they\'re probably going to have rewrite the book after this.""\n\nAuthorities generally believe the plane crashed into the ocean, although they can\'t rule out the possibility that it may be on land somewhere. Twenty-five countries are involved in the search for the plane, using at least 43 ships and 58 aircraft.\n\n""If it really is out there in the Indian Ocean, they\'re going to need a lot more than that,"" Waldock said. ""It\'s immense. It takes a lot of effort, a lot of people, a lot of ships and airplanes.""\n\nIn order to narrow down the location, low-flying planes are searching broad swaths of water for any sign of debris. The search is complicated by the vast amount of trash floating in the world\'s oceans.\n\nIf the airliner did crash into the ocean, some lighter-weight items such as insulation, seat cushions, and life jackets, as well as bodies not strapped to seats, are likely to be floating on the surface, Waldock said. The heavier parts of the plane would sink, with depths in some parts of the Indian Ocean at over 15,000 feet, he said.\n\nWhen suspected debris of a plane is found, the nearest ship — whether it\'s a search ship or a commercial vessel that happens to be in the area — is sent to the site. A small boat or life raft usually has to be lowered into the water for a closer look at the debris to judge whether it might have come from the missing plane.\n\nIf searchers find airplane debris, ocean currents will have already moved away from where the plane went into the water. Searchers will then have to use their knowledge of currents in the region to estimate how far and from what direction the debris came, and work backward to that location.\n\nThe airliner is equipped with two ""black boxes"" — a flight data recorder that contains hundreds of types of information on how the plane was functioning, and a cockpit voice recorder that contains pilots\' conversations and noise in the cockpit. Both are equipped with underwater locator beacons, sometimes called ""pingers,"" that emit a sonic signal that can only be heard underwater. Sonar on ships can sometimes pick up the pings, but they are best heard using a special pinger locator device that is lowered into the water.\n\nThe U.S. Navy in the Indian Ocean region has a pinger locator. ""It\'s boxed up, it\'s ready to be sent somewhere,"" said a U.S. official. ""Right now, there just isn\'t enough evidence to tell us where to send it.""\n\nThe official agreed to speak only on condition anonymity because he wasn\'t authorized to speak publicly.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy', ""By JOAN LOWY, Associated PressWASHINGTON (AP) — Finding a missing Malaysia Airlines plane may hinge on whether searchers can narrow down where they need to look using satellite data that is inexact and has never been used for that purpose before, search and rescue experts say.\nAir crash investigators have never used this kind of satellite data before to try to find a missing plane, but after pursing other leads it's the best clue left.\nTwenty-five countries are involved in the search for the plane, using at least 43 ships and 58 aircraft.\nThe heavier parts of the plane would sink, with depths in some parts of the Indian Ocean at over 15,000 feet, he said.\nIf searchers find airplane debris, ocean currents will have already moved away from where the plane went into the water.""]"

""Because when we have to look into speculative reports, it will distract us from our immediate concern, which is to find the aircraft.""\n\nHere are the latest developments in the search and investigation:\n\nFlight evaded radar?\n\nOn Monday, the Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times reported that the plane may have flown low to the ground -- 5,000 feet or less -- and used mountainous terrain as cover to evade radar detection. The newspaper cited unnamed sources for its reporting, which CNN could not immediately confirm.\n\nHowever, Malaysian officials said Monday that they were not aware of the report.\n\n""It does not come from us,"" said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya.\n\nAnalysts interviewed by CNN said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time and that it\'s not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes.\n\n""Five thousand isn\'t really low enough to evade the radar, and that\'s kind of where general aviation flies all the time anyway, and we\'re visible to radar,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nTimeline clarification\n\nAhmad Jauhari said Monday that it wasn\'t clear whether the final words from the cockpit came before or after the plane\'s data-reporting system was shut down. Earlier, Malaysian authorities had said the message ""All right, good night"" came after the system had been disabled.\n\nThe voice message came at 1:19 a.m. Saturday, March 8, Ahmad Jauhari said. The data system sent its last transmission at 1:07 a.m. and was shut down sometime between then and 1:37 a.m. that day, Ahmad Jauhari said.\n\nIndian radar\n\nA senior Indian military official told CNN on Monday that military radar near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands isn\'t as closely watched as other radar systems. That leaves open the possibility that Indian radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known Malaysian radar contact, near the tiny island of Palau Perak in the Straits of Malacca.\n\nEarlier speculation had centered on the idea the plane may have flown over, or perhaps even landed in, the islands, but no trace of it has been found in the region despite intensive searches by Indian military officials.\n\nChinese response\n\nChina said Monday that it had deployed 10 ships, 21 satellites and multiple aircraft to aid in the search. Premier Li Keqiang spoke with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak to ask for more information to help speed the search along, according to a statement posted on the Chinese government website.\n\nU.S. Navy pulls out destroyer\n\nThe USS Kidd and its helicopters have stopped combing the Andaman Sea and are no longer part of search efforts for the missing plane, the Navy said. No debris or wreckage from a plane was found.\n\nThe move is partially because Australians are taking over the majority of the searching in that area, U.S. officials said. A U.S. P-8 aircraft will move to Perth, Australia, to be based there for searching.\n\nFewer U.S. assets will be involved in the search for the missing plane, but U.S. officials said the P-8 will be able to cover a wider range of ocean more quickly than the ship could.\n\n""This is actually much more effective for the overall search,"" Cmdr.

But experts warn this isn’t likely to be one of those defining moments that lead to fundamental changes.\n\nFor financial and technological reasons, and because of issues tied to national sovereignty, the status quo is expected to prevail in the way passports are checked, aircraft are tracked at sea and searches are coordinated.\n\nIn an age of constant connectedness, it is almost inconceivable to lose a large airplane for more than a week or to be in the dark about what happened on board around the time it went missing.\n\nThe reality is that large portions of the globe don’t have radar coverage. Over oceans, pilots fill in those gaps by radioing air traffic controllers at routine intervals with position updates. And while planes record sounds in the cockpit as well as speed, altitude, fuel flow and the positions of flaps, that information isn’t shared with anyone on the ground. Crash investigators only get access to the data on the recorders after combing through the wreckage, if they can find it.\n\nNumerous experts have said it is time to update tracking abilities and use satellite links to provide real-time feeds on the operation of planes and conversations within the cockpit.\n\nHowever, transmitting data by satellite from all 80,000 daily flights worldwide wouldn’t be cheap. Airlines made an average of $4.13 in profits per passenger last year and $2.05 in 2012, according to International Air Transport Association, the industry’s trade group. Any additional costs would eat into those slim profits. Some experts say planes don’t crash frequently enough to justify the cost.\n\nIf such information were to be streamed live, there would be major concerns about privacy says Robert Clifford, a personal injury lawyer in Chicago who has been involved in several aviation lawsuits. “Once it’s broadcast, the data from a plane would essentially be considered public access material — something that aircraft manufacturers, pilot unions, operators and even accident investigators don’t want.”\n\nThere is also a question of who would receive and control that data. There are concerns that an airline, plane maker or government worried about its reputation could meddle with the information.\n\n“You can’t assume that there would not be strong economic interests to tamper with information,” said James E. Hall, former chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nA compromise solution is to create deployable black boxes — data recorders similar to the voice and data recorders currently in planes. During a catastrophic event, they would break away from the tail, have their own homing devices and ideally be found quickly. But given the confusion over the Malaysia Airlines jet’s flight path, it is unclear if these boxes could help.\n\nThen there is the search. The Malaysian government has been widely criticized for how long the search has taken and for its release of contradictory information. So why aren’t American investigators, who have a long history of dealing with plane crashes, taking charge?\n\nNTSB investigators and experts from Boeing are on the scene providing technical assistance. So are U.S. military ships and planes. But politics and customs dictate that everybody takes a back seat to the local government.\n\nThe practice dates to a 1944 convention on international civil aviation in Chicago. Many of today’s rules of the sky were formed at that meeting, including one that puts the country where a crash occurs in charge of the search and investigation. If the airplane is registered in another country, that government is entitled to appoint observers to be present at the inquiry.\n\nHall says it is time for the International Civil Aviation Organization — part of the United Nations — to set up an international team of investigation professionals. “We can’t permit a situation to continue where we don’t have competent, independent people in charge of an investigation,” he said.\n\nHowever, Kenneth J. Button, director of the Center for Transportation, Policy, Operations and Logistics at George Mason University, notes that even U.S. investigators have made mistakes in past disasters. Further, he can’t imagine countries such as the U.S. ceding the investigatory powers they currently have to some international group.\n\nFlight MH370’s disappearance also uncovered another lapse: passenger passports were not checked against Interpol’s database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents. Most countries don’t run passports through the international policy agency’s computer system.\n\n“It is not extremely unusual,” said Rafi Ron, a former chief of security at Tel Aviv’s airport and now head of New Age Security Solutions. To run the checks, countries would have to update software and link computer systems. “We’ve left a substantial loophole. There is only one thing behind it: cost.”', 'The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 has exposed wide gaps in how the world’s airlines — and their regulators — operate.\nBut experts warn this isn’t likely to be one of those defining moments that lead to fundamental changes.\nCrash investigators only get access to the data on the recorders after combing through the wreckage, if they can find it.\nSome experts say planes don’t crash frequently enough to justify the cost.\nA compromise solution is to create deployable black boxes — data recorders similar to the voice and data recorders currently in planes.']"

The airline believes it was the co-pilot speaking.\n\nTRANSPONDER SWITCHES OFF: The plane\'s transponder -- which relays radar information on the plane\'s location and altitude -- stops transmitting 14 minutes after the last ACARS transmission, at 1:21 am.\n\nLAST RADAR CONTACT: The plane slips off Malaysian civilian radar screens at 1:30 am. While it continues to blip on military radars until 2:15 am, that sighting is only identified later as Flight MH370.\n\nROUTE CHANGE: The plane is believed to have turned sharply from its intended route after losing contact with civilian radar, flying west -- back over peninsular Malaysia -- before turning northwest.\n\nLAST SATELLITE COMMUNICATION: Final, automated, satellite communications with the plane come at 8:11 am -- suggesting it may have flown on for hours after the ACARS system and transponder cut out.\n\nThe satellite data cannot pinpoint a location for the plane at 8:11 am. It places it anywhere on one of two huge arcs -- one stretching north from Malaysia up to central Asia, and the other south, deep into the Indian Ocean towards Australia.\n\nA total of 25 countries are now involved in the massive hunt for any sign of the plane, with Australia announcing on March 17 that it is taking charge of the search in the southern arc.\n\nIn the first weekend of the plane\'s disappearance, it emerged that two passengers were travelling on stolen EU passports, fuelling speculation of a terrorist attack. Police then concluded that the pair were illegal Iranian immigrants.\n\nBut the terrorism thesis is now back in the spotlight along with possible hijacking or deliberate action by one or other of the pilots, who are now under investigation by Malaysian authorities along with the cabin crew, the passengers and ground engineers.\n\nAFP', ""More than a week after the jet vanished, a clearer picture is emerging of the events leading up to and immediately after its disappearance.\nMore than a week after the jet vanished, a clearer picture is emerging of the events leading up to and immediately after its disappearance.\nHere is a timeline of the plane's known last moments on March 8:TAKE-OFF: Flight MH370 takes off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12:41 am (1641 GMT Friday) bound for Beijing.\nLAST RADAR CONTACT: The plane slips off Malaysian civilian radar screens at 1:30 am.\nWhile it continues to blip on military radars until 2:15 am, that sighting is only identified later as Flight MH370.""]"

They also said that a final message had been received from the pilot after the plane\'s signaling apparatus had been disabled, raising suspicion that the flight was intentionally diverted by crew. There have also been numerous reports this morning that plane may have flown as low as 5,000 feet, in order to avoid all radar detection, a maneuver that would require considerable skill from the pilots, while also putting the plane itself in considerable danger, as it is not designed for long travel at that altitude.\n\nIn a press conference today, Malaysia Airlines officials say they now believe it was the co-pilot who spoke those final words. The Acting Transport Minister Hussein Hishammuddin added during the conference that Malaysia is requesting renewed assistance from the countries involved in the search, saying:\n\nMalaysia\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search and rescue operation. This includes two groups: first, countries in the search corridors; and second, countries from which we are seeking assistance and expertise.

The Malaysian situation is much more difficult,"" Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France\'s aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMalaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was purposely diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and suspicions has fallen on anyone aboard the plane with aviation experience, particularly the pilot and co-pilot.\n\nMalaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot\'s home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot, in what Malaysia\'s police chief Khalid Abu Bakar later said was the first police visits to those homes. The government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying that police first visited the pilots\' home on March 9, the day after the flight.\n\nInvestigators haven\'t ruled out hijacking or sabotage and are checking backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.\n\nMalaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that an initial investigation indicates that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight\'s last words -- ""All right, good night"" -- to ground controllers.\n\nOfficials previously have said that those words came at a point when one of the jetliner\'s data communications systems already had been switched off, and the timing has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane\'s disappearance. The detail would appear indicate that whoever spoke the words was deceiving ground control. However, it is not clear whether the system could have been turned off by one of the pilots -- or someone else -- without the other pilot\'s knowledge.\n\nMalaysia\'s government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.\n\nOver the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 AA1/2 hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.\n\nHad the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.\n\nThe northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan -- all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.\n\nAn official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn\'t immediately respond to questions on radar information.\n\nIndonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country\'s search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the ""ill-fated aircraft"" during a conversation Monday with Malaysia\'s leader.\n\n""Australia will do its duty in this matter,"" Abbott told parliament. ""We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery.""\n\nAustralia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands. The southern Indian Ocean is the world\'s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.\n\nBy Ian Mader.

But despite sending nine ships to help in the search, China appears to have little leverage over its far smaller Southeast Asian neighbor.\n\n\n\nExperts on what may have happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\n\nThe situation is especially uncomfortable for Chinese leaders because part of the ruling Communist Party\'s claim to a monopoly on power is that it is best qualified to look after the public\'s interests. The rise of social media and the increased willingness of China\'s public to assert its rights adds to the pressure to find the 154 Chinese among the 227 missing passengers.\n\nThere is ""very likely a lot more pressure from the domestic community in China on Beijing to make sure that Chinese nationals are being protected,"" said Marc Lanteigne, research director at the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre at Victoria University of Wellington.\n\n\n\nAuthorities are attempting to trace the plane across two possible corridors, indicated by the dotted red lines on the map above.

""I believe they are still deciding which information to release and which isn\'t convenient to release right now.""\n\nChina has the world\'s second-largest military budget, at $114 billion last year, and has spent heavily on expanding the ability of its navy to project power farther from its shores. But the search that began in the Gulf of Thailand on the edge of the South China Sea, which China claims as its territorial waters, has relied heavily on expertise from the United States and Britain on the other side of the globe.\n\nChina is the biggest trading partner for most of its Asian neighbors, buying tens of billions of dollars\' worth of raw materials and components from them annually. Yet despite such incentives for cooperation, countries from Vietnam to Australia are uneasy about China\'s ambitions, which has hampered its efforts to acquire influence.\n\nBeijing has resorted to taking the unusual step of publicly haranguing Malaysia\'s government, a sign that whatever pressure it is applying in private is failing to produce results.\n\nAfter Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday that the Boeing 777 might have flown beyond the current search area, Beijing reacted with fury, a sign that the announcement took it by surprise.\n\n\n\nA deputy Chinese foreign minister demanded ""more thorough and accurate information"" about the new search area.

How can 239 people and a Boeing 777 disappear into thin air? Most experts believe that the plane somehow suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure, but now the world is speculating possible human involvement. Here are some of the top conspiracy theories and rebuttals currently circulating in social media discussion:\n\nThe plane was shot down by the US Navy shortly after it took off.\n\nImpossible since the engines of the plane submit real-time data through a satellite uplink. For this flight, that data was being submitted a full five hours after the takeoff of the jet.\n\nThe two Iranians or the flight crew turned off the plane’s transponder and flew it to an undisclosed location.\n\nFalse. The plane would have to fly through the active radar of many countries and it never showed up again on any radar.\n\nThe plane flew east and landed at a secret base, perhaps in Vietnam or the Philippines.\n\nFalse. The Malaysian government tracked the plane going west. In addition, a large airstrip is required to land a 777 and such a strip would easily be seen on satellite pictures.\n\nThe plane was struck by a missile and pilots were able to send a distress call before it crashed.\n\nFalse. This particular airplane is a fly-by-wire which means the pilots have direct control. The plane turned around and flew in an opposite direction than what was programmed into its flight computer. If a missile hit the cockpit of the plane, it could not turn nor could any autopilot be activated. If the pilots were all dead, the plane is programmed to continue flying and land by itself.\n\nAliens took the plane.\n\nWe have no answer for this one, but it is a popular source of discussion.\n\nThe plane survived and has landed somewhere and the U.S. government knows exactly where it is.\n\nThis would cause a scandal that would bring down the Obama administration and cause untold damage to the United States. Would President Obama authorize something like this which could lead to war?\n\nMistrust of the government, belief in aliens, or the Illuminati causing the disappearance are all theories constructed in the world of social media. The Malaysian government has officially stated that someone aboard the plane disabled critical systems. The question remains? Was it the flight crew or unknown passengers that committed this crime? In the end, the truth will come out.', 'The disappearance of Malaysian Air Flight 370 has the entire world wondering what happened.\nThe two Iranians or the flight crew turned off the plane’s transponder and flew it to an undisclosed location.\nThe plane flew east and landed at a secret base, perhaps in Vietnam or the Philippines.\nThe plane turned around and flew in an opposite direction than what was programmed into its flight computer.\nMistrust of the government, belief in aliens, or the Illuminati causing the disappearance are all theories constructed in the world of social media.']"

The Boeing 777, carrying 239 people, disappeared from radars last week on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Since then, authorities have been unable to ascertain the whereabouts of the plane, and have not found any wreckage from a crash.\n\n\n\nThe Pakistani government says it has no record of the craft entering its airspace, but has told the Malaysian investigators it is ready to share all available information.

Furthermore, investigators said that it would have taken someone with pilot training to be able to switch off the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS. This system automatically sends engine data and other information to the airline.\n\n‘All right, good night’\n\nOn Sunday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the last words to be spoken to air traffic control from onboard the plane were “All right, good night.” This was said after the ACARS system had been switched off and there was no mention of any inflight problems.\n\n\n\nIn connection with this new information, authorities are now investigating the pilot, 53-year-old Captain Zaharie Shah.

The Malaysian situation is much more difficult,"" Jean Paul Troadec, a special adviser to France\'s aviation accident investigation bureau, said in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMalaysian authorities say the jet carrying 239 people was purposely diverted from its flight path during an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, and suspicions has fallen on anyone aboard the plane with aviation experience, particularly the pilot and co-pilot.\n\nMalaysian police confiscated a flight simulator from the pilot\'s home Saturday and also visited the home of the co-pilot, in what Malaysia\'s police chief Khalid Abu Bakar later said was the first police visits to those homes. The government issued a statement Monday contradicting that account by saying that police first visited the pilots\' home on March 9, the day after the flight.\n\nInvestigators haven\'t ruled out hijacking or sabotage and are checking backgrounds of all 227 passengers and 12 crew members, as well as the ground crew, to see if links to terrorists, personal problems or psychological issues could be factors.\n\nMalaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said at a news conference Monday that an initial investigation indicates that the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, spoke the fight\'s last words - ""All right, good night"" - to ground controllers.\n\nOfficials previously have said that those words came at a point when one of the jetliner\'s data communications systems already had been switched off, and the timing has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane\'s disappearance. The detail would appear indicate that whoever spoke the words was deceiving ground control. However, it is not clear whether the system could have been turned off by one of the pilots - or someone else - without the other pilot\'s knowledge.\n\nMalaysia\'s government in the meantime sent out diplomatic cables to all countries in the search area, seeking their help with the search, as well as to ask for any radar data that might help narrow the task. Some 26 countries are involved in the search, which initially focused on seas on either side of peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca.\n\nArticle Continues After These Ads\n\nOver the weekend, however, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators determined that a satellite picked up a faint signal from the aircraft about 7 ½ hours after takeoff. The signal indicated that the plane would have been somewhere on a vast arc stretching from Kazakhstan down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nMalaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein announced Monday that searches in both the northern and southern stretches of the arc had begun, with countries from Australia up to Kazakhstan joining the hunt.\n\nHad the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace, and some experts believe the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen to go south. However, authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that path.\n\nThe northern search corridor crosses through countries including China, India and Pakistan - all of which have indicated they have seen no sign of the plane so far.\n\nAn official with the Chinese civil aviation authority said the missing plane did not enter Chinese airspace, but the Chinese Defense Ministry and Foreign Ministry didn\'t immediately respond to questions on radar information.\n\nIndonesian officials have said the plane did not cross their territory, based on radar data. Air force spokesman Rear Mar. Hadi Tjahjanto said Monday his country\'s search efforts were focusing on waters west of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told parliament that he agreed to take the lead scouring the southern Indian Ocean for the ""ill-fated aircraft"" during a conversation Monday with Malaysia\'s leader.\n\n""Australia will do its duty in this matter,"" Abbott told parliament. ""We will do our duty to the families of the 230 people on that aircraft who are still absolutely devastated by their absence, and who are still profoundly, profoundly saddened by this as yet unfathomed mystery.""\n\nAustralia already has had two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search, one of them looking north and west of the remote Cocos Islands.

On Saturday, the Malaysian government suggested that the plane was deliberately diverted and might have flown as far north as central Asia or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.\n\nAuthorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff. The equipment sends information about the jet�s engines and other data to the airline. About 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.\n\nThe fact that both systems went dark separately offered strong evidence that the plane�s disappearance was deliberate.\n\nYesterday, Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit � �All right, good night� � were spoken to air-traffic controllers after the ACARS system was shut off. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board.\n\nAir force Maj. Gen. Affendi Buang said he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air-traffic controllers.\n\nThe search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, Hishammuddin said, adding that the number of countries involved in the operation had increased from 14 to 25.\n\n�The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort,� he said. �It has now become even more difficult.�\n\nThe search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. Hishammuddin said he had asked governments to hand over sensitive radar and satellite data to try to get a better idea of the plane�s final movements.\n\nIn the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC�s Meet the Press that the FBI is supporting the criminal probe.\n\nRep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence, said on ABC�s This Week that so far �there�s nothing out there indicating it�s terrorists.�\n\nInvestigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own will? Did one passenger or more manage to break into the cockpit or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then seize the plane? And what possible motive could there be for diverting the jet?\n\nPolice searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities �didn�t see the necessity in the early stages.�\n\nPolice confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues, Khalid said.\n\nMalaysian police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who might have had contact with the plane before it took off, Khalid said.\n\nEven though the ACARS system was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to emit faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off. That placed the jet somewhere in a huge arc from as far north as Kazakhstan in central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nWhile many people think the plane has crashed, there is a small possibility that it might have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi, the air force general, and Hishammuddin, the defense minister, said it was possible for the plane to �ping� when it was on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.\n\nWhoever disabled the plane�s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects, Malaysian officials and aviation experts said.\n\nZaharie, the captain, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member."", 'The Malaysia Airlines jet took off from Kuala Lumpur in the wee hours of March 8, headed to Beijing.\nAuthorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communication systems � the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS � about 40 minutes after takeoff.\nAbout 14 minutes later, the transponder that identifies the plane to commercial radar systems also was shut down.\nPolice searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane vanished, the government said.\nThe last �ping� was sent out at 8:11 a.m. � 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off.']"

It is also unclear if such messages are recorded by air traffic control and are available for expert analysis to determine who the voice belongs to.\n\nMalaysia Airlines could not be reached for comment and Malaysia\'s transport ministry declined to comment.\n\nMalaysia\'s police chief, Khalid Bakar, has said authorities were investigating all crew, passengers and ground staff involved with MH370 under a penal code that includes hijacking, sabotage and terrorism. Police had questioned Zaharie\'s friends and family, and dismantled and reassembled at headquarters a flight simulator Zaharie kept in his house on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nPolice also searched Fariq\'s home, although it was unclear if anything was confiscated.\n\nAccording to Malaysia Airlines, the pilot and co-pilot did not ask to fly together, reducing the probability of a co-ordinated plan between the pilots to hijack the aircraft.\n\nKhalid told reporters that all 239 people on board – 228 passengers and 11 Malaysian crew – were being investigated for suspicious activity, but that police were waiting for background information from some of the nations whose citizens were on the plane.\n\nEight days after the Boeing-777 vanished, with no concrete leads on its whereabouts, investigators are now searching for the plane along two possible flight corridors from the its last known location at 2.15am last Saturday over the Malacca strait – one stretches south from Indonesia towards the Indian Ocean, a vast expanse with very little radar coverage; the other reaches north from Thailand up towards central Asia, a heavily militarised area whose airspace is carefully scrutinised.\n\nThere are 25 countries assisting in the search, said Malaysia\'s defence and acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein – raising the additional challenges of co-ordinating ground, sea and aerial efforts as well as the delicate diplomatic issue of sharing significant sensitive information, from satellite data to primary and secondary radar playback, as well as any ground, sea and aerial co-ordination efforts.\n\n""This is a significant recalibration of the search,"" Hishammuddin told reporters on Sunday. ""From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans.\n\nThe search was already a highly complex, multinational effort. It has now become even more difficult.""\n\nMalaysia\'s prime minister, Najib Razak, has already spoken with the heads of state of Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and India; the foreign ministry has briefed at least 22 countries regarding the new search efforts as well as any additional countries that may be able to provide assistance.\n\nThose countries include Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia, with special assistance regarding satellite data requested from the US, China and France.\n\nSurveillance airplanes and maritime vessels will also be needed in the search for the missing jet along the southern corridor, where the Indian Ocean can reach depths of two miles and radar coverage is patchy at best.\n\nMalaysia Airlines has confirmed that the plane departed for Beijing with enough fuel only to reach its scheduled destination, so it would have been likely to run out after about seven hours\' flight time – if flying at normal cruising altitudes. But with reports emerging that the aircraft may have been flying at altitudes as high as 45,000ft, authorities also confirmed on Sunday that the plane need not have been flying for the duration of the period it was picked up by satellites.\n\nThe satellite ""pings"" that were last read at 8.11am on Saturday – six hours after Malaysian military radar last detected the aircraft over the Malacca strait at 2.15am – could still have been transmitting data from the ground, if the plane were to have landed, said Malaysia\'s civil aviation chief, Abdul Rahman.\n\n""The plane can still transmit pings from the ground as long as there is electrical power,"" he said.', 'Authorities have not yet disclosed whether the person who issued the last message to controllers was Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, or an unknown third person.\nMalaysia Airlines could not be reached for comment and Malaysia\'s transport ministry declined to comment.\nPolice had questioned Zaharie\'s friends and family, and dismantled and reassembled at headquarters a flight simulator Zaharie kept in his house on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur.\nAccording to Malaysia Airlines, the pilot and co-pilot did not ask to fly together, reducing the probability of a co-ordinated plan between the pilots to hijack the aircraft.\n""The plane can still transmit pings from the ground as long as there is electrical power,"" he said.']"

We cannot respond to every request immediately, so I ask you to bear with us.\n\n1. Search area\n\nAs the Prime Minister said yesterday, the operation has entered a new phase. The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort. It has now become even more difficult.\n\nThe search area has been significantly expanded. And the nature of the search has changed. From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans.\n\nThe number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased from 14 to 25, which brings new challenges of co-ordination and diplomacy to the search effort.\n\nThis is a significant recalibration of the search.\n\nThe search and rescue operation continues to be a multi-national effort, one led and co-ordinated by Malaysia.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, the Prime Minister has spoken to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the President of Turkmenistan, the President of Kazakhstan and Prime Minister of India.\n\nYesterday the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia briefed representatives from countries along the northern and southern corridors.\n\nAt 2pm today, the Foreign Ministry of Malaysia briefed representatives from 22 countries, including those along the northern and southern search corridors, as well other countries that may be able to help. These include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia.\n\nMalaysian officials are requesting support from these countries ― as well as others. This support includes general satellite data, radar playback ― both primary and secondary ― provisions for ground, sea and aerial search, and assets as appropriate.\n\nWe are currently discussing with all partners how best to deploy assets along the two search corridors. At this stage, both the northern and southern corridors are being treated with equal importance.\n\nWe are asking countries that have satellite assets, including the US, China and France amongst others, to provide further satellite data. And we are contacting additional countries who may be able to contribute specific assets relevant to the search and rescue operation. Surveillance aircraft are required, and maritime vessels are needed, particularly for the southern corridor.\n\n2. Police investigation\n\nAs the Prime Minister said yesterday, up until the time the aircraft left military primary radar coverage, its movements were consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane.\n\nI cannot comment on speculative theories as to what might have caused the deviation from the original flight path, as I do not wish to prejudice the on-going investigation.\n\nI understand the hunger for new details. But we do not want to jump to conclusions. Out of respect to the families, and the process itself, we must wait for the investigation to run its course.\n\nThe Malaysian authorities are refocusing their investigation on all crew and passengers on board MH370, as well as all ground staff handling the aircraft.\n\nYesterday, officers from the Royal Malaysia Police visited the home of the pilot. They spoke to family members of the pilot and experts are examining the pilot’s flight simulator. The police also visited the home of the co-pilot. According to Malaysian Airlines, the pilot and co-pilot did not ask to fly together on MH370.\n\nI would like to stress that Malaysia has been working with international law enforcement agencies since day one.\n\n3. Aircraft maintenance\n\nMalaysia Airlines has confirmed that the aircraft was subjected to the required maintenance programme: the Boeing Maintenance Planning Document. Checks are done according to this programme. The aircraft had been fully serviced and was fit to fly.\n\n4. New involvement\n\nThe Inmarsat team arrived yesterday and will support the investigations team, which includes the Malaysian authorities, and the UK and US teams.\n\n5. Concluding remarks\n\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that the search for MH370 has entered a new phase.\n\nThe information released yesterday has provided new leads, and given new direction to the search process.\n\nWe will provide more detail on the redeployment of assets when it becomes available. Facts must be corroborated and verified before being released.\n\nWhen possible, we will keep the media fully briefed, but our priority remains the search and rescue operation. To that end, we have been engaged in diplomatic and investigative efforts over the past 24 hours.\n\n* Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein is the Minister of Defence and Acting Minister of Transport.\n\n** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of The Malay Mail Online.', 'Search areaAs the Prime Minister said yesterday, the operation has entered a new phase.\nThe search and rescue operation continues to be a multi-national effort, one led and co-ordinated by Malaysia.\nIn the last 24 hours, the Prime Minister has spoken to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the President of Turkmenistan, the President of Kazakhstan and Prime Minister of India.\nWhen possible, we will keep the media fully briefed, but our priority remains the search and rescue operation.\n* Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein is the Minister of Defence and Acting Minister of Transport.']"

It has already said there was good reason to think the OMT exceeded the ECB’s mandate and violated a ban on the ECB funding governments.\n\nReferring to Tuesday’s decision, Christian Schulz, an economist at Berenberg bank, said it would have been a major surprise if the Constitutional Court had contradicted its own preliminary verdict from 2012.\n\n“It’s important that we have certainty about the legality of the ESM in the eyes of Karlsruhe because it is central to the financial stability architecture of the euro zone,” he said.\n\nBut the court had “created much bigger trouble” with its negative comments on the OMT in February, “because without that, the ESM is simply too small - it is not big enough to defend countries like Spain and Italy”, said Schulz.\n\nEconomist Hans-Werner Sinn, head of the Ifo economic think-tank, also said the court’s insistence on Bundestag approval of each ESM transfer would have implications for EU plans for a “banking union” scheme to tackle troubled banks.\n\nIt meant that “you can’t use the ESM’s funds as an automatic backstop for this wind-up mechanism if it doesn’t have enough money”, Sinn told reporters.', 'It also confirmed the legality of the “fiscal pact” for stricter European Union budget discipline, championed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nFinance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who had appeared for the government during the hearings, welcomed the final ruling which he said “confirmed our course for securing the stability of the currency” and boosted confidence in the euro zone.\nThe German court took the unprecedented decision last month to defer a ruling on the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) programme - which is credited with saving the euro zone - to the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg.\nThe German court could still give its own verdict after an ECJ ruling, which is likely to take over a year.\n“It’s important that we have certainty about the legality of the ESM in the eyes of Karlsruhe because it is central to the financial stability architecture of the euro zone,” he said.']"

A strong 59 percent agree with the $10 billion pace of tapering, with 27 percent saying the Fed should go faster and 10 percent saying slower. The Fed currently is purchasing $65 billion in assets every month to try and drive down interest rates and stimulate the economy. It has signaled it would reduce or taper its purchases by $10 billion at each meeting this year, which would effectively ends it purchase program by December.

There are greater divisions emerging over what happens next year, however. About 60 percent see the Fed hiking interest rates in 2015 and 40 percent look for it to wait until 2016 or later. While 60 percent see the Fed maintaining its large balance sheet, now at $4.1 trillion and growing, 40 percent see the Fed reducing it, which can happen either through asset sales or by not replacing bonds that mature.

The rate has already declined to 6.7 percent and Yellen and other Fed officials have said that it does not tell the full story of excess slack in the labor market and the need for continued low rates. ""They will use Yellen\'s first press conference to move away from the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold,"" said Diane Swonk of Mesirow Financial. About half of respondents think the Fed will drop a numerical target all together. A fifth of respondents think the threshold will be replaced by another number, with the average being 5.6 percent.

15737,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/18/When-Yellen-Meets-Press-Markets-Could-Tremble,business,"[""Most of the suspense surrounding this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee has less to do with the Fed’s asset purchase program (it will likely continue the “taper” by again slowing the pace of its purchases) or interest rates (they will hold them steady).\n\nIt has everything to do with how Fed Chair Janet Yellen articulates the path forward in her first meeting with the press Wednesday afternoon.\n\nIn guidance released last year, the central bank sought to calm market concerns about potential interest rate increases by laying out a quantitative threshold that committee members would be watching as they considered whether it was time to start raising interest rates again. Instead of just promising that interest rates would stay close to zero until, say, mid-2015, the Fed signaled it would hold steady until the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.5 percent as long as inflation also didn’t rise above 2.5 percent.\n\nThat unemployment figure is now within sight. The economy could easily reach it with a month or two of solid job creation, given that the rate currently stands at 6.7 percent.\n\nRelated: Yellen’s High-Stakes Challenge on Unemployment\n\nThe Fed, being the Fed, has been very careful about the language officials have used when discussing interest rate policies, and they have been quite clear that the 6.5 percent figure is a threshold, not a trigger for action. More recently, the bank’s policymakers have made clear that they will keep rates low well past the point that threshold is reached.\n\nSo nobody expects a sudden spike in interest rates coming out of this week’s two-day meeting or, indeed, any time this year. But businesses and investors plan for the long-term as well as the short-term, and Yellen will have to address the impact falling unemployment has on the FOMC’s thinking, even if actual policy movements are unlikely in the near term.\n\nIt’s clear that Yellen will have to lay out a new way to signal the Fed’s intentions – something more qualitative and open to interpretation – than relying on a hard number that could cause the market to make assumptions about imminent interest rate moves. The central bankers have already shifted their emphasis to that so-called “forward guidance,” but markets and Fed watchers will be eager to hear more about just what indicators Yellen and her colleagues will be watching.\n\nMichael Feroli, a research analyst at J.P. Morgan predicted that Yellen would use the FOMC’s post-meeting statement, as well as her meeting with the press to help smooth the transition from quantitative to more qualitative guidance.\n\n“Recent Fed-speak has increasingly focused on what Atlanta Fed President Lockhart has called the ‘shadow labor force,’ Feroli wrote in a research note. “In particular, the statement could begin to reference a desire to see lower levels of part-time employment for economic reasons and in measured marginal attachment to the labor force, such as discouraged workers.”\n\n\n\nRelated: Yellen Says Fed Needs “Firmer Handle” on Soft Data\n\nAnalysts at Nomura Securities said that while they expect the FOMC to jettison most of the quantitative aspects of forward guidance, they believe policymakers will retain language indicating that they “will maintain a low interest rate if projected inflation continues to run below the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.”\n\nThe need for the Fed to adjust its forward guidance, interestingly, comes just a week after the influential Bank for International Settlements published a paper calling into question the overall usefulness of forward guidance as a tool.\n\nThe paper concluded, “The recent increased reliance on forward guidance has been helpful in clarifying policy intentions in highly unusual economic circumstances. However, the mixed evidence concerning the effectiveness of these practices, and the challenges they raise, caution against drawing firm conclusions about their ultimate value.”\n\nGiven that Yellen was an early supporter of aggressive forward guidance from the Fed, and that she has signaled that policies under her leadership will be largely consistent with those under her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, whatever the market hears on Wednesday will likely reflect a change in nuance rather than a change in overall philosophy.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times"", 'It has everything to do with how Fed Chair Janet Yellen articulates the path forward in her first meeting with the press Wednesday afternoon.\nMore recently, the bank’s policymakers have made clear that they will keep rates low well past the point that threshold is reached.\nSo nobody expects a sudden spike in interest rates coming out of this week’s two-day meeting or, indeed, any time this year.\nThe central bankers have already shifted their emphasis to that so-called “forward guidance,” but markets and Fed watchers will be eager to hear more about just what indicators Yellen and her colleagues will be watching.\nThe paper concluded, “The recent increased reliance on forward guidance has been helpful in clarifying policy intentions in highly unusual economic circumstances.']"

But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it may drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed eventually to raise short-term rates. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.\n\n\n\n�\n\nThe Fed\'s most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows ""well past"" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials have recently suggested scrapping the 6.5 percent threshold and instead describing more general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.\n\nCharles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there\'s ""not a large expectation"" that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.\n\nOne reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market\'s health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they\'re no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.\n\n""There is a growing consensus to go with more nuance instead of a specific number,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. ""I think they are just too close to 6.5 percent on the unemployment rate.""\n\nYellen, who was sworn as chair on Feb. 3, has spoken of seeking continuity with Bernanke, under whom she served as vice chair. That\'s partly why the Fed will likely announce this week a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases. Those purchases have been intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage spending and growth.\n\nIn December and in January, the Fed cut its monthly pace of bond buying from an original $85 billion in $10 billion increments to $65 billion. If the economy keeps improving, the Fed will likely keep paring its bond purchases until ending them altogether in December.\n\nThe pullback is expected to occur despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that\'s depressed growth, to fears about how Russia\'s aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.\n\nStill, Fed officials, including Yellen, have signaled their belief that the weakness in U.S. economic data is temporary rather than a sign the economy is losing momentum.\n\nThe Fed and most private economists foresee faster economic growth in 2014. Many think the economy, which grew a lackluster 1.9 percent in 2013, will rebound to around 3 percent this year.\n\nOther business headlines\n\n\n\nStocks rally: What you need to know\n\n\n\nMajor upgrades coming from Apple', 'The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest this week with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts.\nThe Associated PressWASHINGTON � The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest this week with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts.\nWill Yellen, having succeeded Ben Bernanke, embrace Bernanke\'s approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed\'s economic stimulus?\n�The Fed\'s most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows ""well past"" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent.\nOne reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market\'s health.']"

Ordningen gjør det enklere å få lånet, og kan i tillegg gi en økonomisk fordel. Her får du vite alt du trenger om det å ha en medlåntaker.\n\nDette er en medlånstaker\n\nNår du tar opp et lån sammen med en annen person, har du en medlåntaker. Begge to blir ansvarlige for å gjøre opp gjelden, og begge har samme rett til pengene som lånes.\n\nFra bankene sin side står de da bedre rustet til å få tilbake det utlånte beløpet. Mister for eksempel en av dere inntektene, må den andre gjøre opp alene.\n\nBilligere forbrukslån\n\nDen ekstra sikkerheten banken får når du søker med en medlåntaker, gir naturligvis større sjanse for at lånet innvilges. Men, akkurat den biten er faktisk ikke det viktigste, for kravene er uansett ikke spesielt høye.\n\nDen største fordelen med en medlåntaker er at lånet ofte blir billigere sier Billigeforbrukslån.no.

While China appears to be slowing, it is important to note the context: the much larger size of the Chinese economy today, versus double-digit growth in the past, means that 7 percent increases are potentially just as big as those in the 2000’s. Additionally, the Chinese government is actually engineering the slower rate, which means that if growth slows down too much, the government can easily push policy levers in the opposite direction.\n\nWith regard to Ukraine, if the situation results in a prolonged diplomatic stalemate, markets are likely to remain subdued. But if there were worsening violence or an escalation to a full-blown trade war, the impact would be more severe.\n\nRegardless of events in China and Ukraine, there is some anticipation that the Fed will discuss the conditions under which it would finally raise interest rates, which have been at 0 – 0.25 percent since December of 2008 (pity the beleaguered savers!)

If the Fed emphasizes that they intend to keep interest rates low, it could be interpreted by the markets as a positive for stocks and risk-taking in general. With the Fed on deck, and given the S&P 500 recaptured an important support level, stocks could experience better than expected outcomes this week.\n\nGuidance Takes Center Stage\n\nThe Fed has signaled in recent weeks that the threshold for altering their bond tapering schedule is high. Therefore, the market expects another round of tapering this week. The focus has shifted to forward guidance. In the current economic environment, forward guidance is the Fed’s way of signaling to the markets how long they expect to keep interest rates low. Forward guidance has been tied almost exclusively to the unemployment rate; that may change Wednesday. From MarketWatch:\n\nThe Fed’s current pledge is to hold rates steady until “well past” the point when the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%. But the unemployment rate has steadily dropped over the past year, before ticking up slightly to 6.7% in February. “It is time to seriously rethink that 6.5% unemployment target because we are so close to it,” said former Fed governor Randall Kroszner in an interview with MarketWatch. Yellen has signaled that she would be comfortable with this change, analysts said, when she told lawmakers last month that the unemployment rate did not fully summarize the health of the labor market.\n\nVulnerabilities Call For Flexibility\n\nWhile stocks staged an impressive rally Monday, this week’s stock market outlook video covers numerous observable signs of vulnerability. While vulnerable does not mean bearish, it speaks to the need to pay close attention this week from a risk management perspective.\n\nKeeping An Ear To The Ground\n\nIt is always a good idea to review recent writings from The Wall Street Journal’s Jon Hilsenrath prior to a formal Fed statement. The excerpt below also points to guidance being the focus of this week’s Fed statement. From The Wall Street Journal:\n\nNew York Fed President William Dudley said on March 6 he thought the Fed should revise the guidance with the jobless rate so close to 6.5%. It was 6.6% in January. With Friday’s report that it rose to 6.7% in February, that takes a little pressure off officials to change their guidance right away. Still, Mr. Dudley said he believed March was the right time to strike new chords on the interest rate outlook. “My personal opinion is 6 ½% is not providing a lot of value right now in terms of our communications,” Mr. Dudley said. “So my personal view is this is probably a reasonable time to revamp the statement to take out that 6 ½% threshold because it’s not really providing any great value. I’d rather do it before I reached that threshold.” To be clear, Mr. Dudley remains strongly supportive of Fed efforts to spur stronger growth and bring down unemployment. He said Thursday he was comfortable with the market’s view the Fed wouldn’t start raising short-term interest rates until mid- to late-2015.\n\nInvestment Implications – Key Support Still In Play\n\nJust as we noted vulnerable does not mean bearish, the incremental risk-reduction steps we took last week are a form of risk management, not a shift to the bearish camp. The comments from my last article still apply:\n\nOur core positions continue to be U.S. stocks (SPY) and technology stocks (QQQ). Last week our allocation to stocks contracted and our cash position expanded. The market remains in a more vulnerable state, but bearish conviction is not yet strong enough to carry the day, which can be seen in the flattish nature of the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average. The market’s current profile requires a high degree of flexibility. With a Fed meeting on this week’s docket, we must be willing to increase or decrease our equity exposure based on the incoming data and evidence.\n\nThe chart below shows the S&P 500 making a stand near a key range. Also note, the slope of the 50-day moving average is trying to turn back up in a bullish manner, which reflects improving investor sentiment relative to last week.\n\nThe S&P 500 Makes A Stand\n\nMonday’s return to a risk-on bias allowed us to take a small incremental step on the growth side of the portfolio via the S&P 500 Equal-Weight ETF (RSP). If conditions continue to improve, we will further reduce our cash holdings and add to our stock positions.', 'With the Fed on deck, and given the S&P 500 recaptured an important support level, stocks could experience better than expected outcomes this week.\nForward guidance has been tied almost exclusively to the unemployment rate; that may change Wednesday.\nFrom MarketWatch:The Fed’s current pledge is to hold rates steady until “well past” the point when the unemployment rate falls below 6.5%.\nBut the unemployment rate has steadily dropped over the past year, before ticking up slightly to 6.7% in February.\nThe comments from my last article still apply:Our core positions continue to be U.S. stocks (SPY) and technology stocks (QQQ).']"

15762,http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765649934/Yellen-to-put-Feds-new-leadership-on-display.html,business,"['WASHINGTON — The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest this week with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts. Yet all that will be a prelude to the marquee event: Yellen\'s first news conference as Fed chair.\n\nThe financial world will be parsing every word for any hint of a policy shift.\n\nWill Yellen, having succeeded Ben Bernanke, embrace Bernanke\'s approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed\'s economic stimulus?\n\nOr, as some speculate, might she prove even more inclined than Bernanke to favor low rates to try to accelerate job growth, even at the risk of high inflation?\n\nNo major announcements are expected when the meeting ends Wednesday. But many analysts think the Fed could make one change in its statement: They think it may drop any reference to an unemployment rate that might cause the Fed eventually to raise short-term rates. Eliminating that reference would help the Fed maximize its flexibility on rates.\n\nThe Fed\'s most recent policy statement said it planned to keep short-term rates at record lows ""well past"" the time the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent. The rate is now 6.7 percent. But several Fed officials have recently suggested scrapping the 6.5 percent threshold and instead describing more general changes in the job market and inflation that might trigger a rate increase.\n\nCharles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said last week that there\'s ""not a large expectation"" that the 6.5 percent threshold will remain much longer, a point also made recently by William Dudley, president of the New York Fed.\n\nOne reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market\'s health. In recent months, for example, the rate has fallen not so much because of robust hiring but because many people without a job have stopped looking for one. Once people stop looking for a job, they\'re no longer counted as unemployed, and the rate can fall as a result.\n\n""There is a growing consensus to go with more nuance instead of a specific number,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. ""I think they are just too close to 6.5 percent on the unemployment rate.""\n\nYellen, who was sworn as chair on Feb. 3, has spoken of seeking continuity with Bernanke, under whom she served as vice chair. That\'s partly why the Fed will likely announce this week a third reduction in its monthly bond purchases. Those purchases have been intended to keep long-term loan rates low to encourage spending and growth.\n\nIn December and in January, the Fed cut its monthly pace of bond buying from an original $85 billion in $10 billion increments to $65 billion. If the economy keeps improving, the Fed will likely keep paring its bond purchases until ending them altogether in December.\n\nThe pullback is expected to occur despite challenges the U.S. economy and financial markets face, from a brutal winter that\'s depressed growth, to fears about how Russia\'s aggression toward Ukraine might slow the global economy.\n\nStill, Fed officials, including Yellen, have signaled their belief that the weakness in U.S. economic data is temporary rather than a sign the economy is losing momentum.\n\nThe Fed and most private economists foresee faster economic growth in 2014. Many think the economy, which grew a lackluster 1.9 percent in 2013, will rebound to around 3 percent this year.\n\n""We had a tough start to the year with the winter storms, but it looks like we are starting to pull out of those weather effects,"" said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors.\n\nEconomists point to several hopeful signs — from a rebound in retail sales to an increase of 175,000 jobs in February despite continued harsh weather.\n\nEven if the economy strengthens and the Fed ends its bond purchases late this year, it will still be stimulating the economy. It has no plans to start selling its enormous portfolio of bonds — a step that would likely send loan rates up. Nor is it likely this year to raise the benchmark short-term rate it controls.\n\nMore than five years ago, the Fed cut that rate to a record low near zero, where it\'s remained since. Most analysts think the Fed will keep its target for short-term rates near zero until late 2015.\n\nOne reason the Fed may choose this week to drop its mention of a 6.5 percent unemployment rate as a threshold for an eventual rate increase is that Yellen will hold a news conference. Her question-and-answer session with reporters would allow her to explain the Fed\'s reasoning for any change.\n\nUnder a plan established by Bernanke, the Fed\'s chair holds news conferences after four of the eight meetings each year. The next news conference isn\'t scheduled until June.\n\nNot all economists expect the Fed this week to drop a link between a specific unemployment rate and an eventual rate increase.\n\n""I don\'t think they will tweak the language,"" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Tuft University. ""There is enough wiggle room currently.""', 'WASHINGTON — The Janet Yellen era at the Federal Reserve begins in earnest this week with a two-day meeting, a policy statement and fresh economic forecasts.\nWill Yellen, having succeeded Ben Bernanke, embrace Bernanke\'s approach of keeping rates low while gradually paring the Fed\'s economic stimulus?\nOne reason for dropping the threshold, as Yellen among others have noted, is that the unemployment rate can overstate the job market\'s health.\n""I think they are just too close to 6.5 percent on the unemployment rate.""\nNot all economists expect the Fed this week to drop a link between a specific unemployment rate and an eventual rate increase.']"

Twenty percent of 54 economists surveyed said the Fed will maintain the threshold, while 6 percent said the Fed will drop such guidance entirely.\n\nAlert:\n\nStocks to Drop 90%? These 5 Charts Reveal Why...\n\nFed Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are considering ways to clarify when they’ll increase borrowing costs for the first time since 2006 after payrolls rose more than projected last month and unemployment fell to 6.7 percent from 7 percent in November. They plan to begin a two-day meeting Tuesday.\n\nPolicy makers will lean toward “less specificity and a greater emphasis on just judgment,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo & Co. in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n“Often these economic numbers can move in ways you don’t anticipate and because of things you can’t anticipate, and I think they got caught off guard,” he said, citing the fall in joblessness.\n\nPolicy makers at their Dec. 17-18 meeting forecast unemployment would decline by the end of this year to 6.3 percent to 6.6 percent. Joblessness has fallen from 7.5 percent in June and a 26-year high of 10 percent in October 2009.\n\nEvery Meeting\n\nThe FOMC this week also will announce a cut in monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $55 billion and continue reductions at that pace at every meeting before announcing an end to the buying at its Oct. 28-29 gathering, according to the median of responses in the survey. Policy makers at each of their prior two meetings have cut monthly purchases by $10 billion.\n\nThe committee “will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings,” Yellen said to the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 27. “That said, purchases are not on a preset course, and the committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York President William C. Dudley in comments on March 6 endorsed a switch to qualitative guidance. In a speech the following day he said the decline in the jobless rate “significantly overstates the degree of improvement in the labor market.” People dropping out of the labor force accounts for much of the fall in the unemployment rate, said Dudley, FOMC vice chairman.\n\n“Dudley seemed pretty clear it’s time to abandon the 6.5 percent unemployment rate, and it makes sense to do it before their backs are up to the wall” should the jobless rate fall further, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. “They’ve laid down enough clues to tell me that they’re ready to make the change.”\n\nAlert:\n\nStocks to Drop 90%?

Her får du vite alt du trenger om det å ha en medlåntaker.\n\nDette er en medlånstaker\n\nNår du tar opp et lån sammen med en annen person, har du en medlåntaker. Begge to blir ansvarlige for å gjøre opp gjelden, og begge har samme rett til pengene som lånes.\n\nFra bankene sin side står de da bedre rustet til å få tilbake det utlånte beløpet. Mister for eksempel en av dere inntektene, må den andre gjøre opp alene.\n\nBilligere forbrukslån\n\nDen ekstra sikkerheten banken får når du søker med en medlåntaker, gir naturligvis større sjanse for at lånet innvilges. Men, akkurat den biten er faktisk ikke det viktigste, for kravene er uansett ikke spesielt høye.\n\nDen største fordelen med en medlåntaker er at lånet ofte blir billigere sier Billigeforbrukslån.no. Rentene på et forbrukslån fastsettes individuelt av de fleste banker. Rentefastsettelsen avhenger veldig av søkerens betalingsevne, noe som selvsagt blir bedre når to søker sammen. Dermed kan man ofte forvente bedre tilbud på rentebetingelser.\n\nLike krav til begge søkere\n\nBanker som aksepterer medlånstaker på forbrukslån stiller de samme kravene til begge to.

I tillegg må dere begge ha norsk statsborgerskap, eller såkalt d-nummer (gjelder utenlandske statsborgere som skatter til Norge).\n\nLån helst med partneren din\n\nDet anbefales at en medlånstaker er ektefellen eller samboeren din. Da unngås lettere uenigheter om hvem som skal betale avdragene på lånet. Faktisk er det stadig flere banker som krever at den du låner sammen med er en ektefelle, eller samboer i registrert forhold.\n\nDet er i tillegg enklere for ektefeller, og til en viss grad samboere, å fordele skattefradraget for gjeldsrenter.\n\nKausjonist er noe annet\n\nMerk deg at en medlåntaker ikke er det samme som kausjonist. Å ha kausjonsansvar gir ingen rettighet til pengene, men kausjonisten får likevel ansvar for tilbakebetaling av lånet dersom låntakeren ikke overholder forpliktelsene sine overfor banken.\n\nPer i dag er det få banker som tilbyr lån mot kausjonsansvar, blant de som spesialiserer seg på forbrukslån.', 'Dette er en medlånstakerNår du tar opp et lån sammen med en annen person, har du en medlåntaker.\nBilligere forbrukslånDen ekstra sikkerheten banken får når du søker med en medlåntaker, gir naturligvis større sjanse for at lånet innvilges.\nLike krav til begge søkereBanker som aksepterer medlånstaker på forbrukslån stiller de samme kravene til begge to.\nFaktisk er det stadig flere banker som krever at den du låner sammen med er en ektefelle, eller samboer i registrert forhold.\nPer i dag er det få banker som tilbyr lån mot kausjonsansvar, blant de som spesialiserer seg på forbrukslån.']"

15785,http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/03/14/janet-yellen-and-the-fed-must-champion-jobs-as-republicans-refuses-to-act,business,"[""Half a decade after the financial crisis, the Great Recession is still alive and kicking. Thirty million Americans are unemployed or underemployed, and there’s still only one job opening for every three applicants. All this joblessness has put downward pressure on everyone’s wages and reversed years of progress in fighting poverty.\n\nOur government has a moral obligation to end this crisis. As co-founders of the Congressional Full Employment Caucus, we’ve put forth legislation to make needed investments in infrastructure, job training, education and local and state public services to get everyone working, earning a salary and contributing to the tax base.\n\nBut House leaders refuse to act. By instead pursuing reckless job-killing budget cuts and dangerous and ineffective deregulation, Congressional Republicans keep making matters worse.\n\nThat’s why we just submitted a letter -- signed by 21 members of Congress -- to the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, with a simple message: When Congress fails to help the unemployed, you must help carry the mantle. Chairwoman Yellen has a long history of standing up for working people and a powerful arsenal of economic policies to fight unemployment.\n\nThe Fed has a mandate dating back to the Employment Act of 1946 to pursue the goals of “maximum employment, production and purchasing power.” As the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act further clarified in 1978, the Fed is supposed to actively set maximum employment targets and use all its policy levers to achieve a full employment society.\n\nSince the start of the Great Recession, Yellen and her predecessor Ben Bernanke have taken this mandate seriously, pursuing a policy known as quantitative easing to purchase mortgage-backed securities, Treasury bills and other kinds of bonds to lower interest rates and accelerate job creation and economic growth. The Fed, in short, is not only using its most effective tool to fight for jobs; it's quite simply the only powerful economic player in Washington that’s doing what it can to solve the unemployment crisis.\n\nStill, Yellen and her colleagues are facing serious pressure to stop quantitative easing and other pro-employment policies. Some conservatives see such easing as excessive government interference or a potential cause of inflation, even through inflation remains extremely low. Texas Gov. Rick Perry went so far as calling the Fed’s policies “treason” during an Iowa stop on the 2012 primary campaign trail.\n\nIf conservatives truly believe that Fed actions amount to “treason,” we have some good news for them. Republicans can end any disagreeable Fed policies any time. All they have to do is pass a serious jobs bill in Congress.\n\nAs prominent Republican economist Martin Feldstein argued in the New York Times recently, the Fed would be free to end its quantitative easing if Congress enacted a serious jobs agenda. There’s no shortage of fiscally responsible legislative options to create jobs. The Congressional Progressive Caucus’s “Better Off Budget,” released this week, would, for instance, create an estimated 8.8 million jobs while reducing deficits by more than $4 trillion over 10 years. From state infrastructure banks to training programs for the long-term unemployed, there are plenty of ways to reduce unemployment without betraying conservative principles."", 'All this joblessness has put downward pressure on everyone’s wages and reversed years of progress in fighting poverty.\nStill, Yellen and her colleagues are facing serious pressure to stop quantitative easing and other pro-employment policies.\nRepublicans can end any disagreeable Fed policies any time.\nAll they have to do is pass a serious jobs bill in Congress.\nAs prominent Republican economist Martin Feldstein argued in the New York Times recently, the Fed would be free to end its quantitative easing if Congress enacted a serious jobs agenda.']"
15786,http://www.nasdaq.com/article/fed-strategy-taper-or-bust-cm335768,business,"['By Mark Hamrick for Bankrate.com\n\nThis week, Janet Yellen leads her first Federal Reserve meeting and holds her first news conference since becoming the central bank\'s new chair.\n\nMonetary policy under Yellen is expected to virtually mimic that of predecessor Ben Bernanke, at least in the near-term. It\'s a bit like the classic rock hit ""Won\'t Get Fooled Again"" by The Who, specifically the lyrics, ""Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss."" That continuity should be welcome by the financial markets, which don\'t tend to digest change well.\n\nA busy week\n\nHere\'s what we have on the economic calendar this week:\n\nThe Fed reports on February industrial production, Monday at 9:15 a.m. (all times Eastern).\n\nThe Commerce Department reports on February housing starts, Tuesday at 8:30 a.m.\n\nThe Labor Department reports on the February Consumer Price Index, Tuesday at 8:30 a.m.\n\nThe Fed releases a statement after its policy meeting and Yellen holds a news conference, Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors releases February existing home sales, Thursday at 10 a.m.\n\nThe Conference Board releases the index of leading economic indicators, Friday at 10 a.m.\n\nOn the Fed\'s agenda\n\nThe Federal Reserve\'s meeting is expected to result in another decision to reduce monthly asset purchases -- a wind-down that\'s widely become known as ""tapering.""\n\nSpecifically, the pace of bond-buying is expected to be cut by another $10 billion to $55 billion. The asset purchases are on track to end this year.\n\nMany experts believe the Fed\'s first boost in short-term interest rates will come next year.\n\n""From their perspective, I think they\'re going to try to keep in that mid-2015 (range). Right now, they don’t want to rock the apple cart,"" says Diane Swonk, chief economist with Mesirow Financial. But she thinks there\'s a chance the Fed might not be able to raise rates quite so soon, particularly if the recovery stumbles and inflation remains remarkably low.\n\nEconomy\'s temperature?\n\nWith winter presumably on its last legs, the economy is expected to shake off its recent chill. There was a reassuring sign last week when the government reported a better-than-expected 0.3 percent increase in retail sales.\n\n""The spring recovery is on the way,"" writes economist Scott Anderson with Bank of the West.\n\nFor many, the arrival of spring will be more welcome than usual. That\'s especially true for businesses that have been seeing diminished sales because of harsh winter weather.\n\nSome economists think growth for the first quarter will come in below 2 percent. The prediction from Chris Christopher, director of consumer economics for IHS Global Insight, is for gross domestic product growth of just 1.4 percent in the first three months of the year.\n\n""If we\'d had regular winter weather, that would\'ve been 1.6 percent,"" he says.\n\nHousing complexities\n\nHousing, too, has been affected by the bad weather, among other negative factors. They include ""tight credit, eroding affordability conditions and limited inventory,"" says Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors.\n\nAs we move into the springtime, ""we\'ll probably see a bounce-back,"" Molony says. For all of 2014, he looks for sales of previously owned homes to be flat to down 0.2 percent this year.\n\n""Prices, on the other hand, are likely to grow 5 (percent) to 6 percent because of ongoing shortages,"" Molony notes.\n\nOf course, local conditions vary, depending upon the market. There\'s that ""location, location, location"" thing.\n\nThis week in business history\n\nOn March 18, 1852, Wells Fargo was founded. It rapidly became synonymous with one of the leading forms of transportation: the stage coach. The name has become iconic from movies about the Old West.\n\nBefore the automobile, a stage coach could carry some combination of passengers and freight, including gold dust and business papers. In 1869, completion of the transcontinental railroad was the beginning of the end for the stage coach business. But Wells Fargo lives on as one of the nation\'s largest banks.\n\nThis article was originally published on Bankrate.com.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.', ""Monetary policy under Yellen is expected to virtually mimic that of predecessor Ben Bernanke, at least in the near-term.\nA busy weekHere's what we have on the economic calendar this week:The Fed reports on February industrial production, Monday at 9:15 a.m. (all times Eastern).\nThe Fed releases a statement after its policy meeting and Yellen holds a news conference, Wednesday afternoon.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.""]"

The central banker confirmed that it will not be walking away from an accommodative monetary policy because the labor market is still in a difficult predicament today.\n\nDudley noted that there have been several economic prospects that are “reasonably favorable,” but he did concede that he would like to see faster economic growth, a quicker decrease in the unemployment rate and higher inflation.\n\n“I would very much prefer faster economic growth and more rapid progress towards our dual mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability,” Dudley said last week in his oration presented at Brooklyn College in New York. “Hence, the continued need for monetary policy to remain highly accommodative to support the economic recovery to the fullest.”\n\nSince the quantitative easing measures were introduced by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, the jobless rate threshold to start raising rates was 6.5 percent, which was reaffirmed by new Fed Chair Janet Yellen, though she did warn that they might not even be raised. Dudley concurred with this suggestion.\n\nHe made the case that rather than looking at a 6.5 percent unemployment figure, the Fed should analyze a wide variety of indicators which include the real estate market and financial state of those polled to make a complete health assessment of the overall labor market in the U.S. today.\n\n“I do expect that growth will be strong enough to lead to continued improvement in labor-market conditions. I must caution, however, that the outlook for the unemployment rate is unusually uncertain,” said Dudley. “Such developments could result in a more muted rate of decline of the unemployment rate despite the faster growth.”\n\nThe nation’s unemployment rate stands at 6.7 percent.\n\nThe key Fed policy decision maker refrained from touching upon the central bank’s bond-buying measures. Instead, the Fed president said investor predictions that an increase in rates next year is sensible. However, analysts argue that his dovish tone in his speech and remarks might signify that the Fed is nowhere near tightening its near-zero interest rates that has been the policy for the past five years.\n\nDuring an official swearing-in ceremony in Washington last week, Yellen reiterated her concerns again about the unstable labor market. We reported that Yellen promised that she would “do all that I can” to improve the availability of jobs and reassured the market she would continue the present interest-rate policy.\n\n“I promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and challenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy,” stated Yellen.\n\nCharles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, told an audience at the Columbus State University on Monday that it’s likely the Fed will continue trimming its bond purchases at a $10 billion tapering pace.\n\n“We’re at a point now where we’re moving away from purchasing assets, we’re tapering, and our balance sheet continues to be very large but we’re not going to add to it as much,” said Evans, Reuters reported. “The last two meetings we reduced the purchase flow rate by $10 billion and we’re going to continue to do that.”\n\nMany haven’t been so quick to assume the Fed will persist in tapering. There have been ardent critics, such as Peter Schiff, Ron Paul and Marc Faber, that think Yellen and the Fed will actually enhance its monthly bond-buying initiatives. Late last year, Evans himself tweeted that the Fed would increase QE by 26 percent in 2014.', 'Although it has been a slow one, there have been some bright spots in the United States economic recovery, says New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley in a speech Friday.\nDudley noted that there have been several economic prospects that are “reasonably favorable,” but he did concede that he would like to see faster economic growth, a quicker decrease in the unemployment rate and higher inflation.\nI must caution, however, that the outlook for the unemployment rate is unusually uncertain,” said Dudley.\n“Such developments could result in a more muted rate of decline of the unemployment rate despite the faster growth.”The nation’s unemployment rate stands at 6.7 percent.\nThe key Fed policy decision maker refrained from touching upon the central bank’s bond-buying measures.']"

In the past 12 months, prices have risen just 1.1 percent, down from 1.6 percent in January and the smallest yearly gain in five months.\n\n\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.1 percent last month and 1.6 percent in the past year.\n\n\n\nEnergy prices fell 0.5 percent because lower gasoline and electricity costs offset higher prices for natural gas and heating oil. Clothes and used cars were also cheaper last month.\n\n\n\nStill, consumers took a hit at the grocery store as food costs rose 0.4 percent, the most in nearly 2 1/2 years. Beef prices jumped 4 percent in February, the most in more than 10 years, as recent droughts have pushed up cattle feed prices. Milk, cheese and other dairy prices also rose.\n\n\n\nThe big drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.1 percent comes as the Federal Reserve starts a two-day policy meeting, its first under new chair Janet Yellen. Low inflation has enabled the Federal Reserve to pursue extraordinary stimulus programs in an effort to boost economic growth.\n\n\n\nThe Fed is now trying to unwind some of that stimulus. It is purchasing $65 billion in bonds this month, down from $75 billion in January and $85 billion last year. The bond purchases are aimed at lowering long-term interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending.\n\n\n\nFed policymakers are expected to announce another $10 billion cut Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe slowdown in the annual inflation rate occurred partly because energy prices spiked in February 2013, and that figure has now fallen out of the year-over-year calculation. As a result, economists don't think the rate will fall much further.\n\n\n\nInflation has been held back by sluggish growth and a tough job market, which makes it harder for retailers and other businesses to raise prices.\n\n\n\nWhile shoppers may prefer lower prices, economists warn that super-low inflation can slow economic growth. It encourages consumers to postpone purchases and can also make inflation-adjusted interest rates higher, potentially discouraging borrowing."", ""WASHINGTON - Cheaper energy kept U.S. consumer prices in check last month, despite a big rise in the cost of food, the latest sign that inflation is tame.\nThe consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in February, matching January's increase, the Labor Department said Tuesday.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.1 percent last month and 1.6 percent in the past year.\nEnergy prices fell 0.5 percent because lower gasoline and electricity costs offset higher prices for natural gas and heating oil.\nThe slowdown in the annual inflation rate occurred partly because energy prices spiked in February 2013, and that figure has now fallen out of the year-over-year calculation.""]"

A jump in building permits last month, however, also offered cautious optimism for an acceleration once the weather warms up.\n\n“The economy is not too hot and not too cold. Winter was a difficult season for housing and there are no signs that inflation is about to pick up in a meaningful way,” said Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.\n\nThe Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index nudged up 0.1 percent for the second month in a row as a drop in gasoline prices offset the largest rise in the cost of food in nearly 2-1/2 years.\n\nIn the 12 months through February, consumer prices were up only 1.1 percent, slowing from a 1.6 percent rise in January. The February increase was the smallest in four months.\n\nStripping out the volatile energy and food components, the so-called core CPI rose 0.1 percent for a third straight month. Its 12-month gain held steady at 1.6 percent.\n\nThe Fed targets 2 percent inflation and it tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI. With inflation falling short of their target, Fed officials are likely to bide their time before raising benchmark overnight rates from zero.\n\nNevertheless, they have indicated they will press forward with plans to wind down a separate bond-buying stimulus program.\n\n“There isn’t much to suggest inflation is about to make a move to the upside or downside,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “This should allow the Fed to remain growth-friendly.”\n\nFed officials are expected to announce another $10 billion cut to their monthly bond-buying program when their meeting concludes on Wednesday.\n\nSeparately, a quarterly survey by the Business Roundtable found U.S. chief executive officers somewhat more positive about the economy, including plans for hiring and capital spending over the next six months, although they expect only tepid growth this year.\n\nWhen asked in a conference call if the CEOs felt they had pricing power, AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson said they were not surveyed about pricing but added that he thought most were experiencing “kind of a low inflation environment.”\n\n“We have all built our business plans around continued low inflationary expectations,” said Stephenson, who is also chairman of the Business Roundtable.\n\nDROUGHT FACTOR\n\nA drought in the western United States likely accounted for the 0.4 percent rise in food prices last month, the largest advance since September 2011. There were big increases in the prices for meat, fish, poultry, eggs, vegetables and fruits.\n\nWithin the core CPI, a 0.2 percent gain in the cost of shelter was the major contributor to the rise in the index. There were also increases in medical care, recreation and new vehicle prices. But prices for tobacco, used cars and trucks, apparel and household furnishings and operations fell.\n\nIn a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 907,000 units in February. Groundbreaking declined 11.2 percent in January.\n\nSevere winter weather likely constrained building activity last month, with starts in the Northeast region plunging 37.5 percent. However, there were huge increases in the Midwest and South.\n\nHousing lost momentum after a run-up in mortgage rates last summer. High prices and a lack of properties on the market are also holding back buying activity.\n\n“We are probably due for a bounce in the coming months as the weather normalizes, but questions linger about the underlying pace of starts once the catch-up period is over,” said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nGroundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest segment of the market, rose 0.3 percent last month. Starts for the volatile multi-family homes segment fell 1.2 percent.\n\nPermits to build homes increased 7.7 percent to a 1.02 million-unit pace, ending three straight months of declines. Permits for single-family homes, however, fell 1.8 percent, while those for multifamily units surged 24.3 percent.\n\n“The gap between starts and permits is widening and since builders don’t pay the money for permits unless they expect to do something with them, you can bet that once the warm weather returns, so will the bulldozers,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.', 'The data, which came as the Fed opened a two-day policy meeting, painted a picture of sluggish economic growth in the first quarter as unseasonably cold weather disrupted activity.\nA jump in building permits last month, however, also offered cautious optimism for an acceleration once the weather warms up.\nIn the 12 months through February, consumer prices were up only 1.1 percent, slowing from a 1.6 percent rise in January.\nThe Fed targets 2 percent inflation and it tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI.\nIn a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 907,000 units in February.']"

Beef prices jumped 4% in February, the most in more than 10 years, as recent droughts have pushed up cattle feed prices. Milk, cheese and other dairy prices also rose.\n\nThe big drop in the annual inflation rate to 1.1% comes as the Federal Reserve starts a two-day policy meeting, its first under new chair Janet Yellen. Low inflation has enabled the Federal Reserve to pursue extraordinary stimulus programs in an effort to boost economic growth.\n\nThe Fed is now trying to unwind some of that stimulus. It is purchasing $65 billion in bonds this month, down from $75 billion in January and $85 billion last year. The bond purchases are aimed at lowering long-term interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending.\n\nFed policymakers are expected to announce another $10 billion cut Wednesday.\n\nThe slowdown in the annual inflation rate occurred partly because energy prices spiked in February 2013, and that figure has now fallen out of the year-over-year calculation. As a result, economists don't think the rate will fall much further.\n\nInflation has been held back by sluggish growth and a tough job market, which makes it harder for retailers and other businesses to raise prices.\n\nWhile shoppers may prefer lower prices, economists warn that super-low inflation can slow economic growth. It encourages consumers to postpone purchases and can also make inflation-adjusted interest rates higher, potentially discouraging borrowing.\n\nlink"", 'Cheaper energy kept U.S. consumer prices in check last month, despite a big rise in the cost of food, the latest sign that inflation is tame.\nExcluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 0.1% last month and 1.6% in the past year.\nEnergy prices fell 0.5% because lower gasoline and electricity costs offset higher prices for natural gas and heating oil.\nBeef prices jumped 4% in February, the most in more than 10 years, as recent droughts have pushed up cattle feed prices.\nThe slowdown in the annual inflation rate occurred partly because energy prices spiked in February 2013, and that figure has now fallen out of the year-over-year calculation.']"

Gear up for the #ModernWarfare Multiplayer Gameplay Premiere on August 1st. pic.twitter.com/vJIMbPZRyE — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) July 22, 2019\n\nA blog post from Activision says Assault Rifles typically have nine areas to change: Muzzle, Lasers, Optic, Stock, Rear Grip, Magazine, Underbarrel, Barrel, or a Perk. That’s a lot of customization, but it appears to go even deeper than that. A few of the variants in the short video could be considered SMGs in-game.\n\nFirst, here’s a variant that keeps the M4 in its Assault Rifle style.\n\nAn M4 Assault Rifle variant.\n\nNow let’s look at a couple of smaller variants.\n\nM4 in a smaller variant.\n\nAnother smaller variant of the M4.\n\nYou can see the M4 is much shorter and looks to be missing its stock. These M4s are often called M4 Pistols/AR Pistols. You can check out a civilian model here.\n\nNow, maybe the new variants are for show – but a YouTube video from TheGamingRevolution earlier this month with a leaked weapons list suggests there’s an attachment/perk that takes an Assault Rifle and allows you to use it as an SMG. That lines up with the smaller variants we see in the Twitter video today.\n\nTheGamingRevolution also says the flip side works as well, at least in the case of the AUG. Its base variant is an SMG, but it can be turned into an AR.\n\nThe AR-to-SMG is still speculation, but today’s video along with the earlier leak is pointing towards it being true. We’ll know for sure next week when Infinity Ward does its big multiplayer reveal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.', 'Weapon customization isn’t new, but we don’t often see it as in-depth as the Gunsmith in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare appears to be.\nA short Twitter video shows a montage of changes to an M4 including different barrels, stocks, grips, sights, magazines, and more.\nAn M4 Assault Rifle variant.\nThat lines up with the smaller variants we see in the Twitter video today.\nWe’ll know for sure next week when Infinity Ward does its big multiplayer reveal for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.']"

15852,http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-south-africa/a-eulogy-for-bitcoin,business,"['Bitcoin has not yet closed up shop, but I’m going out on a limb and writing its eulogy anyway. Why now you ask? Because Bitcoin has lost perhaps the most important element of what a credible currency requires – trust.\n\nCurrencies are used for several reasons and perhaps their most import function is as a medium of exchange to trade goods and services. But where Bitcoin fails most is in another of its core functions – its ability to be used as a store of value. Investors need a currency to be a safe and secure means to store and protect the value of their wealth. What investors really need with a currency is price stability – the inverse of volatility. They want its value to remain reasonably constant and perhaps this is where Bitcoin fails the most. Its incredible volatility makes it scare off any sensible investor who understands the simple logic that the price of a Bitcoin can go down just as easily as it goes up.\n\nPerhaps the greatest irony of Bitcoin is that its momentous rise in value may well have caused its very downfall. It rose too much, too quickly. Speculators joined the fun and pushed it to crazy levels. Its rise in value caused volatility, which made Bitcoin vulnerable to significant downside risk.\n\nBitcoin price over the last year\n\nSource: bitcoin charts, www.bitcoincharts.com\n\nBitcoin is the ultimate example of investors suffering from “greater fool theory”. The theory goes that the price of a tradable asset goes up based on irrational expectations of market participants, and not based on its intrinsic value. The only way “fools” buy such an asset is because they expect to resell it at a higher value to a “greater fool”. This bubble continues to inflate until such time as the market runs out of fools. When there are no more fools around to buy the asset, the price implodes in spectacular fashion.\n\nThis is not the first such instrument to have been bought in such a speculative manner. The tulip bulb mania and IT dot com bubble are two of the more well known ones, but the history of financial markets is full of speculative bubbles where participants drove the price of assets to exorbitant levels. So the Bitcoin phenomenon is not the first and certainly won’t be the last.\n\nIn certain respects, Bitcoin is really just 21st century gold. But instead of miners working in physical mines, computer hackers work with computers to “mine” for Bitcoins. And the similarities don’t stop there – the greatest advocates of Bitcoins are the very same people who complain about the US dollar and the American economy. Buy Bitcoins because “the US dollar is worthless and doomed to failure” they say. It’s a rather strange irony that these people trust an unknown founder with an unknown history more than they do the world’s most powerful nation with a concrete central bank overseeing its money supply.\n\nAnd while the purist ideal of an internet-based monetary instrument – not backed by the many developed market and over-indebted nations of the world – is a rather sweet and novel concept, the main reason why I am convinced that it is doomed to failure is because there is no confidence or surety with Bitcoin. For all its weaknesses, the US dollar is backed by the world’s strongest economy and the largest central bank in the world. America is a working, growing economy that produces a quarter of the world’s GDP. It is trustworthy.\n\nThe same cannot be said about Bitcoin. From the sudden closure of the Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, to the evaporation of millions of dollars of Bitcoins, to the attempts to hack its systems and then the recent news of the obscurity of its founder, the trust in Bitcoin has all but dissipated. There is no stability in its price. There is no company or country backing its value. It’s really just a rather speculative bubble that will most likely eventually pop, if it has not already done so.\n\nRoy Topol is an Investment Manager at Investec Wealth & Investment.

Legislation lagging in Japan. — Reuters file pic\n\nTOKYO, March 18 — Japan’s government says it has yet to decide whether to regulate Bitcoin, while highlighting that banks must report any suspicions of money laundering stemming from trades of the digital currency.\n\nThe government is still collecting information on Bitcoin, it said today in a written response to questions asked by opposition lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo. Banks had a duty to notify authorities if they suspected that customers had been involved in crime or drug dealing, it said.\n\nThe bankruptcy last month of Mt. Gox Co., an online Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, brought the issue of regulating the virtual currency into focus in Japan. Bitcoin has attracted attention from authorities around the world who are concerned that the anonymity of transactions may attract money launderers.\n\nOkubo’s questions centred on the responsibilities of Japanese banks used by Bitcoin exchanges to settle transactions with clients. While Bitcoin is not considered a currency in Japan, it could be subject to taxation, as with goods and services, the government said on March 7 in response to earlier questions from Okubo, who is a member of the Democratic Party of Japan.\n\nMt. Gox was a customer of Mizuho Bank Ltd., a unit of Japan’s third-biggest bank by market value. Tokyo-based Mizuho repeatedly asked Mt. Gox to close its accounts in the months before the exchange’s collapse because it was concerned about an unmanageable volume of money transfers, The Wall Street Journal reported this month.\n\nBanks in Japan were required to check the identity of people who wanted to send more than ¥100,000 (RM3,230) of cash, along with the purpose of transfers, and keep records of the transactions, the government said in today’s statement.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said last week that it planned to regulate virtual-currency intermediaries including operators of Bitcoin exchanges and vending machines to deal with risks of potential money laundering and terrorist financing. — Bloomberg', 'The government is still collecting information on Bitcoin, it said today in a written response to questions asked by opposition lawmaker Tsutomu Okubo.\nGox Co., an online Bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo, brought the issue of regulating the virtual currency into focus in Japan.\nBitcoin has attracted attention from authorities around the world who are concerned that the anonymity of transactions may attract money launderers.\nOkubo’s questions centred on the responsibilities of Japanese banks used by Bitcoin exchanges to settle transactions with clients.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said last week that it planned to regulate virtual-currency intermediaries including operators of Bitcoin exchanges and vending machines to deal with risks of potential money laundering and terrorist financing.']"

15883,http://www.business2community.com/mobile-apps/cash-king-mobile-money-future-business-0813721,business,"['Has the age of the cash register come to an end? Consumers increasingly report they would prefer to pay for goods and services via a credit/debit card or digital bank account, and a recent Javelin study found that cash is no longer is the dominant exchange in point-of-sale systems (it was surpassed by debit and credit cards). There’s another simple way to think about this: When was the last time you carried cash in your wallet? I know I don’t. How can a company adapt to this change?\n\nDigital Currency\n\nFew topics in the world have garnered as much attention as digital currency (also known as cryptocurrency). The biggest name in this arena is BitCoin, a fully digitized currency that conforms to the laws of supply and demand just like international dollars, pounds, euros and yen. The Wall Street Journal notes that it’s possible to use bitcoin to purchase everything from a pizza delivery to a vacation trip to space. A business that accepts bitcoins can turn around and sell them for USD as soon as they receive them for payment. All that is necessary is to set up a digital checkout that takes this e-currency.\n\nBe care with BitCoin. I’m not sure how the success or failure of these digital currencies are going to play out. Usually there are a few very informed parties (people) that make a lot of money at the beginning, while the rest of us are left wondering about the legitimacy of a new currency. If you want to use a digital currency like BitCoin, make sure you know the in’s and out’s and do your research! That being said, there is still a chance for lucrative outcomes by choosing to participate in new digital currencies, especially if your target market is using them. Start with some market research and if your customers are asking for the ability to pay in BitCoins. give it to them, just make sure you turn it into real cash asap.\n\nPoint of Sale\n\nWhen you no longer need a cash register in order to handle sales, do you still need a cashier? More importantly, do you still need a store? This is the big question that brick-and-mortar businesses need to ask themselves. With the change of pace in consumer purchasing, it’s possible to make your sales processes capable of remote transactions. Services like Intuit even show business owners how they can set up a POS solution on a mobile device, so it’s possible to make a sale away from your office or storefront. With no reason to limit your sales to your four walls, why limit the rest of your business to physical boundaries?\n\nRecommended For You\n\nRegister Now\n\nLet’s be real.\n\nIf you have a physical office location because you believe it adds legitimacy to your business, you’re wrong. Save that monthly rent and put it towards a new website redesign because your digital real estate is the only thing that matters these days. There are tools like Free Conference Call, Google + For free video chatting, and Regus if you really need a place to have a meeting.\n\nPaying It Forward\n\nWith the rapid decline of cash in favor of credit cards, it’s fair to ask how much longer credit cards will be around before they, too, turn into dinosaurs. Tech providers suggest it may be sooner than we think. Nokia and BlackBerry have incorporated near-field communications technology (used to capture credit card data) into their smartphones since 2011. With NFC settings on a mobile or tablet (and Apple’s newest generation of iPads), it’s possible to turn a mobile device into a credit card that you can scan at everything from a Starbucks to a Honda dealership to make a payment.\n\nThere’s a downside to mobile integration, however: security. Lookout Labs reports that $30 billion worth of cell phones are stolen, lost, or destroyed per year in the United States alone. Losing $20 in cash represents a one-time hit to your budget; losing your credit card-enabled phone can mean far more.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nConsumers no longer want to deal with cash and change. Many more do not even want to pull a card out of their wallets, preferring to integrate their transactions and their favorite devices. Companies who are not only capable of handling mobile processing, but those who can turn it into a trustworthy transaction, will be better situated to net more sales and higher yields.', 'There’s another simple way to think about this: When was the last time you carried cash in your wallet?\nDigital CurrencyFew topics in the world have garnered as much attention as digital currency (also known as cryptocurrency).\nIf you want to use a digital currency like BitCoin, make sure you know the in’s and out’s and do your research!\nPoint of SaleWhen you no longer need a cash register in order to handle sales, do you still need a cashier?\nLosing $20 in cash represents a one-time hit to your budget; losing your credit card-enabled phone can mean far more.']"

Instead, it noted that bitcoin will likely become an innovative payments technology.\n\nOne particular claim has generated buzz: bitcoin could save consumers, retail merchants and users of money transfer services approximately $200 billion in the global economy. The figure was hypothetically calculated by the institution. This is an immense sum of money and one that could damage conventional payment service providers, such as PayPal, Visa and MasterCard.\n\nThe biggest hurdles that bitcoin face are remaining alive and maintaining its innovative status, according to Goldman Sachs. The company says more government, greater regulation, increased operating costs and heightened competition are quite inevitable.\n\n“While it is too early to tell how banks and payment processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a digital currency strategy,” wrote Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering information-technology services, in the report.\n\nAlthough the bitcoin leaders have initiated lobbying efforts in Washington over the past few months, it is still pittance compared to what the credit card and technology industries spend to encourage lawmakers to veer their way on certain pieces of legislation.\n\nCould the $200 billion in savings spell doom for bitcoin? It’s certainly difficult to conclude if the digital currency can defeat efforts to eliminate bitcoin from the economic sphere. Companies like Visa and PayPal have a lot of pull and influence and though it’s unlikely that there will be an outright ban at first, these private enterprises could establish small blockades one step at a time.\n\n“Today the future of the bitcoin is unclear due to the pressure coming from various governments,” said Vladimir Ulyanov, the head of the analytical center of the Zecurion Company. “If in the past the interest towards the bitcoin was growing by the day, today when governments take steps against this system, the prospects of its development and proliferation are a lot weaker.”\n\nOpponents who have been wary of the virtual currency since the beginning have often warned about these very concerns, especially over the past year. Since bitcoin threatens the establishment then the arms of government could very well protect their contributors.\n\nIt has become apparent that financial institutions are afraid of bitcoin or any other alternative currency. We reported last month that the Bank of Montreal began shutting down business accounts that were associated with bitcoins. Of course, central banks and other financial entities have issued reports highlighting the risks, volatility and security vulnerabilities of bitcoins as well as spelling out its demise.\n\nWarren Buffett, a friend of big government and the status quo, recently came out (a few times) against bitcoin.

Or, more likely, it\'s already there.\n\nThe five-year-old digital currency is increasingly being adopted by brick-and mortar businesses, including dentists, pet boutiques -- even a small honey business in Utah.\n\nIn 2012, about 1,000 businesses used BitPay, the largest processor of Bitcoin payments. Today, more than 26,000 businesses worldwide use BitPay, said Tony Gallippi, its cofounder and CEO.\n\nThe majority of those firms are small businesses -- about half are in the U.S. and the rest are international. And while a majority are online sellers, Gallippi said 20% are merchants with storefronts.\n\nMost prominent in tech hubs like San Francisco, New York and Atlanta, the shops range from bakeries and wine stores to car dealers and mattress sellers.\n\nBitPay estimates that there are currently about 5 million active digital wallets, or Bitcoin accounts, worldwide. But the currency has had its fair share of negative headlines lately for the volatile price, underground drug market busts, high-profile hacks and calls for regulation.\n\n""There\'s no government agency that\'s backing Bitcoin,"" said Jeffery Born, a finance professor at Northeastern University.\n\nRelated: What is Bitcoin\n\nBut these risks aren\'t deterring small businesses from embracing the virtual currency.\n\nCraig Huntzinger started Bees Brothers in 2008 as a booth at a farmer\'s market in Cache Valley, Utah. Over the years, he added a line of honey-flavored caramels and launched an online store. In January 2012, Huntzinger started accepting Bitcoin for online purchases, which he promoted on a Bitcoin forum.\n\n""Initially I was fascinated by this idea of decentralized money and wanted to support it,"" said Huntzinger. Then he started to appreciate some of its other benefits.\n\n""It\'s fast and it makes it easy to sell to anybody in the world,"" he said.\n\nIt also cuts down on processing fees. Credit cards usually charge 2% to 3% in fees; BitPay and similar processors charge between 0% and 1%.\n\nToday, about 50% of Bees Brothers transactions -- both wholesale and retail -- are done with Bitcoins. Initially, they came largely from Seattle, New York, L.A. and San Francisco. Now, he said the orders are all over the world.\n\nRelated: Alleged Bitcoin creator denies he\'s the one\n\nNashville\'s My Second Home, a high-end pet boarding and grooming business, began accepting Bitcoin in January. Chris Starko, its marketing director, said they felt it would give the business a competitive edge.\n\n""We want to be seen as a progressive company versus our competitors,"" he said. ""The [Bitcoin payment] process takes only a minute, allowing our customers to quickly pick up their pets and make their way home.""\n\nIf it takes off, he said it could account for up to 20% of future payments.

""It\'s a way to attract new customers.""\n\nIt\'s why Dr. Max Kerr, a dentist, started accepting Bitcoin three months ago at his practice outside Austin. Kerr believes it\'s a novel way to ""put the business on the map,"" especially with Austin\'s young, tech-savvy population.\n\nHis uses BitPay to process Bitcoin transactions, which offers three options. Users can have Bitcoin payments converted into cash and deposited into their bank account, they can keep the funds as Bitcoins, or they can or opt for a combination of the two.\n\nIf merchants want to keep payments in Bitcoin, which Gallippi said less than 10% do, they need to open a digital wallet through a Bitcoin exchange.\n\nMore than half of BitPay\'s merchants convert the Bitcoins immediately into cash. That\'s what Kerr opts for, since it\'s a way for him to mitigate the risk.\n\n""In 15 seconds, I\'ll get an email confirming the deposit,"" he said.

The state website also lists local enrollment counselors and insurance agents who offer help at no cost.\n\nAfter March 31, you won’t be able to sign up for a private plan until the next open enrollment period scheduled for November. Lower-income people can still qualify year-round for Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program.\n\nThere’s also special enrollment for people who lose their job, get a divorce or have some other major event in their life.\n\nI heard Obamacare deadlines keep changing. Will this one be extended?\n\nPresident Obama recently said the deadline won’t be pushed back. However, it’s likely that if you start signing up on March 31 and run into technical difficulties, you may get a few extra days to finish your application. But that grace period only applies if you started in time.\n\nWhen does my coverage start?\n\nIf you pick a health plan before March 31, your coverage should start May 1.\n\nCheck with your insurance company on when your first month’s premium is due.

15913,http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/18/survey-one-third-of-uninsured-plan-to-stay-that-way/,business,"['The problem all along with treating the entire bloc of Americans without health insurance as a monolith is what brought us ObamaCare in the first place. The massive reorganization of the health-care sector presumed that 40 million (or 48 million, or 37 million) people lacked insurance all for the same reason — obstacles such as pre-existing conditions or economic hardship. A great many of those were either transitionally uninsured or uninsured by choice. Not surprisingly, a new survey shows that a significant number still don’t want to pay for health insurance, mandates notwithstanding:\n\nA new report finds that one in three Americans who do not have health insurance plan to remain uninsured. According to the survey done by Bankrate.com, of the 34 percent who say they won’t purchase Obamacare, 41 percent said it was too expensive, 17 percent were against the Affordable Care Act and 13 percent said they were healthy enough not to need coverage. “It’s hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it’s a case of, ‘I’m in pretty good health, I don’t think about these things, I know I can’t afford it now,’” Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health, told Bankrate.com. “I think it’s just rolling past them, and they’re not giving it a whole lot of attention.” Only 56 percent polled said they plan to purchase health insurance.\n\nThe article then quotes a researcher who thinks that the problem is that the White House didn’t emphasize the penalties hard enough. Well, it’s difficult to emphasize penalties when those keep getting delayed, especially by the same White House that would need to do the emphasizing. The penalty for the individual mandate is all but gone for tax years 2014 and 2015, thanks to the latest unilateral change coming from the Obama administration. Penalties that don’t penalize aren’t really all that motivating.\n\nBesides, the survey itself makes it pretty clear that the refuseniks in this case aren’t making that decision out of sloth. More than 40% of them think ObamaCare is too expensive, and another 13% don’t see the need for comprehensive insurance, which is a majority who see the mandate as so cost-ineffective that it’s worth it to pay the penalty instead. Those are rational decisions, which a significant portion of the uninsured population made prior to ObamaCare, too.\n\nHow rational? Paul Bedard reports that an eHealthInsurance survey shows it to be a wise calculation (via Power Line):\n\nAccording to a cost report from eHealthInsurance, a nationwide online private insurance exchange, families are paying an average of $663 a month and singles $274 a month, far more than before Obamacare kicked in. What’s more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called “bronze” plans. The firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system. In California, for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York, $1,845. … — Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.\n\n— The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.\n\nThis follows on sharp premium increases since the 2010 passage of ObamaCare, too, after the taxes and mandates for coverage began to kick in for insurers. Families are now spending almost $8,000 for an average policy, and that’s before the deductibles. They will have to spend thousands of dollars more before their benefits actually take effect. The same is true for individuals; at the above average, it’s about $3300 for premiums and thousands more in deductibles. So much for “bending the cost curve downward.”\n\nLet’s remember that this market disruption was ostensibly created to entice all of these uninsured into the system. What rational reason do these costs give them to comply? It’s better to pay the fine and deal with routine care with out-of-pocket payments, then get insured late if a catastrophic event takes place.\n\nMaybe, when we finally scrap this system, we’ll design one that offers real cost savings through open competition and reduced government rationing. In the meantime, no one can blame people for making rational choices, except of course this White House.', 'The problem all along with treating the entire bloc of Americans without health insurance as a monolith is what brought us ObamaCare in the first place.\nA great many of those were either transitionally uninsured or uninsured by choice.\nNot surprisingly, a new survey shows that a significant number still don’t want to pay for health insurance, mandates notwithstanding:A new report finds that one in three Americans who do not have health insurance plan to remain uninsured.\n“I think it’s just rolling past them, and they’re not giving it a whole lot of attention.” Only 56 percent polled said they plan to purchase health insurance.\nThose are rational decisions, which a significant portion of the uninsured population made prior to ObamaCare, too.']"

But with sign-ups among 18- to 34-year-olds lagging behind expectations nationally, pro-reform groups are targeting Texas — with its large, youthful population — in an effort to up their numbers.\n\nIn February, for the second consecutive month, young adults made up 27 percent of those who had successfully purchased coverage through the online insurance marketplace in Texas, compared to 25 percent of those who enrolled nationally, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has said that young adults — who are generally healthy and have fewer medical costs — should make up 40 percent of those insured through the marketplace to offset the costs of older, higher-risk patients and keep premiums down.\n\n“The next couple of weeks are going to be instrumental,” said Sara Smith, program director for the pro-ACA Texas Public Interest Research Group, which advocates on consumer issues. “We have two weeks to inform the state’s most uninformed health care consumers.”\n\nJohn Davidson, senior health care policy analyst for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that will be a futile battle, given that costs for young people under Obamacare aren\'t minimal.\n\n“The ACA was sold as something that would make health care cheaper. A lot of people are going on the exchange expecting their plans to be free or very inexpensive, and that’s just not the case,” he said. “...Young, healthy people aren’t going to want to pay rates like this, especially if they don’t have to go to the doctor.""\n\nBefore the implementation of the ACA, insurance companies often charged a five-to-one ratio or higher for monthly premiums based on a consumer\'s age, according to America’s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry. The new law limits this ratio to three to one. In order to make this system work, the Obama administration has said that young adults need to enroll at high enough rates to yield a surplus in premium revenue — which insurance companies can then allocate to help cover the expected deficit created by lower premiums for older patients.\n\nThe Texas Public Interest Research Group started its campaign, Health Insurance 101, to give young adults information on their health care enrollment options. They have canvassed on Texas college campuses, hired student interns at several schools and pushed university officials and student body leaders to send out the group\'s information guide and email reminders about ACA deadlines.\n\nSmith said the group is also focusing on future users of the marketplace: “Maybe they are a 24-year-old senior on their parents’ plan. They aren’t always going to be that way,” she said.\n\nAnother national pro-ACA group, Young Invincibles, was a presence at the recent South By Southwest festival in Austin, and has established enrollment stations at bars in the state\'s urban areas. The group also created an app called Healthy Young America that can be used to calculate premiums and find health care services.\n\n“We rarely have young people tell us they don’t want to sign up,"" said José Sánchez, the group\'s southern regional organizing director. ""It’s usually that they didn’t know about the deadline or subsidies.""\n\nSupporters of health reform are hopeful there will be a surge in sign-ups among young adults in the final days of the open enrollment period. “I’m confident that these numbers will spike before the deadline,” said Stacey Pogue, a senior health care policy analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities.\n\nIf they don\'t, the ACA has protective measures built in to avoid major increases in premiums for the first two years. A study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation concluded that if rates among young people stay at around 25 percent, it will not be catastrophic for the system — but insurance companies would likely increase premiums to protect their profits.\n\nDavidson, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said he believed cost was the top impediment for young people seeking health coverage. For example, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator, a single 25-year-old making $20,000 per year and living at 174 percent of the federal poverty line would need to pay $1,021 each year for coverage — and that\'s after the government subsidy.\n\nIf young people were suddenly going to start enrolling in large numbers, Davidson said, ""we would have seen it by now.”\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan health policy research and communication organization not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.', '“The next couple of weeks are going to be instrumental,” said Sara Smith, program director for the pro-ACA Texas Public Interest Research Group, which advocates on consumer issues.\n“The ACA was sold as something that would make health care cheaper.\nThe Texas Public Interest Research Group started its campaign, Health Insurance 101, to give young adults information on their health care enrollment options.\nSupporters of health reform are hopeful there will be a surge in sign-ups among young adults in the final days of the open enrollment period.\nDavidson, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said he believed cost was the top impediment for young people seeking health coverage.']"

But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees in a report this month.\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n“Five million is only a good number if it’s mostly people who didn’t have insurance before,” said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law’s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration will not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods.

McClatchy-Tribune Information Services\n\nMarch 18 --The state insurance exchange established as part of the Affordable Care Act opened New York's insurance market for individuals to more competition, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported Monday.\n\nThe foundation found that the individual insurance market had more companies offering coverage in 2014, after the NY State of Health exchange was put in place, compared with 2012, before the exchange was introduced as part of federal health care reform efforts.\n\nFor example, in 2012, the top two insurers, Wellpoint (including Empire BlueCross BlueShield) and UnitedHealth , served 48 percent of New York's individual market. In 2014, preliminary exchange enrollment figures show that the top insurers, Wellpoint and a new company, Freelancers (including Health Republic Insurance ), accounted for only 34 percent of the market.\n\nOr, by another measure, in 2012, five insurers had 5 percent or more of the individual market, while in 2014 seven insurers had at least that much of the market.\n\nThe foundation points out that the individual insurance market historically hasn't been competitive. In 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was passed, a single insurer had more than half the individual insurance market in 30 states.\n\nNew York was one of seven states whose individual insurance markets were studied by the foundation, and New York's were found to be the most competitive under the exchange.\n\nThe findings in the Kaiser Family Foundation report mirror the insurer exchange enrollment data released in January by the state Health Department .\n\nAnd the foundation report also confirms The Buffalo News article from December that talked to experts who predicted the exchange would open up the local insurance market to competition from new insurers.\n\nCompanies that didn't previously offer insurance in Western New York , or weren't active in the individual or group markets here, include Health Republic Insurance and Fidelis Care .\n\nThe foundation report looks at statewide numbers and does not break down the New York individual insurance market by region.

With 14 days left in the open enrollment period, it appears that the final numbers will come close to or even reach the initial Congressional Budget Office estimates of 7 million people signing up in the first year. While the CBO has since amended that number down to 6 million, don’t be surprised if this final push gets it well above that.\n\nBelow is the press release from the website of the HHS:\n\nAs this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Fernando Valdez and Denise Schroeder were part of a weekend wave of consumers signing up for new coverage and bringing enrollment nationwide to more than 5 million through the Federal and State-based Marketplaces since October 1st. Fernando Valdez, 25, of El Paso, Texas woke up early on Saturday, after his mother insisted that he walk to an enrollment center and enroll in Marketplace coverage. Now, he will pay $22 a month for his health insurance. Fernando said that he walked away knowing that if “I get into an accident I will not be in trouble with trying to find health care.” Read more about Fernando’s story at: http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_25353816/enroll-el-paso-makes-push-get-residents-enrolled?IADID=Search-www.elpasotimes.com-www.elpasotimes.com. And Denise Schroeder says she now feels like “I have a whole new life” after enrolling in coverage in recent days. Denise, a small business owner in West Chester, Pennsylvania who runs “Happy Heart Clown N’Stuff” which does balloon decorating and entertainment for parties is also a cancer survivor. Because she had cancer, Denise knew she couldn’t let her health coverage lapse, but the $880 premium she was paying each month wiped out her savings account, and she said it was killing her. But after working with an enrollment navigator, she enrolled on Thursday in a Silver Plan for $22 a month. When she saw the new premium, she cried. You can find more stories like theirs at http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/mystory/index.html. Consumers like Fernando and Denise are coming every day to check out their options for affordable health care at HealthCare.gov or seeking help from a trained representative in person or via our 24/7 call center. The last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone -the busiest day since December 23—and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend. Last week, HealthCare.gov saw more than 4 million visits—and an additional 1 million visits this weekend. With only two weeks to go, we’re continuing to work hard to ensure that every American who wants to enroll in affordable coverage by the deadline of March 31st is able to do so. So don’t delay; tell your friends and family to sign up today.\n\nThree weeks ago, ACA enrollment passed 4 million. Since then, we’ve seen another million sign up. No matter how much Republicans try to deny it, the ACA is going to be a rousing success in in its first year. Conservative pundits had a field day laughing at the ‘paltry’ enrollment numbers in October, apparently unaware that fewer people sign up at the beginning of an enrollment period than at the end. The message a few months ago was how there was NO WAY that millions of people would sign up for Obamacare. Conservatives kept bringing up that 7 million figure from the CBO and pointing out how much lower the final enrollment figure would be.\n\nFor months, the narrative, repeated over and over by the mainstream media, was about the ‘botched’ rollout of the ACA and the ‘disastrous’ Healthcare.gov website. While news anchors and pundits were repeating the same talking points day in and day out, whatever glitches that were hounding the website were found and fixed, and people in need of affordable health care continued to sign up.\n\nNow here we are, two weeks away from the final deadline of this enrollment period, and we now see 5 million people have signed up. 5 million people have obtained quality healthcare because of this law. All despite the numerous roadblocks thrown up by Republican lawmakers trying their hardest to make the law fail before it even had a chance to be enacted. How many more would have had a chance to sign up already if the majority of states would have set up their own healthcare exchanges? If Red state governors would have allowed Medicaid expansion to take place, as provided for by the ACA, how many more people would have health coverage right now?\n\nThat’s the thing. Even with the petulant obstruction, 5 million people have signed up for healthcare under the ACA, and in the years to come, tens of millions more will. It is the law of the land. It is here to stay.', 'The Department of Health and Human Services broke the news on Monday that 5 million people have now signed up for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nBelow is the press release from the website of the HHS:As this historic open enrollment period enters its final weeks, millions of Americans are finding quality, affordable coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\nSince then, we’ve seen another million sign up.\nConservatives kept bringing up that 7 million figure from the CBO and pointing out how much lower the final enrollment figure would be.\nNow here we are, two weeks away from the final deadline of this enrollment period, and we now see 5 million people have signed up.']"

Even more surprising to the media was that Obamacare turned out to be the winning issue for Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic congressional candidate outspent the Republican by a million dollars, and it was a district that President Barack Obama carried in 2012. But the Democratic candidate\'s message about Obamacare, ""fix, don\'t repeal"" and ""mend, don\'t amend,"" was a loser because the American people want Obamacare repealed.\n\nThe Democrats had thought Obama\'s favorite legislation would be a political advantage by now. It would have given health insurance to millions of voters who never had it before, others would enjoy subsidies and free contraceptives, and all had confidence in Obama\'s promise, ""If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor"" (and your health insurance plan and your hospital).\n\nIt must have been a rude awakening for many liberals to realize that it was all a lie, and you really can\'t keep your doctor or your insurance plan. Liberals now have to face the fact that not only Obama made a false promise, but that he and his staff knew it was a lie when they wrote it on his teleprompter.\n\nMillions of Americans have had their health insurance canceled. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that Obamacare will cause more than 2 million Americans to lose their jobs.\n\nNancy Pelosi told members of Congress they had to pass Obamacare so we can all find out what\'s in it. We are finding out more and more things we don\'t like about it every day.\n\nObama\'s game plan to dodge the Obamacare bullet is to announce an exemption or a waiver or a deadline change almost every week. The purpose seems to be to postpone as many obnoxious deadlines as possible so that they do not take effect until after this year\'s November election.\n\nThe scholar Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute reports that the administration has made 37 significant changes to Obamacare, of which at least 20 were made unilaterally by Obama with his famous ""pen.""\n\nOnly 15 were made legally by Congress.\n\nObamacare is a disaster any way you look at it. It violates the Constitution by forcing individual Americans to buy things we don\'t need or want, and to pay for other people to buy products we don\'t approve of.\n\nSo what do we have to show for the high cost of Obamacare? Lost jobs, full-time jobs cut to part-time jobs, canceled health insurance policies, higher premiums for health insurance, a website that doesn\'t work (so people don\'t know if they are signed up or not), and navigators, who couldn\'t pass a background check, to help us navigate the website.\n\nObamacare was designed to conceal its extraordinary cost by depending on healthy young people signing up to compensate the insurance companies for the high costs of unhealthy seniors. And we\'ve just discovered a previously unnoticed fine-print provision to require taxpayers to bail out the insurance companies if they lose money on that deal.\n\nThe Obama administration is trying to save face by claiming that Obamacare\'s only problems are with the website and implementation. In fact, the real problem is the socialist mindset that the government can take over a sixth of our economy and do it better and cheaper, and that\'s ridiculous because higher taxes, more inconvenience and lots of bailouts are what prevail.\n\nThe big government takeover of an entire industry is driving up health care costs, imposing new taxes, increasing our national debt, encouraging Obama to function like a dictator by unilaterally changing the law, and destroying our once-great health care system.\n\nThe administration claims that 4.2 million people have signed up, which is a lot fewer than the original 7 million goal. But the real joker is that many of these people haven\'t paid their first premium. Like shopping at the supermarket, they\'ve put some items in their cart, but they haven\'t yet paid at the checkout counter, so we don\'t know the real numbers.\n\nBut we do know that more people have lost health insurance than have been able to get new insurance. The Associated Press reported that at least 4.7 million Americans received notices that their current health insurance policies were canceled, and that\'s more than the 4.2 million who have signed up.\n\nMost of Obama\'s changes were to help 2014 Democratic candidates, who are running away from Obamacare faster than they are running for office. The solution for Americans is to elect a conservative Senate in November that will repeal Obamacare.\n\nPhyllis Schlafly is a lawyer, conservative political analyst and author of 20 books.

Alvarez/AP Luis M. Alvarez/AP\n\nEver since Republicans began using the words ""repeal and replace"" back in 2010 to describe their intentions for the Affordable Care Act, they\'ve faced a question: What, exactly, would they replace it with?\n\nWhile there\'s currently no clear Republican alternative for the health care law, President Obama\'s signature domestic achievement, the House Republican leadership is signaling there will be one this year.\n\nThe signal came in the form of an interview The Washington Post\'s Robert Costa had with House Majority Whip Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the third-highest-ranking official in the House GOP\'s leadership.\n\nThe goal: give voters a clear way to distinguish the Republican and Democratic approaches as part of the GOP plan to bludgeon Democrats with the controversial health care law at every opportunity this midterm election year.\n\nWhile there apparently isn\'t yet a detailed alternative to analyze, the concepts being considered as part of the proposed replacement are far from new. Indeed, they\'ve been part of Republican alternatives from conservative think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe final GOP package could include old standbys like health savings accounts, expanding state-run high-risk pools for the hardest-to-insure individuals, and the sale of insurance across state lines.\n\nOne immediate problem for Republicans is that these ideas don\'t exactly have buy-in from the insurance industry like, say, the individual mandate did, and without its backing, they would be hard to pull off.\n\nIndeed, the insurance industry might be expected to fiercely lobby with its ample war chest against some, if not all, the GOP proposals.\n\n""Every insurance industry executive I talk to thinks those proposals are silly,"" said Robert Laszewski, a health care industry expert, in an interview with It\'s All Politics. In a blog post, Laszewski explains industry officials\' objections to GOP proposals, such as selling insurance across state lines.\n\nAnother problem for the Republican proposals is that they could undermine two of the health care law\'s most popular features — the ban against insurance companies declining to insure people with pre-existing conditions (or charging prohibitive amounts to do so) and the ability of parents to keep their children, up to age 26, on their insurance plans.\n\n""Bingo,"" said Laszewski, when I raised this problem with him. When the ACA banned pre-existing conditions as a reason for not insuring someone, it obviated the need for the state-run high-risk pools, which is where people with pre-existing conditions formerly would turn.\n\nA return to such high-risk pools would by definition mean revisiting a time when insurance companies used pre-existing conditions to exclude certain people.\n\n""I can\'t imagine a Republican candidate wanting to go into a November election suggesting we go back on pre-existing conditions,"" Laszewski said.\n\nLaszewski, no fan of how the Affordable Care Act was fashioned, is also skeptical of the Republican approach from what he\'s seen so far.\n\n""I\'ve been critical of the Obama people because they built Obamacare and they never really consulted people in the industry when they did it. That\'s one of the big reasons they got the mess that they do,"" Laszewski said. ""And so here go the Republicans. Instead of doing something out of a left-wing think tank, the Republicans are doing it out of a right-wing think tank.""', 'While there\'s currently no clear Republican alternative for the health care law, President Obama\'s signature domestic achievement, the House Republican leadership is signaling there will be one this year.\n""Every insurance industry executive I talk to thinks those proposals are silly,"" said Robert Laszewski, a health care industry expert, in an interview with It\'s All Politics.\nWhen the ACA banned pre-existing conditions as a reason for not insuring someone, it obviated the need for the state-run high-risk pools, which is where people with pre-existing conditions formerly would turn.\nA return to such high-risk pools would by definition mean revisiting a time when insurance companies used pre-existing conditions to exclude certain people.\n""I can\'t imagine a Republican candidate wanting to go into a November election suggesting we go back on pre-existing conditions,"" Laszewski said.']"

But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group, but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co in a report this month put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n“Five million is only a good number if it’s mostly people who didn’t have insurance before,” said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMARCH 31 DEADLINE\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law’s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration would not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods.

Those numbers are part of the Obamacare enrollment figures.\n\n“California continues to lead the nation in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the numbers released today illustrate strong progress in the push to expand health care coverage as we head into the final weeks of open enrollment,” California Assocation of Health Plans’ Chief Executive Patrick Johnston said in a statement.', 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 5 million people have enrolled in private health insurance under the law known as Obamacare since open enrollment began on October 1, the Obama administration said on Monday.\nCathey Park of Cambridge, Massachusetts shows her cast signed by U.S. President Barack Obama after he spoke about health insurance at Faneuil Hall in Boston October 30, 2013.\nThe 5 million enrollee total marked an increase of at least 800,000 people since March 1, indicating that total enrollment could approach the 6 million figure estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office if enrollment surges in the final weeks as administration officials have predicted.\nWith huge volumes expected in the final days of the open enrollment period, analysts say 2014 enrollment may not reach its final total until sometime after March.\nSeparately, California’s state health insurance exchange said on Monday its enrollment passed the 1 million mark, with 1,018,315 people selecting a health plan through the exchange as of Saturday.']"

But there are benefits that have a greater impact specifically on the Latino community.\n\nLatinos are disproportionately uninsured in the American population. But now 80% of uninsured Latinos eligible for marketplace coverage will have access to lower-cost health options, such as tax credits for private insurance plans on healthcare.gov or BadgerCare here in Wisconsin.\n\nCitizens and documented immigrants may sign up at healthcare.gov. However, undocumented immigrants may not. But households of mixed status should not fear looking for coverage. Healthcare.gov cannot require individuals purchasing coverage for themselves to disclose the immigration/citizen status of anyone else in the household.\n\nThere will be new options to get health care as well. The Affordable Care Act expands funding to community health centers, such as the 16th Street Community Health Center here in Milwaukee, to serve new patients. And one out of every three patients at a community health center is Latino.\n\nLastly, Latino health care professionals will have new opportunities thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Expanded programs like the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) will provide more care and train more physicians. One out of ten NHSC physicians are Latino. That’s twice the rate than in the national physician workforce.

He writes from South Newfane.\n\n\n\nWhen the enrollment deadline for the Affordable Care Act rolls around, I will be one of the millions of Americans who hasn’t signed up. If it were entitled the Affordable Insurance Act it would at least bear an honest name. And as laudable as it may be to make health insurance more affordable, it has very little to do with health care.\n\nGet all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.\n\nThe health insurance industry sucks billions of “health care” dollars from Americans without providing a single service that is health restorative in any sense. If anything, insurance costs, hassles and inadequacies should only be seen as exacerbating factors in dealing with problems of bad health. These billions of dollars, if not being used to generate profits as well as administering parameters and limits to health care, could be available to pay for the care itself. Some of it could stay in our pockets.\n\nPeople claim that this arcane insurance gateway to health care system stems from our mistrust in government and our love for free enterprise. No matter that in one industrialized country after another, single payer health care systems are successfully taking care of peoples’ health at a much lower cost than we pay in America.\n\nOur history is a free-for-all of healers of all stripes advertising their cures. While medical practices have ranged wildly over the spectrum, they shared one common quality; whether a quack or a surgeon, medical practitioners have mostly operated for profit. As a result many a poor American has perished from not being able to afford medical treatment. Instead of stepping in as a polis and understanding that a healthy life for everyone is necessary for a nation to thrive, we allowed the free enterprise system to intrude instead, creating a for-profit labyrinth of bureaucracies that served a majority of the public (good enough for private contractor work) while leaving a large minority without adequate access to health care.\n\nIs there a risk to living without insurance? Of course there is. Even though the odds are in my favor (that’s where those insurance profits come from) and I’ve made it this far, an accident or sickness could leave me with an enormous bill to pay.\n\nEven if the subsidies in the ACA offered me a chance to enroll relatively cheaply, I wouldn’t do so any more than I would spend medium amounts of money on anything that I didn’t like or didn’t believe in.\n\nVTDigger is underwritten by:\n\nCall me old fashioned, but I’m also not willing to sally forth to Vermont Health Connect and give some website contractor all of the personal data that is required to determine eligibility for the ACA. When a government or industry spokesperson assures us the latest data breach probably won’t do any harm, it rings with the same false bravado that accompanies every declaration about “safe” radiation leaks that pose no threat to public health. I don’t bank or manage any of my affairs online. I rarely purchase anything online and I don’t share personal information, medical or otherwise, with anyone online. As I get by well enough without these Internet services, I’m less inclined to be sanguine about the possible cost of a hack attack or the loss of private data.\n\nIs there a risk to living without insurance? Of course there is. Even though the odds are in my favor (that’s where those insurance profits come from) and I’ve made it this far, an accident or sickness could leave me with an enormous bill to pay. At that point, I’d be making monthly payments just like I would for insurance, but it would be paying for a service (even if an over-priced one.)\n\nI am waiting instead for single payer health care to come to Vermont as planned by 2017. Some assert that IT problems with Vermont Health Connect are a harbinger of the disaster that single payer will surely be. But the current website and its problems should not bear have much bearing on Vermont’s eventual single payer system. We are already connected for single payer in that the state has already figured out how to reach us each year with a tax form. I’m happy to let the Legislature and the governor hash out what taxes will need to be raised to pay for providing health care in the state. And I’ll welcome the inevitable rise in taxes that I will face. Since I don’t pay for health insurance coverage, I will see an increase in taxes without a commensurate decrease in insurance premium rates.\n\nBut as much I am adamant in refusing to pay insurance premiums, I will have no problem in paying a hefty tax rise knowing that the money is paying for actual health care for all Vermonters. I have a debt to society in being part of it. I have no interest in being indebted to insurance corporations."", 'And as laudable as it may be to make health insurance more affordable, it has very little to do with health care.\nThe health insurance industry sucks billions of “health care” dollars from Americans without providing a single service that is health restorative in any sense.\nPeople claim that this arcane insurance gateway to health care system stems from our mistrust in government and our love for free enterprise.\nI am waiting instead for single payer health care to come to Vermont as planned by 2017.\nBut the current website and its problems should not bear have much bearing on Vermont’s eventual single payer system.']"

In particular, they predicted that some groups, including young people and Latinos, whose participation in the marketplaces so far has lagged behind others’, increasingly would sign up as the deadline approached. The administration did not release a demographic breakdown for the latest enrollments.\n\nThe state-based marketplaces enable Americans who do not get health-care coverage through work to select among plans that offer at least a basic set of benefits.

But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group, but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co in a report this month put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n“Five million is only a good number if it’s mostly people who didn’t have insurance before,” said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nMARCH 31 DEADLINE\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law’s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration would not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods.

Even more surprising to the media was that Obamacare turned out to be the winning issue for Republicans.\n\nThe Democratic congressional candidate outspent the Republican by a million dollars, and it was a district Barack Obama carried in 2012. But the Democratic candidate\'s message about Obamacare – ""fix, don\'t repeal"" and ""mend, don\'t amend"" – was a loser, because the American people want Obamacare repealed.\n\nThe Democrats thought that Obama\'s favorite legislation would be a political advantage by now. It would have given health insurance to millions of voters who never had it before, others would enjoy subsidies and free contraceptives, and all had confidence in Obama\'s promise that ""if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor"" (and your health insurance plan, and your hospital).\n\nIt must have been a rude awakening for many liberals to realize that it was all a lie, and you really can\'t keep your doctor or your insurance plan. Liberals now have to face the fact not only that Obama made a false promise, but that he and his staff knew it was a lie when they wrote those promises on his teleprompter.\n\nMillions of Americans have had their health insurance canceled. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that Obamacare will cause more than 2 million Americans to lose their jobs.\n\nTRENDING: Strzok outed Hillary\'s abuse of secret information!\n\nNancy Pelosi told members of Congress they had to pass Obamacare so we can all find out what\'s in it. We are finding out more things we don\'t like about it every day.\n\nObama\'s game plan to dodge the Obamacare bullet is to announce an exemption or a waiver or a deadline change almost every week. The purpose seems to be to postpone as many obnoxious deadlines as possible so that they do not take effect until after this year\'s November election.\n\nThe scholar Grace-Marie Turner of the Galen Institute reports that the administration has made 37 significant changes to Obamacare, at least 20 made unilaterally by Obama with his famous ""pen."" Only 15 were made legally by Congress.\n\nObamacare is a disaster any way you look at it. It violates the Constitution by forcing individual Americans to buy things we don\'t need or want and to pay for other people to buy products we don\'t approve of.\n\nSo what do we have to show for the high cost of Obamacare? Lost jobs, full-time jobs cut to part-time jobs, canceled health insurance policies, higher premiums for health insurance, a website that doesn\'t work so people don\'t know if they are signed up or not, and navigators to help us navigate the website who couldn\'t pass a background check.\n\nDon\'t miss Phyllis Schlafly\'s latest book, now available at the WND Superstore: ""No Higher Power: Obama\'s War on Religious Freedom""\n\nObamacare was designed to conceal its extraordinary cost by depending on healthy young people signing up to compensate the insurance companies for the high costs of unhealthy seniors. And we\'ve just discovered a previously unnoticed fine-print provision to require taxpayers to bail out the insurance companies if they lose money on that deal.\n\nThe Obama administration is trying to save face by claiming that Obamacare\'s only problems are with the website or implementation. In fact, the real problem is the socialist mindset that the government can take over a sixth of our economy and do it better and cheaper, and that\'s ridiculous because it ends up with higher taxes, more inconvenience and lots of bailouts.\n\nThe big-government takeover of an entire industry is driving up health care costs, imposing new taxes, increasing our national debt, encouraging Obama to function like a dictator by changing the law unilaterally and destroying our once-great health-care system.\n\nThe administration claims that 4.2 million people have signed up, which is a lot fewer than the original 7 million goal. But the real joker is that many of those haven\'t paid their first premium. Like shopping at the supermarket, they\'ve put some items in their cart, but they haven\'t yet paid at the checkout counter, so we don\'t know the real numbers.\n\nBut we do know that more people have lost health insurance than have been able to get new insurance. The Associated Press reported that at least 4.7 million Americans received notices that their current health insurance policies were canceled, and that\'s more than the 4.2 million who have signed up.\n\nMost of Obama\'s changes were to help Democratic 2014 candidates who are running away from Obamacare faster than they are running for office. The solution for Americans is to elect a conservative Senate in November that will repeal Obamacare.', 'But the Democratic candidate\'s message about Obamacare – ""fix, don\'t repeal"" and ""mend, don\'t amend"" – was a loser, because the American people want Obamacare repealed.\nAnd the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that Obamacare will cause more than 2 million Americans to lose their jobs.\nObamacare is a disaster any way you look at it.\nBut we do know that more people have lost health insurance than have been able to get new insurance.\nThe solution for Americans is to elect a conservative Senate in November that will repeal Obamacare.']"

15966,http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2014/03/17/march-madness-fake-obamacare-enrollment-numbers/,business,"['The administration is claiming a limited victory by saying the number of those enrolled in ObamaCare has now hit 5 million with two weeks to go until the March 31 deadline. If accurate, the number does represent a steep increase over the 4.2 million that were said to have signed up at the beginning of the month. At this rate, administration cheerleaders reason, the goal of 7 million enrolled in the Affordable Care Act may yet be reached at some point in the near future, if not quite on time. This burst of enrollments is seen as a vindication of President Obama’s all-out push to promote the law including such questionable activities as appearing on the “Between Two Ferns” web show where he traded barbs with comedian Zach Galifianakis.\n\nBut before the president and his team start popping the champagne corks to celebrate their achievement and their faux hipness, it’s time once again to point out that the administration’s Potemkin enrollment figures should be read with a truckload of salt. As the New York Times reported last month, as much as 20 percent of all those enrolled had not actually paid their premiums, meaning they were not covered by the program. While Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius told Congress she had no idea what the numbers of unpaid enrollees were, more states are reporting these figures and, as CNBC reported last week, the results are literally all over the map. While some states report high pay rates, others like Maryland say only 54 percent have paid.\n\nAll this calls in to question not only the effectiveness of the sales job done by the president and celebrity supporters such as Lebron James. It also means that the odds that this system can sustain itself without mandating vast increases in rates for those who do pay are getting slimmer every day.\n\nFor months we’ve been told by the administration that the only problem with ObamaCare was a “glitchy” website that had since been fixed. But what has since become clear is that the effort to convince young and healthy Americans to sign up for insurance that is both expensive and not something they may need is a failure. Though many of those who clearly benefit from the new health law, such as the poor and those with pre-existing conditions, have signed up, the scheme requires large numbers of those who won’t need the coverage as often in order to be economically viable. That problem will be exacerbated by the failure of much larger percentages of customers to pay for their insurance.\n\nAs we’ve noted previously, the non-payment of the premium is not a technicality. Many of those purchasing the insurance may be first-time buyers and not understand that they must pay their bill before coverage starts rather than long after the fact, as they can with a credit card transaction. Or it may be that some enrolled with no intention of paying or thinking that the hype about the glories of ObamaCare they’ve heard in the mainstream media and from the president absolved them of the obligation to pay for it. But either way, the large number of non-payments renders the enrollment figures meaningless and ensures that the rates for those who do pay are going up next year by percentages that will shock them.\n\nThe president claimed that the number of enrollees has already reached the point where the law will work rather than collapse from lack of participation. But even if we accept his premise that falling millions of customers short of the announced goal of seven million is no big deal, the fact that hundreds of thousands of those being counted in the pool of those he’s counting are not covered because of non-payment of premiums makes his assertion a colossal fraud.\n\nThe president may think that a March madness ad blitz during the NCAA basketball tournament may save ObamaCare. But if the past pattern holds, any further surge in enrollment will provide the scheme with a false sense of security. Until we get a full accounting not only of those who signed up on a website but completed the process by paying for the plan they chose, we’ll have no idea how many people truly are enrolled. Seen in that light, the president’s enrollment promises may well turn out to be no different from other pledges he has made about the ACA in the last few years: completely untrue.', 'The administration is claiming a limited victory by saying the number of those enrolled in ObamaCare has now hit 5 million with two weeks to go until the March 31 deadline.\nWhile some states report high pay rates, others like Maryland say only 54 percent have paid.\nFor months we’ve been told by the administration that the only problem with ObamaCare was a “glitchy” website that had since been fixed.\nThe president may think that a March madness ad blitz during the NCAA basketball tournament may save ObamaCare.\nBut if the past pattern holds, any further surge in enrollment will provide the scheme with a false sense of security.']"

But after the federal website stumbled in the early weeks, the administration discounted that target.\n\nStill, in the waning days, the sign-up rate is increasing. It took 20 days for the last 1 million to sign up. By contrast, there were fewer than 1 million sign-ups in all of February.\n\nUnder Obamacare’s individual mandate, Americans must have health insurance by the end of March or else they will have to pay a penalty in their 2014 taxes.\n\nLast week, however, Republicans said they’d discovered a loophole that will allow anyone who claims a “hardship” to refuse to sign up and still not have to face a penalty. The new hardship exemption was added to the forms in December, but went unnoticed by analysts until last week.\n\n“Frankly, I think the American people deserve some explanation as to what the White House really is doing,” House Speaker John A. Boehner told reporters last week.\n\nBut House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the 5 million people who have signed up for health plans are all evidence for why the GOP’s efforts to repeal the law are a bad idea.\n\n“Each new enrollee is a reminder of the real, human cost of each of the 51 Republican votes to repeal or undermine this legislation,” she said.\n\nMr. Obama’s allies are ramping up their efforts to try to boost the number of enrollees, as are administration officials.

The administration has updated the enrollment tally twice a month since millions of customers were required to pay their premiums, but officials have declined yet again to disclose payment information.\n\nMonday’s unscheduled update revealed that the administration can now count 5 million selected plans on Obamacare exchanges across the country — 1 million in California alone. It’s a desperately needed coup for the administration, which is two weeks away from the final enrollment deadline.\n\nBut like Tavenner’s other surprise enrollment updates, the blog post is devoid of details or statistics. Instead, it’s chock full of stories about those who were so happy to receive Obamacare that they cried.\n\nOfficial monthly enrollment announcements merit a conference call with media and a formal state breakdown from the Department of Health and Human Services. But detailed demographic information wasn’t released until mid-January — over halfway through the open enrollment period.\n\nThe late release emphasized the administration’s failure to enroll nearly enough of its key demographic, healthy people aged 18 to 35. Through February’s end, Obamacare exchange customers were only 25 percent “young invincibles” — leaving very little time to meet the administration’s prior minimum target of 39 percent.\n\nAs of January, customers that paid have been using their Obamacare insurance. But the Obama administration continues to say it doesn’t know how many have paid their premiums.\n\nThe best estimates come from consulting firms’ studies of data from insurance companies.

Most, 41 percent, cited cost as their reason, while 17 percent said they oppose Obamacare and 13 percent said they are healthy and don\'t need insurance.Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they do plan to purchase health coverage.""We did all this discombobulating for nothing, because the uninsured are not signing up,"" Fox News Channel\'s Neil Cavuto said on Monday.""It\'s hard to generalize, but for some of these folks, it\'s a case of, \'I\'m in pretty good health, I don\'t think about these things, I know I can\'t afford it now,\'"" Michael Morrisey, professor of health economics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health told Bankrate. ""I think it\'s just rolling past them, and they\'re not giving it a whole lot of attention.""The debate swirled even as the administration announced that more than 5 million had now enrolled in private health insurance under Obamacare since open enrollment began on Oct. 1.\n\nThe tally is an increase of at least 800,000 enrollees since March 1, with volume rising as the six-month enrollment period approaches its deadline on March 31.

Vote in Urgent National Poll\n\nIn the Bankrate survey, only 30 percent were aware of tax credits designed to offset costs, but those making less than $30,000 a year — who are more likely to benefit from them — were in the group most likely to know about the credits.It is mostly men who won\'t buy insurance over opposition to Obamacare. Twenty-two percent of men cited that as the reason as opposed to 8 percent of women.Most opponents of the Affordable Care Act are Republican, so it\'s not surprising that half of uninsured Republicans cited opposition to Obamacare as their reason to remain uninsured. Only 5 percent of those who identify as Democrats cited opposition to the ACA as their reason.And it is mostly the young who say they won\'t buy insurance because they are healthy. Thirty-one percent of respondents age 18-29 cited that reason. Only 6 percent of those 30-49 said they were healthy enough to remain uninsured.Deborah Chollet, a health insurance research leader at Mathematica Policy Research in Washington, D.C., told Bankrate that the multimedia advertising campaigns targeting the ""young invincibles"" may have missed another target group: low-income, young families.""They\'re probably not spending a lot of time watching television, they never read a newspaper, and if they listen to radio, it\'s probably music in the car,"" she said. ""In communities of color, people might hear about [Obamacare] in church, but for people who are not attached to a church, I don\'t know how they get the information.""Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University\'s Health Policy Institute, told Bankrate that the Obama administration may have focused too much on positive aspects of the law, such as tax subsidies, rather than the penalties imposed for not buying insurance.""They found in Massachusetts, with \'RomneyCare,\' that the individual mandate penalty absolutely motivated a lot of people to purchase insurance,"" Corlette said. ""The Obama administration understandably tried to emphasize the positive, but people need to understand that the mandate is not insignificant – they could be hit with a big tax bill if they don\'t buy coverage.""Also, only 48 percent of the uninsured were aware they have only until March 31 to sign up. After that, they have to wait for next year\'s open enrollment, which begins November 15. The only exceptions are life changes such as a divorce or lost job.Dr. Jane Hughes, an ophthalmologist, told Fox News that the Department of Health and Human Services and Medicare and Medicaid Services say they aren\'t keeping track of who had insurance and who didn\'t when they are signing up.""It\'s absolutely not been worth the hassle, and I know why we did all of this: This was a socio-political agenda to take over one-sixth of the private sector economy using my profession — medicine — to do it.""Six million have been bumped off insurance plans because of Obamacare. 4.2 million have signed up. ""If we had a big neon sign over Healthcare.gov it would be minus-1.8 million now enrolled.

But the data so far shows young adults accounting for only one-quarter of enrollees.\n\nAnother important section consists of people signing up for insurance for the first time, a group that also tends to be healthy. The administration says it has no data for that group but the consulting firm McKinsey & Co put the number at around 27 percent of the total enrollees in a report this month.\n\nToo few healthy beneficiaries could cause healthcare costs to rise as insurers grapple with higher insurance risks posed by policyholders who are sick or older.\n\n“Five million is only a good number if it’s mostly people who didn’t have insurance before,” said Joe Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is expected to extend health insurance to millions of uninsured Americans through the private marketplaces and an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.\n\nBut the 2010 law’s implementation has been dogged by delays, legal challenges and political attacks from Republicans and other critics.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress last week that the administration will not extend the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nBut the law allows people who have difficulty signing up for coverage to arrange for special enrollment periods.

Under the law’s individual mandate, Americans who don’t have health insurance by April 1 will be subject to a penalty of 1 percent of their annual income, unless they apply for a hardship exemption.\n\nPeople can qualify for the exemption if they are experiencing a financial hardship that could make it difficult to obtain health coverage. The administration announced an extension of the exemption through 2016 last week. Critics say it could make it easier for people to skirt around the new requirement, and it can also make people less likely to get coverage.\n\nRelated: Why There May Be a New Obamacare Delay\n\nThough they are still far from reaching their enrollment projections, administration officials are touting the numbers as a success, and say they are confident that sign ups will continue to surge ahead of the open enrollment deadline.\n\n""The last several days have been the busiest since December, with the Call Center taking more than 198,000 calls on Thursday alone -- the busiest day since December 23 -- and more than 130,000 calls over the weekend,” Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner said in a blog published Monday.\n\nRelated: 10 Top Questions Consumers Ask About Obamacare\n\nAnother important question the figures do not answer is how many of the new enrollees previously lacked health coverage.

What\'s more, to save money, most buyers are choosing the lowest level of coverage, the so-called ""bronze"" plans.\n\nThe firm provided the costs to Secrets through their new online price index, which gives the averages of what people are paying for insurance sold through their system. In California, for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York, $1,845.\n\nThe shocking surge in prices show what Americans not in Obamacare or covered by their employer are paying as they seek lower premiums. Typically, they are not eligible for the subsidies Obamacare offers those with low incomes.\n\n""Premiums are increasing primarily because of the new required provisions for 2014 Affordable Care Act compliant plans, including guaranteed issue, essential health benefits, modified community rating and minimum actuarial values,"" said Brian Mast, spokesman for eHealthInsurance. ""It is also likely that health insurance companies expected additional risk in the risk pool, because people with pre-existing conditions could no longer be denied coverage, and may have priced their plans higher to accommodate for this risk,"" said Mast.\n\nHis firm\'s price index also gives an average age for singles buying plans, and the results are worrying for insurers and the Obama administration. That\'s because the average age is 36, older than the administration had hoped for.\n\nExplaining the higher costs, Mast said, ""There are likely other factors, but what is important is that moving forward, there needs to be a collective effort to enroll as many people as possible and create a broad and diverse risk pool to keep premiums in check. eHealth can help in that effort by enrolling consumers off-exchange and is pushing to be able to enroll people in subsidy-eligible plans as well.""\n\nThere is a hint of good news, though, in firm\'s the price index. While the current costs for insurance are higher than before Obamacare, they have come down over the past several months.\n\nBelow is a cost summary provided by eHealthInsurance:\n\n— Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage. As of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.\n\n— The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.\n\n— For both individual and family applicants, bronze plans have been the most popular plan type chosen since the beginning of open enrollment.', 'In California, for example, some families are paying a high of $2,604 a month and in New York, $1,845.\nWhile the current costs for insurance are higher than before Obamacare, they have come down over the past several months.\nBelow is a cost summary provided by eHealthInsurance:— Premiums have increased by 39 percent to 56 percent, compared to pre-Obamacare coverage.\nAs of Feb. 24, the average premium for an individual health plan selected through eHealth without a subsidy was $274 per month, a 39 percent increase over the average individual premium for pre-Obamacare coverage.\n— The most recent average premium for plans without a subsidy chosen by families was $663 per month, a 56 percent increase over the average family premium in Feb. 2013, which was $426 per month.']"

The divide is more equitable than before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as California’s insurance market is now “moderately concentrated” instead of “highly concentrated,” according to a measure of market share called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, said researchers at Kaiser, a Menlo Park, California-based nonprofit that focuses on health care.\n\n“There are some examples of smaller or newer plans being able to get a sizable piece of the market in the exchanges, but by and large a lot of the players in the exchanges that are the biggest were the biggest before as well,” Cynthia Cox, a senior analyst at Kaiser, said in a phone interview.\n\nAbout 5 million Americans have signed up for private health plans through today using the law’s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government. The exchanges were intended to ease access and improve transparency for people who shop for insurance on their own, about 5 percent of the U.S. population. Democrats who wrote the law also hoped to break the dominance of some companies that existed in many states.\n\nIn California, WellPoint Inc.’s Anthem brand signed up about 30 percent of the 869,000 people who used the state’s health exchange, Covered California, by March 1. Anthem had 47 percent of the state’s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.\n\nState Changes\n\nWellPoint also lost ground in New York and Nevada, where it fell from 28 percent and 34 percent of the market, respectively, to 18 percent and 12 percent. In Connecticut, WellPoint’s plans now hold 60 percent of the market from 45 percent before major provisions of the law known as Obamacare took effect.\n\nKristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman, cautioned against drawing conclusions from the Kaiser data, which exclude customers whose plans were renewed from prior years and people who signed up without using exchanges.\n\nBefore the health-care law, one insurance company held at least half the individual market in 30 states, according to the Kaiser report. That remains true in some states, even after the major provisions of Obamacare took effect this year. In Minnesota, for example, PreferredOne, a closely held company based in Golden Valley, Minnesota, has taken about 59 percent of customers on the state’s exchange, MNsure.\n\nBefore the health law, the state’s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent. Blue Cross Blue Shield now has 24 percent share.\n\nThe Kaiser report said that PreferredOne took share by offering “some of the lowest exchange premiums in the country” for plans with very narrow networks of hospitals and doctors.', 'A snapshot of Obamacare enrollment in seven states suggests the law hasn’t significantly increased competition in health insurance markets, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported.\nIn California, for example, four big insurers have largely carved up the state’s market.\nAbout 5 million Americans have signed up for private health plans through today using the law’s insurance exchanges, according to the U.S. government.\nAnthem had 47 percent of the state’s market before plans started to be sold on the new health exchanges on Oct. 1.\nBefore the health law, the state’s Blue Cross Blue Shield plan had 59 percent of the market, while PreferredOne had 3 percent.']"

Obamacare) is really working\n\nBy Jill Shaffer Hammond\n\nLast modified: 3/17/2014 6:17:03 PM\n\nHealth insurance reform through the Affordable Care Act is working. Not a week goes by that I don’t see a Facebook posting, or talk to an acquaintance who’s self-employed, who tells me their happy status of now being insured because of Obamacare. These are folks who were previously shut out of health insurance because they worked part-time, were self-employed, had pre-existing conditions, or simply could not afford it. Now, with the Marketplace, the new rules about guaranteed issue and no pre-existing conditions, and the subsidies available for moderate income earners, people are signing up and getting coverage.\n\n\n\nIn New Hampshire enrollment numbers have been great and are consistently performing well against the national benchmarks. “We are greatly outperforming expectations and are set to break our goal of over 19,000 enrollment by March 31,” a spokesman from CoveringNewHampshire.org told me on March 11.\n\n\n\nIn fact reports later that day put New Hampshire at over 21,000! Nationally, while the ACA certainly had a lousy launch, the website Healthcare.gov is now functioning effectively, and national estimates put the number of enrollees between 4 and 5 million people. States that embraced the ACA early, and built strong websites, such as California, New York, and Kentucky, are having the most success. The percentage of uninsured in the U.S. has been reported by Gallup to have dropped from 17.1 percent to 15.9 percent in just a three-month period, bucking a decades-long trend of increasing numbers. The strong numbers of New Hampshire enrollees shows how great the need has been, in spite of legislative road blocks put in place a couple of years ago. Prohibition against a state-based exchange, and delayed acceptance of grants to cover marketing efforts of our state’s insurance department, left us with an uncertain insurance environment. This is probably a major factor as to why there is only one carrier, Anthem, in our Marketplace. New Hampshire’s very informative marketing website, CoveringNewHampshire.org, wasn’t able to launch until December 24, 2013.\n\n\n\nAlthough the narrow network of the Anthem plan may be annoying or inconvenient to some, it has meant that Anthem was able to keep its premiums about 25 percent lower that they might have been. This will also be a temporary problem. More insurance companies are expected to enter the Marketplace by 2015.\n\n\n\nAbout Medicaid Expansion: A bill has passed in the N.H. Senate, and last week was heard in the House, that will allow the expansion of coverage to another 50,000 residents at or below poverty level, by using federal Medicaid funds to buy private insurance. By not passing legislation last fall, New Hampshire has lost $40 million into our economy, half a million a day, since Jan. 1. That could have been covering those eligible, many of whom work minimum wage jobs — and pay payroll taxes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end of job-lock\n\n\n\nThe ACA has meant the end of job-lock. What’s that? For a long time, I’d encountered families in New Hampshire where one spouse was self-employed, and the other had the health-care job, because the cost of buying insurance as a small business was too expensive. Often that spouse felt locked into that full-time job because her family would not have health coverage otherwise. These families often put infants and small children in costly daycare, rather than work part-time and/or stay home.\n\n\n\nThe ACA now means that these families can be certain of coverage tailored to their income level, and they can make clear decisions about how much time to dedicate to work and to family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cancellation myth\n\n\n\nFirst, every insurance contract is for one year. Insurance products change every year. In the past, if you wanted to keep the same insurance coverage as last year, it often meant a double-digit percentage premium increase. If you wanted to keep roughly the same premium, you often had to double your out-of-pocket costs. Due to the ACA, the coverage required under new insurance policies meets a new standard, including more primary care at no cost, and limiting out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n\n\nNews reports doing follow-ups on individuals claiming their policies got cancelled and their premiums skyrocketed regularly find that those people did find much better coverage at lower costs due to subsidies, once they shopped the Marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment deadline March 31\n\n\n\nTwo weeks left to enroll. How? CoveringNewHampshire.org is our state’s website for all kinds of information about enrolling in the ACA. Here you can find out about the plans available, financial assistance, and start enrollment. There are links to finding help, to contacting In-Person Assisters (The River Center in Peterborough is one location), and almost daily events state-wide for application assistance. There’s no reason to be uninsured anymore. You can’t be denied. It will be affordable. Do it for your own peace of mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJill Shaffer Hammond is in her third term representing Peterborough in the New Hampshire House.\n\n\n\n\n\n', 'Obamacare) is really workingBy Jill Shaffer HammondLast modified: 3/17/2014 6:17:03 PMHealth insurance reform through the Affordable Care Act is working.\nStates that embraced the ACA early, and built strong websites, such as California, New York, and Kentucky, are having the most success.\nProhibition against a state-based exchange, and delayed acceptance of grants to cover marketing efforts of our state’s insurance department, left us with an uncertain insurance environment.\nIn the past, if you wanted to keep the same insurance coverage as last year, it often meant a double-digit percentage premium increase.\nCoveringNewHampshire.org is our state’s website for all kinds of information about enrolling in the ACA.']"

Premiums were often 25 percent of a person\'s income. States found that they couldn\'t afford to subsidize more of the premiums, or expand the program so more people could enroll.\n\nHealthy people would benefit if the sickest patients were no longer in their insurance pool, since rates could be lower. Those less healthy individuals would be competing for spots in the high-risk pools.\n\nPromotion of health savings accounts: Health savings accounts allow you to deposit pre-tax funds into a savings account towards qualifying medical costs if you have a high deductible plan. Obamacare makes the accounts slightly less necessary by capping out-of-pocket costs. It also prohibits the use of HSA funds to buy over the counter drugs (without a prescription) and raises the withdrawal fee from 10 to 20 percent.\n\nWhen President Bush started promoting the accounts in 2006, Mother Jones described the pros and cons. ""Many health care analysts fear that widespread acceptance of HSAs will separate the wealthy and healthy from the sick in insurance pools,"" they wrote, ""and drive up premiums and out-of-pocket health costs for the latter."" It\'s not clear whether that happened, but HSAs grew in popularity between 2007 and 2013 (from five percent to 20 percent of workers) as employers tried to cut down on healthcare costs. The plans definitely benefit wealthy individuals over low income individuals, who can\'t use the tax benefits or afford high deductibles as easily.\n\nInducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together: The Small Business Health Options Plan — the SHOP exchange — already allows business owners to sign up and select plans for employees to choose from. Enrollment has been slow, but unlike the individual market, the SHOP exchange is open year round. The GOP likely wouldn\'t offer an exchange, but just encourage businesses to buy insurance together with tax breaks.\n\nMaybe Included\n\nBuying insurance across state lines: As Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic explains, in the past insurance was more expensive in some states because of regulations that required insurers to sell plans regardless of pre-existing conditions. If insurers could sell across state lines, insurers would relocate to states with lower regulation, where they would be allowed to identify customers more freely.\n\nGuaranteed renewability of policies: What\'s important here is that Republicans are only considering including guaranteed renewability in their plan. The GOP plan might reverse that provision in Obamacare, but it\'s unlikely.\n\nChanges to medical-malpractice regulations: This is something both Democrats and Republicans support, depending on what the reforms are. ""There are versions that simply shield physicians from lawsuits or limit their liability, rather than improving the system so that truly bad providers receive punishment and quality of care improves,"" writes Cohn. In the past the GOP has supported bills to cap pain and suffering payments at $250,000, but states\' rights activists within the party derailed efforts for federal regulation.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.', ""States found that they couldn't afford to subsidize more of the premiums, or expand the program so more people could enroll.\nHealthy people would benefit if the sickest patients were no longer in their insurance pool, since rates could be lower.\nPromotion of health savings accounts: Health savings accounts allow you to deposit pre-tax funds into a savings account towards qualifying medical costs if you have a high deductible plan.\nThe plans definitely benefit wealthy individuals over low income individuals, who can't use the tax benefits or afford high deductibles as easily.\nThe GOP likely wouldn't offer an exchange, but just encourage businesses to buy insurance together with tax breaks.""]"

Keeping what works and reforming what the GOP believes doesn't work is tricky and could face an uphill battle.\n\nFirst, since a new poll shows that the majority of Americans are satisfied with the way the current health care system is working, any tinkering with benefits or age requirements could set off a firestorm of protests. Second, if Republicans try to satisfy everyone, costs are likely to skyrocket, equalling or exceeding the dramatic year over year increases in premiums that have made health care a burden for business and consumers alike.\n\nOne thing Republicans are unlikely to do is risk big, controversial fixes that could jeopardize the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nThe Gallup poll released Monday shows that two thirds of Americans say they are satisfied with the health care system—the majority of whom have insurance, while a third are uninsured. Gallup also found that young people and elderly people were the most satisfied with the current healthcare system. Some 73 percent of people ages 18-30 said they were content with the system. And 80 percent of people over 65—who are eligible for Medicare—said they were also satisfied.\n\nRelated: GOP Obamacare Strategy Fixed After Florida?\n\nThe new survey comes on the heels of a separate CNN-ORC International poll released last week revealing that support for the president’s health care law is rising slightly, with 39 percent of Americans now saying they support the law, compared to 35 percent in December. The poll found that 57 percent still oppose the law, down from 62 percent at the end of last year.\n\nBoth survey results are good news for the Obama administration, as more and more provisions in the new health care reform law take effect.\n\nMeanwhile, the surveys could throw a wrench in the GOP’s campaign strategy to continue attacking Obamacare, while offering their own alternatives.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and other House leaders are cobbling together a bill to serve as an alternative to the law that shifts more power away from the federal government onto the states, with an emphasis on moving more people to private plans.\n\nRelated: GOP on Obamacare: Repeal or Replace?\n\nThe proposal includes a handful of previously offered GOP ideas—including expanding the high risk insurance pools, promoting health savings accounts, inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together, The Washington Post reporters.\n\nThis is the first time Republicans in the House will offer a real comprehensive Obamacare alternative, instead of symbolically voting to repeal major provisions of the law or get rid of it entirely, as they have done more than 50 times.\n\nThe Post reports that House leaders plan to share a memo with other GOP lawmakers later this month outlining the proposal which is called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind.” The memo will also include talking points for the GOP lawmakers to explain it to voters.\n\nRelated: Obamacare May Be Failing the Uninsured\n\n“We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-CA said in a statement.\n\nHowever, some Democrats are skeptical about the proposal and believe the GOP’s proposal is only political and won’t actually fix the healthcare law.\n\n“If they had fixes, I’d certainly consider it,” Sen. Timothy M. Kaine (D-Va.) told the Post. “But if they are trying to scrap it all, going back to the bad old days, it’s not going to go anywhere.”\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in the Senate have unveiled an Obamacare alternative of their own and are watching the House closely to see how the new proposal will fare.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:"", ""With the midterm elections looming, Republicans are preparing to unveil their Obamacare alternative in order to appeal to voters who may be unhappy with the president’s health care law.\nKeeping what works and reforming what the GOP believes doesn't work is tricky and could face an uphill battle.\nRelated: GOP Obamacare Strategy Fixed After Florida?\nBoth survey results are good news for the Obama administration, as more and more provisions in the new health care reform law take effect.\nRelated: GOP on Obamacare: Repeal or Replace?""]"

Yet, despite the drop, federal officials anticipate another surge as the March 31 deadline for enrollment approaches. Those who are not covered by the deadline may face a fine of $95 or 1 percent of their income, whichever is greater.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, at the current pace, sign-ups are below the original target of 5.6 million by the end of February, based on the Congressional Budget Office projection of seven million by the end of March. Last month, the budget office downgraded those projections to six million for the full six-month enrollment period, so a big surge would be needed in the final weeks to meet that benchmark.\n\nApproximately 25 percent of enrollments up to March 1 were for individuals in the critical demographic age range of 18 to 34.

The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan �?? which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations �?? are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills. But this is the first time this year that House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles from those bills and present it as their vision. This month, House leaders will begin to share a memo with lawmakers outlining the plan, called �??A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind,�?� with suggestions on how Republicans should talk about it to their constituents. �??We�??ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,�?� House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said in an interview. �??We�??ve got all of these bills out there, so we�??re going to take this core of policies and grow from there.�?�\n\nThe key phrase here is “the first time this year.” Republicans have put forth several other alternatives over the past four years, including a few other working-group products that were meant to be the party’s “official alternative” to ObamaCare. But the media let Democrats get away with pretending none of these plans existed. One of President Obama’s most frequently repeated, and categorically false, talking points is that nobody has any alternative suggestions to his disastrous Affordable Care Act. In the very same Washington Post article that describes the 2014 Republican alternative, Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) is quoted pretending the new plan doesn’t exist.\n\nSo Republican leaders are basically surfing on the media tide by treating this as the grand unveiling of a brand-new package, even though most of the (quite excellent) ideas they’re teasing have been part of earlier proposals Democrats were able to wish away into the cornfield. This might prove to be an effective bit of political and media judo, because 2014 feels like a brand-new shuffle and cut of the electoral cards, and voters will see the official Republican plan as an entirely fresh and new replacement for the widely hated ACA. (The Post tries to buck up lil’ campers on the Democrat reservation by citing an ostensibly reassuring poll that has “support for the Affordable Care Act ticking up slightly”… to 39 percent, with 57 percent disapproval.)\n\nThe new Republican plan will debut amid much buzz about President Obama’s falling approval ratings, public disgust with the endless and nakedly political revisions to the ACA, and the meaning of the special election in Florida’s District 13. The underdog Republican victory in that race might have persuaded the leadership it’s time to bring out a plan they can run with, in unison, during the midterm elections. Until now, it has been thought that exposing a GOP alternative to Democrat attacks could be a tactical mistake, giving Dems a chance to change the subject away from the ongoing ObamaCare disaster. Some conservative strategists evidently still feel that way, but others think it will be difficult to fully capitalize on the public revolt against ObamaCare without a solid alternative on the table.\n\nIf the House package draws wide acclaim once its details are unveiled, the next step will be to get Senate Republicans on board. If the party’s efforts are split between too many conflicting alternatives, their signals will all be lost in media static – they should have learned that by now. On the other hand, every headline-grabbing ObamaCare horror story gives them another chance to say, “Under our plan, these things won’t happen,” coupled with frequent reminders of all those broken ObamaCare promises and absurdly inaccurate predictions.\n\nBarack Obama is illegally waiving huge chunks of the Affordable Care Act just to keep his party alive during the 2014 election.

That’s a pretty amazing feat of crystal ball gazing, isn’t it?\n\nNo, of course not. It’s like predicting that a Republican tax plan will include lower rates on the rich. They might package it in different wrapping paper, but it’s always the same old stuff. And it’s worth keeping in mind that guaranteed renewability of policies has been the law for a long time, so it’s unlikely the GOP plan actually offers anything substantive on that point. Ditto for the small business “inducements,” which will probably just turn out to be tax cuts of some kind.\n\nBasically, Republican health care proposals are always, always, always a repackaging of the four tired old points above. Nobody seriously thinks that any of them will expand access to health care in any serious way, but that doesn’t matter. These are the only things Republicans can all agree on, so that’s what they always propose. Whether it works or not isn’t really the point.\n\nIf you want more detail about all this, rather than just my exasperated Cliff Notes version, check out Jonathan Cohn here. He has it all covered.', 'I hear that House Republicans have a shiny new health care plan they plan to introduce sometime soon.\nIt looks like I missed a couple of things: “inducements” for small businesses and “guaranteed renewability” of policies.\nAnd it’s worth keeping in mind that guaranteed renewability of policies has been the law for a long time, so it’s unlikely the GOP plan actually offers anything substantive on that point.\nBasically, Republican health care proposals are always, always, always a repackaging of the four tired old points above.\nNobody seriously thinks that any of them will expand access to health care in any serious way, but that doesn’t matter.']"

16034,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/av-sinensky/obamacare-small-business_b_4964649.html,business,"['How Obamacare Impacts Small Business Transactions\n\nLast week, I wrote about some of the ways Obamacare impacts small businesses, specifically five requirements Obamacare places on small businesses and five opportunities Obamacare affords small businesses. As discussed, while small businesses (i.e. companies with fewer than 50 employees) are exempt from many of the most rigorous requirements of the Affordable Care Act -- most notably, the Employer Mandate -- there are still some requirements and even some opportunities that small business owners should be aware of regarding Obamacare.\n\nAs an Obamacare attorney, I have observed that the factors a small business has to consider with respect to the Affordable Care Act can change quite dramatically if its workforce grows beyond 50 full-time employees. This can occur over time as a result of the natural growth of the business but can also happen rapidly and unexpectedly as a result of a business transaction.\n\nHere are three tips that any small business owner considering a business transaction should keep in mind to ensure that there are no unexpected Obamacare surprises as a result of the transaction:\n\n1. Count Hours, Not Just Employees\n\nTo determine how many full-time employees a business has for purposes of the Affordable Care Act, a business has to count not only its actual full-time employees (those work more than 30 hours per week) but also the number of hours worked by its part-time employees. The number of hours worked by part-time employees is aggregated to calculate a company\'s full-time equivalents. Therefore, as part of the due diligence process, the acquiring company should focus not only on the target company\'s full-time employees but also its full-time equivalents. If the target company\'s and acquiring company\'s full-time employees and full-time equivalents combine to total more than 50 employees, the new combined company will be subject to the Employer Mandate and other requirements of Obamacare.\n\n2. Remember Controlled Groups\n\nWhile the process above might seem obvious in the context of two related businesses that combine (i.e. a gardening business buys its competitor down the street to form a larger gardening business), it is less intuitive but still applicable in the context of unrelated businesses under common ownership.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act assesses liability with respect to the Employer Mandate on what the Tax Code calls a ""controlled group"" basis. Essentially, what this this means is that companies that are otherwise totally separate businesses are treated as one company for certain purposes if they are owned by the same or similar people (or corporations).\n\nTherefore, when purchasing a business in an M&A transaction, the acquirer needs to consider the workforce not only of the business it is acquiring but also of other seemingly unrelated businesses it may own.\n\n3. Beware of Successor Liability\n\nUntil now, we have been thinking about acquisitions of small businesses that prior to acquisition were exempt from the Employer Mandate. But what if the target business had more than 50 employees and was therefore subject to all of Obamacare?\n\nWhile there is still some ambiguity that is awaiting further guidance from the IRS, the possibility of successor liability is important to keep in mind. This would mean that the purchaser could be on the hook for any liabilities of the previous owners if they failed to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, it is important to ask about and seek evidence of the company\'s compliance with the applicable provisions of Obamacare or the new owner could be left holding the bag for the previous owner\'s actions. Additionally, a purchaser should consider the possibility of post-closing liability in any transaction, and ensure that the transaction document contains the appropriate representations and allocates responsibility for any Affordable Care Act penalties accordingly.', 'How Obamacare Impacts Small Business TransactionsLast week, I wrote about some of the ways Obamacare impacts small businesses, specifically five requirements Obamacare places on small businesses and five opportunities Obamacare affords small businesses.\nAs an Obamacare attorney, I have observed that the factors a small business has to consider with respect to the Affordable Care Act can change quite dramatically if its workforce grows beyond 50 full-time employees.\nHere are three tips that any small business owner considering a business transaction should keep in mind to ensure that there are no unexpected Obamacare surprises as a result of the transaction:1.\nThe Affordable Care Act assesses liability with respect to the Employer Mandate on what the Tax Code calls a ""controlled group"" basis.\nBeware of Successor LiabilityUntil now, we have been thinking about acquisitions of small businesses that prior to acquisition were exempt from the Employer Mandate.']"

A month later, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said GOP leaders would have “conversations” with members about possible ideas that could go into a theoretical alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt was hard to miss the incompatibility of Cantor’s promise and Boehner’s half-hearted hedge.\n\nThat said, Robert Costa reports that House Republican leaders are still moving towards some kind of reform blueprint to present to voters in advance of the 2014 midterms. It’ll apparently be called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind.”\n\nThe plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together. The tenets of the plan – which could expand to include the ability to buy insurance across state lines, guaranteed renewability of policies and changes to medical-malpractice regulations – are ideas that various conservatives have for a long time backed as part of broader bills.\n\nLet me get this straight. It took House Republican leaders five years of secret meetings, held far from public view, to come up an outline of ideas we already knew they supported?\n\nCosta added that this will be “the first time … House leaders will put their full force behind a single set of principles,” and that’s certainly nice. But (a) they’ve spent five years promising a bill, not a set of principles; (b) what’s needed are specific provisions that can be scored, not vague blueprints; and (c) the Affordable Care Act already has some of the Republicans’ favorite provisions in it.\n\nOr put another way, health care policy is hard. A political party that’s serious about substance and policy outcomes will have to invest a lot of time and energy into crafting a health care plan that works.\n\nAnd yet, at this point, the Republican approach rests with presenting a fragile coin. On one side of the coin we see a bunch of hollow complaints about the ACA; on the other side we see a list of ideas Republicans have always liked, but which do not amount to a real, credible plan.\n\n“We’ve got to get to where you can compare the two perspectives, Republican and Democrat,” House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Costa.\n\nThat’s actually a compelling point, and a side-by-side comparison would contribute quite a bit to the debate. Which party’s approach would cover more of the uninsured? Which offers more consumer protections? Which would improve the nation’s long-term finances? Which would do more to help lower costs within the system without sacrificing quality of care?', 'That said, Robert Costa reports that House Republican leaders are still moving towards some kind of reform blueprint to present to voters in advance of the 2014 midterms.\nIt’ll apparently be called “A Stronger Health Care System: The GOP Plan for Freedom, Flexibility, & Peace of Mind.”The plan includes an expansion of high-risk insurance pools, promotion of health savings accounts and inducements for small businesses to purchase coverage together.\nIt took House Republican leaders five years of secret meetings, held far from public view, to come up an outline of ideas we already knew they supported?\nOr put another way, health care policy is hard.\nA political party that’s serious about substance and policy outcomes will have to invest a lot of time and energy into crafting a health care plan that works.']"

And based on a report in the Washington Post, it will look a lot like their old health care proposals—the ones that would have done very little to improve access, reduce financial distress, and contain health care spending. But this new plan would be different in one key respect. Implementing this sort of Republican plan now would probably mean taking away coverage from quite a lot of people who just got it. That’s a pretty big deal.\n\nOf course, they don’t admit that. The main feature of the Republican approach, according to the Post’s Robert Costa, will be cross-state purchasing, expansion of high-risk pools, and malpractice reform. The idea, which Republicans have been talking about for 20 years, would mean that somebody in, say, New York could buy a policy from a carrier in, say, North Dakota. Sounds great, right? We order shoes from far-flung websites and drive across the state line for beer—why not do the same for health insurance? Here’s why: A big reason coverage in places like New York has gotten expensive is local rules designed for protect people from insurance companies’ misbehavior. In New York, carriers must sell to anybody, regardless of pre-existing condition, and they must provide a reasonably comprehensive set of benefits.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act effectively made those kinds of regulations national. But if the GOP were to get its way, scrapping Obamacare and replacing it with the yet-unpublished plan Costa describes, the insurance industry would likely evolve just like the credit card industry did, with carriers relocating to states with the least regulations. That would be good news for healthy people willing to carry bare-bones coverage, and for people with enough money to pay for a plan, would love this arrangement. But people with preexisting conditions, the ones who were only able to buy coverage thanks to the ACA’s rules, would be back to the bad old days.\n\nNot to worry, Republicans always say—that’s the reason for high-risk pools, which are separate insurance arrangements for people who can’t buy insurance on their own. In theory, high-risk pools may sound like a sensible idea. In practice, they are relatively expensive to run—because, by definition, they don’t have the premiums from healthy people to subsidize the cost of the sick. And they rarely get the money they need from government, because they lack constituencies powerful enough to fight for funding. As a result, high-risk pools almost always end up oversubscribed, leading to long waiting lists. And they typically provide less coverage for more money.', 'House Republican leaders have come up with a new health care proposal.\nAnd based on a report in the Washington Post, it will look a lot like their old health care proposals—the ones that would have done very little to improve access, reduce financial distress, and contain health care spending.\nImplementing this sort of Republican plan now would probably mean taking away coverage from quite a lot of people who just got it.\nWe order shoes from far-flung websites and drive across the state line for beer—why not do the same for health insurance?\nAs a result, high-risk pools almost always end up oversubscribed, leading to long waiting lists.']"

16041,http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_25356069/obamacare-health-insurance-agents-now-most-popular-people,business,"['By Tracy Seipel\n\nWhen employees at the Los Gatos nail salon where Roshan Bedi gets her manicures recently found out she sold health insurance, they practically froze in mid-polish. Suddenly, everyone was asking her which health plan was best.\n\nOnce her nails had dried, she handed out a batch of business cards.\n\nNot long ago, a chance meeting with an insurance agent might have led strangers to start running in the opposite direction — or politely extricate themselves from the inevitable sales pitch. Yet as the March 31 deadline to enroll in a health care plan looms, health insurance agents have become some of the most popular people in town.\n\n“It’s absolutely true,” Kelley Filice Jensen said with a chuckle.\n\nJensen, who has been in the insurance business for 15 years, said whenever parents at her children’s schools discover her profession, they almost always tell her about a relative who needs advice or help signing up for a plan under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\n“People, and their questions, are coming out of the woodwork,” she said.\n\nPeople like Davlyn Spetch, 34, owner of Action Cleaning Service in San Jose. In late February, she sought out Jensen to help her pick the best Obamacare plan for her 13 employees. Jensen directed Spetch to a small-business plan that will give the business owner tax credits for the employee premiums she pays, but which also allows her employees’ spouses and dependents to qualify for a federal tax subsidy.\n\n“I don’t have the time to read through all the fine print and figure out every little detail of these plans,” said Spetch, who said Jensen proved to be a “gold mine” of information.\n\nWhile online sites like eHealthInsurance.com and GetInsured.com have taken a bite out of independent agents’ business, problems with California’s health insurance website and the sometimes endless waits to talk to someone at official call centers have won these Rodney Dangerfields of the business world a newfound respect. They quickly became the go-to people for Obamacare.\n\n“Everyone thought that insurance agents would go the way of travel agents,” said Micah Weinberg, a health policy analyst at the Bay Area Council, a business advocacy group. “But here’s the problem: Health insurance is actually more difficult to purchase after health care reform than it was before health care reform.”\n\nWeinberg, an Obamacare supporter who called the belief that buying health insurance would be as easy as buying a book on Amazon “ludicrous on its face,” said he’s steered “every single person” who has asked him about signing up for a health plan to insurance agents.\n\n“These are people who have sold health insurance for a living,” he said. “Everyone else is still involved in on-the-job training.”\n\nThose other people Californians can turn to include the 800 call-center operators at the Covered California insurance exchange’s three sites. In addition, there are more than 5,000 enrollment counselors certified by Covered California. The exchange also counts 10,725 county social service workers who can enroll people in both expanded Medi-Cal and exchange plans. But there also are 11,600 insurance agents who have been certified by Covered California. All are free of charge.\n\nLarry Hicks, a Covered California spokesman, said enrollment counselors can educate consumers on their health care plan options and discuss the financial obligations under each plan, then enroll consumers once they choose a plan. But insurance agents are licensed to actually recommend specific health insurance companies and plans, both on and off the exchange.\n\n“The difference between us is pretty simple,” said Robert Jetter, a seasoned East Bay insurance agent who compares a client’s experience to dining at a cafeteria versus a five-star restaurant.\n\n“The guy in the cafeteria can tell you what the entrees are,” said Jetter, the director at American Health Advocates in Alameda. “But the restaurant waiter can tell you which one tastes best.”\n\nStill, Hicks said, insurance agents aren’t for everybody. Enrollment counselors who are often found at community centers and enrollment events have a different appeal.\n\n“I might be more comfortable walking into an office of the local chapter of the NAACP to sign up than walking into an office of an insurance company,” said Hicks, who is African-American.\n\nInsurance agents say while they’re pleased to be popular, there’s a price to pay.\n\nThey generally earn about 4 percent commission for each Obamacare policy they write. And Neil Crosby, spokesman for the California Association of Health Underwriters, an industry group that represents 2,500 health insurance agents in the state, said the process of enrolling people in the new health plans often takes hours to explain — so much time that agents, he said, “cannot get their regular work done.”\n\nMoreover, most agents Crosby talks to say they have so far earned “basically nothing” in commissions because insurance companies are so backed up processing applications and premiums. A lot of them, Crosby said, feel like they’re beating their heads against a wall because of the workload.\n\n“But,” he added, “I will tell you that the majority of agents I know and talk with feel like it’s just part of what they think is the right thing to do. “\n\nContact Tracy Seipel at 408-920-5343.

Fewer people have signed up than the administration had hoped, especially among the young and healthy. For many people, even the previously uninsured, the choices in the Obamacare market are simply not what they’re looking for in a health insurance plan.\n\nIt’s easy to understand why.\n\nObamacare replaces a wide variety of market-determined plans with a limited number of plans containing narrow networks of doctors and hospitals and a required set of items covered. No more cheap catastrophic care plan for the young man in his first job. Families and businesses can’t choose an insurance plan that meets their circumstances and needs. Now the government sets the plans and the networks.\n\nThe result is that cancer patients are losing access to the doctors and hospitals they rely on. Parents are losing their trusted pediatricians. And families may not have access to the hospital nearest to their homes.\n\nSubscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate\n\nby email and never miss\n\nour top stories\n\nConsider this: In Georgia, one of the five insurers offering plans on the Obamacare exchanges has just one hospital in the entire state in its network. In California and New York, major plans exclude the world-class Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles and New York City’s Memorial Sloan-Kettering.\n\nFor those with serious and chronic illnesses, there is more terrible news. Many people are finding that their expensive, life-saving medications are not covered under their new Obamacare plans.\n\nThese narrow plans with narrow networks mean fewer choices, higher costs, and difficult decisions for millions of Americans.\n\nSome families do pay less for their monthly premiums for Obamacare-subsidized plans. Many more working families, who earn too much to qualify for subsidized plans, are paying considerably more each month for their health insurance. But the monthly premium is not the only cost in a health insurance plan.\n\nFamilies are finding that their insurance won’t begin paying for care until they’ve spent $5,000, $10,000, or more of their own money toward the deductible first. And once the deductible is met, the co-insurance (the amount the plan pays) may be as low as 60 percent, leaving individuals to pay the rest of the bill for their care by themselves.\n\nMost plans in the previous insurance market had an “out-of-pocket” cap to prevent people from losing everything in the event of a serious health problem. But in the Obamacare exchanges, some plans are offered with out-of-pocket protection only for care provided in-network. If you go to a doctor or hospital outside of your network, your insurance plan may pay nothing.\n\nPeople who rely on an expensive medication—for multiple sclerosis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, or HIV for example—are seeing their medication costs skyrocket. If the medication is covered by their insurance plan, they may still have to pay 40 percent of the cost, or thousands of dollars a year, up to the out-of-pocket limit. If the medication is not covered, they must pay the full price and the cost does not count toward the deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Their expenses then are literally limitless.\n\nOne of the most serious problems with Obamacare is that it mistakes health insurance for health care. Obamacare supporters pretend that if every person has a health insurance plan, then they are getting the health care they need. That is simply not true. As we have seen, a plan that doesn’t include your doctor or your medication doesn’t provide the care you need. But there is another serious problem quickly coming into view.\n\nFor decades, poor people in this country have been eligible for Medicaid. The amount the government pays doctors to see Medicaid patients, however, is very low. At some point, when a doctor is not getting paid enough to cover the basic expenses of providing care, he or she will stop accepting Medicaid patients, or get out of medicine altogether. That is why today Medicaid patients can wait months for care, if they can find a doctor who will see them at all.\n\nObamacare specifically expands Medicaid to a wider segment of the population. Young adults with low incomes and the children of low-income families may have Medicaid as their only choice in the Obamacare exchanges, based on family income. So far, enrollment in Medicaid has been more than half of the signups made under the new Obamacare rules. Who will provide care to those people? How long will they have to wait to see a doctor?\n\nIn 2008, about 15 percent of Americans were uninsured. The Congressional Budget office projects that under Obamacare, in the years 2013-2023, the percentage of uninsured will never fall below 11 percent of the population. That’s not much of a change in health insurance rates, at the expense of more expensive, less accessible health care for millions more Americans.\n\nMatthew Brooks is the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition.', 'For many people, even the previously uninsured, the choices in the Obamacare market are simply not what they’re looking for in a health insurance plan.\nBut the monthly premium is not the only cost in a health insurance plan.\nOne of the most serious problems with Obamacare is that it mistakes health insurance for health care.\nObamacare supporters pretend that if every person has a health insurance plan, then they are getting the health care they need.\nThat’s not much of a change in health insurance rates, at the expense of more expensive, less accessible health care for millions more Americans.']"

And to about one-third of the country’s uninsured, the deadline doesn’t matter because they are choosing to go without coverage.\n\nThis is according to a new survey from the folks at Bankrate.com, which found that, of those opting to face the penalty instead of obtaining coverage, 41% said it was because they believed that insurance is too expensive for them.\n\nHowever, the survey also found that only 30% of uninsured Americans are even aware of subsidies and tax credits that are available to bring down the cost. That’s virtually the same number (29%) as those who incorrectly believe there are no such credits, and markedly below the 41% of uninsured people who admitted to not knowing about these subsidies.\n\nAnother reason given for choosing to not get coverage was opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

That group was dominated by males, who were nearly three times more likely to give this reason than females.\n\nThe 18-29 year-old demographic has been the subject of much of the marketing for the ACA, but the Bankrate survey found what you’d probably expect to find among this age group — a sense of invincibility and a perceived immunity from all things that could make you sick or kill you — with 31% of uninsured young adults saying they simply don’t need insurance because they are healthy.\n\nJust remember that thought when a piano or anvil falls on top of you from a comical height.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, and whatever your reasons are, just know that the deadline is March 31.

Meanwhile, about 70 percent said they were unaware of subsidies available under the new law that could make their health plans more affordable.\n\nThe study’s findings are worrisome for the Obama administration since the key goal of the president’s health care law was to extend access to health coverage for the uninsured.\n\nA separate study by the McKinsey consulting firm found just 27 percent of Obamacare enrollees were uninsured. That means that the majority of those signing up for Obamacare had previous insurance of some kind—whether they were kicked off their old policies, or they found a better deal on the exchanges. Though not confirmed by the White House, if accurate, that could mean the law is failing to meet its intended goal.\n\nRelated: Gallup: Employment, Obamacare Lower Uninsured Rate\n\nGary Cohen, an official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the administration has not been tracking how many of the Obamacare enrollees were previously uninsured.\n\n“That's not a data point we are really collecting in any sort of systematic way,” Cohen told an audience at a health policy conference in Washington.\n\nHowever, a separate poll from Gallup shows that the uninsured rate is at its lowest rate in the last five years—and the pollsters say Obamacare may deserve part of the credit. Of course, the uninsured rate is also tied to the lower unemployment rate, which could also explain the decline.\n\nStill, the Bankrate survey found one bright spot for the White House—about 66 percent of young people between the ages of 18-29 said they are planning to sign up for coverage. This is crucial since the Obama administration has stressed from the beginning the importance of enrolling a strong mix of young and healthy people to offset the costs for older, sicker Americans.\n\nThrough February, young people made up about 27 percent of total enrollees--well below the White House’s 40 percent benchmark. Still, administration officials have repeatedly said they expect a crush of young people to sign up ahead of the March 31 deadline.\n\nRelated: Uninsured Still Unaware of Obamacare Deadline\n\nUnder the law’s individual mandate, those who do not sign up for health coverage before March 31, will be subject to a penalty of 1 percent of their annual income. However, under rules issued by the administration, millions of people will likely be exempt from paying that penalty through a provision called the “hardship exemption,” which was extended last week through 2016.\n\nThis allows anyone who believes they will have a “hardship in obtaining insurance,” including homeless people, or those who have foreclosed upon, can apply for the exemption.\n\nCritics of the provision say it is too ambiguous and could potentially allow anyone to skirt around the penalty.\n\n“Quietly, without any fanfare, there’s a real question about whether the White House has just abandoned the individual mandate, the heart of Obamacare itself,” Boehner said a news conference last week. “This is a huge public policy decision that could affect millions of Americans.”\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:"", 'Related: Obamacare May Be Failing the UninsuredBankrate surveyed 3,005 people and found that 41 percent of those who were uninsured said they plan to stay uninsured because they think that health insurance is too costly.\nA separate study by the McKinsey consulting firm found just 27 percent of Obamacare enrollees were uninsured.\nRelated: Gallup: Employment, Obamacare Lower Uninsured RateGary Cohen, an official for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the administration has not been tracking how many of the Obamacare enrollees were previously uninsured.\nHowever, a separate poll from Gallup shows that the uninsured rate is at its lowest rate in the last five years—and the pollsters say Obamacare may deserve part of the credit.\nOf course, the uninsured rate is also tied to the lower unemployment rate, which could also explain the decline.']"

There is us (the insured) and them (the uninsured). We are good and they are not. Which is why we never bothered to ask them what they might be looking for in a health insurance policy. We passed the law requiring them to buy what we think they should buy.\n\nWith this contemptuous attitude towards the people the elite is trying to “help” perhaps it is not surprising that the helpees are not behaving the way the helpers would like them to. Amy Goldstein writes in the Washington Post that “Health insurance marketplaces (are) signing up few uninsured Americans…”\n\nMegan McArdle is even more stark in Bloomberg, “How Not to Help the Uninsured.” She includes a fascinating graph:\n\nWe are five months into open enrollment and 56% of the uninsured haven’t even looked into getting coverage, and another 34% looked but declined to buy. Ten percent of the uninsured are newly covered, but 18% of the previously insured are newly uninsured.\n\nVery few of the people who wrote this law have ever been uninsured or even know anyone who has been. They are well educated and gainfully employed. Their entire world-view and values belong to what used to be called the bourgeois state of mind. They obey all the laws, are generally well mannered, save money for their children’s college funds, eat right and exercise regularly. They don’t take risks and they don’t get into fistfights.\n\nThey believe that the world would be a better place if everyone were more like them. They are also pretty powerful people, though they may not see themselves that way. They have money and influence, they rank high on Google searches, they write articles that actually get published. They are articulate and respected by their peers.\n\nAnd they want to do good. They want to leave the world a better place. So they reach out for the levers of influence available to them – usually government – to create policies that will improve the lives of the less fortunate. These efforts range from the annoying, like banning Big Gulp sodas, to Obamacare’s mandate that everyone must buy insurance or be penalized.\n\nThe problem is that these people are not much like the rest of America. They may disapprove of Big Gulp sodas but the product is wildly popular in the rest of the country. As Rick Santorum reminded the crowd at CPAC, only 30% of the country will ever graduate from college. That doesn’t make the other 70% stupid or ill-informed, it just means they don’t have the patience to sit in a classroom day after day for years on end being lectured to by pompous buffoons.\n\nSome seven years ago (2007) Duke Law School published an edition of its journal “Law and Contemporary Problems” devoted to “Distributional Issues in Health Care.” It included articles by writers such as Mark Pauly, Mark Hall, Christopher Conover, and Tom Miller, but for me the most interesting article was the Foreword by editors Clark Havighurst and Barak Richman.\n\nThey argue that poor and working people are poorly served by coverage decisions made by upper middle-class managers who load up on benefits with little value to lower-income workers — “… lower-income insureds get less out of their employer’s health plans than their higher-income coworkers despite paying the same premiums.” They conclude, “… in health care perhaps more than any other sector, the true interests of consumer-voters are ill-served by the political, regulatory, and legal environment.”\n\nIn other words, workers in a corporate environment will accept the coverage provided by upper-class management, but once they are on their own they simply don’t see any value in the super-rich and expensive benefits the elites prefer. But the regulatory structure precludes the offering of anything more modest, so these people vote with their feet and become uninsured.\n\nThat was certainly my experience. In the 1990s, after I left my job with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, I went without coverage for five years while I started three separate businesses. I simply could not afford to both start these businesses (which ended up employing 45 people in Northern Virginia) and pay for health insurance. You might not make the same decision, but the 45 people I hired were probably pretty happy that I did. If some sort of catastrophic illness plan had been available I probably would have bought it, but such were not permitted at the time.\n\nI am not alone. Tens of millions of people have made rational decisions to spend their money on things that are more important than health insurance, at least for a time. I could list a couple of dozen people I know personally who have made this decision. Who is to say they are wrong?\n\nIn most markets when a large number of people are not buying your product, you look to see how to improve the product to make it more appealing. Only in health care is it considered acceptable to command people to buy what they have rejected. No wonder the elite wants to ban the word “bossy.”', 'People without health insurance are terrible people – free riders, leaches, irresponsible deadbeats.\nWhich is why we never bothered to ask them what they might be looking for in a health insurance policy.\nTen percent of the uninsured are newly covered, but 18% of the previously insured are newly uninsured.\nVery few of the people who wrote this law have ever been uninsured or even know anyone who has been.\nThese efforts range from the annoying, like banning Big Gulp sodas, to Obamacare’s mandate that everyone must buy insurance or be penalized.']"

We asked what it means to you, and you\'ve responded.\n\nHundreds of Alabamians have shared specific personal experiences with AL.com that explain why they\'re in favor of the law or against it. These stories are helping to guide and inform our reporting.\n\nAlan Gurganus\n\nName: Alan Gurganus\n\nAge: 36\n\nCity: Irondale\n\nHis situation: Gurganus, the director of recycling at the Alabama Environmental Council, checked out the healthcare.gov site soon after it opened in October and experienced its well-documented glitches.\n\n""It was very frustrating,"" Gurganus said.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, he learned that his Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health insurance premium payment was going to go up about $100 per month -- from $180 to $280.\n\nAfter having allowed about six weeks for the Affordable Care Act website to get fixed, he tried again. He got all the way through the process and at the end, he still couldn\'t see the plans offered. More frustration.\n\nBut he persevered and eventually found a plan on the exchange for about $240 that matched the coverage he had. So even though it was more than his original premium of $180, Gurganus is pleased to have saved $40 from what he would have been paying outside the exchange. On top of that, the deductible on the ACA Silver plan he chose is about $1,500 less, he said, while prescription drugs and co-pay remain unchanged.\n\nHe did not qualify for a subsidy via tax credits.\n\nWhat it means: It\'s likely that Gurganus\' original plan\'s premium increased due to some of the effects of the Affordable Care Act. The law doesn\'t allow for insurers to deny or charge more for preexisting conditions anymore, for example. In states like Alabama where medical underwriting, as it is called, was prevalent, many premiums were bound to go up. By going on the exchange, however, Gurganus was able to ameliorate that price hike by finding a plan that matched his coverage and was $40 less expensive than what was offered to him outside the exchange.\n\nHis view: ""Overall, I\'m happy to be spending less for good health insurance, but I\'m most appreciative of the fact that friends and family and fellow Americans with preexisting conditions now have access to health insurance,"" Gurganus said.\n\nBut Gurganus said the process was exasperating at times.\n\n""I was able to keep my cool by reminding myself that this is a government program,\' Gurganus said.

To avoid those roadblocks, Republicans are signaling that they might delay plans for comprehensive legislation in favor of passing a set of narrowly targeted reforms.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., is running the process, with an assist from his leadership deputies and top committee chairmen. Rank-and-file Republicans familiar with their work describe it as a diligent attempt to develop workable, conservative health care policy that jettisons what Americans dislike about Obamacare while addressing the problems with health insurance that have lingered since the law was enacted in 2010. Nothing is likely to be ready for consideration before July.\n\n“House Republicans will offer our own solutions that focus on patient-centered care, while reducing costs through increased competition, improving outcomes and expanding choices and coverage,” Cantor told the Washington Examiner in a statement provided by his office. “Repealing Obamacare is a prerequisite, but we will also share our alternative approach with working middle-class families being harmed by that law.”\n\nAccording to Republican sources, Cantor at the very least wants to craft a midterm campaign agenda for health care that can be used as the basis for legislation next January, in the event that the GOP wins control of the Senate and is in a position to send legislation to President Obama\'s desk.\n\nRank-and-file House Republicans are doubtful Cantor will achieve much more than that before Nov. 4. Contributing to the skepticism that a sweeping Obamacare alternative will receive a floor vote is the heated political season — now fully underway — and House Republicans’ recent history of repeated failures to unify behind big-ticket legislation. The caucus is roughly split over what to do, and not along the usual conservative-Establishment lines.\n\nHalf of the House majority is aligned with leadership and supports passing a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act before the Nov. 4 elections. Among them are some of the staunchest conservatives in the House who especially bristle at Democratic charges that they have no ideas for how to reform health care other than repealing Obamacare.\n\nThe other half of the caucus also agrees that Republicans should offer an Obamacare replacement. But they prefer to wait until after the midterms, when doing so might be less politically hazardous and not run the risk of distracting voters from the ongoing problems with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe division, predicted one House Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity, means that the caucus probably will have to settle for passing a “milquetoast” piece of legislation, or, more likely, releasing a broad list of health care principles.\n\n“The discussions still are going on that are, politically, would we be smart to put out an alternative plan or not? That’s what the debate is about right now,” Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, said. “You don’t want to give your opponents something to shoot at, and any alternative people are going to be able to shoot at in some way or another.”\n\nHouse Republicans have reviewed an extensive amount of public and private polling about Obamacare since its rocky rollout began Oct. 1.\n\nEven though the Affordable Care Act’s consistently low approval ratings have positioned the GOP to gain House seats and flip control of the Senate in November, House Republicans have concluded from the data that simply vowing to repeal Obamacare is not enough to capitalize on voters’ disenchantment with the law. To win seats, House Republicans believe they must pair their criticism with a proactive health care agenda of their own.\n\nThe latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll lends credence to the Republicans\' conclusions. In the national survey, only 35 percent of respondents said they thought “President Obama\'s health care plan” was a “good idea.” And yet, 48 percent said they would be more likely to vote for a Democrat in November who supports “fixing and keeping” the law; 47 percent were more inclined to vote for a Republican who backs “repealing and eliminating” it.\n\nA recent survey jointly conducted by Democratic and Republican pollsters for America\'s Health Insurance Plans, an industry lobbying group, revealed similar findings. Overall, only 34 percent of respondents expressed support for the law and voters motivated by their disapproval of the statute are more likely to vote this year. But by a margin of 54 percent to 28 percent, they favored “fixing” Obamacare over “totally eliminating” it.\n\nThat is why, even after the Republicans\' victory last week in Florida in a closely watched special House election fought largely over Obamacare, normally cautious GOP political consultants are recommending that House Republicans develop a health care agenda they can campaign on. One GOP strategist focused on House races said Republicans don\'t need to pass legislation, but need to be able to tell voters what they would put in place of Obamacare.\n\n“The priority for us, our candidates and especially our members is that they have the ability to talk about what they’re for when it comes to health care,” the strategist said. “Democrats saying we would put the insurance companies back in charge has the capability to resonate.""', 'House Republican leaders are committed to passing an Obamacare alternative before the November elections, but even proponents of the effort are skeptical that it will produce anything beyond a set of policy principles.\nRank-and-file House Republicans are doubtful Cantor will achieve much more than that before Nov. 4.\nContributing to the skepticism that a sweeping Obamacare alternative will receive a floor vote is the heated political season — now fully underway — and House Republicans’ recent history of repeated failures to unify behind big-ticket legislation.\nHalf of the House majority is aligned with leadership and supports passing a comprehensive alternative to the Affordable Care Act before the Nov. 4 elections.\nTo win seats, House Republicans believe they must pair their criticism with a proactive health care agenda of their own.']"

Please listen carefully,” a male voice said in a recording of the call provided to CTNewsJunkie.com.\n\nThe next voice in the recording is Mayor Toni Harp, a former state lawmaker who once chaired the Medicaid Managed Care Council and worked for two decades as a healthcare administrator.\n\n“Hi, this is Mayor Toni Harp and I want to provide you with some important information about signing up for health insurance. There are free health insurance enrollment events every week in the city of New Haven where you will be able to meet one-on-one with trained and certified individuals who can answer questions and enroll you and your family in health care coverage,” Harp said in the recording. “The Access Health CT open enrollment period officially closes on March 31st. After March 31st you will be eligible to apply for health insurance through Access Health CT only if you have changes in your personal circumstances, or if you qualify for HUSKY.”\n\nHUSKY is the name for the state’s Medicaid program for low-income families and children.\n\nNo one has criticized Harp’s decision to use the reverse-dial phone system to warn of the end of the enrollment period.\n\nLaurence Grotheer, Harp’s spokesman, said Sunday that the Everbridge phone system is the same one used to give residents information about parking bans and plowing schedules following winter storms.\n\n“It’s consistent with the city’s policy to use the telephone tree,” he said.\n\nAs far as the message is concerned, “the mayor believes it’s in the best interest of residents to avail themselves of healthcare coverage that’s now available.”\n\nIn the recorded message, Harp went on to give the city of New Haven website address and the phone number for New Haven’s Public Health Department. The New Haven Public Health Department is an Access Health CT navigator and received funding to guide people through the process of signing up for Obamacare. Access Health CT, the quasi-public agency that manages Connecticut’s insurance exchange, also opened up a storefront in New Haven where people can go to get help with the enrollment process.\n\nAccess Health CT planned to spend $15 million on a marketing and advertising campaign to make sure everyone who qualifies enrolls in the program before the March 31 deadline.\n\nWhat Harp doesn’t mention in her call is the tax penalty imposed on those who don’t have health insurance coverage either through the exchange or outside the exchange before March 31.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters Friday, Access Health CT CEO Kevin Counihan stressed that the penalty will be 1 percent of an individual’s adjust gross income or $95 at the minimum.\n\nThose who don’t get coverage on March 31st can still apply through the exchange to get an exemption. There’s exemptions for Native Americans, religious exemptions, and other hardship provisions under the Affordable Care Act. Those who would have to pay 8.5 percent of their monthly income on health insurance, even with the subsidy, are excused from having to purchase it.\n\n“They are the only way other than getting coverage to avoid a tax penalty,” Chad Booker, a policy analyst with Access Health CT, said.\n\nThose who get insurance before March 31 either inside or outside of the exchange will avoid tax penalties, even if they didn’t have coverage for the first part of 2014.\n\nThe percent of uninsured residents in New Haven was about 14 percent in 2010, which is higher than the statewide average of about 8 or 9 percent. However, it’s unclear how many of those uninsured received coverage through the exchange since that’s not one of the questions on the application.\n\nAs of March 9, Access Health CT had exceeded its enrollment expectations and had signed up more than 150,000 individuals to plans in the exchange and Medicaid since Oct. 1 of last year.', '“The Access Health CT open enrollment period officially closes on March 31st.\nThe New Haven Public Health Department is an Access Health CT navigator and received funding to guide people through the process of signing up for Obamacare.\nAccess Health CT planned to spend $15 million on a marketing and advertising campaign to make sure everyone who qualifies enrolls in the program before the March 31 deadline.\nIn a conference call with reporters Friday, Access Health CT CEO Kevin Counihan stressed that the penalty will be 1 percent of an individual’s adjust gross income or $95 at the minimum.\n“They are the only way other than getting coverage to avoid a tax penalty,” Chad Booker, a policy analyst with Access Health CT, said.']"

It turns out the Republicans didn't have to trouble themselves with their attempts to repeal it, because the Obama administration's politically and ideologically motivated actions have emasculated the Democrats' purported health care reform law.\n\nThe deadline to sign up for some kind of medical bill payment program is still two weeks away, but it is already obvious to anyone who has been paying attention that the Affordable Care Act — the inaccurate euphemism by which Obamacare is often known — is a complete failure and will never be enacted.\n\nIt’s not the Republican Party’s steadfast opposition that led to Obamacare’s demise, though. It turns out the Republicans didn’t have to trouble themselves with their attempts to repeal it, because the Obama administration’s politically and ideologically motivated actions have emasculated the Democrats’ purported health care reform law.\n\nAlmost as soon as the Democrats passed the bill so we could find out what was in it, the Obama administration began to grant waiver after waiver to various groups and organizations, usually (and not coincidentally) elements of the Democratic Party’s coalition.\n\nThen came the stupendously disastrous rollout of the federal government’s Obamacare website.\n\nThen came the wave of insurance policy cancellations, leading to the revelation that when Obama repeatedly said, “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,” he was knowingly, deliberately lying. To be sure, that shouldn’t have been a revelation to anyone who was paying attention or anyone who is wise to the ways of politicians, but most people don’t pay attention and aren’t as wise to politicians’ ways as they should be (or as they may think they are).\n\nThat was followed by another waiver — one that potentially could gut the law: In some cases, people would be allowed to ask their insurance providers if they can have their old, superior policies back, even though their old policies don’t comply with Obamacare’s requirements.\n\nAmong the other waivers granted by the Obama administration, the “employer mandate” to provide staff with at least basic coverage or face a fine has been delayed, and those whose plans were canceled will be temporarily exempt from the “individual mandate” to purchase health insurance.\n\nInitially the exemption would have expired in September this year, but the White House was not about to let that happen right before midterm elections in which ObamaDebacle is expected to help the Republicans pick up Senate seats and perhaps win back control of Congress.\n\nAnd so, early this month, came another waiver. A really big one — so big, it wasn’t even announced.\n\nNow some people will be allowed to renew their non-compliant policies until 2016, by which time the president will be preparing to leave the White House and will no longer have to worry about the political consequences of this rotten law. Millions of Americans will be allowed to avoid paying the individual mandate penalty by claiming that the cancellation of their policies constitutes “hardship.”\n\nWhen news of this serious revision of the Obamacare law finally got out last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius initially testified before the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday that the reports were “not accurate” … only to backtrack and concede that the reports were accurate after all. (In that, she at least shows herself to be more honorable and honest than Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who still has not retracted his claim that all of the insurance cancellation horror stories that the press has been reporting are fake.)\n\nWhat makes this latest Obamacare waiver such a big deal is that Obamacare simply doesn’t work without the individual mandate — unless nearly everyone is forced to either buy extremely expensive health insurance or sign up for welfare, the entire system breaks down. To pay the high medical costs of those who are high-risk, such as those with preexisting conditions, and to pay for all of the “free” contraceptive and abortifacient drugs and procedures, insurance companies need everyone to buy their health plans. Once you start exempting millions of Americans who otherwise would have had to comply with the new law, it all falls apart.\n\nThus, we find ourselves watching the insane spectacle of the president effectively repealing and delaying the individual mandate while threatening to veto any bill that repeals or delays the individual mandate.\n\nHere’s what I want to know: If the powers that be never had any real intention of enacting and enforcing this monstrosity of a law, why did they bother to foist it on an unwilling populace in the first place? They could have saved us, and our employers and insurance providers a lot of trouble.\n\nUnless a lot of trouble was the whole point all along?\n\nCommunity editor Jared Olar may be reached at 346-1111, ext. 660, or at jolar@pekintimes.com.

You\'re exempt.\n\nDid you recently get a shut-off notice from a utility company? You\'re exempt, too.\n\nHave you been evicted, been a victim of domestic violence or had your home damaged by fire? Those get you off the health-insurance hook, too.\n\nBut wait, there\'s more -- and some of these ""hardship exemptions"" are pretty broad.\n\nFor example, if you\'re among the several thousand Montanans who had their health insurance canceled within the past six months because it didn\'t comply with Affordable Care Act minimum standards and you can\'t find another plan you consider affordable, you\'re exempt from the mandate.\n\nJoe Balyeat , state director of Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group that opposes the ACA, has been traveling the state in recent weeks giving presentations on elements of the law.\n\nPart of his presentation focuses on the 14 hardship exemptions identified by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and how they\'re greatly open to interpretation.\n\n""We\'re treading new ground here,"" said Balyeat, a former state legislator who\'s also an accountant. ""As a practicing accountant, I don\'t know if the IRS ( Internal Revenue Service ) is going to play hardball or, if you submit documentation, will give everyone approval.\n\n""If I had to bet, I\'d bet they would give approval to the majority of them, but we don\'t know.""\n\nThe tax penalty this year is $95 per adult in a household, $47.50 per child, or 1 percent of your household income -- whichever is higher. It increases next year.\n\nOne exemption to the tax penalty applies to as many as 50,000 people in Montana : Those earning less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level ( $11,670 for a single person) and who don\'t qualify for Medicaid .\n\nThis group was supposed to be covered by an expansion of Medicaid , as part of the ACA, but the U.S. Supreme Court made that expansion optional for the states, and Montana\'s 2013 Legislature rejected the expansion.\n\nFederal health officials decided that in states where Medicaid wasn\'t expanded, those earning less than 100 percent of the poverty level can be exempt from the insurance-purchasing mandate.\n\nAnother exemption category said merely that ""you experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance,"" and to ""please submit documentation if possible.""\n\nBalyeat said these broad exemptions could be good news for Montanans who don\'t want to buy health insurance. But it also undercuts a fundamental ACA premise, which is that everyone is supposed to pay into the health insurance system to make it financially sound, he added.\n\n""There are so many instances (in the law) where you solve one problem but create another,"" he said. ""I won\'t hide the fact that I think Obamacare is a bad idea. It\'s just not going to work.""\n\n___\n\n(c)2014 The Montana Standard (Butte, Mont.)\n\nVisit The Montana Standard (Butte, Mont.) at www.mtstandard.com\n\nDistributed by MCT Information Services', 'The tax penalty this year is $95 per adult in a household, $47.50 per child, or 1 percent of your household income -- whichever is higher.\nAnother exemption category said merely that ""you experienced another hardship in obtaining health insurance,"" and to ""please submit documentation if possible.""\nBalyeat said these broad exemptions could be good news for Montanans who don\'t want to buy health insurance.\n___(c)2014 The Montana Standard (Butte, Mont.)\nVisit The Montana Standard (Butte, Mont.)']"

We joined millions of other Americans whose individual market health plans died after Democrats lied about our ability to keep the plans and doctors we liked.\n\nAs I reported last fall, our letter from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado informed us that we could no longer keep our high-deductible PPO plan with a wide doctor network because of “changes from health care reform (also called the Affordable Care Act).” The ObamaCare engineers determined that the affordable plan we liked was “substandard,” forcing us to enter the ObamaCare health insurance exchange, purchase a severely limited HMO plan or seek some other alternative in the shrinking private marketplace.\n\nWe reluctantly took steps to sign up with the exchange, spending hours on Colorado’s busted website, hours on the phone with shady reps and weeks waiting for some proof that we were, in fact, “enrolled.”\n\nThen, a few months later, we received another letter from Anthem informing us that we could keep our current plan until November 2014. We signed a form stating that we wanted to do so and took steps to cancel our pending ObamaCare enrollment. Next, we got another letter stating that our current Anthem plan would be canceled on May 1, 2014.\n\nThen President Obama announced by administrative fiat that we could keep our plan for another two years.\n\nSimple question: Will our plan be canceled on May 1 or will we have it for another two years?\n\nWe called the number on our Anthem health insurance card. Nobody picked up the phone after waiting on hold for nearly an hour.\n\nSecond try: Twenty minutes on hold. Then, we were transferred to another number. Another 20-minute wait. Finally, a human being came on the line. After explaining our situation and posing our simple question, the rep put us on hold again. The eventual answer: He didn’t know.\n\nAfter taking special note of our lengthy correspondence file, the rep then proceeded to give us the same number we had initially contacted in the first place.\n\nThe left will blame the insurance companies, as always. But at the center of the current mess are Obama’s desperate and now almost weekly Democrat face-saving decrees to “fix” a fundamentally broken government racket. Half of the nation’s state insurance commissioners rejected the original “fix” for noncompliant plans last fall. Several still haven’t made decisions on that first “fix,” let alone the new fixes for 2015 or 2016.\n\nWhile the White House and Hollywood propagandists push aggressively for Americans to “Get Covered” and get enrolled in government-sponsored care before the March 31 open-enrollment deadline, millions of us are in bureaucratic limbo trying to get answers about the changes, the changes to the changes, and the changes to the changes to the changes to the private plans we liked and didn’t want to leave in the first place.\n\nA former ObamaCare policy adviser sheepishly concluded to The Washington Post: “I broadly view the administrative delays as a pragmatic realization that it is actually harder to do some of these things in reality than we thought when we put it down on paper.”\n\nNo kidding, genius.\n\nMichelle Malkin is the author of “Culture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies” (Regnery 2009).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"", 'Back in September, my family received an ObamaCare-induced health insurance death notice.\nWe joined millions of other Americans whose individual market health plans died after Democrats lied about our ability to keep the plans and doctors we liked.\nWe signed a form stating that we wanted to do so and took steps to cancel our pending ObamaCare enrollment.\nNext, we got another letter stating that our current Anthem plan would be canceled on May 1, 2014.\nWe called the number on our Anthem health insurance card.']"

They won the election and proceeded to make it worse, until now Obamacare is the central political issue of our time.\n\nThey promised that you could keep your doctor, that you could keep a plan you liked. They lied.\n\nHealth insurance is even less affordable than it was. Access to healthcare is more difficult, and the quality of healthcare is declining. Doctors and hospitals are finding that they cannot continue to operate under the restrictions of the new law.\n\nThe radical left has been engaged in a campaign of distraction over “income inequality,” their latest plan to transform America from a constitutional republic to a socialist oligarchy. Unfortunately for them, our health and how we obtain healthcare are issues that touch us all.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know people who have been harmed by the Obamacare law. They are not theories or hypothetical cases, but real, live people. Here are the stories of just a few.\n\nThe small business owner\n\nHer employees were being shuffled onto an Obamacare plan where they would lose their vision and dental coverage. Deductibles would triple from $2100 per year to $6500. Copays would go from $50 to over $200. Premiums were to go up by 20 percent for this far worse coverage.\n\nThen Obama announced you could go back to your old plan. How is this legal, even if the insurance company would take you back?\n\nShe called the insurance company back. They said that her company could get the old plan back — for the 20 percent increase — but the owner had to act by close of business the next day and get everyone and the company to fill out all new paperwork and reapply since it would be a “new” policy.\n\nHer next hurdle is the rule which states that if the employer is not on the same plan, there may be a penalty of $50 per day per employee….or is it $100? The rules are still being written. The employer is currently on her spouse’s plan.\n\nThe retired veterinarian\n\nAfter having the same medical insurance plan through the American Veterinary Medical Association for 31 years for himself and his disabled daughter, he received a cancellation letter in December 2012 stating that they could not find an underwriter due requirements in the Affordable Healthcare Act. His wife still has Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance through the local school district even though she is retired. They were able to get on her policy. The two plans are very similar as the school district has no mandate — for now.\n\nRetired state civil servant\n\nHis state retirement fully covers medical for him and his family until he becomes 65; then Medicare becomes primary and his insurance secondary. In his state, there is a shortage of doctors and they can’t afford to see even long-time patients any more after they become Medicare eligible.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis wife is self-employed and he wonders how a person can be self-employed and pay income tax, 15.3 percent Social Security and Medicare taxes both as employer and employee, pay for medical coverage, and also contribute to some kind of retirement plan. He doesn’t see how small and sole-proprietor businesses make it — and many don’t.\n\nMedical student\n\nAnother friend’s son turned 26 last year. He is in medical school. When he applied for health insurance he estimated he would make $16,000 a year. His premium is $40 a month. Preventative care is free. He got a good deal because of the Affordable Care Act, but it’s a subsidy. Universities used to provide affordable health insurance policies. Not now.\n\nAn employee\n\nHe is still working for one reason: health insurance. Going through the government is hell, prices are jacked to a level almost no one who works can afford. Even though the company he works for got an exemption this year, he may have to pay the full cost of his coverage next year. He hopes this nightmare ends soon.\n\nAnother worker\n\nHis family’s insurance premium has tripled with their new policy; the policy they wanted to keep was canceled. Their deductible is double what it was. Even worse, when his wife sees a doctor now, they say she has no insurance. “We are so sick of this.”\n\nThat’s just a cross-section of the many stories I have heard. We all have these stories and we must keep them in the forefront of our minds. We’re not the liars here: Harry Reid and Barack Obama are.\n\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ixNPplo-SU[/youtube]\n\nThis experiment in government control of healthcare is incompatible with American values and beliefs. It will fail, one way or the other. The politicians aren’t going to save either us or the system. The only way to fix the problems that they have made for us is for We the People to stand up as we did in 2009 and 2010 and finish the job.', 'COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., March 16, 2014 — During the 2008 presidential campaign, Democrats made an issue of the rising cost of health insurance.\nAccess to healthcare is more difficult, and the quality of healthcare is declining.\nHow is this legal, even if the insurance company would take you back?\nWhen he applied for health insurance he estimated he would make $16,000 a year.\nUniversities used to provide affordable health insurance policies.']"

16097,http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2014/03/16/shhh-the-secret-that-slashes-health-costs/,business,"['The Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment period is quickly winding down and millions of uninsured continued to be bombarded with philosophical arguments about whether to enroll or forgo ACA-mandated coverage. But lost in a lot of the political rhetoric is a simple fact about being covered:\n\nWhen you have health insurance, you save money every time you seek care – even if you never meet your deductible – because of an often-overlooked benefit of being insured. It’s called negotiated discount rates.\n\nIn its simplest terms, it means anyone who’s insured does not pay full price. I was reminded of this feature when I received my first Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the insurance plan I chose from my state exchange after my yearly oncologist visit in February.\n\nMany of us might not consider something called the “allowed amount” or “negotiated discounts” when we purchase insurance. But what this benefit means is that a healthcare provider or facility may list what it “charges” for the services. However, because that provider or facility has agreed to be part of an insurance network, the provider and/or facility have agreed to accept a discounted amount for their services. Without insurance one would pay the “sticker price” from the provider or facility.\n\nFor example, let’s look at two of my EOBs. One was for $435 of laboratory tests ordered by my oncologist. One column on the EOB lists each test and their full cost. In the next column it lists “amount allowed”-that which the lab has agreed to accept as the payment for those tests because of the insurance plan I chose. The “allowed amount” on the full price of $435 was $137.72, meaning that by being part of an insurance network, I did not have to pay an additional $297.28 for those tests. Had I had no insurance, my “total amount owed” column would have been $435.\n\nCharges for my bone scan totaled $1,101.00. Again, because I had insurance coverage, the total reimbursement the facility would see was calculated to be $477.21. Thus, I saved $623.79 because I was part of an insurance plan. Had I been uninsured, I would have been on point to pay the full price. The same principle applies to any prescription drug benefit. With an insurance plan that also has a prescription drug benefit – a standard could be a copay of $10 for generics and $75 for brand drugs – full out-of-pocket costs are reduced, sometimes dramatically.\n\nThis is not a column to debate the pros and cons of how we calculate charges for health care services. Rather it’s intended to be a reminder that when someone is insured they save money because they are part of an insurance system that has negotiated rates with health care providers and facilities.\n\nIt’s a simple fact that often is overlooked, underreported, or not clearly understood. But it is something that can have a real impact on pocketbooks across the nation as individuals decide whether to purchase insurance as part of the ACA.\n\nMany factors go into an individual’s decision on whether to purchase health insurance or not. As the days dwindle for those currently uninsured to be able to sign up for coverage, the best advice still remains: talk to someone who understands the health care system.\n\nWith the enrollment deadline approaching, a discussion with a licensed, ACA-certified insurance agent – or even a knowledgeable navigator – would be a wise move. Make sure you know what all your options are, where your savings come from when you purchase insurance, and how you can position yourself to take the best care of your health and the charges associated with it.\n\nJoanne Boyer is author/editor of Wisdom of Progressive Voices, a book chronicling our progressive heritage through biographies and quotes from some of the most famous voices of the American Progressive Movement. She blogs at www.wisdomvoices.com.', 'Many of us might not consider something called the “allowed amount” or “negotiated discounts” when we purchase insurance.\nThus, I saved $623.79 because I was part of an insurance plan.\nThis is not a column to debate the pros and cons of how we calculate charges for health care services.\nMany factors go into an individual’s decision on whether to purchase health insurance or not.\nAs the days dwindle for those currently uninsured to be able to sign up for coverage, the best advice still remains: talk to someone who understands the health care system.']"

16104,http://www.fool.com/financial-advice/2014/03/16/can-you-afford-to-retire-early-because-of-obamacar.aspx,business,"[""Studying the long-term effects of the Affordable Care Act, the Congressional Budget Office recently projected a drop in hours worked equivalent to having 2 million fewer full-time workers in the workplace in 2017. Several factors play into this forecast, but one major driver is the flexibility offered by available affordable health insurance. So how will the new law affect your ability to retire early?\n\nYou may be eligible for deeply discounted health insurance\n\nInsurance premiums for older men and women are expected to drop by 19% and 32%, respectively, under the Affordable Care Act, according to a recent study. This will decrease the amount of out-of-pocket premium dollars this population will need to spend on health insurance, meaning they will need less money to cover health expenditures.\n\nFurthermore, health insurance companies are no longer allowed to refuse coverage or increase premiums based on pre-existing conditions or the age of the enrollee. Before the ACA, many Americans needed the insurance benefits offered through their work -- and therefore stuck with a full-time job. But if health insurance is available at a lower cost, older Americans could choose to retire and purchase coverage through the exchanges.\n\nPremium costs are expected to drop thanks to tax credits -- essentially discounts on monthly premiums. Enrollees can qualify for tax credits based on their family size and income, and this may allow them to work less or not at all. The ability to purchase affordable health insurance is not the only reason people may consider working less: Premium costs decrease as income decreases, so there is an incentive to work less and therefore to earn less. The regulations for the 48 contiguous states are:\n\n$11,490 to $45,960 for individuals\n\n$15,510 to $62,040 for a family of 2\n\n$19,530 to $78,120 for a family of 3\n\n$23,550 to $94,200 for a family of 4\n\n$27,570 to $110,280 for a family of 5\n\n$31,590 to $126,360 for a family of 6\n\n$35,610 to $142,440 for a family of 7\n\n$39,630 to $158,520 for a family of 8\n\nCommunity rating restrictions require health insurance providers to offer policies to their costliest beneficiaries at no more than three times what they charge to their least-costly ones -- regardless of health status. As a result, older Americans will, on average, see a 13% drop in their premiums -- as opposed to a 75% spike in costs for the youngest group of insured Americans.\n\nThis drop in cost for older Americans may mean less of a need for employer-based insurance, less money needed in their 401(k) accounts, and, therefore, less time spent in the workforce.\n\nFor example, using the Covered California shop-and-compare tool, a couple in San Francisco, both age 55 and with a household income of $60,000, could find bronze coverage for $2 per month after premium tax credits. While not all prices are so low, this exemplifies just how affordable some plans can be.\n\nMedicaid expansion may be your ticket\n\nMedicaid is expanding in some states, and this expansion will cover a group of newly eligible individuals: people between 19 and 65 who have an income below 138% of the federal poverty level ($15,856 this year for a single person), meet citizenship requirements, are not incarcerated, and do not qualify for Medicare.\n\nThe expansion of Medicaid benefits is made possible through federal funding mandated by the ACA, and will result in a having higher number of Americans qualify for additional health-care benefits -- making early retirement possible for some. Beware, though, that Medicaid expansion has not been approved in all states. You can find information about your state here.\n\nSome important care is now free\n\nMarketplace insurance plans cover a set of free preventive health benefits that are not subject to a copayment or deductible. Certain tests and screenings have specific criteria based on health and age, and some may be more applicable than others, so don't worry about getting every screening just because it's free. There are some screenings that everyone should consider getting, and women have an additional set of benefits to take advantage of. While these free benefits are an exciting part of the Affordable Care Act, know that they are free only when performed by an in-network provider.\n\nlink"", 'Several factors play into this forecast, but one major driver is the flexibility offered by available affordable health insurance.\nThis will decrease the amount of out-of-pocket premium dollars this population will need to spend on health insurance, meaning they will need less money to cover health expenditures.\nFurthermore, health insurance companies are no longer allowed to refuse coverage or increase premiums based on pre-existing conditions or the age of the enrollee.\nBefore the ACA, many Americans needed the insurance benefits offered through their work -- and therefore stuck with a full-time job.\nBut if health insurance is available at a lower cost, older Americans could choose to retire and purchase coverage through the exchanges.']"

It’s WellPoint’s only rival: Maine Community Health Options, a startup that didn’t exist three years ago.\n\nThe newcomer, funded primarily by taxpayer money lent under the U.S. health-care law, has won about 80 percent of the market so far in Maine’s new insurance exchange, exceeding its own expectations, said Kevin Lewis, the CEO.\n\nAdditional Photos The Maine Community Health Options co-op occupies a refurbished mill in Lewiston. Funded primarily by taxpayer money lent under the U.S. health-care law, it has won about 80 percent of the market in Maine’s new insurance exchange. Telegram File Photo/Gordon Chibroski\n\nHealth law opponents predicted early on that insurance co-ops created by the law would fail, and that much of the $2.1 billion they were loaned to get started would be lost. Instead, the 23 co-ops that now exist nationally have enrolled about 300,000 people in health plans by combining low premiums with a certain homespun appeal, according to company executives.\n\n“We’re doing really well,” Lewis said in a telephone interview. Taxpayers face “no risk whatsoever” that Maine Community will go under, he said. “A lot of those early, dire concerns just need to be re-examined.”\n\nKristin Binns, a spokeswoman for Indianapolis, Ind.-based WellPoint, declined to comment on her company’s co-op competition.\n\nThe 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act refers to these new companies as “Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans,” or co-ops. To be sure, not all of them have thrived. Some, such as Maryland’s, have struggled to sign people up because of problems with their state’s exchange while others, including Michigan’s, have set premiums too high.\n\nThe successful co-ops “emerged as price leaders,” responsible for more than a third of the lowest-premium plans offered on U.S. exchanges, according to an October report by McKinsey & Co. consultants.\n\nExecutives from these nonprofit groups in part credit innovative benefit designs, including features that offer free doctors’ visits and generic drugs, and even $100 gift cards for people who get an annual physical. In Wisconsin, many customers of Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative appreciate the company’s nonprofit, member-governed business model, CEO Bob DeVita said.\n\n“There’s a long-standing upper Midwest tradition with co- ops,” DeVita said in a telephone interview. “I think there was a lot of pent-up demand for that.”\n\nIn Windsor Heights, Iowa, 35-year-old Geoffrey Wood, the chief operating officer of Startup Genome, said he signed on for the state’s co-op, CoOportunity Health, because he had grown tired of dealing with his previous insurer, Aetna Inc.’s subsidiary Coventry Health Care Inc.\n\n“Given the choice between them, as the incumbent company, and an innovative company trying to do something different, I didn’t feel like I had much choice,” Wood said in a telephone interview. “I decided to give the new guy a shot.”\n\nCynthia Michener, an spokeswoman for Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna, said Coventry’s advantages for enrollees include experience with the Iowa health-care system and stability.\n\n“Coventry Health Care has served Iowans for more than two decades, and knows the community and its health-care needs well,” Michener said in an email. “We have long-standing experience of providing health insurance and benefits and helping members access care, and a track record of financial stability to pay claims.”\n\nAbout 4 million Americans have signed up for private health plans using new marketplaces created by the law, the U.S. government says. The Congressional Budget Office projects 6 million will enroll this year, a reduction of 1 million from estimates before the troubled introduction of the law began in October.\n\nIt hasn’t been a smooth road for some of the co-ops. The computer bugs and errors that prevented many Americans from signing up for coverage in October and November took a toll and, in some states, the startups continue to struggle.\n\nCo-ops in Maryland, Oregon and Massachusetts, for instance, haven’t hit their target enrollments because their state-run exchanges still aren’t functioning well. And Vermont’s co-op dissolved in September, returning its federal solvency loans, after state regulators denied it an insurance license, saying the company’s enrollment expectations were unrealistic and its proposed rates weren’t competitive.\n\nAlong with Maine, co-ops have attained large market share in New York, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, Kentucky, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Utah, Montana, Nevada and New Mexico, said John Morrison, a board member and founding president of the co-op trade group, and other executives.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.', 'Additional Photos The Maine Community Health Options co-op occupies a refurbished mill in Lewiston.\nFunded primarily by taxpayer money lent under the U.S. health-care law, it has won about 80 percent of the market in Maine’s new insurance exchange.\nTelegram File Photo/Gordon ChibroskiHealth law opponents predicted early on that insurance co-ops created by the law would fail, and that much of the $2.1 billion they were loaned to get started would be lost.\nInstead, the 23 co-ops that now exist nationally have enrolled about 300,000 people in health plans by combining low premiums with a certain homespun appeal, according to company executives.\n“Coventry Health Care has served Iowans for more than two decades, and knows the community and its health-care needs well,” Michener said in an email.']"

16133,http://www.craigdailypress.com/news/2014/mar/14/thinking-about-health-tax-penalties-await-those-wh/,business,"['The day of reckoning is coming for the Affordable Care Act, widely called Obamacare. March 31, the day nearly every American is supposed to have health insurance, is fast approaching. And judging from the government’s February enrollment numbers, many uninsured people still have not signed up.\n\nWhile these numbers surely will be higher by the end of March, it’s a safe bet that millions still will be without coverage and subject to a tax penalty for failing to buy a policy.\n\nThe idea behind the Affordable Care Act was to bring health insurance to more Americans but not through a universal national health system like other countries have, where everyone is covered as a matter of right. Instead, Congress wanted to give more Americans the right to buy an insurance policy on the private market. After March 31, nearly everyone will be required to have insurance through Medicare, Medicaid, an employer, the military or a state shopping exchange.\n\nTo make this private market work and keep premiums reasonably low, insurance companies needed a good mix of healthy and sick people. If there were too many sick people and not enough healthy ones enrolled, insurers wouldn’t collect enough in premiums to pay for the claims of those who had high medical expenses. As a result, insurance companies would raise their rates, and premiums would go through the proverbial roof.\n\nTo solve that problem, everyone is required to have insurance or pay a tax penalty, which kicks in next year unless Congress delays it. The House of Representatives voted to do that last week, but its bill has no chance of becoming law because the Senate won’t pass a similar bill, and the president would veto it anyway.\n\nThe penalty is pretty weak, and it may not be big enough to make everyone buy coverage. For some families, it might be cheaper to pay the penalty and skip the insurance. Of course, they won’t have any insurance protection if they do that.\n\nWhat exactly is the penalty? Like most things in the Affordable Care Act, even the penalty is not straightforward. For the first year, it’s $95 for each adult in a family up to $285, or 1 percent of family income. The penalty increases each year until it reaches $695 per person or 2.5 percent of family income in 2016 and afterwards.\n\nWhen the penalty is fully phased in, here’s how it will work: one full penalty per each adult in the family and an additional half-an-adult penalty per child. The penalty cannot exceed $2,085 if it’s assessed as a flat rate. If it’s a percentage of income, it can’t exceed the cost of a bronze plan, the cheapest type of policy sold in the exchange.\n\nBut the tax penalty assessed through your income taxes may not be the biggest tax surprise. The subsidies Congress made available to coax families with low and moderate incomes to buy expensive health insurance have a pretty big string attached. It’s called the “clawback,” and very few consumers who’ve received a subsidy through a state exchange know what can happen. Health researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, UCLA and the Economic Policy Institute estimated that nearly 40 percent of families might be affected by the clawback.\n\nHow does the clawback work? A family’s subsidy is based on last year’s tax return. When they apply for a subsidy, the family must make its best guess about their income for the current year. That may be tough for self-employed people or those with seasonal jobs. If the family’s income increases during the year the family receives its subsidy — say a family member gets a raise — they will have to pay back some of the subsidy they’ve received.\n\nTheir tax return will show they owe the government money it paid the insurance company on their behalf, and families will have to dig into their pockets to pay it back. The money will be “clawed back” to the government.\n\nThis arrangement also might work in a family’s favor. If their subsidy turns out to be too low relative to their income for the year, say if a family member lost a job, then the family’s next tax return will show a tax refund.\n\nWhat’s the backstory? When the law was written, Congress had to find a way to pay for the subsidies and needed to raise money from other sources in the federal budget. One way was to raise some $22 billion by requiring small firms to report more of their business transactions. They complained, and Congress chose to make up the lost revenue from the very people who received subsidies in the first place.\n\nTimothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University, summed up the dilemma: “Many Americans are going to be shocked to discover when they figure up their taxes at the end of the year that what they thought was a grant (to help pay their premiums) was in fact a loan.”\n\nThe Rural Health News Service is funded by a grant from the Commonwealth Fund and distributed through the Nebraska Press Association Foundation, the Colorado Press Association and the South Dakota Newspaper Association.', 'March 31, the day nearly every American is supposed to have health insurance, is fast approaching.\nThe idea behind the Affordable Care Act was to bring health insurance to more Americans but not through a universal national health system like other countries have, where everyone is covered as a matter of right.\nTo solve that problem, everyone is required to have insurance or pay a tax penalty, which kicks in next year unless Congress delays it.\nFor the first year, it’s $95 for each adult in a family up to $285, or 1 percent of family income.\nBut the tax penalty assessed through your income taxes may not be the biggest tax surprise.']"

That\'s up from a 20 percent requirement in 2014, the first year of expanded overage under the health care law.\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces, will also take a much more active role in reviewing health plan networks. CMS, which outlined the new standards in a Friday night letter to insurers, will evaluate whether the plans include enough access to hospitals, primary care doctors, mental health providers and oncologists.\n\nThe updated standards came after a Friday interview in which President Barack Obama acknowledged that pressure to keep down costs could mean consumers may not have access to their choice of doctor.\n\n“You may find out that network is more expensive than another network, then you have to make choices in terms of what’s right for your family,” Obama told WebMD. “Do you want to save on costs, or do you want to save on convenience?”\n\nA senior administration official defended the health law’s standards in a Friday afternoon statement.\n\n“What is what true before the health law is true today insurers have always made decisions about which providers and doctors are in their networks – that won’t change,” the official said. “What is different now is the Affordable Care Act marks the first time that federal law requires insurance plans to offer adequate networks of doctors, including mental health practitioners, pharmacies, hospitals, and community providers. Americans can now choose between different types of plans with different networks to find a plan that best meets their needs.”\n\nCMS late Friday night also released a slew of new standards related to the insurance marketplaces, also known as exchanges. For instance, the agency issued new rules related to in-person Obamacare assisters, known as navigators. It also builds on small business insurance marketplaces, which have face several delays in the law\'s rollout.\n\nCMS also said it will excuse insurers\' administrative spending for costs stemming from the failed roll out of Healthcare.gov. The health law requires insurers to provide rebates to customers if they spend more than 20 percent of premium dollars on administrative costs, but CMS says it won\'t count administrative costs related to the enrollment website\'s turbulent launch.', '(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)The Obama administration is requiring health plans in Obamacare insurance marketplaces to include a more robust offering of care providers in 2015 after some early backlash over limited networks in the health care law\'s first year.\nHealth plans selling on the federal marketplaces in 2015 must include 30 percent of area ""essential community providers,"" which are usually health centers and other hospitals serving mostly low-income patients.\nThat\'s up from a 20 percent requirement in 2014, the first year of expanded overage under the health care law.\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the marketplaces, will also take a much more active role in reviewing health plan networks.\nIt also builds on small business insurance marketplaces, which have face several delays in the law\'s rollout.']"

I’m not usually one to dabble in mobile gaming, but I was waiting for my brother to wrap up a doctor’s appointment.\n\nI’m not the only one to give Call of Duty Mobile a try on the go. Activision touted first week numbers for the free-to-play, mobile take on its most popular franchise. 35 million downloads across iOS and Android and it sits at the top #1 app ranking on iOS in more than 100 countries. So yeah, it’s pretty popular.\n\nRob Kostich, Activision’s president, was understandably thrilled. “This is an incredibly fun experience, and we’re only getting started. Congratulations to the teams at Activision and at our partner Tencent’s TiMi Studios for making such a great game for players. And special thanks to our fans for their continued support. There is a ton more to look forward to as we release more content and updates.”\n\nWhen I loaded it up this morning, I was hit with instant nostalgia as the Crash map loaded up. I’m pretty sure I was matched up against bots, but I would be lying if I said I didn’t have fun calling in an airstrike on my phone. Mobile developers definitely know how to get you having fun right off the bat.\n\nControls are the standard fare if you’ve played PUBG or Fortnite on your phone. It’s about as good as you can get with touch controls.\n\nBe prepared to be inundated with prompts about the store and battle pass in your first 20 minutes. Yep, it’s a mobile game. But the microtransactions didn’t seem too crazy. Just the usual cosmetics and a Battle Pass with more cosmetics. It could always be worse on this platform.\n\nI ended up playing it for 30 minutes and would have played it longer, but my brother’s doctor appointment wrapped up. It’ll never replace regular Call of Duty, but I could see myself blowing 10-20 minutes here and there.\n\nI was surprised by how good Call of Duty Mobile looked. Crash took me right back to the Xbox 360 days with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It’s missing some graphical bell and whistles, but it looked good enough for me to lean over and show it to my brother.\n\n35 million downloads might seem like a big number, and it is. But take PUBG Mobile. Back in June, it was revealed the mobile version of the popular BR game reached over 400 million downloads with 50 million active daily players. 35 million is nowhere near the ceiling for Call of Duty mobile. We’ll see how it stacks up against PUBG Mobile and Fortnite in the coming months.\n\n', 'While I’m impatiently waiting for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare to come out later this month, I decided to fire up the recently released Call of Duty Mobile.\nI’m not the only one to give Call of Duty Mobile a try on the go.\nCrash took me right back to the Xbox 360 days with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.\n35 million is nowhere near the ceiling for Call of Duty mobile.\nWe’ll see how it stacks up against PUBG Mobile and Fortnite in the coming months.']"

(HTZ) Tuesday reported a narrower loss for the fourth quarter, as revenues grew about 10 percent mainly due to acquisition of Dollar Thrifty. Both adjusted earnings per share as well as revenues missed analysts\' expectations.\n\nThe firm also forecast adjusted earnings per share for first quarter and full year 2014 below estimates.\n\nSeparately, Hertz said its board approved plans to separate Hertz car and equipment rental businesses into two independent, publicly traded companies. In addition, the board approved a new share repurchase program totaling $1 billion which replaces the existing program.\n\nThe two companies would be \'Hertz,\' comprised of the Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly rental car businesses as well as Donlen, a provider of fleet leasing and management services, and \'HERC,\' the Hertz Equipment Rental Corp.\n\nThe separation is intended to be in the form of a tax-free spin-off to Hertz shareholders. Hertz would receive net cash proceeds from a HERC spin-off of around $2.5 billion, which would be used to pay down Hertz debt and support the newly approved $1 billion share buyback program. The HERC separation is expected to be complete by early 2015.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, net loss attributable to Hertz Global Holdings, Inc., and Subsidiaries\' common stockholders was $0.6 million or break even per share, compared to a loss of $36.8 million or $0.09 per share in the prior year.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings per share totaled $0.26, while the firm posted $0.33 per share a year earlier. On average, 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the company to earn $0.32 per share for the quarter. Analysts\' estimates typically exclude special items.\n\nMark Frissora, CEO said, ""In a difficult fourth quarter, we achieved an adjusted earnings per share of $0.26 despite an estimated $0.12 impact of lower than expected pricing and higher expenses related to carrying extra fleet.""\n\nWorldwide revenues for the quarter grew 10.2 percent to $2.56 billion, but came below analysts\' estimate of $2.62 billion.\n\nU.S. car rental segment revenues increased 14.1 percent to $1.48 billion, mainly due to Dollar Thrifty, which was acquired on November 19, 2012, partially offset by the December 2012 divestiture of Advantage. U.S. off-airport total revenues rose 9.8 percent.\n\nThe U.S. average number of company-operated vehicles was 472,200, an increase of 22.4 percent from a year ago, largely due to the acquisition of Dollar Thrifty.\n\nInternational car rental revenues were $544.2 million, up 5.8 percent from last year. Revenues from worldwide equipment rental were $400.9 million, an increase of 4 percent from last year.\n\nLooking ahead to the first quarter, the company expects adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.09. Analysts project first-quarter earnings of $0.19 per share.\n\nFor full year 2014, the firm anticipates adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.00. Revenues are expected to be between $11.40 billion and $11.70.

The previous owners focused on the cash and the underlying earnings, or EBITDA.\n\n“That’s great, except we’re not just interested in that; we’re interested in growing the business as well,” Murria explains.\n\nSo, while the company has made the usual cost savings that you might expect when integrating an acquisition – human resource and payroll functions, for instance – the money gets ploughed back into areas that will grow the top line, such as sales & marketing and research & development.\n\n“We never buy businesses just to milk them,” Murria declared.\n\nThe City certainly seems on board with the group’s strategy.\n\nN+1 Singer said the interim results came in ahead of its expectations. Revenues of £99.1mln were ahead of the broker’s forecast of £96.5mln and the adjusted EBITDA of £22.9mln was £1.3mln higher than the City firm had been expecting.\n\n“Cash generation was strong (£18.7mln from operations) with net debt at period end of £50.7mln vs. our expectations of £52.3mln,” the broker added.\n\nN+1 Singer reckons “a strong track record of organic growth as well as identifying and integrating complementary acquisitions make current [share price] levels highly attractive. The group has a strong balance sheet and is highly cash generative which should allow it to continue pursuing its strategy for growth. Management continues to execute well and we believe there is room for further value creation.”\n\nAs joint-broker to ASW, N+1 Singer is not an entirely disinterested party, but Panmure Gordon has no affiliation to the company, and it rates the shares a ‘buy’ with a price target of 110p.\n\n“We believe that there is plenty of growth for this business to pursue, with multiple growth opportunities – e.g. shared services deals, cross-selling and mobile solution sales - available to all three operating divisions. Add to this the reassurance of strong management, a high level of recurring revenues (65%) and prodigious cash generation and a FY 2014 enterprise value/EBITDA multiple of 10.7x looks appealing,” the broker said.\n\nShares in ASW currently trade at around 88p."", ""According to chief executive Vin Murria, Advanced Computer Software's ( ) Business Solutions division provides the fuel that keeps the firm motoring.\n“That’s great, except we’re not just interested in that; we’re interested in growing the business as well,” Murria explains.\n“Cash generation was strong (£18.7mln from operations) with net debt at period end of £50.7mln vs. our expectations of £52.3mln,” the broker added.\nThe group has a strong balance sheet and is highly cash generative which should allow it to continue pursuing its strategy for growth.\n“We believe that there is plenty of growth for this business to pursue, with multiple growth opportunities – e.g.""]"

16167,http://www.thestreet.com/story/12533150/1/hertz-revamps-capital-structure-in-equipment-rental-spin.html,business,"['Updated from 1:26 p.m. ET to include closing share prices\n\nNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Hertz (HTZ - Get Report) said Tuesday it will spin off its equipment rental business, Hertz Equipment Rental, in an effort to refocus on the company\'s car rental business. The spinoff of Hertz\' equipment rental business is expected to generate $2.5 billion in cash that will be used to pay down the company\'s debt and support a newly approved $1 billion share repurchase.\n\nOverall, the spinoff may dramatically alter Hertz\' capital structure, putting its leverage in line with competitors, while providing Wall Street with a far more straightforward car rental business. The move also comes as Hertz provided investors with a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2014.\n\nTuesday\'s decision to spin the equipment rental business may help Hertz weather a rough patch in the car rental market, while also insulating the company and its management from activist investors.\n\nHertz\'s newly announced share repurchase could allow the car rental chain to buy back 20% of its outstanding shares, the company said in a Tuesday statement. Hertz also raised the prospect of additional returns of capital to shareholders as a result of the company\'s targeted net debt ratio of 2.5-to-3.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nThose targets indicate Hertz could see its leverage rise from year-end net-debt of 2.9 times EBITDA, putting the company closer in line with Avis Budget (CAR - Get Report). Analysts had forecast Hertz net debt-to-EBITDA could fall in the coming year without a change to its capital planning.\n\n""The actions announced today will create separate companies which we expect to benefit from improved financial profiles that include increased earnings stability and higher returns on capital,"" Mark P. Frissora, CEO of Hertz said in a statement.\n\nEquipment Rental\n\nHertz Equipment Rental may be renamed and will have its own management team after the spinoff. The business generated annual revenues of over $1.5 billion in 2013, with 38% of those sales from construction market, 26% from industrial users, and a further 36% from other markets including niche markets like the energy sector.\n\nAt separation, the business is expected to have net debt of 3.5 times-to-4.0 times 2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nHertz will retain its Donlen fleet leasing business.\n\nHertz and Dollar Thrifty\n\nFor Hertz\'s more well-known car rental business, the spinoff may improve the company\'s cash flow, allowing the company to return capital to shareholders.\n\nThe spinoff may also give investors access to a pure-play car rental business that may be in recovery after the market was dramatically oversupplied in the years since the financial crisis. Consolidation such as Hertz takeover of Dollar Thrifty, and a recovering economy may also allow rental giants like Hertz, Avis Budget (CAR - Get Report) and Enterprise to regain their pricing power.\n\nActivist Investors\n\nIn December, Third Point Management and Corvex Management were reported as having taken stakes in Hertz, in an effort to unlock value at the car rental giant. Those reported investments came after company\'s weak third-quarter results, which caused shares to significantly underperform the S&P 500 in the second half of 2013.\n\nHertz enacted a so-called \'poison pill\' in response to high trading volumes in the company\'s shares and around the time media reports of activist investors surfaced. Third Point repeatedly declined to comment on those reports, and on Tuesday declined to provide any statement.\n\nIn a late December note to clients reacting to those media reports, JPMorgan analyst Kevin Milota said Hertz investors were frustrated the company hadn\'t moved quicker with a sale or spinoff of its capital intensive equipment rental business. Such a transaction could unlock significant free cash flow for Hertz and increase the company\'s strategic focus on the rental car market, Milota said.\n\n""In our view, if HTZ was to exit the equipment rental business, its free cash flow profile would dramatically increase,"" the analyst wrote. JPMorgan estimated Hertz would generate $693 million in 2014 free cash flow and $936 million in 2015.\n\nOn Tuesday, Milota said in a client note ""we believe investors will receive the HERC spin announcement with open arms, offsetting what was otherwise a soft [quarter[ from an operating and full-year 2014 guidance perspective.""\n\nWeak Guidance\n\nHertz on Tuesday said it expected full-year 2014 revenue to be between $11.4-to-$11.7 billion, and EBITDA to be between $2.06 billion-to-$2.42 billion, generally a guidance that was below Wall Street consensus. Earnings per share guidance came in at between $1.70-to-$2.00 a share.\n\nThe lukewarm guidance provided by Hertz management underscores the strategic imperative of streamlining its operations and rejiggering the company\'s capital structure. Those initiatives could help Hertz navigate through supply issues in the car rental industry, for which it is the major culprit.\n\nHertz cited over-fleeting for an especially weak first quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance and said that the issue could be resolved by the end of the quarter, after dragging on earnings through the second half of 2013.\n\nManagement Focus\n\nHertz continues to integrate its acquisition of Dollar Thrifty and will use the equipment rental spin off to quickly pay down debt assumed in the deal. The acquisition culminated a multi-year effort by Hertz to buy its down-market competitor. It may also come to the forefront of Hertz strategy given the company\'s efforts to streamline business lines and re-configure its capital structure towards expanded returns of capital to investors.\n\nWhether Hertz initiates a dividend is still to be seen. Hertz shares fell less than 1% in Tuesday trading, closing at $27.08. Shares have gained over 27% over the past 12-months.\n\n-- Written by Antoine Gara in New York', 'ET to include closing share pricesNEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Hertz (HTZ - Get Report) said Tuesday it will spin off its equipment rental business, Hertz Equipment Rental, in an effort to refocus on the company\'s car rental business.\nTuesday\'s decision to spin the equipment rental business may help Hertz weather a rough patch in the car rental market, while also insulating the company and its management from activist investors.\nHertz\'s newly announced share repurchase could allow the car rental chain to buy back 20% of its outstanding shares, the company said in a Tuesday statement.\n""In our view, if HTZ was to exit the equipment rental business, its free cash flow profile would dramatically increase,"" the analyst wrote.\nThose initiatives could help Hertz navigate through supply issues in the car rental industry, for which it is the major culprit.']"

The car rental firm reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.26 on revenues of $2.56 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the company reported EPS of $0.33 on revenue of $2.32 billion. Fourth-quarter results compare to the Thomson Reuters consensus estimates for EPS of $0.32 and $2.62 billion in revenue.\n\nFor the full year, Hertz reported an EPS of $1.63 on revenues of $10.77 billion, compared with EPS of $1.31 on revenues of $9.02 billion in 2012. The consensus estimate called for EPS $1.70 on revenues of $10.84 billion.\n\nHertz also announced this morning that it will split the company into two pieces. One will be called Hertz and will comprise its car rental business plus its fleet leasing and management services company Donlen. The second piece will consist of its equipment rental company and will be called HERC. The separation is expected to be achieved as a tax-free spin-off of the equipment rental business to Hertz Global shareholders and the company expects the deal to be completed in early 2015.\n\nIt is that spin-off and a new buyback program that drove Hertz Global’s share price higher Tuesday morning, not the paltry results for the quarter or the year. Hertz anticipates net cash of around $2.5 billion as a result of the spin-off, and it will use the cash to pay down debt and support a new $1 billion share repurchase program that the company expects will make most of its purchases following the separation. Hertz said its repurchases could total up to 20% of Hertz’s outstanding shares.\n\nIn its comments on the company’s outlook for 2014, revenues are forecast to rise to a range of $11.4 billion to $11.7 billion, and adjusted EPS is forecast in a range of $1.70 to $2.00. Consensus estimates call for EPS of $2.07 on revenues of $11.6 billion.\n\nThe company’s CEO said:\n\nIn a difficult fourth quarter, we achieved an adjusted earnings per share of $0.26 despite an estimated $0.12 impact of lower than expected pricing and higher expenses related to carrying extra fleet. … We are forecasting Q1 adjusted earnings per share of between $0.07 and $0.09, reflecting the impact, estimated at $0.07 to $0.08 adjusted earnings per share this quarter, of excess U.S. rental car fleet, although we expect fleet levels to be aligned with transaction day growth by the end of this quarter.\n\nShares were up about 3% in premarket trading Tuesday, at $27.99 in a 52-week range of $19.73 to $29.81. Thomson Reuters had a consensus analyst price target of around $30.30 before the results were announced.', 'The car rental firm reported adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.26 on revenues of $2.56 billion.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, the company reported EPS of $0.33 on revenue of $2.32 billion.\nFor the full year, Hertz reported an EPS of $1.63 on revenues of $10.77 billion, compared with EPS of $1.31 on revenues of $9.02 billion in 2012.\nThe second piece will consist of its equipment rental company and will be called HERC.\nIt is that spin-off and a new buyback program that drove Hertz Global’s share price higher Tuesday morning, not the paltry results for the quarter or the year.']"

The FT reported that the auto-rental giant was expected to make the announcement official this week.\n\nThe move has been on the table for some time, as Hertz said it was exploring potential changes to its structure in December. The FT\'s sources put a $4.5 billion price tag on the division.\n\nHertz shares jumped 5.3% to $27.35 in recent trading but should drive higher.\n\nThe news offsets the disappointment surrounding United Rentals \' (URI) acquisition last week of National Pump, which was seen as a potential bidder for HERC. Moreover, MKM Partners analyst Christopher Agnew predicts that the spinoff could ""pre-empt recent presumed activist activity"" by noisy investors like Carl Icahn, who have been clamoring for greater shareholder returns, while also acting as a catalyst for the stock. (See Hot Research, ""Hertz Spinoff Could Head Off Activists,"" Jan. 10.)\n\nWith Hertz reporting fourth-quarter results tomorrow, MKM\'s Agnew suggests that investors take ""advantage of any weakness on or around the quarter."" He notes that ""the outlook for 2014 remains very attractive, in our view, based on industry fundamentals (consolidation/pricing and volumes) and potentially improves on any disappointment as we believe Hertz\'s need to drive pricing will increase.""\n\nMoreover, according to the Manheim Index, released earlier this month, pricing and mileage trends for rental cars are trending positively. ""Hertz continues to increase its use of alternative disposition channels which should provide ongoing structural cost savings,"" notes Wells Fargo analyst Richard Kwas, who reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock.\n\nWith growing demand bumping up against disciplined fleet levels, the balance of power has shifted in rental car companies\' favor. This could continue to be the case this year, boosting free cash flow and earnings.\n\nBarrons.com has been bullish on Hertz before, writing late last year that the market was overreacting to the firm\'s disappointing earnings preannouncement (see Weekday Trader, ""Take Hertz for a Spin,"" Oct. 3, 2013). The shares are up nearly 25% since that call, compared to a single-digit gain for the S&P 500.\n\nAt just over 13 times forward earnings, the stock isn\'t as cheap as it was last autumn. Yet the company has been delivering robust annual double-digit earnings-per-share growth since 2009, a trend projected to continue through 2016.\n\nIn addition, the rally put the stock closer to the valuation of main rival Avis Budget Group (CAR), which has long traded above Hertz, given the lower profitability of construction equipment rentals. The spinoff should allow Hertz to enjoy a plumper valuation. And analysts still expect the stock to climb almost 15%, even after Monday\'s pop.\n\nIn short, Hertz should continue to speed ahead in 2014.\n\nE-mail: teresa.rivas@barrons.com', 'The move has been on the table for some time, as Hertz said it was exploring potential changes to its structure in December.\n(See Hot Research, ""Hertz Spinoff Could Head Off Activists,"" Jan.\nWith Hertz reporting fourth-quarter results tomorrow, MKM\'s Agnew suggests that investors take ""advantage of any weakness on or around the quarter.""\nBarrons.com has been bullish on Hertz before, writing late last year that the market was overreacting to the firm\'s disappointing earnings preannouncement (see Weekday Trader, ""Take Hertz for a Spin,"" Oct. 3, 2013).\nIn short, Hertz should continue to speed ahead in 2014.']"

Now the market is starting to grow again.\n\n“As the year progresses, we would expect the car market continuing to pick up because the economy is starting to move in the right direction,” said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for LMC Automotive. Selling rates in western Europe clawed their way back to mid-2012 levels, he said.\n\n“People are going to feel more confident to make that big-ticket purchase, such as a car, that they’ve been holding off on because of the concerns over their employment prospects and their income,” he said.\n\nAt the Geneva auto show earlier this month, executives said they were encouraged by the recovery in crisis-hit European countries, although they were worried that volatile emerging markets could overshadow the gains.\n\nRegistrations in Germany, the top car market, underperformed the regional trend, with a 4.3 percent increase, and fell by 1.4 percent in Europe’s second-biggest car market, France. But sales grew by double digits in some states most hit by the crisis.\n\nSales grew 17.8 percent in Spain, 40.2 percent in Portugal and 20.6 percent in Ireland, signalling that a fragile recovery in the region was gaining strength. In Italy, the region’s fourth-biggest market, sales grew 8.6 percent as the country recovers from its longest recession in 70 years.\n\n“We keep forecasting an ongoing improvement of the underlying sales trend,” ISI Group said in a note. “In addition, we keep highlighting improved vehicle pricing in tandem with better residual values and sales channel mix.”\n\nSales at Renault Group jumped 11.5 percent, boosted mainly by a 33.6 percent surge in registrations of its no-frills Dacia brand. Ford sales were up 11.3 percent. Toyota Group, the world’s biggest-selling car maker, posted a 14 percent increase, and General Motors saw sales go up 12.3 percent, boosted by a 15.6 percent increase in registrations of its Opel- and Vauxhall-branded vehicles.\n\nGermany’s Volkswagen group, Europe’s biggest carmaker by volume, posted a 7.2 percent rise, helped by a 21.5 increase at its value brand Skoda, a 15.7 percent jump in Seat sales and an 11.8 percent gain at its premium brand, Audi. VW’s performance was weighed down by a 0.8 percent decline in sales at its namesake brand.\n\nFrench carmaker PSA lost some market share in February. Its overall sales grew 3.5 percent, supported by an increase in registrations of its Peugeot brand, but sales of Citroen-branded cars were roughly flat year-on-year.\n\nThe long-awaited revival of the European market seems to be on track, with almost all countries and manufacturers performing better. But industry players urge caution, pointing out the gain comes from historic lows. In Italy, for example, car sales are recovering from levels last seen in the 1970s.\n\n“Sales have effectively been growing, but discounting practices have been following a very similar path, it seems,” Carlos Da Silva, an analyst with market researchers IHS Automotive, said in a note. “This would tend to indicate that the overall situation remains more tense than it might appear.”', 'Registrations in Germany, the top car market, underperformed the regional trend, with a 4.3 percent increase, and fell by 1.4 percent in Europe’s second-biggest car market, France.\nBut sales grew by double digits in some states most hit by the crisis.\nIn Italy, the region’s fourth-biggest market, sales grew 8.6 percent as the country recovers from its longest recession in 70 years.\nThe long-awaited revival of the European market seems to be on track, with almost all countries and manufacturers performing better.\nIn Italy, for example, car sales are recovering from levels last seen in the 1970s.']"

Mr Broadbent, 49, replaces Charles Bean, who is retiring from the central bank after 14 years.\n\n\n\nNemat Shafik, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund and a former senior official at the UK government\'s department for international development, will take up a new role August 1 as the BOE\'s deputy governor for markets and banking.\n\n\n\nMs Shafik, known by her nickname Minouche, will be responsible for reshaping the BOE\'s markets unit after it was hurt by allegations that some of its staff may have known about alleged attempts by bank traders to manipulate foreign-exchange rates. The BOE appointed a senior lawyer to lead a probe into the allegations last week, although an earlier internal investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nAnthony Habgood, chairman of publisher Reed Elsevier, will succeed David Lees on July 1 as chairman of the BOE\'s court, its board of directors, the treasury also said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe appointments come at a crucial time for the BOE. Alongside its role setting interest rates, the central bank was handed new responsibilities to oversee the financial system and police banks last year in a shake-up of financial regulation implemented by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.\n\n\n\nLawmakers on parliament\'s treasury committee, which scrutinises economic policy, have been pushing for a radical overhaul of the storied institution to make senior staff more accountable and reform the BOE\'s old-fashioned governance. A 2012 report into the BOE by Bill Winters, a former investment banker, criticised the central bank\'s ""centralised and hierarchical"" culture, saying it stifled challenges to senior staff\'s views.\n\n\n\nMr Carney is due to announce further details of how the BOE will be reorganised under his watch at a lecture in London later Tuesday. In past testimony to parliament, the governor has signalled that he sees reforming the BOE as a priority of his five-year tenure.\n\n\n\nAlongside the new appointments, the treasury and the BOE said Spencer Dale, the BOE\'s chief economist, and Andrew Haldane, director of its financial stability wing, would swap jobs, with Mr Haldane joining the rate-setting MPC as chief economist and Mr Dale moving off to join the Financial Policy Committee, which tackles risks to the financial system. Paul Fisher, the BOE\'s executive director for markets, will lose his seat on the MPC to Ms Shafik, the BOE said.\n\n\n\nThe changes mean the MPC is getting an influx of new blood before crucial decisions on when to raise interest rates, which analysts said makes it harder to gauge how the MPC will respond if the economy continues to improve.\n\n\n\n""What does all this mean for the direction of policy? Well the truth is it is hard to know, but it certainly adds a degree of raised uncertainty as to how the debate on the MPC will go,"" said David Tinsley, an economist at BNP Paribas.', ""Bank of England leadership shake-upThe UK treasury on Tuesday made three appointments to the Bank of England's top team and shuffled seats on its two policy committees as part of an unprecedented overhaul of the 320-year-old central bank to be unveiled later by Governor Mark Carney.\nMr Broadbent, 49, replaces Charles Bean, who is retiring from the central bank after 14 years.\nAlongside its role setting interest rates, the central bank was handed new responsibilities to oversee the financial system and police banks last year in a shake-up of financial regulation implemented by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.\nIn past testimony to parliament, the governor has signalled that he sees reforming the BOE as a priority of his five-year tenure.\nPaul Fisher, the BOE's executive director for markets, will lose his seat on the MPC to Ms Shafik, the BOE said.""]"

Fisher has been under fire from lawmakers over the BoE’s handling of alleged manipulation of London’s currency market.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter if there was a connection, Carney said the shake-up predated the foreign exchange scandal.\n\n“The Bank needed a pretty major shake-up and it is certainly getting one,” said Jonathan Portes, director of Britain’s National Institute for Economic and Social Research.\n\nPortes said the new appointments should breathe fresh life into the central bank’s macroeconomics team - which had a patchy forecasting record and was too inward-looking - and that Shafik had the right temperament to tackle market abuse.\n\n“She’s pretty tough and at the moment you need someone who is prepared to be fairly tough with the London financial sector,” he said.\n\nBut Domenico Lombardi, a former IMF board member who now works for Canadian think tank CIGI, said: “She will have some catch-up to do, because clearly banking and markets were not at the core of her responsibilities at the IMF.”\n\nNEW DEPUTY GOVERNORS\n\nPrior to Tuesday’s announcement, Carney had overseen the appointment of outsiders to two other top positions at the Bank.\n\nBroadbent was formerly a senior economist at Goldman Sachs - Carney’s employer before he became a central banker. He will succeed Charlie Bean, who retires at the end of June.\n\nBroadbent has said the failure of troubled banks to lend money to more efficient firms is one of the reasons behind Britain’s weak economic productivity since the financial crisis.\n\nShafik - who holds Egyptian, U.S. and British nationality - has a background in development economics, working at the World Bank and as the top civil servant at Britain’s overseas aid department before becoming deputy managing director at the IMF.\n\nShe oversaw much of the IMF’s work in the turnaround programmes for Greece and Portugal, and at the World Bank helped get private money into infrastructure projects.\n\nShafik will be responsible for the BoE’s eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy, under which it amassed 375 billion pounds ($624 billion) of government bonds. She will also steer a review of how the bank gathers intelligence on markets.\n\nSince taking office in July, Carney has been keen to increase the number of women in senior roles at the BoE.\n\nBNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments were a surprise, and would add “a degree of raised uncertainty” about when the central bank would start to lift interest rates from their record low of 0.5 percent.\n\nLittle is known about Shafik or Haldane’s views on monetary policy, though Portes said she had been sympathetic to the IMF’s move away from its highly orthodox policy prescriptions.\n\nBroadbent and Dale both voted against the Bank’s final expansion of asset purchases in July 2012, while Fisher was part of a dovish minority under former governor Mervyn King who wanted more asset purchases up until King’s departure in June.\n\nBroadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor. He will be responsible for the BoE’s analysis of Britain’s economy, as well as bank notes.\n\nBritain’s finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank. Habgood is chairman of brewer Whitbread and publishing company Reed Elsevier .\n\nHabgood succeeds David Lees, whose term expires on July 1.', 'Ben Broadbent, until now an external member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, will step up to become deputy governor for monetary policy.\nThe changes - made by Carney and the government - are part of an overhaul to break down barriers between the Bank’s monetary policy and bank regulation wings after the BoE was given major new supervisory powers in April.\nLittle is known about Shafik or Haldane’s views on monetary policy, though Portes said she had been sympathetic to the IMF’s move away from its highly orthodox policy prescriptions.\nBroadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor.\nBritain’s finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank.']"

Ben Broadbent, already on the monetary policy committee, will take over as a deputy governor from Charlie Bean when he retires this summer. City grandee Anthony Habgood becomes chairman of court at Threadneedle Street, managing the Bank\'s affairs other than monetary policy.\n\nThe appointment of Egyptian-born Shafik, who is also a British and US national, follows growing criticism of Osborne\'s failure to appoint a woman to the monetary policy committee. The nine-member committee, which meets monthly to set interest rates under the chairmanship of Carney, has been without a female member since Kate Barker left in May 2010.\n\nShafik\'s post is a new role at the Bank, deputy governor responsible for markets and banking. It means Carney now has four deputies. Her appointment, effective from August, comes as the Bank fights to shore up its credibility amid a worldwide probe into alleged rigging of foreign exchange markets. The 51-year-old was just 36 when she became the youngest ever vice president at the World Bank. In her new role at Threadneedle Street she will represent the Bank in meetings with other central banks, the IMF and other institutions and will sit on the BoE\'s financial policy committee and court of directors. From June she will take the place of Paul Fisher on the monetary policy committee when his term ends.\n\nCarney, who is pushing through a shakeup of the Bank\'s structure, welcomed the three new appointments.\n\n""With a diverse combination of skills and experience, these appointments result in a well-rounded senior management team at the Bank – one that will set the direction for an ambitious agenda of transformation for the institution and enable it to meet the challenges and opportunities it faces in maintaining monetary and financial stability,"" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Bank said that Shafik would be responsible for reshaping its operations and balance sheet, including ""ensuring robust risk management practices"". She will also help develop and implement ""an eventual exit"" from quantitative easing, whereby the Bank pumped billions in electronic cash into the flagging economy during the downturn.\n\nHabgood, who is chairman of Whitbread, takes over as chair of the Bank\'s court of directors from David Lees, who leaves at the end of June.\n\nAs the new deputy governor for monetary policy, Broadbent will be responsible for the Bank\'s analysis of the UK and international economies that feeds into interest rate decisions. He takes on the post at a turning point in the cycle for borrowing costs. After five years at a record low of 0.5% interest rates are expected to start rising again in 2015, albeit gradually, as the economic recovery gathers steam.\n\nAnnouncing the appointment, Osborne said: ""I am delighted to announce the appointment of three such highly qualified and experienced people to join the Bank\'s already excellent executive team. Their impressive experience of business, economics and international finance will strengthen and diversify the Bank\'s top team and enable them to continue to face Britain\'s ongoing economic challenges from a position of strength"".\n\nIn further changes, Spencer Dale, currently MPC member and Bank chief economist, will become executive director for financial stability, joining financial policy committee. He effectively swaps roles with Andy Haldane, currently executive director for financial stability, who becomes chief economist and joins the MPC.\n\nChanges to the monetary policy committee will give market players plenty to think about as they seek to predict when the first move in interest rates will come.\n\nDavid Tinsley, economist at BNP Paribas bank in London, said: ""What does all this mean for the direction of policy?

It suspended one of its employees this month, and an investigation into the Bank\'s conduct is ongoing.\n\nShafik\'s appointment is part of a drive to have more women in senior roles at the Bank. It is well known that Mark Carney, the Bank\'s Governor, and Chancellor George Osborne are looking for more women to serve at the top.\n\n""The lack of participation, especially on the MPC, is striking,"" Carney wrote in a letter to Osborne dated August 28 last year. ""The Bank has a responsibility to foster top female economists all the way through the ranks.""\n\nBorn in Alexandria, Egypt, Shafik has described her father as an ""Anglophone-trained scientist"" and her mother as a ""Francophone-trained literary type."" Surrounded by poverty, Shafik left Egypt at the age of four to begin a new life in America.\n\nIn an interview in 2001, she said the ""combination of empirical scientific rigor but at the same time being more human and earthy were a big part of my upbringing"".\n\nWith degrees from Oxford, the London School of Economics and Massachusetts-Amherst under her belt, Shafik quickly rose to become the youngest ever vice president of the World Bank. At the time, she was 36, and responsible for $50bn (£30bn) of investments.\n\nShafik, now 51, served as a UK civil servant for three years, joining the Department for International Development as Permanent Secretary in 2008, before becoming the IMF\'s deputy managing director for Europe and the Middle East in 2011. She was also responsible for the Fund\'s $1bn administrative budget, and human resources for its 3,000 employees.\n\nShe is also is used to being in at the deep end. Barely a month after she joined the IMF, and in the middle of negotiations over a second Greek bail-out, she was asked to step in for former IMF boss Dominique Strauss Kahn at a key eurozone meeting, after he was arrested for sexual assault charges.\n\nOf course, Shafik is not the first female to join the upper echelons of the Bank. Dame DeAnne Julius was one of the MPC\'s founding members, and Rachel Lomax, a former deputy governor, Marian Bell and Kate Barker have all served on the committee.\n\nCharlotte Hogg - the Bank\'s chief operating officer - was appointed last year to be Carney\'s ""eyes and ears"" at the Bank.\n\nHowever, Shafik is the first female MPC member for four years, and will be only the fifth woman out of 36 current or former members once Andy Haldane - currently the Bank’s executive director for financial stability - joins.\n\nBut Shafik has proven she is no wallflower, and is more than capable of adapting to the demands of the job. Perhaps it will be her ""superb leadership qualities"" - identified by Ms Lagarde - that will one day put her in contention to be its first female governor.', 'Those were the words used by IMF managing director Christine Lagarde on Tuesday to describe the Bank of England\'s newest member and deputy governor, Nemat Shafik.\nIt is well known that Mark Carney, the Bank\'s Governor, and Chancellor George Osborne are looking for more women to serve at the top.\nOf course, Shafik is not the first female to join the upper echelons of the Bank.\nDame DeAnne Julius was one of the MPC\'s founding members, and Rachel Lomax, a former deputy governor, Marian Bell and Kate Barker have all served on the committee.\nPerhaps it will be her ""superb leadership qualities"" - identified by Ms Lagarde - that will one day put her in contention to be its first female governor.']"

Haldane has been unusually outspoken for a central banker, criticising banks for trying to dodge regulation and addressing anti-capitalism protesters.\n\nThe changes — made by BoE Governor Mark Carney and the British government — are part of an overhaul at the Bank that Carney is pursuing to break down barriers between its monetary policy and bank regulation wings.\n\nOne of the biggest losers from the upheaval is markets director Paul Fisher who will have to give up his MPC seat to Shafik from August 1.\n\nFisher has been under fire from lawmakers over the BoE’s handling of alleged manipulation of London’s foreign exchange market.\n\n“This shows the extent to which Mark Carney is reshaping the bank,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. “He’s serious about making reform, not only to the structure of the Bank ... but also in terms of its culture.”\n\nPrior to Today’s announcement, Carney had overseen the appointment of outsiders to two other top positions at the Bank.\n\nNew deputy governors\n\nBroadbent was formerly a senior economist at Goldman Sachs — Carney’s employer before he became a central banker — and he will succeed Charlie Bean, who retires at the end of June.\n\nBroadbent has said the failure of troubled banks to lend money to more efficient firms is one of the reasons behind Britain’s weak economic productivity since the financial crisis.Shafik — who holds Egyptian, US and British nationality — has a background in development economics, working at the World Bank and as the top civil servant at Britain’s overseas aid department, before becoming deputy managing director at the IMF.\n\nShe oversaw much of the IMF’s work in the turnaround programs for Greece and Portugal.\n\nShafik will be responsible for the BoE’s eventual exit from its quantitative easing policy — under which it amassed £375 billion (RM2.043 trillion) of government bonds — as well as reviewing the way the central bank gathers intelligence on markets which has come under scrutiny recently after claims that London traders manipulated key foreign exchange rates.\n\nSince taking office in July, Carney has been keen to increase the number of women in senior roles at the BoE.\n\nBNP Paribas economist David Tinsley said the appointments were a surprise, and would add “a degree of raised uncertainty” about when the central bank would start to raise interest rates from their record low 0.5 per cent.\n\nLittle is known about Shafik or Haldane’s views on monetary policy. Broadbent and Dale both voted against the BoE’s final expansion of asset purchases in July 2012, while Fisher was part of a dovish minority under former governor Mervyn King who wanted more asset purchases up until King’s departure in June.\n\nBroadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor at the central bank.\n\nHe will be responsible for the BoE’s analysis of Britain’s economy, as well as bank notes.\n\nBritain’s finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the BoE’s Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank. Habgood is chairman of brewer Whitbread and publishing company Reed Elsevier .\n\nHabgood succeeds David Lees, whose term expires on July 1. — Reuters', 'Ben Broadbent, up until now an external member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, will step up to become deputy governor for monetary policy.\nDale had been seen as a favourite to become deputy governor.\nThe changes — made by BoE Governor Mark Carney and the British government — are part of an overhaul at the Bank that Carney is pursuing to break down barriers between its monetary policy and bank regulation wings.\nBroadbent is the first external member of the MPC to take up a position as deputy governor at the central bank.\nBritain’s finance ministry also named Anthony Habgood as chairman of the BoE’s Court of Directors, which supervises the central bank.']"

16254,http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/mar/18/mark-carney-bank-england-deputy-governors,business,"[""It is all change at the Bank of England. The new appointments were formally announced by George Osborne but show the governor, Mark Carney, stamping his authority all over Threadneedle Street.\n\nBefore moving on to the winners and losers, it is worth commenting on the rationale behind the need for a deputy governor for markets and banking. Quite simply, the extra work load heaped on the Bank in the aftermath of the financial crisis means that there is a risk of Carney being asked to do too much: monetary policy, strategic oversight of the City, keeping an eye on individual banks and ensuring the financial markets work smoothly and honestly.\n\nThe governor remains ultimately responsible for all these tasks, but can now delegate some of the responsibility to four deputies. Ben Broadbent gets monetary policy; the former Treasury mandarin John Cunliffe looks after financial stability; Andrew Bailey takes care of prudential regulation of the banks; Nemat Shafik takes up the new post of deputy governor for markets and banking.\n\nThere are two key parts of Shafik's role. Firstly, to ensure that the markets are cleaned up after the scandals involving Libor and foreign exchange traders. The Bank's own involvement in these affairs is currently under scrutiny, and the appointment of a high-profile outsider – Shafik's role at the IMF makes her Britain's most senior official in an international body – shows Carney's concern about the potential damage the scandals are doing to Threadneedle Street's image.\n\nThe second, perhaps even more daunting, task for Shafik is to work out a way of unwinding the Bank's quantitative easing programme. This is the initiative that pumped money into the banking system through the purchase of £375bn in government bonds. Buying the bonds has helped suppress long-term interest rates; the task for the new deputy governor is to devise a means of selling them back to the markets without jeopardising economic growth.\n\nTwo other things about the new structure are worthy of mention. Broadbent's move from being an external member of the MPC to a full-time Bank official adds to the sense that Goldman Sachs runs the world. Both Carney and Broadbent have worked at Goldmans. Secondly, Shafik's appointment does something to remedy the gender imbalance at the Bank.\n\nAs for the personnel changes, Paul Fisher, the executive director for markets, has carried the can for the Libor and forex scandals. He loses his place on the MPC. Spencer Dale, currently chief economist, was a candidate to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy but lost out to Broadbent. Dale appears to have paid the price for the Bank's less than stellar record for economic forecasting and does a job swap with Andy Haldane, executive director for financial stability.\n\nWhat do the changes add up to? Clearly, the Bank's organisational structure needed to be updated to take account of the fact that it is no longer simply an institution that does monetary policy. That re-organisation is now in place. All the coming and going means there will be a vacancy for an external member of the MPC. It is unlikely, however, that the public will notice much of a change to monetary policy; although Shafik's views are unknown the balance of hawks and doves remains unchanged.\n\nFinally, the appointment of Shafik is bound to prompt speculation that she will become the Bank's first female governor when Carney's term ends in the summer of 2018."", ""The new appointments were formally announced by George Osborne but show the governor, Mark Carney, stamping his authority all over Threadneedle Street.\nBefore moving on to the winners and losers, it is worth commenting on the rationale behind the need for a deputy governor for markets and banking.\nSpencer Dale, currently chief economist, was a candidate to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy but lost out to Broadbent.\nClearly, the Bank's organisational structure needed to be updated to take account of the fact that it is no longer simply an institution that does monetary policy.\nIt is unlikely, however, that the public will notice much of a change to monetary policy; although Shafik's views are unknown the balance of hawks and doves remains unchanged.""]"

How much money is there out there? And who controls the supply?\n\n\n\nBack in the days of the Gold Standard and mainly cash transactions, it was relatively simple. You had as much money as you had gold in the vault. But in these days of electronic transfer, Fiat money, ultra-low interest rates and mind-bogglingly large government interventions aimed at boosting the money supply, things are a great deal more complicated.\n\n\n\nSurely it’s the Bank of England’s job? Well yes, up to a point Lord Copper. Alarmed perhaps by the suggestion that it has more control over money supply than it actually does, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has issued a magisterial document explaining not only where money comes from but also exactly how QE is supposed to work. And precisely what the - rather limited - economic control levers the Bank can actually pull on are.\n\n\n\nIt’s 14 - rather nourishing - pages but probably the best explanation of 21st Century monetarism MT has read. Our only criticism is that it’s about five years late, but never mind.\n\n\n\nFor those who can’t be bothered (sorry, don’t have the time) to tackle the whole thing, here are three top facts to help you feel smug:\n\n\n\nMoney is created every time a bank makes a loan to a customer. This debunks the classical view that banks only lend money that is already in circulation.\n\n\n\nQE is not supposed to be about giving more money to banks. Rather it’s institutional investors like pension funds who are supposed to benefit first, then the rest of us by trickle down. (MT wonders if this isn’t partly wishful thinking).\n\n\n\nThere is no ‘money multiplier’ effect on bank lending. Lending in the economy is not controlled directly by the BoE through the amount of central bank money it makes available.\n\n\n\nHere is the full report, in all its glory - or you can read it in fullscreen here.', 'But in these days of electronic transfer, Fiat money, ultra-low interest rates and mind-bogglingly large government interventions aimed at boosting the money supply, things are a great deal more complicated.\nAlarmed perhaps by the suggestion that it has more control over money supply than it actually does, the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street has issued a magisterial document explaining not only where money comes from but also exactly how QE is supposed to work.\nFor those who can’t be bothered (sorry, don’t have the time) to tackle the whole thing, here are three top facts to help you feel smug:Money is created every time a bank makes a loan to a customer.\nThere is no ‘money multiplier’ effect on bank lending.\nLending in the economy is not controlled directly by the BoE through the amount of central bank money it makes available.']"

16271,http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-26628996,business,"['Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nemat “Minouche” Shafik takes the newly created post of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking\n\nBloomin\' \'eck there is a bewildering game of musical chairs going on at the Bank of England this morning. And pretty much every big job there, bar the very top one, is changing in some way.\n\nI will summarise what I see as the main events.\n\nFor the second time in its history, the Bank of England has appointed a woman to a top policy job, as Minouche Shafik takes the newly created post of deputy governor responsible for markets and banking (Rachel Lomax was the first female deputy governor, a few years back).\n\nWhat\'s most interesting about the Shafik appointment - other than its gender (the Bank has been such a boys\' club) - is how the governor, Mark Carney, has raided the responsibilities of three other big jobs to carve out the role.\n\nShe\'ll take the seat on the Monetary Policy Committee currently occupied by Paul Fisher, the bank\'s executive director for markets (who looks likes the main loser from this reorganisation).\n\nAnd she will also assume chunky duties from the other two deputy governors, those for monetary policy and financial stability - namely that she will be the main negotiator with the G7 group of leading economies and the IMF (currently a monetary policy responsibility), and with overseas central banks and the Bank for International Settlements (nicked from financial stability).\n\nBut what was most interesting about the description of her job was this: ""Dr Shafik will be responsible for reshaping the Bank\'s operations and balance sheet, including robust risk management practices and helping to lead the design and execution of an eventual exit from quantitative easing by the Monetary Policy Committee"".\n\nIn other words, as and when the Bank of England starts to offload that £375bn of government debt it bought, in its unprecedented exercise to create new money and keep interest rates at record lows after the crash, she\'ll be responsible for preventing a collapse in the price of that debt that could hobble both the Bank of England and commercial banks.\n\nNo stress there then.\n\nAnd although she is a very high powered person, as deputy managing director of the IMF since April 2011 and prior to that permanent secretary at the Department for International Development, the cut and thrust of markets will be new to her.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Ben Broadbent is replacing Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy\n\nWhat else is happening in Threadneedle Street?\n\nWell another Goldman Sachs alumnus rises to the top of the Bank to join Mr Carney - with the appointment of Ben Broadbent to replace Charlie Bean as deputy governor for monetary policy.\n\nBroadbent was already on the Bank of England\'s interest-rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, but before that he was Goldman\'s senior European economist.\n\nIn practice Broadbent becomes the top economist at the Bank. But there is also a change in the holder of what the Bank calls its chief economist post, with Andy Haldane taking that job.\n\nHaldane is in fact doing a job swap, with his exact Bank of England contemporary Spencer Dale (I think they joined on the same day as young graduates).\n\nSo Dale takes Haldane\'s job as executive director for financial stability.\n\nIt is certainly interesting that Haldane is staying at the Bank, because it was widely felt that his relations with Mr Carney are poor - since Haldane\'s ideas on how to cleanse and stabilise the banking system were rather more radical than Mr Carney\'s.\n\nAnd Mr Haldane - regarded as one of the more creative and insightful economists of his generation - has been unwontedly quiet on the City reform agenda in recent months.\n\nFinally one of the more distinguished of the UK\'s industrialists, Anthony Habgood, will replace Sir David Lees as chair of the Court of the Bank of England (the Bank\'s pompous historic name for its board).\n\nHe has the job of making sure Mr Carney - with all the many new responsibilities he\'s been given by the chancellor, for making sure the financial system and banks don\'t fall over again - doesn\'t go power mad.\n\nMr Carney himself will lay out his own cunning plan to knit together the newly huge and amorphous Bank of England in the Mais Lecture, later today.\n\nAnd although you may feel a wave of torpor sweeping over you, at just the thought of a speech about governance and structure at the Bank, it may be sensible to stay awake.\n\nBecause how the Bank of England executes its complicated mandate, of keeping inflation low and financial stability high, affects the prosperity of us all.\n\nUPDATE 15:40\n\nInside the Bank of England, the scale of the personnel changes is causing a tiny bit of internal handwringing, as one or two backs are perhaps put out.\n\nSo here is a little ouch from one of its people: ""Minouche won\'t be the lead international person on everything. For example, on the international financial reform programme, Jon Cunliffe [the current deputy governor of financial stability] will take the lead in G20 and Financial Stability Board.\n\n""Jon will also be on the board of the Bank for International Settlements. It\'s a detail, but an important one.""\n\nOf course.\n\nAnd as for the apparent demotion to Paul Fisher, it may be that his job has been downgraded rather than the bloke himself - if you catch my drift. We shall see.', ""Broadbent was already on the Bank of England's interest-rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, but before that he was Goldman's senior European economist.\nBut there is also a change in the holder of what the Bank calls its chief economist post, with Andy Haldane taking that job.\nHaldane is in fact doing a job swap, with his exact Bank of England contemporary Spencer Dale (I think they joined on the same day as young graduates).\nMr Carney himself will lay out his own cunning plan to knit together the newly huge and amorphous Bank of England in the Mais Lecture, later today.\nBecause how the Bank of England executes its complicated mandate, of keeping inflation low and financial stability high, affects the prosperity of us all.""]"

16281,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/18/truth-money-iou-bank-of-england-austerity,business,"['Back in the 1930s, Henry Ford is supposed to have remarked that it was a good thing that most Americans didn\'t know how banking really works, because if they did, ""there\'d be a revolution before tomorrow morning"".\n\nLast week, something remarkable happened. The Bank of England let the cat out of the bag. In a paper called ""Money Creation in the Modern Economy"", co-authored by three economists from the Bank\'s Monetary Analysis Directorate, they stated outright that most common assumptions of how banking works are simply wrong, and that the kind of populist, heterodox positions more ordinarily associated with groups such as Occupy Wall Street are correct. In doing so, they have effectively thrown the entire theoretical basis for austerity out of the window.\n\nTo get a sense of how radical the Bank\'s new position is, consider the conventional view, which continues to be the basis of all respectable debate on public policy. People put their money in banks. Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise. True, the fractional reserve system does allow banks to lend out considerably more than they hold in reserve, and true, if savings don\'t suffice, private banks can seek to borrow more from the central bank.\n\nThe central bank can print as much money as it wishes. But it is also careful not to print too much. In fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place. If governments could print money themselves, they would surely put out too much of it, and the resulting inflation would throw the economy into chaos. Institutions such as the Bank of England or US Federal Reserve were created to carefully regulate the money supply to prevent inflation. This is why they are forbidden to directly fund the government, say, by buying treasury bonds, but instead fund private economic activity that the government merely taxes.\n\nIt\'s this understanding that allows us to continue to talk about money as if it were a limited resource like bauxite or petroleum, to say ""there\'s just not enough money"" to fund social programmes, to speak of the immorality of government debt or of public spending ""crowding out"" the private sector. What the Bank of England admitted this week is that none of this is really true. To quote from its own initial summary: ""Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits"" … ""In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is central bank money \'multiplied up\' into more loans and deposits.""\n\nIn other words, everything we know is not just wrong – it\'s backwards. When banks make loans, they create money. This is because money is really just an IOU. The role of the central bank is to preside over a legal order that effectively grants banks the exclusive right to create IOUs of a certain kind, ones that the government will recognise as legal tender by its willingness to accept them in payment of taxes. There\'s really no limit on how much banks could create, provided they can find someone willing to borrow it. They will never get caught short, for the simple reason that borrowers do not, generally speaking, take the cash and put it under their mattresses; ultimately, any money a bank loans out will just end up back in some bank again. So for the banking system as a whole, every loan just becomes another deposit. What\'s more, insofar as banks do need to acquire funds from the central bank, they can borrow as much as they like; all the latter really does is set the rate of interest, the cost of money, not its quantity. Since the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing. In fact, with ""quantitative easing"" they\'ve been effectively pumping as much money as they can into the banks, without producing any inflationary effects.\n\nWhat this means is that the real limit on the amount of money in circulation is not how much the central bank is willing to lend, but how much government, firms, and ordinary citizens, are willing to borrow. Government spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all). So there\'s no question of public spending ""crowding out"" private investment. It\'s exactly the opposite.\n\nWhy did the Bank of England suddenly admit all this? Well, one reason is because it\'s obviously true. The Bank\'s job is to actually run the system, and of late, the system has not been running especially well. It\'s possible that it decided that maintaining the fantasy-land version of economics that has proved so convenient to the rich is simply a luxury it can no longer afford.\n\nBut politically, this is taking an enormous risk. Just consider what might happen if mortgage holders realised the money the bank lent them is not, really, the life savings of some thrifty pensioner, but something the bank just whisked into existence through its possession of a magic wand which we, the public, handed over to it.\n\nHistorically, the Bank of England has tended to be a bellwether, staking out seeming radical positions that ultimately become new orthodoxies. If that\'s what\'s happening here, we might soon be in a position to learn if Henry Ford was right.', 'Banks then lend that money out at interest – either to consumers, or to entrepreneurs willing to invest it in some profitable enterprise.\nThe central bank can print as much money as it wishes.\nIn fact, we are often told this is why independent central banks exist in the first place.\nSince the beginning of the recession, the US and British central banks have reduced that cost to almost nothing.\nGovernment spending is the main driver in all this (and the paper does admit, if you read it carefully, that the central bank does fund the government after all).']"
