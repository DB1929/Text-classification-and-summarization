""In addition, we are today sanctioning a number of other individuals with substantial resources and influence who provide material support to the Russian leadership, as well as a bank that provides material support to these individuals.""The administration also vowed that further punitive steps are on the way.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that ""the question at this point is not if we will do more sanctions, it’s when.""Those hit with sanctions include Vladimir Yakunin, the influential head of Russian Railways, oil trader Gennady Timchenko, and Putin’s chief of staff and close associate, Sergei Ivanov, as well as a handful of others.The U.S. Treasury also sanctioned Bank Rossiya -- among the country\'s 20 largest banks -- which it called “the personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”Its chairman, Yury Kovalchuk, was also placed on the sanctions list.A senior U.S. administration official told reporters in a call that the named individuals “will be unable to access any U.S. financial services, will find it difficult to transact in the dollar, and I suspect will find it very difficult to transact in Europe and elsewhere, as our partners around the world have demonstrated over time a willingness to also adhere to the sanctions that we are imposing.""Russian officials included in an initial round of U.S. sanctions on March 17 scoffed at that move, saying they had neither any assets in the United States nor any desire to visit the country.But another senior U.S. official who spoke to journalists by phone after this latest round insisted that the sanctions have teeth.“People may think that they are a mere wrist slap. I can assure them that they are not,” the official said.Legal experts said the fresh sanctions could create havoc for the designated individuals as they try to conduct business, particularly when trying to move money around the world.Douglas McNabb, a Washington-based lawyer specializing in financial sanctions and extradition law, said that ""even some banks that don’t have corresponding relations with the U.S. still won’t have anything to do with individuals who have been designated.”One of the targeted individuals, Timchenko, is a Soviet-born Finnish citizen who until this week was a co-owner of the oil-trading company Gunvor, which has a head office in Geneva and a registered office in Cyprus.Gunvor issuedsoon after the announcement saying that in anticipation of ""potential economic sanctions,"" Timchenko on March 19 sold all of his shares in the company to his partner, Swedish businessman Torbjorn Törnqvist.Last year, Reuters reported that Timchenko had hired Washington lobbyists in a bid to secure funding backed by the U.S. government for a luxury aircraft business.Though quickly denied by officials at Gunvor, theon Thursday asserted that ""Putin has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor funds.""Meanwhile, Bank Rossiya, with about $10 billion in assets, will be effectively shut out of U.S. dollar activities worldwide and have its correspondent relationships with banks across the globe placed under threat, according to Steve Ganis, an expert on financial sanctions with the Boston law firm Mintz Levin.Obama also announced an executive order signed that enables the U.S. government to introduce sanctions on entire sectors of the Russian economy. A senior administration official said that could include the energy, engineering, financial services, or metals and mining sectors.“Once those sectors are designated...we will then be able to impose sanctions on specific entities within those sectors,” the official said. “This is a flexible tool that we can use in response to further provocations” -- the official said, citing potential Russian incursions into other areas of Ukraine.Boston lawyer Ganis said that sanctions on the Russian energy sector could be “quite disruptive” to Russian energy companies but that such sanctions could also affect global markets and create problems for European countries dependent on Russian energy.A U.S. administration official said Washington is ""working actively to prepare additional sanctions under these authorities using their creative breadth to design sanctions that will hurt the entities with...the smallest possible impact on us and our allies.""Obama’s is traveling next week to Europe, where he said he will discuss the Ukrainian situation with the United States\' Group of Seven (G7) partners.', 'WASHINGTON -- The United States has slapped fresh sanctions on individuals close to President Vladimir Putin over Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, penalties that officials and legal experts say could severely restrict the targeted Russians\' ability to do business throughout the world.U.S.\nPresident Barack Obama announced the measures, aimed at senior Russian officials, wealthy businessmen in Putin\'s ""inner circle,"" and Bank Rossiya, which has close ties to Russia\'s leadership.\n""Based on the executive order that I signed in response to Russia\'s initial intervention in Ukraine, we are imposing sanctions on more senior officials of the Russian government,"" Obama said.\n""The administration also vowed that further punitive steps are on the way.State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that ""the question at this point is not if we will do more sanctions, it’s when.\n""Obama’s is traveling next week to Europe, where he said he will discuss the Ukrainian situation with the United States\' Group of Seven (G7) partners.']"

However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist.\n\nBanks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far.\n\nWhat bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran.\n\nGermany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter.\n\n“What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow.\n\n“The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions.\n\n“Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.”\n\n********************************************************\n\nBank exposure to Russia link.reuters.com/xej67v\n\nRussia's main trade partners link.reuters.com/jup77v\n\nRussia's EU trade ties link.reuters.com/rup77v\n\n********************************************************\n\nState-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there.\n\n“It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.”\n\nWAIT AND SEE\n\nEven before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns.\n\nThe cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion.\n\nWith that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw.\n\nWith the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight.\n\nSwitzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients.\n\nBeyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories.\n\n“They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow.\n\nVasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace.\n\n“We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

At the moment the ruble exchange rate is growing in Crimean exchange offices. In Russia the ruble is strengthening in the context of reduction of geopolitical risks.\n\n\n\nHowever, yesterday the USA decided to extend the list of Russian officials against whom strict sanctions are launched. 20 people have been included on the list, including the head of the presidential administration Sergei Ivanov, his deputy Alexei Gromov, the State Duma chairman Sergei Naryshkin, the leader of A Just Russia Sergei Mironov, businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, businessman Yuri Kovalchuk, the owner of Volga Group Gennady Timchenko and the head of Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin. The US President stated that sanctions were being launched against “organizations which provide material support to the Russian government”, i.e. the bank ‘Rossiya’. Barack Obama also signed an order on possible sanctions against key sectors of the Russian economy. Whether the sanctions will affect ordinary citizens of Russia is not clear.\n\n\n\nOleg Kazakovtsev, a member of the Federation Council Committee on Budgets and Financial Markets, says that people are only interested in one type of question: “If I have certain savings, will these savings remain? What should I do with them? How will I get my salary? Will the Central Bank fight inflation? These questions are major. People are trying to protect what they have saved. If we look at the market today as a whole, we'll see that there are very few mechanisms with which people can temporarily invest their savings: 80% are accounted for in bank deposits, some of them are accounted for in currencies, but people have generally taken the process of de-dollarization - in 1998 as well as in 2013 - rather calmly. There is another mechanism - through buying property, the only given document is a certificate of ownership and those who are able to still spend their money on real estate. The stock market for the majority is in fact unavailable. We have about 1 million citizens who own shares or are somehow involved in it. In comparison, in America more than 50 million people purchase shares, invest, try to earn something and so on,” Kazakovtsev says.\n\n\n\nHe thinks it is necessary for the Central Bank to adopt a more flexible policy. “Unfortunately, the policy carried out by the CB of revoking licenses is a relevant measure, but nevertheless every week licenses of regional banks are suspended. This creates an additional negative reaction among depositors. Not all the information reaches people. This all has its impact, and people are trying to purchase foreign currency. There is speculative demand. In 1998, for example, a threshold was introduced for commercial banks - 15%, that is, the addition to the currency price could not be higher than 15%. Now, when people come to the exchange office, they find out that either there is no currency or that some banks are trying to raise the price. As a result, the difference between the rate of the CB and the sale price in exchange offices is quite significant, which causes unexpected interest. I believe that today the Central Bank conducts audits and has resources. The issue is that, if there are doubts, let's make formal requests.”\n\n\n\n"", ""Crimea and Russia's financesBy Vestnik KavkazaThe Russian ruble will be officially launched in the territory of Crimea on March 24th.\nAt the moment the ruble exchange rate is growing in Crimean exchange offices.\nIn Russia the ruble is strengthening in the context of reduction of geopolitical risks.\nHowever, yesterday the USA decided to extend the list of Russian officials against whom strict sanctions are launched.\nThe US President stated that sanctions were being launched against “organizations which provide material support to the Russian government”, i.e.""]"

They have come to believe that they are exceptionally qualified and empowered to resolve the fates of the world. They bring power to bear against sovereign states and build coalitions based on the principle ‘whoever’s not with us is against us.’”\n\nAn annexation treaty Putin signed with pro-Russian Crimean leaders says the autonomous territory will be fully integrated into Russia after a transition period.\n\nKyiv, Brussels and Washington twitched.\n\nAt least, that’s how jubilant Muscovites and their politicians interpreted Western expressions of outrage over the move and a first phase of sanctions. The powerful in Moscow scoffed at the measures.\n\nIn contrast, in the biggest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War, US President Barack Obama sought to present his Russian counterpart’s move as motivated by impotence at home — troops in Crimea or not.\n\nObama said: “The truth is that Mr. Putin acted out of weakness, not out of strength. We are not going to be getting into a military excursion in Ukraine. What we are going to do is mobilise all of our diplomatic resources to make sure that we’ve got a strong international coalition that sends a clear message, which is that Ukrainians should decide their own destiny.”\n\nRussia accuses the new pro-Western authorities in Kiev of endangering Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. It says it will insist that its compatriots’ rights and freedoms be fully respected.\n\nWarning of the risks that could come with a weak response to Moscow’s absorption of Crimea, Washington foreign policy pundits Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft have been analysing Putin’s justification of his moves against Ukraine. Both Americans are former US National Security Advisors.\n\nAt a conference at the Center for Strategic & International Studies think tank in Washington, DC, they said a surprisingly efficient annexation of Crimea ends a quarter of a century of constructive relations between Russia and the United States.\n\nAccording to Brzezinski: “We have to convey to the Russians our concern that those words spoken by Putin are terribly reminiscent of what Hitler was saying about Austria before the Anschluss [the occupation and annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938], which was then followed by the Sudetenland [areas of other countries inhabited mostly by German speakers], and we know the rest of the history. And that could be very serious in Europe. Either we can be passive in the face of a calamitous explosion or maybe the Ukrainians will fall apart and simply there will be a repetition of what happened in Crimea.”\n\nIn Scowcroft’s opinion: “Putin is a different person, a very different person from Gorbatchev or even from Khrushchev, and he has the outlook of someone who was KGB and who saw the Soviet Union collapse. He is a person full of venom, because he thought that that collapse was taken advantage of by the West, especially by the United States, to humiliate Russia or take advantage of Russia.”\n\nNeither Scowcroft nor Brzezinski see Europe’s new insecurity as a return to the Cold War; they see it in a different context of 21st century reality.\n\nBrzezinski: “Putin has to consider: can he really undertake a war at this stage in the heart Europe given the state of his economy, which is really very bad, and the relatively retarded state of his military, which is only now being modernised? If he did this ten years from now, he might be in much better shape. But right now, I don’t think a serious conflict in that part of Europe is something that Putin would welcome. He would like to have a quickie: either the break-up of Ukraine or some upheaval within Ukraine. And I think we have to reassure him in a constructive fashion that that is somewhat unlikely, because we have interests too.”\n\nScowcroft said Putin’s action could have been averted if the West had paid attention to Urkaine’s economy, but, he said, both the US and Europe have been lazy about the whole thing.\n\nScowcroft: “The EU made an offer for a relationship with Ukraine. It didn’t amount to anything. Putin turns around and offers a 15 billion dollar loan. What the United States could have done at that time and I think should have done is to say, look, Ukraine’s economy is in terrible shape, let’s us, the United States, the EU and Russia put together a programme of assistance to Ukraine.”\n\nOur correspondent Stefan Grobe asked Brzezinski if the initial sanctions taken against Russia are enough.\n\nBrzezinski answered: “Well, they [the sanctions] are like the introductory phase of a dinner, just a little bit of a preliminary bite, but not too much bite.\n\nGrobe: “Do you expect more?”\n\nBrzezinski: “Yes.”\n\nGrobe concludes: “The foreign policy establishment in Washington is deeply troubled by Putin’s action and by the Western response. The hope is that President Obama and the European allies at the EU summit in Europe next week will find a more muscular approach.”', 'They have come to believe that they are exceptionally qualified and empowered to resolve the fates of the world.\nWarning of the risks that could come with a weak response to Moscow’s absorption of Crimea, Washington foreign policy pundits Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft have been analysing Putin’s justification of his moves against Ukraine.\nBut right now, I don’t think a serious conflict in that part of Europe is something that Putin would welcome.\nHe would like to have a quickie: either the break-up of Ukraine or some upheaval within Ukraine.\nGrobe: “Do you expect more?”Brzezinski: “Yes.”Grobe concludes: “The foreign policy establishment in Washington is deeply troubled by Putin’s action and by the Western response.']"

The West considers the vote illegitimate.\n\nThe MICEX benchmark was down nearly 3 percent two hours into Friday trading with the companies co-owned by the Russians sanctioned by the White House leading the decline. The Russian stock market has lost than more 10 percent this month.\n\nAs Russian stocks were taking a pounding, two Russian banks including Bank Rossiya, the Russian lender which was put on the Treasury’s sanctions list, said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing services to them. U.S. officials described Russia’s 15th largest bank with $12 billion in assets as a “personal bank for senior officials of the Russian Federation.”\n\nAnd clients of another Russian lender, SMP, woke up Friday to discover that they cannot use their cards. In a statement, it said Visa and MasterCard stopped providing their services to them “without prior notification.” SMP’s co-owners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg — billionaire brothers and childhood friends of Putin — were hit by the U.S. sanctions on Thursday.\n\nThe bank, which is in Russia’s top 40 with $5 billion in assets, said it had no assets in the United States and described Visa and MasterCard’s actions as “illegitimate” because the bank, unlike its owners, was not covered by the sanctions.\n\nThough customers in the two banks won’t be able to use cards backed by Visa and MasterCard to buy products in shops or online or even withdraw cash from ATMs, the clients can get cash directly from the banks.\n\nRussia’s central bank sought to assure that the blacklisting of Rossiya and its transactions by U.S. authorities “does not have a serious bearing on the lender’s financial stability.” However, it added that the government could “take necessary steps to support the lender and the interests of its depositors and creditors.”\n\nAmid the signs that the sanctions are beginning to impact on day-to-day life in Russia, ratings agency Fitch followed Standard & Poor’s in warning Russia that it may have its credit rating downgraded. In a statement, Fitch said it has revised down its outlook for Russia’s debt to reflect the potential impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, a day after S&P warned of a potential downgrade too.\n\nFitch operates a 23-notch rating system and Russia’s BBB rating ranks ninth on that scale, two above what is considered to be junk status.

Most have deep ties with Putin and have grown rich during his time in power.\n\nThe EU has predictably acted more cautiously, adding a further 12 names to the list of Russian and Crimean officials already hit with travel bans and asset freezes, cancelling an EU-Russia summit and starting preparatory work on broader financial and trade sanctions – “stage 3” which Angela Merkel said would be triggered if Putin escalated the crisis any further.\n\nThe dozen new names will be published today.\n\nRussia’s retaliatory sanctions so far look thin – banning senior U.S. politicians from travelling there, which was greeted with derision by the likes of John Boehner and John McCain. But there could be more to follow which will hurt Europe, with its deep economic and trade ties with Russia.\n\nThe working assumption remains that it would cost Moscow too much to curb or cut off its gas supplies to the EU. It supplies a third of Europe’s gas and more than a fifth of its oil but the EU has hefty reserves after a mild winter.\n\nThe other presumption is that while Europe will not go to the wall over Crimea, any Russian intervention in the east of Ukraine would demand a more robust, though not military, response from there and Washington. But no one really knows how Putin will react next.\n\nIf any reminder of the cost was needed, Russian stocks have fallen nearly three percent this morning and last night Standard & Poor’s lowered its outlook on Russia’s credit rating to negative from stable. It expects further sanctions to be imposed.\n\nBank Rossiya has said it is working as normal today though Visa and MasterCard have stopped providing payment transactions services for its clients.\n\nThe EU plans to sign an “association agreement” with Ukraine today, promising closer political and trade ties that will help draw it more closely into Europe and boost its economic growth. This is another way of hurting Russia.\n\nBy luring the rump of Ukraine towards the west and priming it with funds, it could be lost to Russia forever, dealing a fatal blow to Putin’s plan for a Eurasian trading bloc. For Kiev’s part, it may have to adopt an ostensibly neutral stance between east and west to avoid provoking Moscow further.\n\nBrussels is giving Ukraine unfettered access to the 28-nation bloc’s 500 million consumers even before a proposed bilateral free-trade accord comes into force later this year. And it has also brought forward plans to finalise agreements with Moldova and Georgia, signing them by June at the latest.\n\nAn IMF team in Kiev has extended its work on an aid package until Tuesday, saying good progress had been made.\n\nThe U.S. and EU would row in behind an IMF package, helping Ukraine meet its debt obligations and begin the process of rebuilding. A meeting of G7 leaders in the Hague on Monday could be pivotal in that regard.\n\nEU minds have also been focused on reducing their dependence on Russian energy which would eventually leave Moscow nowhere to look but east. Longer-term, that means boosting “indigenous supplies”, which include renewable energy and shale gas, exploring how much U.S. gas could be shipped to Europe and before that looking to the Gulf for LNG.\n\nEU sources said the leaders agreed to accelerate work to upgrade cross-border energy networks to reduce individual member states’ vulnerability to supply cuts, and speed up building new liquefied natural gas import terminals to diversify suppliers.\n\nElsewhere, Rome is poised to announce a new issue of its popular BTP Italia bond. The retail bond aimed at ordinary Italians set a\n\nEuropean record by raising 22.3 billion euros at the last sale in November. It has also attracted institutional buyers.\n\nS&P has affirmed Greece’s rating at B-, deep in junk territory, with a stable outlook, saying its economy is gradually rebalancing.

They claim he acts as ""personal banker for Putin"", noting he has been referred to as one of the Russian president\'s ""cashiers"".\n\nKovalchuk reputedly forged close ties to Vladimir Putin throughout the 1990s, when Russia\'s president served as deputy mayor of St Petersburg. The two men still have luxury dachas near each another on Komsomolskoye lake, outside the city.\n\nKovalchuk is part of a dacha cooperative with other members of this upmarket lakeside community, with several other members also major shareholders in Bank Rossiya.\n\nThe bank boss, now estimated by Forbes to have a personal fortune of $1.4bn according to Forbes, helped transform the bank from a Communist party-backed enterprise into a fast-growing and, above all, well-connected bank.\n\nAs well as leading the boardroom, Kovalchuk is the largest shareholder in Bank Rossiya, owning close to 30%.

Bank Rossiya controls large insurance groups Sogas and SK Transneft.\n\nThe bank has been well known for its substantial dealings with Russian gas group Gazprom. Banking analysts at Fitch Ratings have noted in the past that Bank Rossiya relied heavily on a tiny handful of customers for about 60% of its funding, some of whom also act as customers and shareholders of the bank.\n\nAccording to US Treasury officials Bank Rossiya ""is the personal bank for senior officials in the Russian Federation"" and Kovalchuk ""is also the personal banker for senior officials ... including Putin"".\n\nIn their report, S&P analysts said: ""In our view, there is a material risk that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could extend beyond Crimea and that violence between pro- and anti-Russian protesters could spread to other cities in Eastern Ukraine."" The analysts suggested sanctions imposed by EU countries may be tempered as political leaders looked to their economic, trade and energy interests.\n\nInitial market reactions to the Ukraine crisis have suggested investors were quick to discount fears that the dispute would have a major impact on global trade, but the fresh analysis from S&P and a second round of sanctions from Washington may prompt some to revise that view.\n\nOne US official in Washington told Reuters: ""Sanctions build over time.

The other, Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, disagreed.\n\nThe two former economics professors debated in the jargon-laden lingo and polite tones of lifelong academics at a conference held in the Fed’s Washington headquarters.\n\nBut it suggested the real-life tensions that loomed as Janet Yellen ran her first policy-setting meeting earlier in the week, in the Fed building across the street.\n\nAs the world’s most powerful central bank winds down its massive bond stimulus program aimed at bolstering the U.S. jobs market, Fed officials appear increasingly worried that keeping policy so easy for so long could encourage investors to take too many risks, building bubbles that may eventually pop and roil financial markets.\n\nStein has warned publicly for a more than a year that low rates could be stoking financial instability, and on Friday argued that excessively low expected returns in the bond market may be a sign that it is time to reduce Fed stimulus, even if doing so hurts jobs.\n\nKocherlakota for his part argued that the cost of raising rates to head off the unlikely possibility of a crisis is simply not worth it.\n\nIndeed, he wants to add to the Fed’s monetary accommodation by promising to keep rates near zero until unemployment reaches a healthy 5.5 percent, and earlier this week dissented from the Fed’s policy decision in part because his colleagues would not agree to peg rate decisions to the unemployment rate.\n\nAt a separate conference of economists on the other side of Washington, a top Fed official appeared to defend Yellen’s market-roiling remark earlier this week that suggested the central bank could raise interest rates next spring, around six months after ending its massive bond-buying program.\n\n“On the considerable period being six months, the surveys that I had seen from the private sector had that kind of number penciled in,” St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said during a lunch with journalists at the Brookings Institution. “That wasn’t very different from what we had heard from financial markets. So, I just think she’s just repeating that.”\n\nAfter a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, the Fed said it expected to keep benchmark interest rates near zero for a “considerable time” after it wrapped up a bond-buying stimulus program, which it is widely expected to do toward the end of the year.\n\nPressed on the statement at a news conference afterward, Yellen said the phrase “probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing.” Stocks and bonds immediately tumbled as traders took the statement to suggest rate hikes could come sooner than they had anticipated.\n\nFutures traders on Friday continued to bet that April 2015 would mark the Fed’s first rate hike. That’s three months earlier than they had thought before the Fed’s policy-setting meeting.\n\nAt the Fed on Friday, the Bank of England’s chief economist told fellow economists and policymakers that central bankers should stick to telling markets the economic conditions that could set the stage for rate rises, rather than the timing of them.\n\n“I know I don’t know what will happen to interest rates in the next six to 12 months,” said Spencer Dale who coincidentally was speaking in the same room where Yellen had made the contentious remark two days earlier.\n\nYellen did not attend the conference Friday.\n\nIn London, Richard Fisher, the hawkish chief of the Dallas Fed, dodged a question about how he would define “considerable time.”\n\nBut in answering a separate question related to the Fed’s tools for exiting its extremely easy monetary policy, he suggested a rate hike was still a long ways off.\n\n“I’m not going to put a time frame (on it) ... It will be quite some time,” he said.\n\nThe question over when the U.S. central bank will first raise rates from the near-zero level they have been since late 2008 is critical to households and businesses alike as they make their plans for spending, investment and hiring.\n\nYellen has argued that clear communications about the Fed’s policy intentions are key.\n\nWith the goal of transparency in mind, the Fed since December 2012 had promised to keep rates low until the unemployment rate fell to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation did not threaten to rise above 2.5 percent.\n\nBut now that unemployment has fallen to 6.7 percent, and the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation is still little more than half of its 2-percent target, policymakers this week decided to jettison that guideline.

Its first meeting with 2014 members earlier this week also marked the debut of new Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen.\n\nAfter the meeting, she said at a news conference that the committee wouldn\'t consider raising interest rates for some time after the Fed\'s bond-purchasing program completely phases out later this year.\n\nNarayana Kocherlakota , new president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank. ORG XMIT: MIN2012113016210944\n\nInvestors initially took Yellen\'s comments to mean that rates could start rising next year. But on Thursday and Friday, big investors and economists began to settle on the view that interest rates likely won\'t rise until 2016. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius, for instance, issued a report that began, ""Rate hikes are far off.""\n\nSince the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero in late 2008 and early 2009 to free up credit and revive the economy, stocks soared in part because they faced less competition from investments tied to interest rates. As a result, the start of a return to a normal interest rate environment is something investors have watched for closely.\n\nFifteen months ago, the policy committee said it wouldn\'t begin to raise rates until U.S. unemployment reached 6.5 percent. But as that figure got closer — it is now 6.7 percent — broader economic conditions remained sluggish. And, in Yellen\'s first big step as chairwoman, the committee dropped the numeric target for a wide range of ""labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.""\n\nKocherlakota\'s vote against that move was noteworthy partly because it was not directed at a policy action but at the way in which the Fed communicates. While dissents like his are routinely publicized, members of the committee are not obligated to discuss them publicly.\n\nKocherlakota said in Friday\'s statement that he decided to explain his opposition because he thinks the new guidance is ""intended to describe the committee\'s decisions for some time to come.""\n\nIn a seven-paragraph statement, Kocherlakota said using the 6.5 percent unemployment target, along with another goal of keeping inflation below 2.5 percent, was ""highly effective"" for setting market expectations over the past 15 months.\n\nHe added: ""The committee could have adopted language of the following form: \'The committee anticipates keeping the fed funds rate in its current range at least until the unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent, as long as the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for [personal consumption expenditure] inflation remains below 2 ¼ percent, longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, and possible risks to financial stability remain well-contained.\' ""\n\nIn speeches and writings for much of the past year, Kocherlakota has argued that the 6.5 percent unemployment target should be lowered to 5.5 percent. ""He\'s been on this point of view for a while,"" said Marvin Goodfriend, a former Fed official who now teaches at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\n\nWith the vote Wednesday and explanation Friday, Kocherlakota became one of only a few Fed members to create a record of dissent in both hawkish and dovish directions.\n\nDuring his 2011 stint on the open market committee, Kocherlakota in one meeting joined two other members in opposing a commitment to near-zero interest rates ""at least through mid-2013."" He and the two others wanted to say ""for an extended period,"" a hawkish view that meant at the time that interest rates might need to rise before the middle of last year.\n\nBut as the nation\'s economic recovery remained slow, Kocherlakota\'s view shifted and he began to express dovish reservations about when to lift rates.', '""The new guidance fosters policy uncertainty and thereby suppresses economic activity,"" Kocherlakota said in a statement released Friday to explain his vote against the change.\nBut on Thursday and Friday, big investors and economists began to settle on the view that interest rates likely won\'t rise until 2016.\nSince the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero in late 2008 and early 2009 to free up credit and revive the economy, stocks soared in part because they faced less competition from investments tied to interest rates.\nAs a result, the start of a return to a normal interest rate environment is something investors have watched for closely.\nDuring his 2011 stint on the open market committee, Kocherlakota in one meeting joined two other members in opposing a commitment to near-zero interest rates ""at least through mid-2013.""']"

But Kocherlakota said he didn’t think that was the case.\n\n“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal. As evidence he pointed to a line in the Fed’s official policy statement that noted, “the change in the (Fed’s) guidance does not indicate any change in the (Fed’s) policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.”\n\nKocherlakota was the lone dissenter at the meeting. In a statement he released earlier Friday, he said he objected to the Fed’s decision to stop using specific numeric markers for inflation and unemployment to guide the public about its plans for interest rates.\n\nIn the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent. The Fed on Wednesday dropped these numerical thresholds and instead provided more general guidance about its plans to keep rates very low for a long time as the economy gains strength. Kocherlakota said this shift has already caused confusion and some doubt about the Fed’s commitment to keeping rates low until inflation and unemployment return to more normal levels.\n\nSince the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement. These projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.\n\nKocherlakota said the market’s focus on those interest-rate projections is misplaced because they don’t indicate the collective view officials reach in the decision-making process.\n\n“I think this is a great example of the challenges of lack of specificity in your forward guidance that confront you in communication,’ he said. “If you’re not specific in the statement, then market participants are just grasping for scraps of information everywhere, including the (projections) as a way to try formulate, ‘What is the committee really thinking?’ ”\n\nKocherlakota said his dissent was about the lack of specificity in the new rate guidance, not concern that the Fed had moved to a more hawkish stance.\n\n“I have a high bar for dissent,” he said. He felt strongly enough about the issue to do so at the meeting Wednesday as he believes it is going to cause problems for the Fed, he said. Asked if he would continue to dissent on the issue, he suggested he wouldn’t.\n\n“This is a debate that’s over,” he said.\n\nKocherlakota emphasized that he thought the Fed needed to be aggressive in signaling to the public that it won’t tolerate inflation running below its 2 percent objective for a long time. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is now closer to 1 percent.', 'Some investors have taken the outcome of the meeting as a move toward a more “hawkish” monetary policy — toward raising interest rates a bit sooner and higher than previously expected.\n“The committee’s intention is not to move to a less accommodative policy,” he told The Wall Street Journal.\nIn the past, the Fed has said it wouldn’t raise short-term interest rates from near zero as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent and inflation remained below 2.5 percent.\nSince the meeting, investors have latched on to interest-rate projections that the Fed puts out as a supplement to its policy statement.\nThese projections showed some officials see interest rates of a quarter to a half percentage point higher in 2015 and 2016 than previously anticipated.']"

28692,http://www.businessinsider.in/Minneapolis-Fed-President-Explains-Why-He-Dissented-In-Wednesdays-Fed-Decision/articleshow/32431973.cms,business,"['Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota was the lone dissenter in Wednesday\'s FOMC decision to maintain the pace of its wind-down of quantitative easing and modify its forward guidance to make it more qualitative and less dependent on a 6.5% unemployment rate threshold.\n\nHe just released a statement detailing his decision to dissent, copied below.\n\n-----------\n\nI view the March 19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement as an unusually significant one. In that statement, the FOMC adopted new forward guidance about the evolution of its target for the federal funds rate. I see that new guidance as being intended to describe the Committee\'s decisions for some time to come.\n\nI dissented from the new guidance for two reasons. The first reason is that the new guidance weakens the credibility of the Committee\'s commitment to target 2 percent inflation. The second reason is that the new guidance fosters policy uncertainty and thereby suppresses economic activity. In what follows, I\'ll elaborate on these reasons, discuss an alternative form of forward guidance, and conclude by strongly endorsing one aspect of the FOMC\'s new forward guidance.\n\nIn terms of credibility: the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has drifted downward over the past few years and is currently near 1 percent. The FOMC\'s new forward guidance does not communicate purposeful steps being taken to facilitate a more rapid increase of inflation back to the 2 percent target. The absence of this kind of communication weakens the credibility of the Committee\'s inflation target, by suggesting that the Committee views persistently sub-2-percent inflation as an acceptable outcome.\n\nIn terms of uncertainty: Currently, most labor market metrics imply that the economy is still well short of maximum employment. In its forward guidance, the Committee provides little information about its desired rate of progress toward maximum employment. Indeed, the guidance provides little quantitative information about what would characterize maximum employment. These omissions create uncertainty about the extent to which the Committee is willing to use monetary stimulus to foster faster growth, and this uncertainty is a drag on economic activity.\n\nHow could the FOMC have done better? I believe that, over the past 15 months, the Committee\'s forward guidance about the fed funds rate has been highly effective at shaping market expectations. That guidance has relied on an unemployment rate threshold of 6.5 percent and an inflation outlook guardrail of 2.5 percent. Given the effectiveness of this quantitative approach, I would have favored adopting a similar approach going forward.\n\nFor example, the Committee could have adopted language of the following form: ""the Committee anticipates keeping the fed funds rate in its current range at least until the unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent, as long as the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for PCE inflation remains below 2 1/4 percent, longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, and possible risks to financial stability remain well-contained."" This alternative guidance communicates the Committee\'s willingness to use monetary policy tools to push inflation back up to 2 percent. It reduces macroeconomic uncertainty by being clearer about the kinds of labor market and inflation conditions that are likely to be associated with an increase in the fed funds rate. Finally, it deals with the unlikely possibility of risks to financial stability through an explicit escape clause.\n\nThere is one key aspect of the Committee\'s new forward guidance that I strongly endorse. The guidance provides information about the Committee\'s intentions for the behavior of the fed funds rate once employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels. Those intentions are appropriate, and communicating them should help stimulate economic activity by reducing uncertainty about the likely path of the fed funds rate once the Committee\'s goals are reached.', ""In that statement, the FOMC adopted new forward guidance about the evolution of its target for the federal funds rate.\nIn what follows, I'll elaborate on these reasons, discuss an alternative form of forward guidance, and conclude by strongly endorsing one aspect of the FOMC's new forward guidance.\nIn terms of credibility: the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation rate has drifted downward over the past few years and is currently near 1 percent.\nI believe that, over the past 15 months, the Committee's forward guidance about the fed funds rate has been highly effective at shaping market expectations.\nThe guidance provides information about the Committee's intentions for the behavior of the fed funds rate once employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels.""]"

In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.\n\nBut the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago.\n\nMedecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.\n\nGilead has also said it plans to license Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, which would be able to sell lower-priced copies of the medication.\n\nShort link:\n\n', 'Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99 percent discount to the U.S. price.\nGilead said it was ""pleased to have finalized an agreement"" for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world.\nLike HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles.\nDoctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment - and prove hugely profitable.\nMedecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.']"

Henry Waxman, Frank Pallone and Diana DeGete, all ranking members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It called Sovaldi a ""breakthrough"" in HCV treatment, but expressed concern that ""a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.""\n\nDue to Sovaldi\'s $84,000 price tag, the letter went on to say that Colorado\'s and Pennsylvania\'s Medicaid programs had already announced that they\'re funding Sovaldi only for the sickest patients, and California\'s is still figuring out its reimbursement policies. The letter also noted that pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) is ""encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi.""\n\nMeanwhile, hepatitis C is a disease found disproportionately among the poor. As a result of all this, the lawmakers told Gilead to provide an explanation of their pricing by April 3.\n\nHealth insurer WellPoint (WLP) chimed in Friday with concerns about new hepatitis C drug costs, said executive Ken Goulet.\n\nBiotech Stocks Cheaper\n\nGilead\'s (GILD) fell nearly 5% to 72.07, a 3-month closing low, but some biotechs selling expensive drugs fell even harder, perhaps on fears of a larger change in the national mood on drug pricing.\n\nAlexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), whose sole drug, Soliris, goes for upward of $400,000 a year, tumbled 8%. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), which also sells an expensive hepatitis C drug called Incivek, retreated 5%.\n\nBiogen Idec (BIIB), which has a costly multiple sclerosis treatment, Tecfidera, lost 8%.\n\nIBD\'s top-rated Medical-Biomed/Biotech group fell 4.5%.\n\nAbbVie (ABBV), which will likely come out with a rival and possibly cheaper rival to Sovaldi later this year, initially rallied Friday, but closed down a fraction.\n\n""It\'s like Gilead caught a cold and the rest of the market caught pneumonia,"" said Tom Vandeventer, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Opportunity Fund .\n\nSovaldi A Bargain?\n\nAnalysts, for the most part, advised staying calm. Michael Yee of RBC Capital Markets wrote in an email to clients Friday that ""pricing discussions could generate headline \'concern,\' but in our view, this underscores that the drug is going to be huge and they\'re curing patients and improving society. ... HCV is an important public health issue (like HIV was) and validates the significance of this market.""\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a client note that she\'d spoken to Gilead officials and they were already making their case that Sovaldi is actually a bargain.\n\n""A liver transplant related to HCV costs up to $250,000 and another $50,000 each year for meds so that the person does not reject the liver,"" she wrote. ""Gilead has co-pay programs in place (in which) the out-of-pocket cost is as low as $5.""\n\nISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that Sovaldi compares favorably to older hepatitis C drugs, especially Vertex\'s Incivek, which goes for $100,000 a year. Sovaldi\'s cure rate is also much higher than Incivek\'s, so the cost ""per cure"" is even better, he said in a webinar Friday.\n\nDems Seek \'Public Shaming\'\n\nSchoenebaum also queried Terry Haines, a longtime Washington lawyer and lobbyist who once served as the senior Republican counsel to the same congres sional committee that sent the letter. Haines responded that the government actually has little power to address drug prices. In his view, what Waxman et al. hope to accomplish is a ""public shaming"" not unlike the one Waxman delivered to the tobacco industry some years ago.\n\n""This letter is a \'bank shot\' that gets things going, with the goal of getting Gilead to significantly lower the price of Sovaldi,"" Haines wrote.\n\nSuch a move could be politically popular, he added. Discontent about the high price of Sovaldi and of new drugs in general has been swelling from payers and the general public for some time now. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a large nonprofit with a history of criticizing Gilead over its HIV drug pricing, recently turned its fire on Sovaldi.\n\n""Gilead\'s latest display of out-of-touch greed comes on the heels of the company\'s January pricing its new hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), at $1,000 per pill ... 1,100% more than Gilead\'s most expensive AIDS drug, Stribild,"" the AHF said in a Feb. 4 press release.\n\nAll this has played out as biotech stocks have hit a lull the last few weeks, after a bull run not seen since the 1990s, leading some to fear that the party may be over. Vandeventer says that while biotechs are a ""high beta group,"" this is probably just a correction. After all, he points out, drug prices have been a political football since the early 1990s.\n\n""It shouldn\'t be completely unexpected that these kinds of issues come to the fore periodically,"" he said.

Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills) and two other Democratic lawmakers asked Gilead Chief Executive John C. Martin to explain the rationale for selling Sovaldi for $1,000 per pill.\n\nMedical experts say previous therapies for hepatitis C helped only about half of patients and had numerous side effects, such as flu-like symptoms, anemia and depression. In comparison, clinical trials of Sovaldi have shown cure rates approaching 90% with far fewer complications.\n\nThe lawmakers noted those potential benefits for patients, but they said the expensive medication could impose substantial costs on taxpayer-funded Medicaid programs and lead to premium increases for those with employer or individual health coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChronic hepatitis C infection affects about 3 million people in the U.S., and more Americans are expected to find out they have the disease as screening becomes more common. Left unchecked, some hepatitis C infections result in liver damage, liver cancer or death.\n\nIn their letter sent Thursday, Waxman, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said, “our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.”\n\nThe lawmakers said they wanted a response from the company by April 3.\n\nGilead has defended its pricing and said that Sovaldi represents a major advance over existing treatments for hepatitis C. The company has said the new therapy can avoid the long-term medical expenses related to liver failure, cancer and transplants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We had heard the concerns raised in the letter and had reached out to a number of members of Congress prior to this letter to address those concerns,” said Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller. “We look forward to the opportunity to meet with them.”\n\nThe news of the lawmakers’ request sent shares of Gilead tumbling $3.46, or nearly 5%, to $72.07 in trading Friday. Some other drug company stocks also fell Friday, partly on concerns that Congress might take a closer look at industry pricing overall.\n\nAnalysts estimate Sovaldi could reach up to $8 billion in sales this year, which would make it one of the top-selling pharmaceutical drugs worldwide.\n\nBeyond this new hepatitis C drug, employers and insurers are concerned about a growing number of expensive specialty medications that are coming onto the market. They say the wide adoption of these drugs could undermine efforts to rein in soaring medical costs.\n\n“This is a harbinger of things to come,” said Steven Pearson, president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit research group in Boston. “Other specialty drugs are being priced in this range.”\n\nA recent report by that institute estimated the annual cost could top $18 billion if half of all California patients with hepatitis C received Sovaldi, which costs $84,000 for a 12-week course, or another new drug, Olysio, which costs about $66,000.\n\nOlysio is a product of Janssen Therapeutics, a unit of healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThis month, a panel of California medical experts met to discuss those estimated costs and determined that Sovaldi was a “low-value” treatment in light of its high price tag. But patient advocates have pushed for full access to the new drugs given their high cure rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOfficials at Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program for lower-income residents, said they don’t know yet how many patients may need these new drugs. More than 1,500 Medi-Cal patients are prescribed drugs for hepatitis C now.\n\nNationwide, health insurers that run Medicaid managed-care plans for states have sought additional government reimbursement to cover these new hepatitis C drugs. Insurance companies say their previously negotiated rates don’t account for these potentially higher costs.\n\nchad.terhune@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune', 'U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc. to justify the price of its new $84,000 drug for hepatitis C patients amid growing concern about the high cost to taxpayers and consumers.\nLeft unchecked, some hepatitis C infections result in liver damage, liver cancer or death.\nBeyond this new hepatitis C drug, employers and insurers are concerned about a growing number of expensive specialty medications that are coming onto the market.\nMore than 1,500 Medi-Cal patients are prescribed drugs for hepatitis C now.\nNationwide, health insurers that run Medicaid managed-care plans for states have sought additional government reimbursement to cover these new hepatitis C drugs.']"

But is the sell-off long term or just a dreary day on Wall Street?\n\nMany thought the selloff was due to Democratic lawmakers coming down on Gilead Sciences Inc. over the pricing of its promising new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which is $84,000 for a 12-week treatment. Shares ended the day off more than 4% to $72.07.\n\nBut there also have been mounting worries over froth forming in the biotech sector and a possible correction on the horizon. It probably won\'t be known just how meaningful Friday\'s selloff was until next week, or beyond. There is one cause for concern, though, as four major biotech exchange-traded funds all lost more than 4% with many hitting historic lows.\n\nOne frequently watched gauge among ETFs, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF , dropped nearly 5% when it was all over. It was noted that the fund neared its 100-day moving average by RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.\n\nYee noted that ""sentiment is rolling over in biotech a bit"" in a note on one big name in the sector, Celgene Corp. , which lost nearly 4% to $144.40 at the close. He also noted that even though Celgene won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday for Otezla, a psoriatic arthritis drug, that stock crashed its 200-day moving average.\n\n""However, we\'ll state it again that the fundamentals [on Celgene] haven\'t changed,"" he said. Yee contends the launch of Otezla should be uneventful.\n\nISI Group\'s Mark Schoenebaum noted data shows the drug isn\'t as powerful as competing treatments but has fewer side effects and is cheaper -- perhaps a strong suit considering Gilead\'s pricing issues. He says although a full-year of Otezla is priced at $22,500, it still is a discount to virtually all other drugs used for the same treatment.

Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent.\n\nSome health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.\n\nSeparately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price.\n\nThe company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said.\n\nA letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health.\n\nSovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.\n\nGilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi.\n\nThe drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.\n\n“What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.\n\nThe head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level.\n\n“Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3.\n\nCOMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER\n\nThe letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.\n\n“The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.”\n\nSovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.”\n\nAnswers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.\n\nSovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.\n\nThe likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.\n\n“We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.”\n\nThese new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.\n\nThe older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.\n\n“Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note.\n\nGilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

Henry A. Waxman (D-Beverly Hills) and two other Democratic lawmakers asked Gilead Chief Executive John C. Martin to explain the rationale for selling Sovaldi for $1,000 per pill.\n\nPrevious therapies for hepatitis C helped only about half of patients and had numerous side effects. In comparison, clinical trials of Sovaldi have shown cure rates approaching 90% with far fewer complications.\n\nFULL COVERAGE: Obamacare rolls out\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawmakers noted those potential benefits for patients, but they said the expensive medication could impose substantial costs on taxpayer-funded Medicaid programs and lead to premium increases for those with employer or individual health coverage.\n\nIn their letter, Waxman, Rep.

Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said “our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it.”\n\nThe lawmakers said they wanted a response from the company by April 3.\n\nGilead has defended its pricing and said that Sovaldi represents a major advance over existing treatments for hepatitis C. The company has said the new therapy can avoid the long-term medical expenses related to liver failure, cancer and transplants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We had heard the concerns raised in the letter and had reached out to a number of members of Congress prior to this letter to address those concerns,” said Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller. “We look forward to the opportunity to meet with them.”\n\nShares of Gilead were off $3.21, or 4%, to $72.32 in Friday trading.\n\nLeft unchecked, some hepatitis C infections result in liver damage, liver cancer or death.

They say the wide adoption of these drugs could undermine efforts to rein in soaring medical costs.\n\nA recent report estimated the annual cost could top $18 billion if half of all California patients with hepatitis C received Sovaldi, which costs $84,000 for a 12-week course, or another new drug, Olysio, which costs about $66,000.\n\nThis month, a panel of California medical experts met to discuss those potential costs and determined that Sovaldi was a “low-value” treatment in light of its high price tag.\n\nALSO:\n\nRate of babies delivered early at U.S. hospitals tumbles\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReport criticizes health plans for treatment of chronic ailments\n\n\n\nAnthem Blue Cross to raise some health premiums as much as 25%\n\n', 'U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc. to justify the price of its new $84,000 drug for hepatitis C patients amid growing concern about the high cost to taxpayers and consumers.\nPrevious therapies for hepatitis C helped only about half of patients and had numerous side effects.\nLeft unchecked, some hepatitis C infections result in liver damage, liver cancer or death.\nChronic hepatitis C infection affects about 3 million people in the U.S., and more Americans are expected to find out they have the disease as screening becomes more common.\nBeyond this new hepatitis C drug, employers and insurers are concerned about a growing number of expensive specialty medications that are coming onto the market.']"

Biogen Idec fell 6 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 2.5 percent and Celgene Corp was down 2 percent.\n\nSome health insurers, including the government\'s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead\'s new hepatitis C drug for patients. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients for the first time, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars.\n\nA letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on Sovaldi discounts on the recently approved medicine to payors and patients.\n\nThe drug is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions.\n\nGilead did not immediately return calls seeking comment on the lawmakers\' letter on Sovaldi.\n\nThe drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market.\n\n""What is really scaring folks is the volume,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone.\n\nThe head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a ""reasonable"" level.\n\n""Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,"" the letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide this briefing no later than April 3.\n\nCOMBO DRUG RAISES PRICE FURTHER\n\nThe letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000.\n\n""The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,"" the letter said. It added, ""The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.""\n\nSovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a ""breakthrough therapy.""\n\nAnswers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi\'s price and the public health impact of insurers\' and public health programs\' decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis C.\n\nSovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials.\n\nThe likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said.\n\n""We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,"" he said. ""In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.""\n\nThese new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines.\n\nThe older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less.\n\nJP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects.\n\n""Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to \'guarantee a cure\' to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,"" Meacham said in a research note.\n\nGilead shares were off $2.04, or 2.7 percent, at $73.48 after falling as far as $70.85 earlier in the day.

Reports indicate that Gilead intends to sell Sovaldi at $84,000 per treatment, which will affect coverage for patients with public or private insurance.\n\nFDA approved Sovaldi in December 2013 after the drug received an FDA Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation, which is intended to expedite review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe full text of the letter is available below and online here(http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Martin-Gilead-Sciences-Hepatitis-C-Drug-Sovaldi-Pricing-2014-3-20.pdf). March 20, 2014\n\nDr. John C. Martin , PhD\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nGilead Sciences Inc.\n\n333 Lakeside Drive\n\nFoster City, CA 94404\n\nDear Dr. Martin:\n\nWe are writing to request a briefing from Gilead Sciences Inc. to answer important questions about the pricing of the company\'s recently approved Hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi. A breakthrough treatment for Hepatitis C could result in significant public health benefits. Approximately 3.2 million Americans have a chronic Hepatitis C infection, and the illness causes approximately 15,000 deaths in the United States annually. There is no vaccine for Hepatitis C, which causes fatal cirrhosis or liver cancer in up to 5% of affected individuals.\n\nThere is evidence that Sovaldi could be a breakthrough treatment. According to FDA , ""Sovaldi was effective in treating multiple types of the hepatitis C virus. ... demonstrat[ing] efficacy in participants who could not tolerate or take an interferon-based treatment regimen and in participants with liver cancer awaiting liver transplantation, addressing unmet medical needs in these populations.""\n\nOur concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it. Reports indicate that Gilead intends to sell Sovaldi at $84,000 per treatment. In cases where Sovaldi is prescribed with other treatments the costs could be even higher. According to a recent Reuters report, ""many doctors are requesting a $150,000 combination of Sovaldi ... and Olysio.""\n\nThese costs are likely to be too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and those with private insurance. Because Hepatitis C is ""concentrated in low-income, minority patients,"" the affordability problems are likely to be particularly acute for state Medicaid programs and those patients served by these programs. Colorado and Pennsylvania have already announced that their Medicaid programs will be limiting use of the new drug to ""only the sickest patients,"" such as those already suffering from liver disease. California\'s Medicaid program is still considering how and when to reimburse for the drug. The large pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts has said it is ""encouraging some doctors in its networks to delay prescribing Sovaldi."" Even in cases where public or private insurers pay for the medication, it will impose substantial costs on taxpayers and could cause premium increases for those with employer or individual coverage.\n\nThe extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding its approval. In April 2013 , Gilead submitted a New Drug Application to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of Sovaldi for the treatment of Hepatitis C. As part of the request, Gilead filed for and received a Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation, which reduces the FDA review goal date from ten to six months. This designation is awarded to medicines that meet certain criteria, including ""that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy."" The FDA approved Sovaldi on an expedited basis on December 6, 2013 .\n\nThis history raises many questions about Gilead\'s approach to pricing this drug and the impact the high cost may have on public health. In order to address these issues, we ask that you brief Committee staff on a number of key questions, including:\n\n(1) The methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi\'s pricing.\n\n(2) The extent to which Gilead is providing discounts to low-income patients and to key government or private-sector purchasers of the drug.\n\n(3) The value to the company of the expedited review provided under the Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation and how any savings provided by the expedited review factored into pricing decisions for the drug.\n\n(4) The public health impact of insurers\' and public health programs\' decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with Hepatitis C.\n\nWe ask that you provide this briefing no later than April 3, 2014 . Please contact Brian Cohen of the Committee staff at (202) 225-3641 if you have any questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHenry A.

A Pentagon spokesman said Friday that 34 sailors from the frigate USS Elrod are aboard the tanker.\n\nThe tanker saga illustrated the extreme weakness of Libya's government, vying with militias for dominance since the 2011 ouster and death of longtime strongman Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nThe militia commander controlling the terminal where the tanker took on its load, Ibrahim Jedran, is part of a movement demanding autonomy for the east of the country.

As a result, the country's exports of its biggest revenue earner have slowed to a trickle.

Russia’s MICEX stock index was down 1 percent.\n\nWhile some analysts say U.S. equities are vulnerable to any escalation in geopolitical tensions with Russia, stocks were boosted by Moscow’s assertion that no other Ukrainian region would be subject to intervention.\n\n“The path of least resistance for markets is up, and so far it doesn’t think the Ukraine issue is too big of a negative since no one really thinks that Putin will do anything too drastic,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio. “Of course if things do heat up, it would really become a headwind for markets.”\n\nCompanies tied to the pace of economic growth were among the biggest gainers Friday, with energy and industrial shares rallying. Joy Global Inc jumped 4 percent to $57.38 while Halliburton Co was up 2.6 percent to $58.84.\n\nOn the downside, Nike Inc late Thursday said growing pressures from weak emerging market currencies would take a toll on profit. The athletic apparel maker, which gets about 30 percent of revenue from emerging markets, also said China sales would be unchanged or slightly down this quarter. Shares fell 3.3 percent to $76.63.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average was up 110.11 points, or 0.67 percent, at 16,441.16. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 9.23 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,881.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3.34 points, or 0.08 percent, at 4,315.95.\n\nThe S&P 500 briefly climbed to a record high of 1,883.97, just over its previous record of 1,883.57. If the index’s current levels hold, that would represent a record close. For the week, both the Dow and S&P are up 2 percent while the Nasdaq is up 1.4 percent.\n\nFirst Solar continued its recent meteoric rise, climbing 3.9 percent on Friday, its sixth straight daily increase. The stock has jumped 38 percent over that period.\n\nSymantec Corp shares weighed on the Nasdaq, tumbling 13 percent to $18.16 a day after it fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years.\n\nDespite recent market strength, trading volume has been anemic on positive market days, suggesting limited conviction behind the move. However, volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expire alongside multiple index rebalances. Credit Suisse estimates $14 billion in gross trading from the S&P 500 index rebalance, with another $6 billion from rebalancing in other indexes.\n\nIn earnings news, Tiffany & Co reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings and gave a profit outlook that were below estimates. However, shares rose 1.2 percent to $92.23. Darden Restaurants Inc reported third-quarter results largely in line with expectations and affirmed its plan to divest its Red Lobster business. Shares rose 3.1 percent to $50.82.\n\nLin Media LLC jumped 22 percent to $26.21. Media General Inc agreed to buy the company for $1.6 billion. Media General jumped 4 percent to $18.04.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve late Thursday said big U.S. banks have enough capital buffers to withstand a drastic economic downturn. The central bank said 29 out of 30 major banks met the minimum hurdle in its annual health check.\n\nThe only bank to fall under the 5 percent requirement for top-tier capital was Zion Bancorp, which said it would resubmit a capital plan to the Fed. Shares of Zion fell 3.5 percent to $31.84.

In order to comply with the law, the Federal Reserve initially proposed limiting the fees to $0.12 per debit card transaction, but finally set it to $0.21 per swipe with the possibility of a few cents increase to cover some costs such as fraud. Prior the implementation of the Fed ruling, banks were charging $0.44 per debit card transaction.\n\nSeveral retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) among others filed a case requesting a federal judge to nullify the ruling of the Federal Reserve.

District Court Judge Richard Leon opined that the Fed rule “utterly indefensible” interpretation and “runs completely afoul of the text, design and purpose” of the Dodd-Frank law.\n\nToday, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ruled that the Federal Reserve was reasonable in setting the limit for debit card swipe fees. However, the court noted that the Dodd-Frank amendment was written poorly and a clarification is necessary to determine the appropriate cap for debit card transaction fees. The Court of Appeal said, “Its language is confusing and its structure convoluted.”\n\nAnalysts’ comments\n\nIn a note to investors, Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies believed that the ruling of the Court of Appeals is positive for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) as it eliminates concerns regarding its superior U.S. signature debit market share being eroded by increased competition, which should have been the case if the fed lost the exclusivity part of the appeal.\n\nKupferberg believe that the ruling will “likely be an incremental positive” for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and it “would reduce potential risks of further downward pressure on debit network fees paid by issuers.”\n\nOn the other hand, analysts at JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) opined that the ruling was a “big win” for the payments industry particularly for Visa Inc (NYSE:V) because it can keep its 70% share in the signature debit card market.', 'The shares of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) fluctuated today after the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the ruling of the Federal Reserve concerning debit card swipe fees reasonable.\nPrior the implementation of the Fed ruling, banks were charging $0.44 per debit card transaction.\nLast year, a District Court Judge in Washington tossed the Federal Reserve rule and cited that it misinterpreted the Dodd-Frank law.\nToday, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ruled that the Federal Reserve was reasonable in setting the limit for debit card swipe fees.\nHowever, the court noted that the Dodd-Frank amendment was written poorly and a clarification is necessary to determine the appropriate cap for debit card transaction fees.']"

The appeals court ruling upholding the Fed’s cap was a blow to an industry already buffeted by public and congressional outrage over the massive data breach that hit Target Corp. during the holiday season and other data-security violations at big retailers.\n\nCongress mandated a ceiling on debit-card swipe fees as part of the 2010 financial regulatory overhaul. Prior to the cap, fees averaged 44 cents per swipe. The Fed had initially proposed a 12-cent fee limit, and the retailers argued that the Fed buckled under pressure from bank lobbyists when it doubled that level.\n\nThe retailers had argued that the Fed deviated from the 2010 law’s intent by factoring banks’ expenses into the cap that the law didn’t allow.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the appeals court said that in making that argument, “far from summiting the steep hill, the merchants have barely left basecamp.” The judges said they decided to defer to the Fed’s “reasonable interpretation” of the law and to reject the retailers’ challenge.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, one of the parties that had sued the Fed, said Friday that it was reviewing the ruling and will decide whether to appeal it.\n\n“NRF is disappointed and remains confident that the Federal Reserve erred when it set the swipe-fee cap far higher than intended by Congress,” Mallory Duncan, the group’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The Fed ignored congressional intent, and worked to shield debit-card companies and big banks.”\n\nThe Fed, which had appealed the lower court ruling, said Friday that it was pleased with the appeals court decision.\n\nThe banking industry welcomed the ruling. “Reasonable minds have prevailed,” Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement.\n\nHunt said the group still believes the mandate for a fee cap is flawed, but also acknowledges that further changes to the fees “would only pile on the negative consequences for consumers.”\n\n“Make no doubt about it — consumers must come first in this process, not the bottom-line of retailers,” Hunt said.\n\nThe American Bankers Association, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, the Independent Community Bankers of America and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions also said they were happy with the appeals court decision.\n\nThe fight over debit card fees pitted two powerful and politically influential industries against each other, with billions of dollars at stake.\n\nBanks had lobbied hard against the Fed’s originally proposed cap, saying the lower fees wouldn’t cover the cost of handling transactions, maintaining their networks and preventing fraud. Attempts by some big banks to compensate by charging consumers monthly fees for using debit cards sparked a nationwide furor in late 2011, leading the banks to drop their plans.\n\nBanks and big retailers also have faced off more recently over the Target data breach, which affected an estimated 40 million credit and debit card accounts. At issue is which industry bears more responsibility for protecting consumers’ personal information.\n\nThe retailers argue that banks must upgrade the security technology for the credit and debit cards they issue. The banks retort that newer electronic-chip technology wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, and retailers must tighten their own security systems for processing card payments.\n\nThe Fed’s cap is the first limit on debit card fees. Before it took effect in October 2011, banks had negotiated such fees with merchants. A big chain like Starbucks would likely get a better rate than a local coffee shop because it handles more customers. The fees were typically based on a percentage of the purchase price.\n\nIn addition to the National Retail Federation, the suit against the Fed was brought by the National Association of Convenience Stores; the National Restaurant Association; the Food Marketing Institute; Boscov’s Department Store, a chain of 40 stores based in Reading, Pa.; and Miller Oil Co. of Norfolk, Va., which operates convenience stores and gas stations.\n\nMiller Oil has said it used to pay about 16 cents per transaction in debit swipe fees.\n\nThe Fed rule doesn’t apply to credit cards, government-issued debit cards, prepaid cards or cards issued by banks and credit unions with assets under $10 billion.\n\n(© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

The fees reimburse banks for costs involved in offering debit cards.\n\nAt the instruction of Congress, the Fed in 2011 limited the fees to 21 cents per transaction. A U.S. district court in July 2013 agreed with a group of retailers that lawmakers intended the cap to be lower and overturned the Fed’s rule.\n\nThe three-member panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the Fed on Friday, saying the law’s “ambiguity” gave regulators leeway to set a higher fee cap.\n\n“Because neither agencies nor courts have authority to disregard the demands of even poorly drafted legislation, we must do our best to discern Congress’s intent,” the panel wrote in its opinion.\n\nIt said the rules “generally rest on reasonable constructions of the statute.”\n\nThe appeals panel did direct the Fed to better explain the way it treated costs to banks of monitoring transactions for potential fraud.\n\nA Fed spokesperson said the agency was pleased with the outcome.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, whose members include Wal-Mart and JCPenney, and the National Restaurant Association, and other groups sued the Fed in 2011 over the fee cap. Representatives of the groups said they were disappointed with the ruling and were considering appealing the decision.\n\n“To have fees that continue to be so unreasonable in the debit card space is detrimental to the folks that we represent as well as ultimately their customers,” said Liz Garner, director of commerce and entrepreneurship at the restaurant group.\n\n“We are absolutely considering an appeal. Our lawyers are still kind of digging through the opinion that came out today and seeing what our options are,” she said.\n\nThe groups could appeal to the full appellate court or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFEE CAP\n\nSwipe fees, also known as interchange fees, are set by Visa , MasterCard and other card networks. Before Congress intervened, the fees paid by retailers were about 44 cents per transaction.\n\nHoping that lower fees would result in lower prices for consumers, lawmakers called for a cap in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.\n\nThey directed the Fed to set a limit that would cover the costs to banks to provide the cards, ignoring any expenses that were not tied to specific debit transactions.\n\nThe Fed decided network processing fees, costs to monitor transactions for fraud and other expenses were relevant, even though they were not specifically mentioned in the law, and it incorporated them into the 21-cent cap.\n\nMerchants argued those costs went beyond what was allowed under the law.\n\nThe appeals panel said Dodd-Frank’s language was “confusing and its structure convoluted”, but determined that it did leave room for the Fed to consider additional costs.\n\nBanks, which opposed capping fees and supported the Fed’s defense of its higher limits, applauded the appeals court’s decision.\n\n“Reasonable minds have prevailed in vacating the district court’s ruling to affirm the existing rule,” Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, a lobby group for banks, said in a statement.\n\n“This drawn-out fight should put on notice those members of Congress who insist upon interfering with the free market.”\n\nThe panel also sided with the Fed on a rule related to networks that process debit transactions. Retailers argued the Fed did not do enough to promote competition among those networks, as Dodd-Frank required.\n\nVisa’s shares were up 1.9 percent after the release, while those of MasterCard were down 2.3 percent.\n\nThe case is NACS v.

Fannie and Freddie don’t issue home loans, but buy them from lenders and package them into guaranteed securities to sell to investors.\n\nInstead, they were brought into the legal status of conservatorship, under the management of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nThe consequences of that decision are now playing out, as Congress wrestles with what to do with them. Both parties have said the two companies must be dissolved, and the Senate Banking Committee chairman earlier this month announced a bill that would do just that, after the House Financial Services Committee passed a more conservative approach to the same goal last summer.\n\nEven more importantly, however, the two companies have returned to positive cash flow, in a big way.\n\nIn 2013 alone, Fannie and Freddie paid out $130 billion in dividends to the Treasury. Through the first quarter of 2014, they will have produced $203 billion in total for the government, according to the FHFA.\n\nThat cash flow has complicated the issue of resolving the two government-sponsored enterprises.\n\nFor one thing, activist hedge funds want a piece of it.\n\nLed by Fairholme Capital, owners of Fannie and Freddie’s shares sued the government for taking, starting in 2012, all of Fannie and Freddie’s income above what was needed to keep them afloat.\n\nFairholme and other hedge funds also have proposed that the government sell them Fannie and Freddie’s mortgage insurance business.\n\nIt’s clear why they’re interested: Over the next 10 years, the Office of Management and Budget projects the two GSEs to bring in another $164 billion even as their business slows, if they’re not shuttered before then.\n\nBut two new analyses undercut the administration’s claims about Fannie and Freddie’s profitability.\n\nAccording to reports from the conservative Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute, the loan guarantees made by the GSEs should be considered liabilities alongside the incoming revenues.\n\nWhen the possibility of loan losses is taken into account, Fannie and Freddie might actually be net liabilities to the government. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress\' nonpartisan official scorekeeper, estimated in its most recent budget outlook that the GSEs\' operations would cost the government roughly $19 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe CBO considers Fannie and Freddie, and their liabilities related to mortgage guarantees, effectively part of the government. The administration, on the other hand, “treats them as if they were a third-party"" entity, noted Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and former CBO analyst Deborah Lucas in an event at the Bipartisan Policy Center on Wednesday.\n\nNot only does the CBO analysis yield a drastically different picture of Fannie and Freddie’s current budgetary status, but it also has implications for the proposals circulating in Congress.\n\nFor instance, the House GOP bill, which would eliminate government backstops in the secondary mortgage market, would have to yield more than $164 billion in deficit savings to break even for the federal government, by the OMB analysis. But CBO scored the bill as saving $5.7 billion.\n\nThe Senate bill, which would retain a government role in guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities, is harder to assess, because it hasn’t received a CBO score. But it would involve bringing the mortgage-insurance business of Fannie and Freddie onto the government’s books and explicitly guaranteeing the $5.2 billion of outstanding debt, according to Cato.\n\nThe study’s authors, Mark Calabria and Ike Brannon, write that while a “booming economy” would mean few risks for taxpayers, “if the housing market were to have another swoon, the government would undoubtedly find itself having to cover some portion of this debt.”\n\nHeritage recommends putting the GSEs on budget, right now, to clarify the situation. “Improper accounting in the budget for the downside risks that the GSEs pose for American taxpayers is creating the illusion that the GSEs are a free lunch for Washington,” wrote Romina Boccia.\n\nOther analysts disagree, pointing to the hedge funds’ interest in taking over the mortgage businesses as evidence of their value.\n\nJust one more thorny issue to untangle in the long process of determining Fannie and Freddie’s fate.', 'Fannie and Freddie don’t issue home loans, but buy them from lenders and package them into guaranteed securities to sell to investors.\nIn 2013 alone, Fannie and Freddie paid out $130 billion in dividends to the Treasury.\nFairholme and other hedge funds also have proposed that the government sell them Fannie and Freddie’s mortgage insurance business.\nWhen the possibility of loan losses is taken into account, Fannie and Freddie might actually be net liabilities to the government.\nThe CBO considers Fannie and Freddie, and their liabilities related to mortgage guarantees, effectively part of the government.']"

28862,http://www.businessinsider.in/Fannie-Mae-And-Freddie-Mac-Destruction-Delays/articleshow/32446306.cms,business,"['A flawed reform of America\'s housing-finance market.\n\nA rare area of agreement about the financial crisis of 2008 is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at the core of the meltdown and are in urgent need of reform. On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.\n\nThe plan has received widespread attention in part because it appears to address the most evident problems of Fannie and Freddie and because it is deemed likely to be approved by Congress. Yet neither of these assumptions, on deeper examination, seems to be true.\n\nTo satisfy those who want low-priced mortgages on terms that private markets would never endorse, the plan makes explicit the government guarantee on debt which had been implicit for Fannie and Freddie. This would lower the interest rate on high-risk loans, while obscuring the cost of the subsidy.\n\nTo placate those who worry that this in turn would leave the government stuck with mountains of dud loans, a 10% capital cushion must be provided by investors to absorb initial losses.\n\nA fee of 0.1% would be charged on all mortgage-backed bonds, with the proceeds going to three funds, two pre-existing, that will provide subsidies for housing. An as-yet undetermined insurance charge will be levied on top. The result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, ""would be a strong step forward"" to fixing ""our flawed housing system"".\n\nIf only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie. The first objection is that the law would create an unwieldy bureaucracy, with a regulator atop other entities devoted to overseeing functions such as syndicating loans or bundling the loans of small banks.\n\nWhen the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first. Then they tanked--presumably because investors reached page 387 of the 442-page text and found enshrined in legislation an earlier 2012 order by the Treasury that expropriated from private investors all profits made by Fannie and Freddie.\n\nThe move is unlikely to help attract the private money needed to supply the 10% in equity underpinning bonds issued under the new plan.\n\nOpponents of Fannie and Freddie contend that the two played a key role in the crisis by encouraging the issuance of loans with tiny down payments through a benign-sounding ""affordable housing"" mandate. Nothing much has changed. Under the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted.\n\nStrewn through the proposed law are words such as ""affordable"", ""equal access"" and ""underserved communities"", which suggest that lending decisions will be based on political rather than credit criteria. ""The result"", says Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, ""will be risky lending for those least able to cope.""\n\nThe underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups. A better approach would be to handle these goals separately and explicitly.\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist', 'A rare area of agreement about the financial crisis of 2008 is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at the core of the meltdown and are in urgent need of reform.\nThe plan has received widespread attention in part because it appears to address the most evident problems of Fannie and Freddie and because it is deemed likely to be approved by Congress.\nIf only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie.\nWhen the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first.\nThe underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups.']"

The once private stock corporations and now wards of the government, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, didn\'t precipitate the housing bust. They weren\'t even the main issuers of faulty mortgages that imploded with the Great Recession. It was the federally-supervised commercial banks themselves that misrepresented many of the mortgages sold to Fannie and Freddie, thereby giving them the cover of AAA-rated assets, when they were much closer to junk bond quality.\n\nFed Chairman Alan Greenspan had lowered short term interest rates below what was the inflation rate at that time -- some 3 percent -- whereas his fed funds rate was as low as 0.5 percent. (That meant if money was lent at below the inflation rate, it was basically free money because inflation would eat away at the amount owed so that it was actually worth less when paid off, or sold, than the face amount of the debt.)\n\nAnd banks jumped into the housing bubble that resulted, almost ignoring the most basic lending safeguards from such ""free"" money, such as verifying income and assets of the borrowers that Fannie and Freddie required. In other words, Fannie and Freddie guaranteed that nothing was ""stated"" on the loan application that wasn\'t verified.\n\nThe GSEs themselves were also at fault for allowing mortgage banks such as Countrywide Financial (acquired by Bank of America) to package and sell Mortgage Backed Securities to Fannie and Freddie that mainly consisted of negatively amortized ""liar"" loans with very low initial payment rates, and little or no income and asset verification. But that was a small portion of the defaulted loans, and in fact Fannie and Freddie guaranteed mortgages have far and away the lowest default rates.\n\nWall Street insiders now believe that up to $50B could be the tab to settle all the pending cases, according to the New York Times. Some $1.96 Trillion in so-called private-label mortgages were issued by banks from 2005 to 2008 during the height of the housing bubble, according to the latest figures.\n\nAs of January, the FHFA has settled six of the private-label RMBS cases, recovering nearly $8 billion for taxpayers. Whether due to a lack of adequate supervision, or outright fraudulent misrepresentation of the credit quality of those mortgages, these banks sold Fannie and Freddie mortgages that didn\'t meet the strict credit standards of the GSEs.\n\nBanks such as JP Morgan Chase ($5.1B), Deutsche Bank ($1.9B) and now Credit Suisse ($885M) have settled, while admitting they had inadequate oversight. But Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are holding out, so are going to trial sometime in midyear 2014.\n\nOthers that have settled include, GE (Ally Bank), United Bank of Switzerland and Citigroup. They had failed to prove in federal court that the mortgages underlying their Mortgage Backed Securities sold to Fannie and Freddie were due to the busted housing bubble that caused the loss of some $5 trillion in real estate values, rather than their faulty underwriting practices.\n\nTwelve of the cases remain, including FHFA\'s lawsuits against Barclays Bank (BCS), Bank of America (BAC), Credit Suisse Holdings (CS), First Horizon National Corp., Goldman Sachs & Co.

They were as much a victim of deceptive lending practices as the borrowers and homeowners who lost out due to the resulting Great Recession.\n\nHarlan Green © 2014', 'This tells us where the real faults lies for the credit bubble that led to the housing bubble.\nThe once private stock corporations and now wards of the government, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, didn\'t precipitate the housing bust.\nIn other words, Fannie and Freddie guaranteed that nothing was ""stated"" on the loan application that wasn\'t verified.\nBut that was a small portion of the defaulted loans, and in fact Fannie and Freddie guaranteed mortgages have far and away the lowest default rates.\nWhether due to a lack of adequate supervision, or outright fraudulent misrepresentation of the credit quality of those mortgages, these banks sold Fannie and Freddie mortgages that didn\'t meet the strict credit standards of the GSEs.']"
28865,http://www.businessinsider.in/Americas-Housing-Finance-Reform-Plan-Is-Much-Worse-Than-People-Realize/articleshow/32446382.cms,business,"['A flawed reform of America\'s housing-finance market.\n\nA rare area of agreement about the financial crisis of 2008 is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were at the core of the meltdown and are in urgent need of reform. On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.\n\nThe plan has received widespread attention in part because it appears to address the most evident problems of Fannie and Freddie and because it is deemed likely to be approved by Congress. Yet neither of these assumptions, on deeper examination, seems to be true.\n\nTo satisfy those who want low-priced mortgages on terms that private markets would never endorse, the plan makes explicit the government guarantee on debt which had been implicit for Fannie and Freddie. This would lower the interest rate on high-risk loans, while obscuring the cost of the subsidy.\n\nTo placate those who worry that this in turn would leave the government stuck with mountains of dud loans, a 10% capital cushion must be provided by investors to absorb initial losses.\n\nA fee of 0.1% would be charged on all mortgage-backed bonds, with the proceeds going to three funds, two pre-existing, that will provide subsidies for housing. An as-yet undetermined insurance charge will be levied on top. The result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, ""would be a strong step forward"" to fixing ""our flawed housing system"".\n\nIf only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie. The first objection is that the law would create an unwieldy bureaucracy, with a regulator atop other entities devoted to overseeing functions such as syndicating loans or bundling the loans of small banks.\n\nWhen the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first. Then they tanked--presumably because investors reached page 387 of the 442-page text and found enshrined in legislation an earlier 2012 order by the Treasury that expropriated from private investors all profits made by Fannie and Freddie.\n\nThe move is unlikely to help attract the private money needed to supply the 10% in equity underpinning bonds issued under the new plan.\n\nOpponents of Fannie and Freddie contend that the two played a key role in the crisis by encouraging the issuance of loans with tiny down payments through a benign-sounding ""affordable housing"" mandate. Nothing much has changed. Under the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted.\n\nStrewn through the proposed law are words such as ""affordable"", ""equal access"" and ""underserved communities"", which suggest that lending decisions will be based on political rather than credit criteria. ""The result"", says Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, ""will be risky lending for those least able to cope.""\n\nThe underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups. A better approach would be to handle these goals separately and explicitly.\n\nClick here to subscribe to The Economist', 'On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.\nThe result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, ""would be a strong step forward"" to fixing ""our flawed housing system"".\nIf only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie.\nUnder the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted.\nThe underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups.']"

But Congress is reluctant to address the politically sensitive issue, especially...\n\nReforming the U.S. housing-finance system remains the last major piece of unfinished business from the 2008 financial crisis. But Congress is reluctant to address the politically sensitive issue, especially now that midterm elections loom. Still, in a hopeful sign, leaders of the Senate Banking Committee have offered the broad outlines of a promising bipartisan proposal.\n\nThe plan, announced this month by Senators Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), builds on a previous effort led by Senators Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.). Like the earlier proposal, it would do away with the now federally-owned mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In their place would be a new Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation that assumes some risk on taxpayers� behalf, but not nearly as much.\n\nDuring the financial crisis, when defaults on home loans cascaded out of control, investors looked to Fannie and Freddie to cover the losses. But both government-sponsored entities had been privatized long before. So the federal government resumed control, launching a bailout that cost taxpayers $187 billion.\n\nUnder the Johnson-Crapo plan, investors in mortgage-backed securities would have to absorb the first 10 percent of any future losses. Using fees collected on securities, the government would insure against additional failure.\n\nOther plan features: Borrowers would have to make a down payment of at least 5 percent. (First-time buyers would have to pay 3.5 percent.) And a fund supported by industry fees would be created to help pay for affordable housing.\n\nThe proposal will have to be presented, and debated, in greater detail. But eliminating Fannie and Freddie is an important step toward a better system. Though both are now highly profitable, they ensure that the government remains an outsized player in the housing market, putting taxpayers unfairly at risk.\n\nMany conservative Republicans wish to end the federal role entirely. But an exclusively private marketplace would kill the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which has long driven U.S. home ownership.\n\nTo best reform the system, Americans must join in discussing what U.S. housing policy should be. Should it encourage home ownership? If so, to what extent? Should it do more to ensure an ample supply of rental housing? By what mechanism?\n\nYoung people struggling to get a foothold in the current economy may view these questions differently than their parents once did, and deserve a voice. So do elderly Americans, who may wish to stay in their homes or may long for better alternatives.\n\nHelped by plenty of lobbyists, the financial and housing industries, along with other well-heeled interests, are too likely to dominate the debate. But the public should not let them. Americans face a unique opportunity to reshape the way they live, and how they pay for it. They should not let this moment pass.', 'Reforming the U.S. housing-finance system remains the last major piece of unfinished business from the 2008 financial crisis.\nAnd a fund supported by industry fees would be created to help pay for affordable housing.\nThough both are now highly profitable, they ensure that the government remains an outsized player in the housing market, putting taxpayers unfairly at risk.\nTo best reform the system, Americans must join in discussing what U.S. housing policy should be.\nHelped by plenty of lobbyists, the financial and housing industries, along with other well-heeled interests, are too likely to dominate the debate.']"

Bove, having digested the proposed Johnson/Crapo bill, is incredulous that such a measure will come to pass, going into detail about what he sees as the fatal flaws in the bill.\n\nFull Faith and Credit of the United States\n\nI have now read the bulk of the Johnson/Crapo Bill. It appears to have a major contradiction and it is clearly outlining the nationalization of the bulk of the housing finance industry in the United States. Indications are that the political will to accomplish this result is very high. Thus, the risk still exists that the investments in Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) could be wiped out.\n\nI find it difficult to believe that the Congress will pass a Bill that increases the cost of owning a house while at the same time increasing taxpayer risk. Time will tell but I am staying with the Buy ratings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac: Taxpayer Protection\n\nThe short title of the Johnson Crapo Act includes the words ”Taxpayer Protection Act.” The many provisions of the Bill reference the need to protect taxpayers against upsets that can occur in the housing finance industry.\n\nYet, the Bill indicates that the debt of Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) and the insurance placed by the newly created Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC) will be backed by the “Full Faith and Credit of the United States.” In effect, the Bill would have the United States government explicitly accept an obligation that it legally does not have at this moment.\n\nIt makes the taxpayer 100% accountable for any losses or financial problems that impact that portion of the housing finance markets associated with the new government program. How the taxpayer is being protected by accepting 100% of a liability that s/he has legally zero percent of now is confusing to me.\n\nBased on current numbers the Federal debt could rise by $5 trillion if this Bill is passed. The debt ceiling that was the focus of a major political battle last year would have to be raised immediately to a level that no one could conceive of a year ago. Plus, if the new system created by this Bill is successful, as the FMIC grows in size so would the U.S. budgetary obligation. Based on all the reports I am receiving Republicans as well as Democrats think that this is a good idea.\n\nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac: Nationalization\n\nNote the following:\n\nThe newly proposed Federal National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (which would replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) would be a government agency with its governing Board selected by the President.\n\nThe Mortgage Insurance Fund that it creates would invest 100% of its reserves in government securities.\n\nThe FMIC would establish a number of Small Lender Mutuals. Their capitalization, fees, dividends, acquisitions and other activities would be controlled by a government agency (the FMIC). The initial board of the Mutuals will be put in place by a government agency.\n\nThe Securitization Platform’s initial directors will be nominated by a government agency. All of the rules that the Platform must conform to will be approved by a government agency. The product it buys and the suppliers of that product are determined by a government agency. The method under which it insures a portion of covered securities will be based on rules established by a government agency.\n\nRepeating from above any losses accrued from this system above 10% will be absorbed by the taxpayer.\n\nIn sum, the government will create a nationally sponsored entity that will have the full faith and credit of the United States behind it, and that the government will totally control. This nationalized entity will compete in the housing finance market against private home finance companies that will not be backed by the government.\n\nThe American people will elect no person associated with the new agency (as was the case with Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC)). The agency will increase the cost of a mortgage to homeowners by at least 50 to 75 basis points according to observers. The agency will be immune from any demands made by the President, Congress, and the American people because it will be funded by its constituents – those selected by the government. If this is what the Congress wants for this nation, so be it.', 'Thus, the risk still exists that the investments in Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC) could be wiped out.\nTime will tell but I am staying with the Buy ratings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac: Taxpayer ProtectionThe short title of the Johnson Crapo Act includes the words ”Taxpayer Protection Act.” The many provisions of the Bill reference the need to protect taxpayers against upsets that can occur in the housing finance industry.\nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac: NationalizationNote the following:The newly proposed Federal National Mortgage Insurance Corporation (which would replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) would be a government agency with its governing Board selected by the President.\nThe American people will elect no person associated with the new agency (as was the case with Fannie Mae / Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac / Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTCBB:FMCC)).']"

28893,http://www.today.com/money/are-you-paying-too-much-your-mortgage-2D79410724,business,"['Are you shopping for mortgages and comparing them to see which one is the better deal? Were you offered a higher-priced mortgage? How can you even tell?\n\nConsumers in search of a mortgage should be especially wary of higher-priced loans when comparing rates and fees. It becomes especially important in the shopping phase because lenders quote rates and fees competitively in an attempt to capture market share. But be careful — one lender\'s fees and lower interest rate might actually be a higher-priced loan even if it seems like a better offer. So this is where the annual percentage rate (APR) comes in.\n\nThe APR is a calculation lenders are required to provide on all forms of advertising and disclosures. The annual percentage rate blends your closing costs, adds them to the loan amount and re-amortizes the calculation over the term of the loan. APR is simply an expression of loan cost. The higher your APR, the higher-priced your mortgage. APR is a way to make an apples-to-apples comparison of loan costs.\n\nA “higher-priced” loan, by industry standard, is any loan with an APR that is 1.5 percentage points (or more) above the weekly offered prime rate by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac for a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loan. (The prime rate is an estimate of the rate borrowers with very good credit get.)\n\nSo the next threshold is a “high-cost” mortgage, which, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is “a first mortgage with an APR of more than 6.5 percentage points higher than the average prime offer rate.” While a ""higher-priced"" loan is considered a traditional loan offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, you\'d typically have to go to a private investor for a ""high-cost"" loan. Under current regulations, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will not allow a high-cost loan to close unless the interest rate is low enough to offset the APR thresholds.\n\nHow to Figure Out If You Have a Higher-Priced Loan\n\n\n\nOnce you have offers from various lenders, here’s how to compare them:\n\nMake sure you have your offers in writing.\n\nTake the prime offered interest rate corresponding to the most current week.\n\nIf the APR associated with your mortgage offer is 1.5 percentage points higher than the prime rate, you have a higher-priced loan.\n\n\n\nDiscount Points\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\n\nDiscount points are fees paid by the borrower to the lender in exchange for a lower interest rate on the mortgage – which means lower monthly mortgage payments. When you do this, however, this increases the APR, because even as the interest rate drops, the overall costs still rise because of the fees paid up front.\n\nFor example: A first mortgage in the amount of $300,000 at a 4.375 percent interest rate might be offered to a borrower with a discount fee in the amount of $1,500. The same lender might offer the same 30-year fixed rate without the $1,500 fee in exchange for an interest rate of 4.5 percent. The higher interest rate without the fees will result in a lower APR. While this will lead to higher monthly mortgage payments, choosing the higher interest rate/lower APR can be useful to borrowers who are short on cash that would be needed on the higher APR loan.\n\nThese Fees Raise the Cost of Your Loan\n\nThe following fees and costs associated with closing on your home loan will be included in your APR.\n\nDiscount points\n\n\n\nLoan origination fee\n\n\n\nMortgage broker or lender fee\n\n\n\nTax/flood service fee\n\n\n\nMortgage insurance premium\n\n\n\nTitle insurance\n\n\n\nEscrow fee\n\n\n\nRecording fee\n\n\n\nThese fees are all one-time fees, except for the mortgage insurance premium (if it is a monthly premium rather than a single-pay premium). Additionally, fees such as property taxes and insurance are considered normal carrying costs associated with owning a home and thus do not have any effect on the cost of a loan.\n\n\n\nHow to Lower the Price of a ‘High-Cost’ Loan\n\nIf you’re worried your loan could be considered a “high-cost” loan and will not be able to be made by the lender, the following can be done to lower the price and allow the loan process to close:\n\nReducing the purchase price\n\n\n\nReducing the loan amount\n\n\n\nObtaining a seller credit in a purchase transaction\n\n\n\nReducing the discount point (which usually means increasing the interest rate, thereby reducing total fees)\n\n\n\nReducing the interest rate with investor renegotiation (lender offers you a better interest rate if the market has improved since locking in)\n\n\n\nLengthening the term of the loan (applicable if initially looking for a shorter-term mortgage, like a 15-year or a 20-year, for example)\n\n\n\nMortgage tip: Higher-priced loans at lower amounts — like $125,000, for example — can become problematic. Lenders have a certain profit margin they must account for. If the set margins do not allow for adjusting fees to meet higher-priced loan thresholds, lower loan amounts can sometimes be more challenging to obtain than higher loan amounts.\n\nMore from credit.com:\n\nWhy You Should Check Your Credit Before Buying a Home\n\nHow to Search for Your Next Home\n\n\n\nHow to Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage\n\n\n\nScott Sheldon is a senior loan officer and consumer advocate based in Santa Rosa, Calif.

On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.\n\nThe plan has received widespread attention in part because it appears to address the most evident problems of Fannie and Freddie and because it is deemed likely to be approved by Congress. Yet neither of these assumptions, on deeper examination, seems to be true.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nTo satisfy those who want low-priced mortgages on terms that private markets would never endorse, the plan makes explicit the government guarantee on debt which had been implicit for Fannie and Freddie. This would lower the interest rate on high-risk loans, while obscuring the cost of the subsidy. To placate those who worry that this in turn would leave the government stuck with mountains of dud loans, a 10% capital cushion must be provided by investors to absorb initial losses.\n\nA fee of 0.1% would be charged on all mortgage-backed bonds, with the proceeds going to three funds, two pre-existing, that will provide subsidies for housing. An as-yet undetermined insurance charge will be levied on top. The result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, “would be a strong step forward” to fixing “our flawed housing system”.\n\nIf only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie. The first objection is that the law would create an unwieldy bureaucracy, with a regulator atop other entities devoted to overseeing functions such as syndicating loans or bundling the loans of small banks.\n\nWhen the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first. Then they tanked—presumably because investors reached page 387 of the 442-page text and found enshrined in legislation an earlier 2012 order by the Treasury that expropriated from private investors all profits made by Fannie and Freddie. The move is unlikely to help attract the private money needed to supply the 10% in equity underpinning bonds issued under the new plan.\n\nOpponents of Fannie and Freddie contend that the two played a key role in the crisis by encouraging the issuance of loans with tiny downpayments through a benign-sounding “affordable housing” mandate. Nothing much has changed. Under the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted. Strewn through the proposed law are words such as “affordable”, “equal access” and “underserved communities”, which suggest that lending decisions will be based on political rather than credit criteria. “The result”, says Edward Pinto of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, “will be risky lending for those least able to cope.”\n\nThe underlying problem with the new plan is that, like Fannie and Freddie before it, it tries to reconcile two conflicting goals: protecting the financial system and providing low-cost housing loans to favoured groups. A better approach would be to handle these goals separately and explicitly."", 'On March 16th the leading Republican and Democratic members of the key Senate Banking Committee belatedly released a plan for restructuring the two publicly traded mortgage giants.\nThe result, said Mike Crapo, the ranking Republican senator on the committee, “would be a strong step forward” to fixing “our flawed housing system”.\nIf only, say critics, who include investors and both friends and foes of Fannie and Freddie.\nWhen the plan was announced, the price of shares in Fannie and Freddie, which account for about two-thirds of the mortgage market, did not budge at first.\nUnder the new plan, downpayments of as little as 3.5% of the loan value would be permitted.']"

He said they were first used in the 1930s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe call that comes in appears to be — at least on caller ID — from the Internal Revenue Service. Callers claim to be from the IRS and tell people they owe taxes that must be paid immediately. Those who refuse are threatened with arrest, deportation or loss of their business or driver’s license.\n\nThey often call a second time — again cloaking phone numbers to look official — pretending to be the police or a representative from the Department of Motor Vehicles. To round out the scam, they also send official-looking emails that further fool victims.\n\nPayments have been made with pre-paid debit cards or through a wire transfer, payment methods the IRS does not use.\n\n“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” said J. Russell George, the Treasury inspector general for tax administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” George said.\n\nThe agency said that the IRS usually contacts those who owe taxes by mail, not by phone. People are advised to hang up and call the IRS at (800) 829-1040 for any questions regarding unpaid taxes. Those who want to report an incident can call the Treasury’s inspector general at (800) 366-4484.\n\nFOR THE RECORD:\n\nIRS scam: In the March 22 Business section, an article about scammers posing as IRS agents misquoted privacy expert Alessandro Acquisti as saying Social Security numbers were first used in the 1940s. He said they were first used in the 1930s.\n\nAlessandro Acquisti, a Carnegie Mellon University economist who studies privacy, said Americans often believe that Social Security numbers are well-guarded and sensitive pieces of information.\n\nThe reality, however, is they are not. Because these numbers are often used by businesses and organizations to verify people’s identities, Acquisti said it doesn’t take a scammer much effort to find the last four digits of someone’s Social Security number.\n\n“Over the years, since their inception in the 1940s … they’ve been used for more and more purposes by more and more diverse entities, each using them slightly differently,” he said. “Scammers are exploiting an inherent weakness in a society that uses Social Security numbers this way.”\n\nPublic records that are easily searchable online also make it easier for scammers to target people, but the key is those four digits.\n\n“It’s an example of social engineering,” Acquisti said. “Showing knowledge of information which some individuals believe to be sensitive is a way to convince a person you are legitimate.”\n\nricardo.lopez@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter: @rljourno', 'If the IRS is calling and demanding you pay up or else, it’s probably not the IRS.\nFOR THE RECORD:IRS scam: In the March 22 Business section, an article about scammers posing as IRS agents misquoted privacy expert Alessandro Acquisti as saying Social Security numbers were first used in the 1940s.\nCallers claim to be from the IRS and tell people they owe taxes that must be paid immediately.\nAdvertisement“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” George said.\nFOR THE RECORD:IRS scam: In the March 22 Business section, an article about scammers posing as IRS agents misquoted privacy expert Alessandro Acquisti as saying Social Security numbers were first used in the 1940s.']"

(4th CD), issued the following op-ed:\n\nYour phone rings. The caller ID reads "" Internal Revenue Service ."" It\'s the IRS calling to tell you that you owe taxes. The agent on the phone provides their name and badge number, and the agent provides the last four digits of your Social Security number as verification. The agent tells you the amount of taxes that you owe, threatens consequences of the failure to pay back taxes, such as loss of business license or jail time, and takes any questions you may have. Next, they provide you with details on how to pay your back taxes through debit card or wire transfer.\n\nNow the question is the IRS agent real or fake?\n\nThe answer is: fake. This is the scenario of one of the latest consumer scams, which has many Americans sending thousands of dollars to the "" IRS "" only to find out that they have fallen victim to financial theft.http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Warns-of-Phone-Scam\n\nIf you\'re like me, you like to think that you aren\'t likely to fall for a telephone or email scam - particularly those scams telling of a long-lost family member in a foreign country who has a large inheritance to give you... if only you\'ll provide your Social Security number, birth date, and checking account information.\n\nHowever, the truth is, Internet and telephone consumer scams that result in identity theft or financial theft are becoming more sophisticated and they are often unidentifiable at first blush. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)has said that the highest reported age group for identity theft is 20 to 29 year olds who are often considered to be some of our most tech savvy citizens. Overall in 2013, American consumers lost $1.6 billion to fraud, according to an FTC reporthttp://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf on consumer complaints. Internet and telephone scams are successful in victimizing all kinds of individuals, no matter their age, background, or familiarity with technology.\n\nHere are three recent scams to be aware of, according to the Better Business Bureau\'s Top Ten Scams of 2013list.http://www.bbb.org/council/news-events/news-releases/2014/02/top-ten-scams-2013/\n\nThe Affordable Care Act Scam\n\nScammers claim to be from the federal government and explain that the victim needs a new insurance card or Medicare card. They say they need to collect your personal information, including your Social Security number, in order to mail you a card. Often, the scammers already have your bank account number and may provide it to you for ""verification.""\n\nFake Facebook Friend Scam\n\nScammers create fake profiles that appear to be someone from your friends list on Facebook. After requesting to be your friend, these faux friends then post links to websites that download malware or ask for personal information in their communication with you.\n\nScam Texts\n\nScam texts often look like an alert from your banking institution. The text message may ask you to confirm or reactivate a debit card by following a link on your phone. When victims follow the link, scammers are often able to get banking information, ATM numbers or PINs, or place malicious software on phones.\n\nSo how can individuals protect themselves against scams such as these? In this day of technology, consumers must learn to be vigilant in sharing and protecting personal information no matter what the platform. The following steps may help in protecting you from a scam:\n\nFirst, verify the person you are speaking with or the link you have received is who he, she, or it claims to be. In all of the instances above (and with most telephone and internet scams), the scammers request personal information over a non-secure site (your mobile device, a website, or over the phone). Often, institutions have policies that state they will never request personal information by email, text, or social media. When in doubt, hang up and call the institution or agency using a phone number listed on an old bank statement, from an official website, or other trusted document. If the request is legitimate, the person will be able to direct you to an agent for assistance.\n\nSecond, don\'t send money to someone you don\'t know. Agencies like the IRS usually first contact people by mail about unpaid taxes. Again, calling the agency using a phone number from a trusted source will help verify an appropriate method for any necessary payments. If you use online auction sites (like eBay ), the FTC recommends using a payment option that provides protection, like a credit card.\n\nThird, learn how to keep your personal information secure online and offline. The FTC has tips for anything from securing your Social Security number to keeping your mobile devices secure:http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0272-how-keep-your-personal-information-secure.\n\nFinally, stay up to date on the latest scams. If you suspect you\'re the target of a scam, do a quick search through Google or another search engine to see if something similar has been reported in the news. The Federal Trade Commission regularly posts scam alerts on its website. You can sign up to receive scam alerts by email, too: http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/scam-alerts.\n\nIf you think you may have fallen victim to a scam, report the incident to the FTC at http://www.ftc.gov/complaint. Also report scams to your state Attorney General. In Virginia , those complaints can be filed at http://www.ag.virginia.gov/Consumer%20Protection/.\n\nTNS 30TacordaCheng-140322-4676409 30TacordaCheng', 'Scam TextsScam texts often look like an alert from your banking institution.\nIn this day of technology, consumers must learn to be vigilant in sharing and protecting personal information no matter what the platform.\nAgain, calling the agency using a phone number from a trusted source will help verify an appropriate method for any necessary payments.\nThird, learn how to keep your personal information secure online and offline.\nIf you think you may have fallen victim to a scam, report the incident to the FTC at http://www.ftc.gov/complaint.']"

Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (aka, the much cooler-sounding TIGTA).\n\nIn all, George says his office believes that victims of the scam have already lost at least $1 million to the scheme, in which the bad guys and/or gals cold-call consumers and pretend to be from the IRS. They then tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a prepaid debit card or wire transfer. If the recipient of the call refuses, the scammers threaten them with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license.\n\nThis form of scam involving prepaid debit cards and/or wire transfers is nothing new, but it seems like crooks are coming to realize they can leverage the public’s fear of the IRS and the federal government as a way to squeeze victims for money.\n\nTIGTA says some scammers are prepared for their calls with information that helps to convince unsuspecting victims. According to the warning, the callers often know the last four digits of the victim’s Social Security Number, spoof their phone number so it appears as if the IRS is indeed calling, send official-looking but fake e-mails to victims in an effort to bolster their demands, and will sometimes make subsequent calls to the same recipients claiming to be the police or department of motor vehicles.\n\n“The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming,” writes TIGTA. “At all times, and particularly during the tax filing season, we want to make sure that innocent taxpayers are alert to this scam so they are not harmed by these criminals.”\n\nGeorge says that the IRS generally contacts consumers about unpaid taxes by mail before making any sort of telephonic connection. Furthermore, the IRS has a bank account and knows how to deposit checks, so it won’t ever ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer, nor would the IRS ask for a credit card number over the phone.\n\n“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” said George.\n\n• If you owe Federal taxes, or think you might owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with your payment questions.\n\n• If you don’t owe taxes, call and report the incident to TIGTA at 800-366-4484.\n\nYou can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov.

In many cases, an identity thief uses a taxpayer’s identity to illegally file a tax return and claim a refund.\n\nFor the 2014 filing season, the IRS has expanded efforts to better protect taxpayers and help victims.\n\n2. Pervasive telephone scams\n\nThe IRS has seen an increase in local phone scams across the country. Callers pretend to be from the IRS in hopes of stealing money or identities from victims.\n\nIf you get a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS, and you know you owe taxes or think you might owe taxes, call the IRS at 800-829-1040.\n\nIf you get a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and know you don’t owe taxes or have no reason to think that you owe taxes, then call and report the incident to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 800-366-4484.\n\n3. Phishing\n\nPhishing scams typically use unsolicited emails or fake websites that appear legitimate. Scammers lure in victims and prompt them to provide their personal and financial information.\n\nThe fact is that the IRS does not initiate contact with taxpayers by email to request personal or financial information. This includes any type of electronic communication, such as text messages and social media channels.\n\n4. False promises of inflated refunds\n\nThe bottom line is that you are legally responsible for what’s on your tax return, even if someone else prepares it. Scam artists often pose as tax preparers during tax time, luring victims in by promising large tax refunds.\n\nTaxpayers who buy into such schemes can end up penalized for filing false claims or receiving fraudulent refunds. Take care when choosing someone to do your taxes.\n\n5. Return preparer fraud\n\nAbout 60% of taxpayers will use tax professionals this year to prepare their tax returns. Most return preparers provide honest service to their clients. But some dishonest preparers prey on unsuspecting taxpayers, and the result can be refund fraud or identity theft.\n\nChoose carefully when hiring an individual or a company to do your return. Only use a tax preparer that will sign your return and enter their IRS Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN).\n\n6. Hiding income offshore\n\nWhile there are valid reasons for maintaining financial accounts abroad, there are reporting requirements.\n\nAmerican taxpayers who maintain such accounts and do not comply with these requirements are breaking the law. They risk large penalties and fines, as well as the possibility of criminal prosecution.\n\nThe IRS has collected billions of dollars in back taxes, interest and penalties from people who participated in offshore voluntary disclosure programs since 2009. It is in the best interest of taxpayers to come forward and pay their fair share of taxes.\n\n7. Impersonation of charitable organizations\n\nTaxpayers need to be sure they donate to recognized charities. Following major disasters, it’s common for scam artists to impersonate charities to get money or personal information from well-intentioned people.\n\nScammers may even directly contact disaster victims and claim to be working with the IRS to help the victims file casualty loss claims and get tax refunds.\n\n8. False income, expenses or exemptions\n\nFalsely claiming income you did not earn or expenses you did not pay in order to get larger refundable tax credits is tax fraud. This includes false claims for the Earned Income Tax Credit.\n\nThese taxpayes often end up repaying the refund, including penalties and interest or faces criminal prosecution.\n\n9. Frivolous arguments\n\nFrivolous schemes encourage taxpayers to make unreasonable and outlandish claims to avoid paying the taxes they owe.\n\nWhile taxpayers have the right to contest their tax liabilities in court, no one has the right to disobey the law or ignore their responsibility to pay taxes.\n\n10. Using a false Form 1099\n\nFiling false information with the IRS is an illegal way to try to lower the amount of taxes owed. Typically, fraudsters use a Form 4852 (Substitute Form W-2) or a “corrected” Form 1099 as a way to improperly reduce taxable income to zero.\n\nThe fraudster may also submit a false statement denying wages and taxes reported by a payer to the IRS.\n\n11. Abusive tax structures\n\nThese abusive tax schemes often involve sham business entities and dishonest financial arrangements for the purpose of evading taxes. The schemes are usually complex and involve multi-layer transactions to conceal the true nature and ownership of the taxable income and assets.\n\nThe schemes often use limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, international business companies, foreign financial accounts and offshore credit/debit cards.\n\n12. Misuse of trusts\n\nThere are reasonable uses of trusts in tax and estate planning. However, questionable transactions also exist.\n\nThey may promise reduced taxable income, inflated deductions for personal expenses, the reduction or elimination of self-employment taxes and reduced estate or gift transfer taxes.\n\nThese trusts rarely deliver promised tax benefits. They primarily avoid taxes and hide assets from creditors, including the IRS.\n\nTax scams can take many forms beyond the Dirty Dozen. The best defense is to remain vigilant.

Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. He said the agency has received reports of over 20,000 contacts and has become aware of thousands of victims who have collectively paid over $1 million as a result of the scam.\n\nThe Treasury Inspector General warned that the increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming.” This tax filing season and year-round, he urges taxpayers to be on the alert and don’t become a victim Below are tips on how to tell a real IRS contact from a phony one.\n\nThe scam has hit taxpayers in nearly every State in the country. Callers claiming to be from the IRS tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license.\n\nThe truth is the IRS usually first contacts people by mail – not by phone – about unpaid taxes. And the IRS won’t ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The IRS also won’t ask for a credit card number over the phone.\n\n“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling.\n\nThe callers who commit this fraud often:\n\nUse common names and fake IRS badge numbers.\n\nMay know the last four digits of the victim’s Social Security Number.\n\nMake caller ID information appear as if the IRS is calling.\n\nSend bogus IRS e-mails to support their scam.\n\nCall a second time claiming to be the police or department of motor vehicles, and the caller ID again supports their claim.\n\nIf you get a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS asking for a payment, here’s what to do:\n\nIf you owe Federal taxes, or think you might owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with your payment questions.\n\nIf you don’t owe taxes, call and report the incident to TIGTA at 800-366-4484.\n\nYou can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov. Add “IRS Telephone Scam"" to the comments in your complaint.\n\nTIGTA and the IRS encourage taxpayers to be alert for phone and e-mail scams that use the IRS name. The IRS will never request personal or financial information by e-mail, texting or any social media. You should forward scam e-mails to phishing@irs.gov. Don’t open any attachments or click on any links in those e-mails.\n\nTaxpayers should be aware that there are other unrelated scams (such as a lottery sweepstakes winner) and solicitations (such as debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be from the IRS.\n\nRead more about tax scams on the genuine IRS website at www.irs.gov.', '“This is the largest scam of its kind that we have ever seen,” said J.

Russell George in a statement. He noted that TIGTA has received reports of over 20,000 contacts and has become aware of thousands of victims who have collectively paid over $1 million as a result of the scam, in which individuals make unsolicited calls to taxpayers fraudulently claiming to be IRS officials.\n\n“The increasing number of people receiving these unsolicited calls from individuals who fraudulently claim to represent the IRS is alarming,” said George. “At all times, and particularly during the tax filing season, we want to make sure that innocent taxpayers are alert to this scam so they are not harmed by these criminals. Do not become a victim.”\n\nGeorge urged taxpayers to heed warnings about the sophisticated phone scam targeting taxpayers, noting that the scam has hit taxpayers in nearly every state in the country. Callers claiming to be from the IRS tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer. The scammers threaten those who refuse to pay with arrest, deportation or loss of a business or driver’s license.\n\nThe truth, TIGTA pointed out, is the IRS usually first contacts people by mail—not by phone—about unpaid taxes. The IRS also won’t ask for payment using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer, and the agency won’t ask for a credit card number over the phone.\n\n“If someone unexpectedly calls claiming to be from the IRS and uses threatening language if you don’t pay immediately, that is a sign that it really isn’t the IRS calling,” said George.\n\nThe callers who commit this fraud typically use common names and fake IRS badge numbers, TIGTA noted. The scammers also frequently know the last four digits of the victim\'s Social Security Number make the caller ID information appear as if the IRS is calling, making the scam even more convincing. In addition, they tend to send bogus IRS e-mails to support their scam, and call a second time claiming to be the policy or department of motor vehicles, and the caller ID again supports their claim.\n\nTIGTA said that if you receive a call from someone claiming to be with the IRS asking for a payment, here’s what to do. If you owe federal taxes, or think you may owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040. IRS workers can help you with your payment questions. If you don\'t owe taxes, call and report the incident to TIGTA at 800-366-4484. You can also file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at www.FTC.gov. Add ""IRS Telephone Scam"" to the comments in your complaint.\n\nTIGTA and the IRS are encouraging taxpayers to be alert for phone and e-mail scams that use the IRS name. The IRS said it will never request personal or financial information by email, texting or any social media. Taxpayers who received scam e-mails should forward them to phishing@irs.gov, but they should not open any attachments or click on any links in those emails.\n\nTaxpayers also should be aware that there are other unrelated scams (such as a lottery sweepstakes winner) and solicitations (such as debt relief) that fraudulently claim to be from the IRS.\n\nFor more information about tax scams, visit www.irs.gov.', 'Do not become a victim.”George urged taxpayers to heed warnings about the sophisticated phone scam targeting taxpayers, noting that the scam has hit taxpayers in nearly every state in the country.\nCallers claiming to be from the IRS tell intended victims they owe taxes and must pay using a pre-paid debit card or wire transfer.\nThe callers who commit this fraud typically use common names and fake IRS badge numbers, TIGTA noted.\nIf you owe federal taxes, or think you may owe taxes, hang up and call the IRS at 800-829-1040.\nTIGTA and the IRS are encouraging taxpayers to be alert for phone and e-mail scams that use the IRS name.']"

We will wipe out Twitter,” the Islamist-leaning leader told a crowd of adulating supporters during a campaign rally in the northwestern city of Bursa on Thursday, AFP reported.\n\n“I don\'t care what the international community says. They will see the Turkish republic\'s strength,"" Erdogan added.\n\nAccording to the Press Advisory of the Prime Ministry, Twitter officials are currently ignoring court rulings demanding they remove some links.\n\n""[In Erdogan\'s speech] it is stated that as long as Twitter fails to change its attitude of ignoring court rulings and not doing what is necessary according to the law, technically, there might be no remedy but to block access in order to relief our citizens,"" the statement says, as quoted by Hurriyet.\n\nOn Friday, Industry Minister Fikri Isik said Twitter must get a legal representative in Turkey and agree to block individual accounts if it is to hammer out a compromise solution to the problem which has led the government to block access to the service.\n\nLast month, Turkey passed a controversial law tightening control over the internet, raising major concerns about free speech. It enabled authorities to block access to web pages within hours without a prior court order.\n\nThe Communication Technologies Institution (BTK) lists four court rulings on its website as the reasons for the latest block.\n\nTwitter Inc says it is looking into reports that it has been banned in Turkey, Reuters says.\n\nMultiple recordings have recently emerged not just on Twitter, but also on Facebook and YouTube, purportedly showing Erdogan – whose AK Party dominates the parliament – illegally meddling in political, legal, business, and media affairs.\n\nIn one recording, he instructs his son to hide tens of millions of euros worth of cash in the house. In another, he tells off an editor of a major newspaper for producing negative coverage. Erdogan has dismissed most of the recordings as “vile fakes” and accused a “robot lobby” of targeting his government through Twitter.\n\nThe leader also threatened to shut down YouTube and Facebook – which is used by 35 million Turks – last month.\n\nThe run-up to the local elections on March 30 – which will be followed by parliamentary and presidential polls – has been marked by constant rancour, with allegations of fraud adding to the protests over corruption and the suppression of political and civil freedoms from the opposition.\n\nBut the AK Party, which has been in power since 2002, is set to maintain its supremacy, if polls are to be believed.\n\nOn Friday Turkish President Abdullah Gul publicly came out against efforts to restrict access to social media websites.\n\n“A total shutdown of social media platforms cannot be approved,” Gul wrote on his own Twitter account.\n\nGul said only individual internet pages should be blocked, and only if a court has ruled personal privacy has been violated.

I don’t think he has time to think,” said Soli Ozel at Kadir Has university in Istanbul. “He is trying to keep the scandal as muted as possible at all costs, but he can’t control the technology. Instead, he is fuelling the fire of suspicion and making everyone anticipate what, if anything, will come out on the 25th.”\n\nMr Erdogan took aim at Twitter, saying he would “root out” the microblogging service for national security reasons. But he failed to account for Turkey’s predilection for social networks – a response, many say, to a cowed media – which means Twitter has greater penetration among web users here than in any other country.\n\nEven President Abdullah Gul, who signed a Bill increasing government control over the internet, tweeted his opposition to the measure.\n\n\n\nFree speech\n\nBefore long, the European Commission, the Council of Europe, the UK government, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and many other non-governmental and international bodies had sent tweets deploring what they depicted as an attack on free speech. Celebrities such as Russell Crowe, Richard Branson, Mia Farrow and Elijah Wood piled in.\n\nThe Turkish bar association filed a criminal complaint against the ban, which it said was illegal. As sporadic Twitter service returned, mystery surrounded who had formally imposed the measure, supposedly in response to court complaints about invasion of privacy.\n\nThe government says it was done as Twitter had failed to respect such court complaints; a lawyer for Twitter was in Ankara for meetings yesterday.\n\n“These steps are very crucial for the Turkish legal system,” said Selin Erciyas, at Mehmet Gun & Partners, an Istanbul law firm. “We will see if there is a true objective legal system or whether it is just Erdogan that decides things in court.”\n\n– (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2014)', 'Hours after Turkey’s government moved to block access to Twitter, Turkish citizens struck back – on the social media network itself.\nIn another technical fix against the ban, Turkish downloads of Hotspot Shield, the world’s most popular virtual private network service, rose to 270,000 on Friday – from a daily average of 7,000.\nBut if Turkey’s Twitter ban was intended to thwart the dissemination of such allegations, it has backfired spectacularly.\nAs sporadic Twitter service returned, mystery surrounded who had formally imposed the measure, supposedly in response to court complaints about invasion of privacy.\nThe government says it was done as Twitter had failed to respect such court complaints; a lawyer for Twitter was in Ankara for meetings yesterday.']"

Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter\'s ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.\n\nYouTube did not return requests for comment.\n\nTwitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country\'s government.\n\nThe ban, which has proven to be not entirely effective, is the latest effort by a government to squash critical comments that flow freely over online social networks.\n\nFor Twitter, the block highlights the thorny policy challenge facing the San Francisco-based company.\n\nAnalysts and observers said they were not immediately concerned that the ban in Turkey could embolden other governments to follow suit and clamp down on Twitter. But the company\'s easy-to-use communications service and its long-running support of free speech have made it a visible target for some governments.\n\nWhile Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey\'s move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n""It\'s a democracy, that\'s the difference. This is a country that actually has legitimate elections,"" said York. ""That could set a dangerous precedent.""\n\n""I do think there\'s a risk democracies could do this,"" she added. ""I don\'t think most would go so far as (banning) the entire site. I think instead what we\'ll see is more pressure being put on Twitter to block certain content.""\n\nWall Street remains more focused on Twitter\'s overall growth prospects and its budding advertising business, with Twitter\'s stock finishing Friday\'s regular trading session up 1.6 percent at $50.92 despite the situation in Turkey.\n\n""If it does have any ripple effects, then obviously we would be concerned, but at this point I think it\'s isolated,"" said Arvind Bhatia of Stern, Agee & Leach.\n\nBut he noted that Twitter does have more political risk than other social media companies such as Facebook Inc, where messages tend to be shared among private groups rather than posted to the general public. Twitter also allows users to post messages under pseudonyms, instead of using their real identities, making it a popular choice among protesters.\n\nTwitter is one of the most popular communications channels in Turkey. Outraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.\n\nA court in Turkey blocked access to Twitter after Erdogan\'s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to ""wipe out"" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.\n\nThe order followed a document posted on Twitter that purported to be transcripts of phone conversations relating to a corruption investigation of former cabinet ministers close to Erdogan.\n\nIndustry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.\n\nTwitter has said it stands with users in Turkey and published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.\n\nThe clash with the Turkish government highlighted the broad policy challenges facing Twitter, which enjoys significant traction precisely in countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where restrictive speech laws and the reach of government censors have conflicted with Twitter\'s free-speech principles.\n\nBecause of its nature as a public, broadcast medium and its viral network model, where information (or rumors) can spread exponentially through ""retweets,"" Twitter has been viewed as a particularly destabilizing force.\n\nTwitter was blocked for roughly four years in Iran following protests during its 2009 presidential election, while David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, suggested during the London riots in 2011 that he might block the service, although never followed through.\n\nThe Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009. Twitter downplayed the likelihood of opening an office in the world\'s largest Internet market, but the visit highlighted the tension between Twitter\'s values and its business objectives.\n\nAlso read: Sunny Leone\'s Ragini MMS2 - Short review', ""Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter's ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.\nTwitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country's government.\nWhile Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey's move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nOutraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.\nThe Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009.""]"

The prime minister was accused of making personal calls to media bosses seeking to have vocal critics fired.\n\nThe government called the recordings fakes, although independent analysts said they were authentic.\n\nOne recording purported to be of the prime minister telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash Dec. 17, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Erdogan has repeatedly insisted that the recording was fake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It seems that there is some pivotal information that the government does not wish to spread over the Internet,” said Soli Ozel, a professor of international relations at Kadir Has University in Istanbul. “Although such an effort sounds rational, it’s actually highly irrational when you consider it is impossible to stop social media networks. My son breached the ban in 15 seconds.”\n\nThe shutdown occurred 10 days before local elections and after Erdogan lashed out at Twitter at an election rally in the town of Bursa on Thursday, saying that he did not care about international reaction if national security was at stake.\n\nGovernment officials have also sought to justify the attempted blockage by raising the issue of privacy.

Twitter Inc. and Turkish news media also shared some tips, as did Turkish residents through low-tech means such as graffiti and street posters.\n\nThe response to the ban shows why it\'s difficult for governments to control the Internet. China and other countries notorious for censoring content have routinely faced efforts by citizens determined to bypass their controls. And in Turkey, people were still tweeting on Friday.\n\nHere\'s a look at the ban and the ways Turkish Internet users are circumventing it:\n\nQ. Why is Turkey banning Twitter\n\nA. The ban came as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to ""rip out the roots"" of the social network. His remarks came after links proliferated on Twitter to recordings that appear to incriminate Erdogan and other officials in corruption. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government\'s reputation ahead of local elections this month.\n\nMany people who tried to visit Twitter on Friday got a blocking notice from Turkey\'s telecommunications authority that referred to four court orders.\n\nQ. How is Twitter being blocked\n\nA. Internet access providers in the country are redirecting Twitter traffic to a website that contains the blocking notice. It appears that Turkish Internet providers are doing so by changing the numeric Internet Protocol address associated with Twitter.com.\n\nThink of the domain name system as an Internet phone book. When you type in Twitter.com, your computer looks up the numeric IP address for Twitter\'s website and takes you there. It\'s similar to the way you can make calls on your smartphone by looking up your friends\' names rather than memorizing all the phone numbers.\n\nTurkish service providers can steer you away from Twitter\'s website by putting an incorrect IP address for Twitter.com in their domain name servers.\n\nQ. How are people still tweeting in Turkey\n\nA. Users can change the ""phone book"" their computer uses. The domain name system has multiple copies of these phone books, all of which are supposed to be identical. The Internet access provider usually picks the one used, but users can change settings on their machines to a different one. That way, Twitter.com would pull up the real IP address for Twitter\'s website.\n\nPeople also can use masking services called proxies. A person\'s PC or mobile device connects to the proxy, which uses its own domain name servers to reach out to Twitter on the user\'s behalf. Turkish access providers know only that the user is reaching the proxy, not Twitter. Instead of a proxy, people can also use virtual private networks, the tools common for accessing secured corporate networks from home. Just like proxies, VPNs reach out to websites on users\' behalf. Plenty of free VPNs exist.\n\nTwitter can also be accessed by text messaging. In fact, the reason tweets are limited to 140 characters is to fit the length constraints of texts. Twitter Inc. posted on its Policy account instructions on how to send tweets through texts. The guidelines are in both English and Turkish. It\'s possible to receive texts on followed accounts as well, though users must enable that one account at a time. Keep in mind that this is a Twitter feature that won\'t work with other sites that get blocked.\n\nUsers also might be able to turn to Twitter aggregation services such as HootSuite. It\'s similar to a proxy in that the aggregation service is what\'s making contact with Twitter. The user\'s computer looks up the IP address for that service, not Twitter. Many of these services let people both post and read tweets.\n\nQ. What\'s the big deal about the ban if it can be circumvented\n\nA. These circumvention techniques aren\'t easy for everyone to carry out. Think of the last time you had to help a tech-challenged friend or relative do something relatively simple, such as attaching a photo to an email.\n\nThe government also might step up its blocking efforts, as China does every time a new hole pops up. If people are using HootSuite, the IP address for that website can be changed as well. Proxies and VPNs can be blocked, too. If changing the domain name servers proves ineffective, there are other ways to carry out a ban - including content filtering based on keywords.\n\nAndrew Przybylski, a researcher at Oxford Internet Institute in Britain, said Turkey\'s techniques so far appear relatively primitive.\n\n""This is Round One of something that could easily escalate,"" Przybylski said. The domain name system is ""the easiest to block, and then the easiest to get around the block. It\'s more the mindset here.""', ""Not long after Turkey imposed a ban on Twitter, Internet users went on - what else?\nNot long after Turkey's prime minister imposed a ban on Twitter, Internet users in Turkey went on - what else - Twitter to find ways to circumvent the blockade.\nHere's a look at the ban and the ways Turkish Internet users are circumventing it:Q.\nHow is Twitter being blockedA.

They are in search of larger governmental control or even censorship online. — Marietje Schaake, European Parliament Member, February 2014\n\nPolitics, claimed the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, is the art of the possible. Exceed that limit, and you are bound to make a hash of it. By all means, care to dream, but be aware of limitations. The Turkish government, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has given that sentiment substance. Ahead of the local elections on March 30, he has attempted to shut off Twitter via a court order. Google Inc. has similarly been subject to requests by the Erdoğan government to remove material alleging government corruption from its YouTube sites.\n\nIt all began late on Thursday. At a rally, Erdoğan apparently told reporters, “We will wipe out all of these.” Another reported comment from the speech was even less edifying: “Twitter, mwitter!” Erdoğan then hit his strides, claiming that he would target his political enemies, and that he did not care one iota for international opinion. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is.”\n\nThose using the site were taken to a government statement issued by the telecommunications regulator TIB. Four court orders were cited behind the ban. In theory at least, 12 million account users in Turkey were to be shut off from the site. “If Twitter officials insist on not implementing court orders and the rules of law… there will be no other option but to prevent access to Twitter to help satisfy our citizens’ grievances.” Importantly, Erdoğan is suggesting that Turkish citizens have been mocked and insulted, and that he is stepping in to protect citizens against the misuse of Twitter.\n\nAs ever, classic authoritarianism is based on merging civic responsibility with a leader’s aspirations. Insult the body politic and you are insulting the people of the nation state. The reaction shows how rattled Erdoğan has been by a series of postings and recordings seemingly showing corruption within the prime minister’s circle. Wiretap records of telephone conversations between the prime minister, media and business figures, members of Cabinet and family members do not paint a good picture.\n\nHurriyet Daily is also speculating that the move against Twitter by Erdoğan may be motivated by concerns that those who have been behind the leaks may have a recording between the Turkish Intelligence Organisation (MIT) Chief Hakan Fidan and the imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan. That in itself is not a problem – apart from the suggestion that the conversation may contain guarantees for Öcalan’s release. That might well but a dampener on government aspirations.\n\nThe barrel of the ruling regime is certainly filled with more than the odd rotten apple. Last year’s annus horribilis for the government saw at least 52 people, including the sons of three Cabinet members, businessmen, officials and a mayor detained in three separate investigations. Accusations were levelled on the receipt of construction permits for protected areas in exchange for cash, and bribery over state projects. The graft probe resulted in the resignations of four ministers. As more corruption is being exposed, officials are getting desperate.\n\nAttempts to rein in expression of the political sort shows up in the country’s jails, which are being filled with non-compliant journalists. In 2013, the Committee to Protect Journalists revealed that Turkey was the world’s top jailor of journalists, something it has been for some time. Given the stiff competition, this was a remarkable statistic, inflated by the retaliation on the government’s part against coverage of the Gezi Park protests. Additionally, 22 journalists were fired and 37 forced to quit. The desire to control the streams of opinion and expression is proving powerful.\n\nTwitter users in Turkey reacted with immediate effect to the ban, some helped by instructions from the San Francisco based firm to use the medium in other ways. The company does enable users to employ trimmed down version of it. A particularly potent picture appeared, showing Twitter-style birds making droppings on the Prime Minister. The medium had muddled with the message.\n\nAnkara has been keen on controlling various multimedia platforms for some time. The Gezi Park protests last summer were accused of being a social media confection, though the government erred in classic fashion by assuming that the platforms being used were the protests. A request was made to Twitter to establish a Turkish based office for one simple reason: ease of control. Material objectionable to the government would be more easily removed.\n\nSuch efforts are simply not working. In an embarrassing turn of events for Erdoğan, he has found the Twitter ban broken by his own Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arinç and Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek. Even President Abdullah Gül, who claims to have been an unwilling approver of the Internet law, said via his own Twitter account how opposed he was to the ban. To rub salt into an already suppurating wound, the use of Twitter in Turkey has actually soared, rising by 33 per cent.\n\nControlling the Internet continues to remain the ignoble dreams of those in authority. The Turkish prime minister has proven to be no exception, using his AK Parti’s majority in Parliament to pass legislation regulating its use. But the lesson for Erdoğan should be simple: ban Twitter, and you are set for the dump.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Prime Minister, Turkey, March 20\n\n\n\nThings didn\'t work out as planned for PM Erdogan when he tried to shut down Twitter in Turkey on Thursday, March 20. However, the world did see the power of the Turkish people who boosted Twitter usage from 4.54 million to 6.04 million messages in the period after the government ordered the service banned according to the Somera Social Media Rating service. In addition to the 33% increase in message traffic, Somera reported a 17% increase in users. Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sent a message to Turkish users offering alternatives to access the service. Image: Twitter\n\n\n\nThings just got worse for PM Erdogan. Today, Hurriyet Daily News, the leading Turkish source of information on the Erdogan scandals, reported that a Turkish court announced that it could ""repeal the ban on Twitter"" since it did not result from court action. The court said the action was ""an executive decision, not a judicial verdict.""\n\nGiven Erdogans aggressive rhetoric against Twitter, there is little doubt that he was the government official initiating the drastic action. Erdogan promised to ban FaceBook and YouTube as well, if those services keep broadcasting audio recordings that embarrass Erdogan and the AK Party.\n\nFor the past month, anonymous Twitter users broadcast wire tapped phone conversations revealing massive corruption by PM Erdogan, his family, and business associates. Bribery, coercing judges on court rulings, and bid rigging are just three examples. In response, Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) passed legislation that gave the government the power to ban internet services used to criticize the government, i.e., Erdogan and associates. The audio tapes kept coming.\n\nErdogan and his defenders first claimed that the tapes were fake. When the voices were verified, the response shifted to a claim that the tapes were ""montages"" put together to make him look bad. Lately, Erdogan has simply claimed that he was serving the people by interfering with court decisions\n\nTurkish Medical Association Thinks Erdogan has Lost his Mind\n\nDuring the Gizi Park demonstrations that rocked Turkey over the summer of 2013, Berkin Elvan, a 15 year old boy, was shot in the head with a tear gas weapon. Elvan had been in a coma until his death on March 11. Massive demonstrations followed to mourn Elvan and protest the police action including two million people in the streets of Turkey\'s capitol, Ankara on March 14. At this point, PM Erdogan issued a statement that Elvan had been part of a ""terrorist organization."" The statement shocked the nation and inspired more protests.\n\nCiting the attack on a dead boy, in the context of a litany of inflammatory statements by Erdogan over the past months, the medical association listed the abnormal behaviors displayed by the PM. Their conclusion was clear:\n\n""We are doctors. We can accurately assess the emotional well being of a person, and we are worried about the emotional well being of Prime Minister Erdoğan. We are terribly worried. We are worried for him, his family and the entire country. And we would like to share our worry with the public."" Today\'s Zaman, March 16\n\n\n\nSigns that Erdogan was losing touch with reality emerged in August 2013 while the PM was visiting Turkey\'s coastal city of Bodrum. Erdogan was shocked as he inspected the coastline:\n\n""It is not understandable how the local municipalities stood idle while these buildings were constructed. They may face legal prosecutions, and they may lose their posts. We are immediately starting inspections and punishments.""\n\nThere was just one problem. Three separate agencies of Erdogan\'s government had approved the construction and half was located on government land.\n\nMore ominously, Erdogan threatened to send Turkish troops into Syria to protect the shrine of a Turkish religious figure. The Turkish public is strongly opposed to Erdogan\'s support of Syrian rebels and Turkish involvement in Syria. The leader of main opposition Republican People\'s Party (CHP), Kermal Kılıçdaroğlu, had a message for the army: ""\'I would like to call on the chief of general staff: Do not send Turkey on such an adventure, especially at a time when it is ruled by a suspect prime minister.\n\nErdogan is indeed more suspect with every day that passes. His assault on Internet freedom is one of his many instances of tyrannical rule through the eusurpation of power.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2', 'Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sent a message to Turkish users offering alternatives to access the service.\nToday, Hurriyet Daily News, the leading Turkish source of information on the Erdogan scandals, reported that a Turkish court announced that it could ""repeal the ban on Twitter"" since it did not result from court action.\nFor the past month, anonymous Twitter users broadcast wire tapped phone conversations revealing massive corruption by PM Erdogan, his family, and business associates.\nMore ominously, Erdogan threatened to send Turkish troops into Syria to protect the shrine of a Turkish religious figure.\nThe Turkish public is strongly opposed to Erdogan\'s support of Syrian rebels and Turkish involvement in Syria.']"

29085,http://motherboard.vice.com/read/turkeys-most-downloaded-app-beats-its-twitter-ban,business,"['Twitter has been ""eradicated"" in Turkey, to quote the country\'s social media-hating prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. But apparently, for Erdogan, eradication amounts to a simple, easily circumvented DNS block. In other words, when an internet user tries to access Twitter, the government prevents the query from reaching local server providers. Turks were outraged by the symbolic nature of Erdogan\'s ""ban,"" but well prepared to fly in its face. Hundreds of thousands registered their protest on Twitter, naturally, because getting around the ""ban"" was as easy as downloading an app.\n\nMany embraced VPNs (virtual private networks), which were already well-known to web-literate citizens thanks to the Turkish government\'s previous internet assaults—a three-year ban on YouTube began in 2007, for instance. Others simply changed their DNS settings, and spread the word with street graffiti and clever hacks to show others how to do it.\n\nJennifer Hattam, a freelance journalist living in Istanbul and the brains behind @TheTurkishLife, told me that Hotspot Shield, Tunnelbear, Onavo Protect, and privateinternetaccess.com were among the most frequently recommended VPNs today.\n\nAnchorFree\'s Hotspot Shield app appears to be the most popular. According to CEO David Gorodyansky, it has been installed 270,000 times in Turkey in the last twelve hours alone—up from 10,000 daily downloads before. It was enough to push it to the top of the iTunes download store.\n\nMy colleague Tim Pool, who\'s currently on the ground reporting in Turkey, confirms that ""everyone is using it."" He says that while he\'s using Tunnelbear, HotSpot Shield is the ""trendy"" choice, perhaps for its ease of use.\n\n""You don\'t need to be tech savvy,"" Gorodyanksy said. ""You just download it, install it, and use it. You don\'t need an account, you don\'t even need a user name."" The free version (there\'s an Elite app that costs $4.99, and comes with extra features) automatically locates an alternative server outside of the blocked country, and encrypts any data sent over the network.\n\nThis perhaps explains why HotSpot Shield is the ""number one"" VPN app, as Gorodyanksy boasts. (It is also a favorite for users seeking to create and surf securely over private wifi hotspots, for travelers abroad looking to access servers back home, and, he adds, for individuals to protect their location when they use dating apps.) But it is perhaps most recognized today for its involvement in meeting revolutionary internet demands.\n\n""Hotspot Shield has played a heavy role in pretty much every revolution we\'ve seen in the last five years,"" he said. In Egypt, downloads leapt from 100,000 to 1,000,000 in a single day after internet access was threatened. Gorodyanksy also notes the app\'s encryption services, which may prove equally important to dissidents in Istanbul and beyond, considering Turkey has a policy on file to collect and store its citizens internet histories for two years.\n\nAnchorFree\'s aim is to make every website you store information on ""as secure as your bank.""\n\n""We want to be the leading force for freedom and privacy in the world,"" Gorodyanksy said. AnchorFree makes money from the sales of the Elite version, and from the banner ads served over the page. In 2012, Goldman Sachs invested $52 million in the network, citing a demand for VPNs.\n\nThat demand certainly exists in Turkey.\n\n""After three years of the YouTube ban and shorter bans on Wordpress, Blogger, Vimeo, and I can\'t even remember what else, Internet users here are pretty well-versed in their various DNS and VPN options,"" Hattam told me. As more autocrats threaten to block social media and the internet in general, the necessity and popularity of VPNs will continue to increase. And today, dissidents are downloading HotSpot Shield en masse, and the app is playing a key role in enabling Turkey\'s citizens to make a mockery of one of history\'s feeblest attempts to limit modern speech.', 'Hundreds of thousands registered their protest on Twitter, naturally, because getting around the ""ban"" was as easy as downloading an app.\nAnchorFree\'s Hotspot Shield app appears to be the most popular.\nHe says that while he\'s using Tunnelbear, HotSpot Shield is the ""trendy"" choice, perhaps for its ease of use.\nThis perhaps explains why HotSpot Shield is the ""number one"" VPN app, as Gorodyanksy boasts.\n""Hotspot Shield has played a heavy role in pretty much every revolution we\'ve seen in the last five years,"" he said.']"

Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter\'s ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.\n\nYouTube did not return requests for comment.\n\nTwitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country\'s government.\n\nThe ban, which has proven to be not entirely effective, is the latest effort by a government to squash critical comments that flow freely over online social networks.\n\nFor Twitter, the block highlights the thorny policy challenge facing the San Francisco-based company.\n\nAnalysts and observers said they were not immediately concerned that the ban in Turkey could embolden other governments to follow suit and clamp down on Twitter. But the company\'s easy-to-use communications service and its long-running support of free speech have made it a visible target for some governments.\n\nWhile Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey\'s move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n""It\'s a democracy, that\'s the difference. This is a country that actually has legitimate elections,"" said York. ""That could set a dangerous precedent.""\n\n""I do think there\'s a risk democracies could do this,"" she added. ""I don\'t think most would go so far as (banning) the entire site. I think instead what we\'ll see is more pressure being put on Twitter to block certain content.""\n\nWall Street remains more focused on Twitter\'s overall growth prospects and its budding advertising business, with Twitter\'s stock finishing Friday\'s regular trading session up 1.6% at $50.92 despite the situation in Turkey.\n\n""If it does have any ripple effects, then obviously we would be concerned, but at this point I think it\'s isolated,"" said Arvind Bhatia of Stern, Agee & Leach.\n\nBut he noted that Twitter does have more political risk than other social media companies such as Facebook Inc, where messages tend to be shared among private groups rather than posted to the general public. Twitter also allows users to post messages under pseudonyms, instead of using their real identities, making it a popular choice among protesters.\n\nTwitter is one of the most popular communications channels in Turkey. Outraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.\n\nA court in Turkey blocked access to Twitter after Erdogan\'s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to ""wipe out"" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.\n\nThe order followed a document posted on Twitter that purported to be transcripts of phone conversations relating to a corruption investigation of former cabinet ministers close to Erdogan.\n\nIndustry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.\n\nTwitter has said it stands with users in Turkey and published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.\n\nThe clash with the Turkish government highlighted the broad policy challenges facing Twitter, which enjoys significant traction precisely in countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where restrictive speech laws and the reach of government censors have conflicted with Twitter\'s free-speech principles.\n\nBecause of its nature as a public, broadcast medium and its viral network model, where information (or rumors) can spread exponentially through ""retweets,"" Twitter has been viewed as a particularly destabilizing force.\n\nTwitter was blocked for roughly four years in Iran following protests during its 2009 presidential election, while David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, suggested during the London riots in 2011 that he might block the service, although never followed through.\n\nThe Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009. Twitter downplayed the likelihood of opening an office in the world\'s largest Internet market, but the visit highlighted the tension between Twitter\'s values and its business objectives.', ""Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter's ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.\nTwitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country's government.\nWhile Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey's move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nOutraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.\nThe Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009.""]"

The initiative was intended to better engage patients in their own care and improve communication between patients and their doctors.\n\nIt turned out to be quite a success: Patients demonstrated better recall of their medical plans, felt more in control of their care and were more likely to take their medications. Doctors found that sharing their notes with patients had little negative impact on their workflow. Five years later, more than 5 million patients are participating in the OpenNotes movement. And recently, four nonprofits contributed a total of $10 million to expand the program to 50 million patients.\n\nBut even as the program began to grow, two major questions arose: Would patients continue to access the notes after the initial enthusiasm died down? And, how important were the doctors’ reminders in prompting patients to remain active participants in their own care?\n\nThe study suggests that the reminders are indeed very important. Led by Mafi, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the Geffen School, the researchers found that patients tended to view clinic notes substantially less once they stopped receiving the reminders, while patients who continued receiving them tended to continue accessing the notes.\n\nMafi said patients immediately forget between 40 percent and 80 percent of what their doctors tell them — and they get about half of what they do remember wrong.\n\n“Poor patient–doctor communication represents one of the biggest problems in our health care system,” said Mafi, who conducted the research as a fellow in general internal medicine at Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. “OpenNotes offers patients a way to remember their doctors’ instructions, rationale for their care plan and any other critical information about their health. OpenNotes has the potential to empower patients to take charge of their health.”\n\nAnother recent study about OpenNotes found that patients who read their notes are more likely to take the medicine they need to lower their cholesterol.\n\nThe team led by Mafi studied 14,000 patients at Beth Israel Deaconess and at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania, for two years. Doctors at Beth Israel Deaconess sent reminders throughout the study; those at Geisinger stopped after one year.\n\nDuring the first 12 months, 53.7 percent of the patients at Beth Israel Deaconess and 60.9 percent of the patients at Geisinger checked their doctors’ notes within 30 days of their becoming available to them. Those percentages stayed consistent throughout the year.\n\nDuring the second year, patients at Beth Israel Deaconess viewed their notes with the same frequency until a slight decline during the final three months. At Geisinger, however, just 13.2 percent of patients continued viewing their notes once the email reminders ceased.\n\nThe study also found that compared to 55.1 percent of white patients viewed their notes, compared with 36.3 percent of black patients; these differences remained relatively consistent even after the researchers accounted for differences in demographics, the patients’ illnesses and other factors.\n\n“While we predicted that reminders would influence patients’ viewing their doctors’ notes, we did not anticipate the large role that reminders seem to play in patients continuing to access viewing their notes,” Mafi said. “The key lessons of our study are that sending reminders to patients to view their medical notes may be essential to promoting patient engagement and improving patient-doctor communication, and that new health technology implementation requires additional efforts to reduce potential disparities in health.”\n\nMafi said future studies should evaluate how to better engage non-white patients in order to help mitigate racial and ethnic health disparities. Researchers should also evaluate the best way to invite patients to view their doctors’ notes and then gauge the impact on patient engagement, management of chronic diseases and health outcomes.\n\nHe also added that many patients already have access to their notes but might not realize it.\n\n“We encourage people to ask their doctors or other healthcare professionals about whether they have access to their notes, and to make it a habit to view them,” he said.\n\nThe study’s co-authors are Roanne Mejilla, Henry Feldman, Long Ngo, Tom Delbanco, Christina Wee and Jan Walker of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Jonathan Darer of Geisinger Health System.\n\nThe work was supported by a National Research Service Award training grant (T32HP12706) from the U.S. Health Services and Research Administration and the Ryoichi Sasakawa Fellowship Fund, the National Institutes of Health (K24DK087932); the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (65921), the Drane Family Fund and the Richard and Florence Koplow Charitable Foundation.', 'Doctors’ reminders help keep people more engaged in their health careLos Angeles, California - A study led by Dr. John Mafi, a professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, has found that a simple note from a primary care doctor can be a critical way to keep patients involved in their own health care.\nThe initiative was intended to better engage patients in their own care and improve communication between patients and their doctors.\nAnd, how important were the doctors’ reminders in prompting patients to remain active participants in their own care?\n“OpenNotes offers patients a way to remember their doctors’ instructions, rationale for their care plan and any other critical information about their health.\nDoctors at Beth Israel Deaconess sent reminders throughout the study; those at Geisinger stopped after one year.']"

Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555. — Policy (@policy) March 20, 2014\n\nWhile Turkey\'s press is legally free, it is also controlled. Erdogan\'s government has imposed billion-dollar fines on media holdings hostile to the government, issued blunt instructions to editors about how to tailor their coverage, deported critical journalists -- and when all else fails, thrown reporters in prison, transforming Turkey into the world\'s leading jailer of journalists.All of this helps explain why Erdogan took the extraordinary step today of blocking Twitter. This is not a government that tolerates media it can\'t control -- and there\'s nothing harder to control than millions of Turks self-publishing news about the country at a click of a button. While Twitter hasn\'t commented on the ban, the company took the unusual step of issuing guidelines for how to evade the ban, telling Turkish users that they can post tweets via cellular text-messaging. Fittingly, the announcement came from the Twitter feed of the company\'s policy arm:\n\n""Twitter, schmitter!"" Erdogan said at a campaign rally Thursday. ""We will wipe out all of these...The international community can say this, can say that. I don\'t care. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is.""\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. State Department condemned the government\'s decision to block access to the service.

One of those wiretapped conversations purports to be a discussion between Erdogan and his son about how to hide large sums of money. Another allegedly shows the prime minister browbeating an editor for not firing a critical columnist. These wiretaps appear to have been released as part of Erdogan\'s feud with Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers are thought to include many top officials within the country\'s police force. Erdogan has denied the authenticity of the most damaging leaks and hasn\'t commented on others.The Turkish government can pressure large swathes of the print media to ignore the leaks. However, there\'s nothing it can do to prevent Twitter users from sharing and commenting on the wiretapped conversations.""The leaked tapes on corruption are being watched, reposted, and shared millions of times,"" said Engin Onder, a member of @140journos, a group of university students who report on protests across Turkey using Twitter to circumvent what they see as the failure of the country\'s mainstream media. ""It\'s being said that new tapes are upcoming and can cause the governing party to lose significant votes [in local elections later this month].""Because of the constraints under which the official media operates, Turks are devoted Twitter users -- the country ranks among Twitter\'s 10 most active markets in the world. And Erdogan\'s ban, predictably, incited a predictable backlash among devoted tweeps. The hashtag#TwitterisblockedinTurkey quickly started trending across the globe, while there was no large drop in tweets from Turkey, as users quickly found ways to circumvent the ban.Meanwhile, Turks passed around cartoons lampooning the state\'s fear of Twitter and Erdogan\'s intolerance toward dissent.\n\nMore importantly, the ban also appears to have exacerbated divisions within Erdogan\'s party. President Abdullah Gul, who visited the headquarters of Twitter in 2012, said a ban on the site was ""unacceptable"" -- and to add insult to injury, he made his comments via his Twitter account.\n\nGul isn\'t alone.

Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter’s ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.\n\nYouTube did not return requests for comment.\n\nTwitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country’s government.\n\nThe ban, which has proven to be not entirely effective, is the latest effort by a government to squash critical comments that flow freely over online social networks.\n\nFor Twitter, the block highlights the thorny policy challenge facing the San Francisco-based company.\n\nAnalysts and observers said they were not immediately concerned that the ban in Turkey could embolden other governments to follow suit and clamp down on Twitter. But the company’s easy-to-use communications service and its long-running support of free speech have made it a visible target for some governments.\n\nWhile Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey’s move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n“It’s a democracy, that’s the difference. This is a country that actually has legitimate elections,” said York. “That could set a dangerous precedent.”\n\n“I do think there’s a risk democracies could do this,” she added. “I don’t think most would go so far as (banning) the entire site. I think instead what we’ll see is more pressure being put on Twitter to block certain content.”\n\nWall Street remains more focused on Twitter’s overall growth prospects and its budding advertising business, with Twitter’s stock finishing Friday’s regular trading session up 1.6 percent at $50.92 despite the situation in Turkey.\n\n“If it does have any ripple effects, then obviously we would be concerned, but at this point I think it’s isolated,” said Arvind Bhatia of Stern, Agee & Leach.\n\nBut he noted that Twitter does have more political risk than other social media companies such as Facebook Inc, where messages tend to be shared among private groups rather than posted to the general public. Twitter also allows users to post messages under pseudonyms, instead of using their real identities, making it a popular choice among protesters.\n\nTwitter is one of the most popular communications channels in Turkey. Outraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.\n\nA court in Turkey blocked access to Twitter after Erdogan’s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to “wipe out” the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.\n\nThe order followed a document posted on Twitter that purported to be transcripts of phone conversations relating to a corruption investigation of former cabinet ministers close to Erdogan.\n\nIndustry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.\n\nTwitter has said it stands with users in Turkey and published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.\n\nThe clash with the Turkish government highlighted the broad policy challenges facing Twitter, which enjoys significant traction precisely in countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where restrictive speech laws and the reach of government censors have conflicted with Twitter’s free-speech principles.\n\nBecause of its nature as a public, broadcast medium and its viral network model, where information (or rumors) can spread exponentially through “retweets,” Twitter has been viewed as a particularly destabilizing force.\n\nTwitter was blocked for roughly four years in Iran following protests during its 2009 presidential election, while David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, suggested during the London riots in 2011 that he might block the service, although never followed through.\n\nThe Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009. Twitter downplayed the likelihood of opening an office in the world’s largest Internet market, but the visit highlighted the tension between Twitter’s values and its business objectives.

29119,http://www.dw.de/erdogan-defies-quagmire-of-scandal-in-turkey/a-17511672,business,"['As Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces his worst political crisis ever, the Turkish people are preparing for municipal elections on March 30. Ever since the Gezi Park protests began last May, demonstrators have taken to the streets on an almost weekly basis to protest against Erdogan and his ruling AKP party. They have called for the government\'s resignation, and some no longer recognize Erdogan as the country\'s legitimate leader.\n\nFor his critics, the reasons are obvious: one political scandal has followed the other. A public corruption scandal which came to light on December 17 got the ball rolling. On that day, a number of high-ranking politicians, business leaders and sons of political ministers were arrested and accused of bribery, illegal gold transactions with Iran and of profiting from illegal construction projects. Erdogan reacted by forcing out judges, prosecutors and police officers.\n\nGuler and his son have allegedly been involved in illegal business transactions\n\nScandal follows scandal\n\nIn February, the scandals began piling up as a number of recorded phone calls were published online. In one, former Interior Minister Muammer Guler, who was replaced in December after his son was detained as part of the corruption investigation, can allegedly be heard speaking with his son.\n\nThe recording is said to be proof that Guler and his son were involved in illegal business transactions with Iranian businessman Reza Zerrab, one of the main suspects of the corruption investigation. The phone call is said to have taken place on the morning of December 17, but Guler continues to deny the authenticity of the recording.\n\nThe situation became even more precarious when Erdogan was publicly linked with the corruption scandal. For weeks, alleged wiretapped conversations between the Turkish leader and his son have been circulating on YouTube, the most controversial surfacing on February 24. In the recording, Erdogan is said to have urged his son Bilal to hide huge sums of money on December 17.\n\nErdogan has dismissed all allegations, calling the recordings a ""fabrication."" The Turkish leader has repeatedly stressed that a so-called ""parallel state,"" controlled by the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, has had a hand in the deception. Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan, is said to have increased the number of his followers in Turkey in recent years, thereby considerably increasing his influence in the judiciary and police.\n\nNew recordings released\n\nThe latest recording has caused a scandal for both Turkish Airlines and Erdogan\n\nThe latest wiretapped conversation to hit YouTube this week supposedly features Egemen Bagis, Erdogan\'s closest confidant and until the end of last year, Turkey\'s EU affairs minister. In the recording, Bagis is said to have spoken with journalist Metehan Demir.\n\nBagis is known for publishing a religious saying on Twitter every Friday at morning prayer. In the phone call, Demir is supposedly heard accusing Bagis of copying these religious sayings from a prayer book. Bagis apparently denies it, telling Demir that these sayings can be found in a Google search. Later, the two men are allegedly heard making fun of the Arabic language. The mockery of the religious verses has caused a stir in Turkey, especially with the ruling Islamic conservative AKP party placing a heavy focus on its Muslim faith in its politics.\n\nThe latest recording, published on Tuesday (18.03.2014) on Twitter, has caused a furor. The recording purportedly featured a conversation between a senior employee of Turkish Airlines and one of Erdogan\'s advisers.\n\n""Lots of material is on its way to Nigeria right now. Is it going to kill Muslims or Christians? I am sinning right now, you should know,"" a voice, said to be that of the airline official, says. The airline has rejected the allegations of being involved in illegal arms shipments, stressing that it was only transporting weapons and military equipment in line with international laws and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations.\n\nGonen doesn\'t think Erdogan and the AKP party will suffer at the polls\n\n\'The AKP will not lose the election\'\n\nAfter all the scandals surrounding the AKP government, the upcoming municipal election is seen less as a vote by government critics and more of a test. The main opposition party CHP has called the vote a race between ""haram"" and ""halal""; under Islamic law, everything designated haram is prohibited, while that which is halal is permitted.\n\nAmong the general population, the mood is mixed. Former anti-government Gezi Park protesters appear unsure. ""Every government is corrupt, in a way. Erdogan and his AKP party have brought the Turkish economy so far forward. I don\'t know who else to vote for. Maybe I just won\'t vote,"" said a 35-year-old former protester, speaking with DW.\n\nEmre Gonen, a political scientist at the European Institute at Istanbul\'s Bilgi University, believes the AKP has a good chance of winning the election. Gonen told DW that the scandals will not really affect the election results, adding that although the AKP could lose some support the scandals ""will not make the party lose the election.""\n\nIn the last decade, said Gonen, Turkey has benefited from economic, social and political stability. Over the last 30 years, he said the country has seen turmoil, attempts at military coups and the presence of the military in civilian politics. ""All this has been gradually solved within the AKP government period, and that has created a deep sense of confidence among the voters,"" he said.\n\nDespite the current domestic problems, Gonen said the AKP still has at least 40 percent support in the polls. ""Forty percent is an enormous support in any given democracy today. It will definitely require a dependable alternative political force to make the AKP go back into the opposition,"" he said. And in Turkey, that is currently nowhere in sight.', 'As Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan faces his worst political crisis ever, the Turkish people are preparing for municipal elections on March 30.\nEver since the Gezi Park protests began last May, demonstrators have taken to the streets on an almost weekly basis to protest against Erdogan and his ruling AKP party.\nThe situation became even more precarious when Erdogan was publicly linked with the corruption scandal.\nIn the recording, Erdogan is said to have urged his son Bilal to hide huge sums of money on December 17.\nErdogan and his AKP party have brought the Turkish economy so far forward.']"

This comes after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\'s push for a ban of social media network.\n\n""We will wipe out Twitter. I don\'t care what the international community says,"" he told followers at a rally in the run-up to March 30 local elections. Everyone could expect to see Turkey\'s strength, he added while drumming up support in the northwestern city of Bursa on Thursday (20.03.2014).\n\nAccording to Turkish newspaper ""Hürriyet,"" Erdogan\'s press department issued a statement shortly afterward to explain the prime minster\'s decree. Twitter had ""ignored"" Turkish court orders to remove certain links after Turkish citizens had filed complaints. On Friday (21.03.2014), Turkish newspaper ""Radikal"" published a statement by the public prosecutor\'s office which said that there was no court order to block Twitter.\n\nShortly after the ban was imposed, Turkish President Abdullah Gul made headlines by strongly criticizing the decision to block the platform. ""One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,"" Gul tweeted, clearly circumventing the ban. ""I hope this implementation won\'t last long.""\n\nGul, a frequent user of social media, has been critical of Erdogan\'s censorship moves long before - he chafed at the beginning of March when Erdogan demanded YouTube and Facebook be blocked. ""YouTube and Facebook are recognized platforms all over the world. A ban is out of the question,"" Gul said at the time.\n\nCriticism continues online, despite the ban\n\nAccording to market researchers GlobalWebIndex, around 40 percent of Turkish Internet users are registered on Twitter. After the ban was imposed, shortly after midnight, people turned to other social media platforms such as Facebook to vent about the Erdogan administration.\n\nTurkey\'s president has criticized Erdogan\'s move and says Twitter should not be blocked\n\n""It\'s such a shame to have Erdogan as prime minister. I fear he is going to shut down the entire country,"" a Facebook user wrote. ""My beloved democratic country! After the elections you are going to block Facebook as well. These messages are the last bits of our freedom,"" another posted. People also drew comparisons to other countries where Twitter is blocked. ""What countries are blocking Twitter? Yes indeed, Turkey is now on the same level as China,"" a Facebook user wrote.\n\nShortly after the ban was imposed, people began sharing tips via cell phone apps and videos on how to circumvent the ban by changing one\'s DNS settings to allow access to Twitter. ""It took me two minutes to change the DNS settings; I can now use Twitter again,"" a Facebook user wrote. This trick was picked up by millions of other Twitter users. Just a few hours after Twitter was blocked, hashtags like #TwitterisblockedinTurkey and #TurkeyBlockedTwitter were top of the global hashtag ranks.\n\nDespite the ban, members of the Turkish government have continued to tweet as well - like Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc who announced that Erdogan\'s Justice and Development Party\'s (AKP) election campaign would be in the province of Manisa on Friday. ""Arinc uses Twitter for his daily election campaign? Now I\'m confused. Why then block the site at all?"" a user complained.\n\nSocial media pressures Erdogan\n\nErdogan\'s fight against Twitter started last year when protests in Istanbul\'s Gezi Park were in full swing. He publicly called the platform a ""menace,"" stressing again and again that Twitter was distributing lies. In the past year, Twitter has been used as the main means of communication for millions of demonstrators in Turkey. Mass protests were widely organized via the service.\n\nPeople in Turkey have to resort to tricks to be able to access Twitter\n\nBut Erdogan and his government have increasingly come under pressure - more so after a corruption scandal involving the Erdogan administration was unveiled in mid-December. Since then, alleged telephone conversations between Erdogan and his son Bilal were leaked and published on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook. In these conversations, Erdogan reportedly told his son to hide huge sums of money. It\'s still unclear to this date who is responsible for publishing these recordings. Erdogan has accused a parallel state led by US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, a former political ally of Erdogan.\n\nMedia expert Asli Tunc of Istanbul\'s Bilgi University told DW that shutting down Twitter doesn\'t make sense. ""It\'s very hard to fight such technology. There will be software and programs that help people circumvent the ban,"" she said. The Turkish government blocked YouTube a couple of years ago, but even back then there had been many possibilities to circumvent the ban.\n\nAmnesty International has also strongly criticized the ban and called on the Turkish government to immediately reinstate access to Twitter. ""The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on Internet freedom and freedom of expression,"" Amnesty International said in a statement.', 'On Friday (21.03.2014), Turkish newspaper ""Radikal"" published a statement by the public prosecutor\'s office which said that there was no court order to block Twitter.\nTurkey\'s president has criticized Erdogan\'s move and says Twitter should not be blocked""It\'s such a shame to have Erdogan as prime minister.\n""It took me two minutes to change the DNS settings; I can now use Twitter again,"" a Facebook user wrote.\nSince then, alleged telephone conversations between Erdogan and his son Bilal were leaked and published on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook.\n""The decision to block Twitter is an unprecedented attack on Internet freedom and freedom of expression,"" Amnesty International said in a statement.']"

Some people within Google feared an imminent blackout in the wake of Twitter\'s ban, the Journal cited the people as saying.\n\nYouTube did not return requests for comment.\n\nTwitter said on Friday it hopes access to its social media service in Turkey will be restored soon, a day after it was blocked by the country\'s government.\n\nThe ban, which has proven to be not entirely effective, is the latest effort by a government to squash critical comments that flow freely over online social networks.\n\nFor Twitter, the block highlights the thorny policy challenge facing the San Francisco-based company.\n\nAnalysts and observers said they were not immediately concerned that the ban in Turkey could embolden other governments to follow suit and clamp down on Twitter. But the company\'s easy-to-use communications service and its long-running support of free speech have made it a visible target for some governments.\n\nWhile Twitter has earned the ire of other governments, Turkey\'s move to ban Twitter is particularly noteworthy, said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\n""It\'s a democracy, that\'s the difference. This is a country that actually has legitimate elections,"" said York. ""That could set a dangerous precedent.""\n\n""I do think there\'s a risk democracies could do this,"" she added. ""I don\'t think most would go so far as (banning) the entire site.

Twitter also allows users to post messages under pseudonyms, instead of using their real identities, making it a popular choice among protesters.\n\nTwitter is one of the most popular communications channels in Turkey. Outraged Turkish users took to Twitter on Friday, mocking the ban by circumventing the restrictions through virtual private networks and text messages.\n\nA court in Turkey blocked access to Twitter after Erdogan\'s defiant vow, on the campaign trail on Thursday ahead of March 30 local elections, to ""wipe out"" the social media service, whatever the international community had to say about it.\n\nThe order followed a document posted on Twitter that purported to be transcripts of phone conversations relating to a corruption investigation of former cabinet ministers close to Erdogan.\n\nIndustry Minister Fikri Isik said talks with Twitter were taking place and the ban would be lifted if the San Francisco-based firm appointed a representative in Turkey and agreed to block specific content when requested by Turkish courts.\n\nA Twitter spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.\n\nTwitter has said it stands with users in Turkey and published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.\n\nThe clash with the Turkish government highlighted the broad policy challenges facing Twitter, which enjoys significant traction precisely in countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, where restrictive speech laws and the reach of government censors have conflicted with Twitter\'s free-speech principles.\n\nBecause of its nature as a public, broadcast medium and its viral network model, where information (or rumours) can spread exponentially through ""retweets,"" Twitter has been viewed as a particularly destabilizing force.\n\nTwitter was blocked for roughly four years in Iran following protests during its 2009 presidential election, while David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, suggested during the London riots in 2011 that he might block the service, although never followed through.\n\nThe Turkish ban this week came just days after Chief Executive Dick Costolo paid his first visit to China, where Twitter has also been banned since 2009.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Photo: Getty Images\n\nIstanbul: Turkey on Friday blocked access to Twitter nine days before local elections, as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan acted on his vow to shut down leaks targeting his government amid a corruption probe.\n\nThe move was criticised both within Turkey and overseas, as users accessed Twitter via proxies and other work-arounds. President Abdullah Gul was one of them, posting to his Twitter account that the total ban of a social media platform ""can\'t be condoned"" and that he hoped it wouldn\'t last.\n\nEuropean Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes called Erdogan\'s ban a ""groundless, pointless, cowardly"" act of censorship. European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the premier is ""waging a campaign against all the media and press that he cannot directly influence or control.""\n\nThe shutdown began hours after Erdogan said San Francisco-based Twitter had ignored court orders to remove content related to the graft investigation. He\'s also threatened to block Facebook and YouTube, where users have shared material including videos, recordings and transcripts that were first leaked via Twitter. Some of them are tied to a police investigation of government corruption which has cost four cabinet ministers their jobs and roiled markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has been estimated that there are 10 million Twitter users in Turkey.\n\nThe benchmark stock index has dropped 22 percent in dollar terms, the worst performance worldwide, since the corruption allegations were made public on December 17. The lira has slid 10 percent.\n\nThe premier says the investigation and leaks are part of an effort to undermine him ahead of March 30 municipal elections. He blames supporters of a United States-based Islamic cleric, Fethullah Gulen, within Turkey\'s courts and security forces, with support from Turkey\'s foreign enemies. Erdogan has responded by removing the prosecutors in charge and purging thousands of police, effectively blocking further inquiries.\n\nAt a rally on Thursday he vowed to ""dig up Twitter and so on - all of them - from the roots"" and said he didn\'t care about the international response.\n\nKemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People\'s Party, said the ban was harming Turkey\'s image in the world and the party was applying to overturn it. Lutfi Elvan, the minister for communications, said it was imposed because of a court ruling related to pornographic pictures, Star newspaper reported on Friday.\n\nNu Wexler, a spokesman for Twitter, declined to comment. Last month, Twitter said the Venezuelan government blocked users\' online images amid protests by opposition groups against inflation and shortages of goods. China, which maintains a system known as the Great Firewall to limit its citizens\' access to the internet, has banned Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThe tweets targeted by Erdogan are primarily from two anonymous users: one going by the name of Haramzadeler, a phrase translated by Turkish media as ""Sons of Thieves"" though it could also mean ""bastards,"" and another called Bascalan or ""Prime Thief,"" a play on the Turkish term for prime minister.\n\nAlmost every day they publish new material, mostly from alleged wiretappings of conversations. The leaks call into question everything from the financial probity of ministers to their religious piety, and provide evidence of a media browbeaten by the government. Ministers say the recordings are fabricated or assembled by montage.\n\nEarlier this week, Erdogan\'s party prevented the opposition from reading a prosecutor\'s statement outlining some of the allegations in parliament. The ruling party\'s Nurettin Canikli said there was no need to read them because they\'d been leaked and ""everyone already has them in their hands.""\n\nLocal media has reported that the most damaging leaks were yet to come. In a column in the Yeni Safak newspaper on Thursday, Hayrettin Karaman, a retired professor of Islamic law, preemptively denied the validity of a tape he said would be aired showing him advising Erdogan on whether Islam would permit him to order the killing of politician Muhsin Yazicioglu, who died in a helicopter crash on March 25, 2009.\n\nOn Thursday, a prominent Turkish news anchorwoman denied rumours of a sexual affair with the prime minister.

We hope to have full access returned soon,” the company said in a tweet.\n\nA company spokesman declined to say whether it would appoint someone in Turkey but said it was moving forward in talks with the government.\n\nTech-savvy Turks – President Abdullah Gul apparently among them – quickly found ways to circumvent the ban, with the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey among the top trending globally on Friday.\n\n“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted, voicing his hope that the ban would be short-lived and setting himself publicly at odds with the prime minister.\n\nErdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government wrongdoing. He did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.\n\nTurkey’s main opposition party said it would challenge the ban and file a criminal complaint against Erdogan on the grounds of violating personal freedoms. The country’s bar association filed a separate court challenge.\n\nTwitter users called the move a “digital coup”, some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled. There were also calls for protests.\n\n“Waking up to no Twitter in Turkey feels like waking up to a coup. The modern equivalent of occupying the radio stations,” U.S. author and journalist Andrew Finkel, who has reported from Turkey for more than 20 years, said on his Twitter account.\n\nErdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights the corruption scandal, which the prime minister has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.\n\nGul, seen as a more conciliatory figure than Erdogan, has been hesitant to openly criticize the prime minister in the run-up to the election, despite the scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government.\n\nThe two co-founded the Islamist-rooted AK Party and Gul is seen as a potential successor to Erdogan should the latter run for the presidency in an August vote. His critics say his own ambitions have made him too cautious about challenging Erdogan, by far the most powerful figure in the ruling party.\n\nEUROPEAN VALUES?\n\nTelecoms watchdog BTK said Twitter had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.\n\n“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens,” it said.\n\nEuropean Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said the move raised grave concerns and “cast doubt on Turkey’s stated commitment to European values and standards”. Turkey has been seeking membership of the EU for decades.\n\nGermany, home to the largest Turkish diaspora in Europe, said the move did not fit with its view of freedom of expression, while the British Foreign Office said social media had a “vital role to play in a modern democracy”.\n\nTurkey’s financial markets were unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares underperforming emerging markets peers and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 percent from 11.12.\n\nTwitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.\n\nErdogan was scathing about the service on Thursday. “We will wipe out all of these,” he said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is.”\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said he expected the block to be temporary while Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek told state broadcaster TRT Haber the closure “does not derive from a prohibitive mentality” and was nothing other than the application of a court ruling.\n\nImage: Reuters/Stringer', '“We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform.\nHe did not mention the Twitter ban at two campaign rallies on Friday.\nTwitter users called the move a “digital coup”, some comparing Turkey to Iran and North Korea, where social media platforms are tightly controlled.\nIt said the social media service had ignored previous requests to remove content.\nTwitter published a tweet to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.']"

Erdogan, who could claim many early successes in growing the economy, limiting the military’s influence over Turkish politics, and moving the country closer to the European Union, has now, apparently, convinced himself that everyone is out to get him. Some people no doubt are, but Erdogan has let his paranoia drive his politics, to his and the region’s detriment.\n\nWhen leaders in young democracies face growing opposition, falling back on populism and ideology becomes one way to shore up the support of those you know you can count on.\n\nErdogan’s Turkey is a classic example of an “illiberal democracy,” where populist leaders win one election after another. Cloaking themselves in victory, they seek to limit civil liberties and suppress dissent. While it clearly hasn’t “worked” in Erdogan’s case – Turkey’s Twitter ban is trending worldwide – there is a logic to such moves.\n\nWhen leaders in young democracies (and even old ones) face growing opposition and struggle to deliver on their promises, falling back on populism and ideology becomes one way to close the gap and shore up the support of those you know you can count on – your base. The timing, too, is far from coincidental; local elections are set for March 30, which, in a way, are a referendum on Erdogan’s increasingly controversial, even erratic policies.\n\nThe idiosyncrasies of individuals can, in fact, matter just as much as the more tangible, structural factors that political scientists tend to focus on most. It was Erdogan, with his charisma and sheer force of personality, who helped revive Turkey in the early 2000s. And it is Erdogan, now, who appears intent on undermining the very Turkish “model” he popularized.\n\nIn a sense, Erdogan fell victim to his own success.

Turkey has become a case study in the reversal of political reforms, especially in the area of freedom of expression. The recent ban on Twitter is the logical next step in a process that has unfolded during the last few years in which the Turkish government has sought to intimidate and thereby silence critical journalists, academics and other observers. Erdogan, who is both paranoid and calculating, has sought to frame his offensive against freedom of expression as a fight against foreign plots to dishonor Turkey and undermine its recent prosperity and diplomatic influence.\n\nThe Turkish educational system nurtures a not entirely unwarranted mistrust of foreign powers, lending credence to Erdogan’s message among his sizeable core constituency who will vote for the A.K.P. in the March 30 municipal elections. Still, for many Turks the ban on Twitter is reminiscent of the tactics that recently deposed Arab leaders employed to gain political control.

In 2007, a Turkish judge ordered the nation’s telecom providers to block access to YouTube in response to videos that insulted the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, which is a crime under Turkish law. The video that sparked the controversy was a parody news broadcast that read, “Today’s news: Kamal Ataturk was gay!” The clip was posted by Greek soccer fans trying to taunt their Turkish rivals. The original offending video was voluntarily removed by YouTube users. But after the video was taken down, Turkish prosecutors objected to dozens of other YouTube videos that they claimed insulted either Ataturk or “Turkishness.”\n\nCensorship does not bode well for Turkish democracy, especially at a time when Turkey is reviving its bid to become an E.U. member.\n\nThe YouTube blackout of 2007 was not imposed by Turkey’s governing Justice and Development Party (A.K.P.). The ban had originated with the secular judiciary and several A.K.P. members of parliament harshly criticized it. Meanwhile, during the YouTube ban, the country’s prime minister had recorded a video showing his dramatic exit from the panel discussion on Gaza at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and had advised the reporters accompanying him to watch it on YouTube. When a reporter reminded the prime minister that YouTube was blocked in Turkey, he responded: “I get in; you can do so as well.”\n\nTurkish Twitter users are doing just that: bypassing the most recent Twitter ban. Once again the ban has been imposed by the judiciary. But this time it was the government that made the decision. Censorship deeply embedded in Turkish political culture does not bode well for democracy, especially at a time when Turkey is trying to revive its bid to become a European Union member. In a functioning democracy, citizens have a right to express themselves on political matters without the danger of punishment. They have a right to seek alternative sources of information and that right has to be protected by law.

There were reports that the party recruited thousands of people for a massive attack against government critics through Twitter, Facebook and YouTube messages, which often contained threats and intimidation.\n\n\n\nHaving already declared Twitter and social media as “menaces,” Erdoğan’s policy was lacking intelligence, creativity and content, which led to a total failure of the project. Well, he then did what any ordinary authoritarian leader would do and banned them.\n\n\n\nErdoğan’s move to block access to Twitter can only be described as stealing people’s freedoms. Turkey has 12 million Twitter users and is one of the leading countries in the use of social media, especially in a media environment where the government is exerting all of its efforts to undermine the freedom of the press. A majority of the Turkish media is biased and effectively acts as “Erdoğan’s Pravda,” while the remaining outlets are under huge pressure not to report corruption and graft claims associated with Erdoğan, his family and Cabinet members. Erdoğan had signaled that he was considering shutting down YouTube and Twitter two weeks ago, in order to stop the leaks of his phone conversations with his family members and businessmen, which are considered to be powerful evidence of his corrupt relations. But there are also rumors that the worst has yet to come and that Erdoğan’s rush is to prevent the release of this very worst.\n\n\n\nAs of the afternoon of March 21, Turkish President Abdullah Gül, EU Commissioner Stefan Füle, the State Department of the U.S. and numerous national and international organizations, have voiced their opposition to the move, expressing grave concerns and calling on the government to lift the Twitter ban. Even Cabinet ministers Mehmet Şimşek and Ali Babacan expressed their belief that the ban would not last long, and underlined the importance of social media for an open society. But who wants an open society? Not Erdoğan, obviously.\n\n\n\nStarting from the massive Gezi protests and escalations during the Dec. 17, 2013 corruption and graft operation process, we are observing the regression of Turkey’s democratic achievements under Erdoğan’s government. His uncontrolled anger that results in uncalculated moves is landing huge blows on people’s lives and their hopes for the future. With his recent steps, he stole the people’s belief in justice, the people’s notion of public conscious and of individual liberties. At this point, I recalled a book by American author Ron Paul Jones, titled “The Way to Steal Freedom,” as he introduced it as a guide for government.\n\n\n\n“To steal freedom, do whatever this book says,” it reads, citing the following methods:\n\n\n\n“Purge government officials and opposition leaders--Attack laws and the constitution--Take advantage of opportunities--Blame scapegoats, foreign and domestic--Use the military in domestic crises--Create domestic wars everywhere--Keep the people under close surveillance--Embrace tracking technologies--Pass hate crime laws--Maintain terrorist lists, immigrant lists, sexual offender lists, etc.--Take away people’s property--Control education--Expand military draft--Engage in aggressive interrogation and torture--Suspend habeas corpus (a key judicial act that nixes arbitrary arrest)-- Limit free speech and assembly--Control media through censorship--Require gun registration--Control guns through economic means--Manage the economy--Increase the income tax and inflation tax.”\n\n\n\nWho would disagree that a good majority of these methods are now being used by the government? Erdoğan, especially on the eve of the elections, is doing everything he can just to cover up a probe into how millions of euros and dollars of this country have been stolen. Instead of weakening the democratic pillars of Turkey and of giving a major blow to the country’s reputation through his irresponsible and unwise moves, he should allow a total investigation on corruption allegations to clear his and his party’s record. Otherwise, history will cite him among the most corrupt politicians, who in particular stole the future and hope of his nation.', 'Erdoğan is stealing people’s freedom It was during and immediately after last year’s Gezi protests that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) realized the importance of social media, and decided to establish a powerful social media team in order to suppress government opponents.\nHaving already declared Twitter and social media as “menaces,” Erdoğan’s policy was lacking intelligence, creativity and content, which led to a total failure of the project.\nErdoğan’s move to block access to Twitter can only be described as stealing people’s freedoms.\nEven Cabinet ministers Mehmet Şimşek and Ali Babacan expressed their belief that the ban would not last long, and underlined the importance of social media for an open society.\nWith his recent steps, he stole the people’s belief in justice, the people’s notion of public conscious and of individual liberties.']"

His latest salvo was handing over micro-blogging website Twitter, which was Premier Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s long-time foe.\n\n\n\nJust like many other authoritarian leaders in the neighborhood, the Turkish prime minister has never been content with social media due to its uncontrollable character in a country, which is ruled by the absolute hand of one man: Erdoğan himself. His outburst for a vendetta on Twitter was not new. During the heights of the anti-government Gezi protests, the premier called the network “a trouble” amid the widespread use of Twitter and other social media tools by Gezi demonstrators.\n\n\n\nThe trouble was apparently at a “tolerable” level for the prime minister in those days or he did not think the trouble would be one of the final strokes against him in his fight for political survival.\n\n\n\nScandalous secretly-recorded tapes have been released by clandestine Twitter accounts in the last couple of months, featuring voices that are said to belong to the prime minister, many other cabinet members, senior officials and their family members. Daily-basis releases have cemented the idea that the premier and his inner circle were heavily involved in a corruption scandal unleashed by Erdoğan’s ally-turned-foe Hizmet (Service) Movement and its U.S.-based leader Fethullah Gülen.\n\n\n\nThe premier has girded on his sword against Twitter and vowed, actually ordered, to rout out the network. The message was clear; therefore, prosecutors even from the now-defunct Specially Authorized Courts rushed to find a reason for the closure. It was not a difficult task and some old files have resurfaced and the absolute authority on the Internet - thanks to a recently approved censorship law - Turkey’s top communication watchdog arranged the blackout.\n\n\n\nBut is that it? Is pulling the plug of a social network website, which has over 12 million users in Turkey, that simple in the times of a growing tech era? The answer was given by Turkish Twitter users, including the deputy prime minister and even the president, who first thing in the morning found alternatives routes to reach the website.\n\n\n\nSo, what is the prime minister’s motivation for a nonsense ban? Did he think he would be able to silence his critics and cover up the mounting corruption case? He is obviously not tech-savvy, but his bully and infamous cyber team, a.k.a “AK trolls,” must have known and warned him that pulling the plug would not be enough.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the prime minister did not care about Twitter with his ban order. Actually, it was a show of force for him that he is still mighty enough to shut down the website in spite of the local and international outrage and criticism over freedom of speech, which has not bothered him at all since coming to power. His arrogance was crystalized by himself at an election rally hours before the Twitter ban, “I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic’s state.”\n\n\n\nIn fact, it was not the state’s, but the limits of his power that the prime minister wanted to show to everyone in and abroad Turkey, as his unquestionable control in the country and the unbeaten myth of his party has been shaking recently in the wake of the massive corruption scandal. On the other hand, it is also a signal that the light at the end of the tunnel is in sight for those who have heavily suffered under his rule, since the prime minister is taking steps that would have both local and global backlashes. Even if Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) is the first party in the upcoming March 30 elections, he lost ground and turning tides upside down will be much more difficult, since the attacks on him would be harsher amid his ongoing calls for a vendetta, which would see worse actions than the Twitter ban.', 'With fears of an end, Turkish PM takes blunter steps The embattled prime minister of Turkey fears, and eventually will admit, that his over a decade-long era is nearing its end, thus, he has been taking blunter steps and tightening the screw on the country day by day.\nHis latest salvo was handing over micro-blogging website Twitter, which was Premier Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s long-time foe.\nJust like many other authoritarian leaders in the neighborhood, the Turkish prime minister has never been content with social media due to its uncontrollable character in a country, which is ruled by the absolute hand of one man: Erdoğan himself.\nThe answer was given by Turkish Twitter users, including the deputy prime minister and even the president, who first thing in the morning found alternatives routes to reach the website.\nHis arrogance was crystalized by himself at an election rally hours before the Twitter ban, “I don’t care what the international community says.']"

On Thursday night (March 20), I was driving home at a time that Istanbul’s sluggish traffic was at its worst. A friend called me and asked, “Have you heard what Erdoğan just said? He claimed he would eradicate Twitter.” I was surely surprised, but not terribly worried. “It is horrible that he said something like this,” I replied to my friend. “But he probably cannot really do that. Turkey is not Iran or China.”\n\n\n\nWell, it turned out that I was too naïve. I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!\n\n\n\nThis, of course, is unacceptable and shows how far the government has moved away from the days it was doing reform after reform to bring more freedom to Turkey. Quite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.\n\n\n\nOne can wonder how this ban exactly came to be. Notably, it is based on not a court order, but a political decision by the Communication Technologies Institution (CTI), which is a branch of the government. (Erdogan, with a recent law, had increased the powers of the CTI.) In its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.\n\n\n\nBesides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule. This became apparent during the Gezi Park protests of last summer, during which demonstrators organized themselves and carried out their propaganda on Twitter. Erdoğan, then, had defined social media as “a menace to society,” but did not take any measure to ban it.\n\n\n\nThe real menace emerged this year, in the past two months, when dozens of wiretapped phone conversations between key figures of the governing elites, including Erdoğan himself, appeared on the Internet. All conversations implied a scandalous truth about the government --- such as manipulation of the media, interference in the judicial process, or mere corruption. Hence Erdoğan defined this effort as a “coup attempt” by the “parallel state” that has allegedly been created within the police force and the judiciary by the religious followers of the Islamic scholar Fethullah Gülen.\n\n\n\nAll those wiretapped conversations have been uploaded to YouTube, but they went viral mainly thanks to Twitter, which is used by more than 12 million Turks and which really has become a universe of its own. By shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”\n\n\n\nThe government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it. If the audios in question were really about private life, such as sex, then I would understand that argument. (In the past, Turkey has seen sex tapes of politicians, which really deserved condemnation and censorship.) But in the past two months, what we have learned thanks to social media are political facts about the government that the public really deserves to learn.\n\n\n\nWhat is worrying is what might come next. Every government has a right to defend itself, but they range from liberal democracies to dictatorships based on what sort of things they dare to do for that end. We will see how far Erdoğan will go.', 'I went to bed that night, woke up early in the morning, and saw that, lo and behold, Twitter was gone!\nQuite the contrary, Turkey is moving away from freedom these days, and the ban on Twitter shows how dramatic this decline has become.\nIn its statement, the CTI referred to several court orders to block certain Twitter accounts, but these were all individual cases in which one certain Twitter account was found guilty of “offense” or “violation of privacy.” There was simply no legal basis to shut down the whole of Twitter.\nBesides technicalities, here is the real reason why Erdoğan decided to “eradicate” Twitter: It has become a political threat to his rule.\nBy shutting down Twitter, Erdoğan, thus, wants to block this instrument of the “coup.”The government’s argument is there are “violations of privacy” on social media, and that is why they need to block it.']"

Within hours, an Ankara court had shut down the site to the 12 million Twitter accounts in Turkey.\n\n\n\nThe official reason from the PM’s press office was shown as the number of court cases opened by Turkish citizens against Twitter on the basis that they had been insulted.\n\n\n\nBut there are many speculations about the actual reason for the unfortunate move.\n\n\n\nErdoğan has been getting more upset because of leaks of wiretap records of telephone conversations between him and his family members, Cabinet members, media figures, and business figures, with lots of claims of corruption. This has been the case ever since the graft probe started on Dec. 17, 2013, which has so far cost Erdoğan the resignations of four ministers.\n\n\n\nInstead of opening the judicial path to investigation of the corruption allegations, Erdoğan started to bash judges, prosecutors, policemen and social media for trying to stage a “coup” against him with manipulation from his former close ally Fethullah Gülen, the U.S.-resident moderate Islamist scholar. It was then that the leaks started to cause so many headaches for the prime minister.\n\n\n\nAs Turkey approaches the March 30 local elections, Erdoğan and his close aides have started to worry about more leaks, which could affect the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AK Parti) votes.\n\n\n\nErdoğan first introduced more political control over judges and prosecutors, and then passed a law restricting the use of the Internet, taking advantage of the AK Parti’s domination of Parliament.\n\n\n\nBut nobody expected that he would act so quickly and so firmly as to shut Twitter down completely.\n\n\n\nThere are speculations regarding the timing of the move as well.\n\n\n\nWhen the day turns from March 20 to March 21, day and night are equal in the northern hemisphere, which marks one of the most ancient festivities on earth: Nevruz (Nooruz in Persian, Novruz in Azeri, and Newroz in Kurdish). On March 21 in the predominantly Kurdish populated city of Diyarbakır, the Kurdish problem-focused Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) held a big rally. It featured a message from Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned leader of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which shares the same grassroots with the BDP.\n\n\n\nErdoğan’s government was uncomfortable with the possibility that the PKK would end the dialogue process on the grounds that the government has not been doing enough, or at least give an ultimatum to end the cease-fire.\n\n\n\nThere is speculation that those who are leaking the documents could have a recording between Turkish Intelligence Organization (MİT) Chief Hakan Fidan and Öcalan about guarantees for his release. The possibility of a leak before the BDP’s Nevruz rally could ruin all Erdoğan’s game plan before the March 30 elections.\n\n\n\nSo he preferred the hard way and shut down Twitter, which he sees as the source of the leaks.\n\n\n\nErdoğan had once promised to take the Turkish people into the European Union, or at least to the level of the EU’s democratic standards, but with the latest ban he has put Turkey in the same league as North Korea, China and Iran.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, hours after the ban most Turkish users were back on Twitter, using the ways and means of digital technology.\n\n\n\nWhat’s more, to Erdoğan’s dismay, those rejoining Twitter and breaking the ban included Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç and Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek (a genuine Twitter addict).\n\n\n\nPresident Abdullah Gül, who had “unwillingly” approved the recent Internet law, also broke the law, saying via his own Twitter account that he was against the ban.\n\n\n\nImmediately after the ban went into effect, millions of Turkish Twitter users hit back, defying the restrictions and demonstrating that the walls of fear that Erdoğan is trying to build have started to fall apart.\n\n\n\nIt is getting more difficult for Erdoğan to rule Turkey as he has done up to now, even if his AK Parti comes first on March 30.', 'Erdoğan lost his Twitter battle - very badly On March 20, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan said in an election rally that he wanted to “root out” Twitter, no matter what the “international community” thought.\nWithin hours, an Ankara court had shut down the site to the 12 million Twitter accounts in Turkey.\nIt was then that the leaks started to cause so many headaches for the prime minister.\nBut nobody expected that he would act so quickly and so firmly as to shut Twitter down completely.\nNevertheless, hours after the ban most Turkish users were back on Twitter, using the ways and means of digital technology.']"

Tweets have proliferated with links to recordings that appear to incriminate him and other top officials in corruption.\n\nTurkey in the past has blocked access to YouTube, but this is the first ban on Twitter, which is hugely popular in the country — to the point where Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against the government last year.\n\nBy midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.\n\nPresident Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Gul, once a political ally of Erdogan, has spoken out against Internet censorship in the past, although last month he approved government moves to tighten controls over the Internet.\n\n""I hope this implementation won\'t last long,"" he wrote.\n\nLinks to leaked recordings have been popping up on two Turkish Twitter accounts, including one in which a voice resembling Erdogan\'s instructs his son to dispose of large amounts of cash from a residence amid a police graft investigation. Erdogan, who denies corruption, said the recording was fabricated and part of a plot by followers of an influential U.S.-based Muslim cleric to discredit the government before March 30 local elections.\n\nErdogan has cast the elections as a referendum on his rule.\n\n""Prime Minister Erdogan\'s move spells the lengths he will go to censor the flood of politically damaging wiretap recordings circulating on social media,"" said Emma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.\n\nAndrew Przybylski, a researcher at Britain\'s Oxford Internet Institute, said the ban appeared to be working through Domain Name System — or DNS — blocking, which was easy to work around.\n\nHe said many Twitter-hungry Turks manually changed the DNS settings on their computers and in their phones to point to Google\'s Domain Name System, which isn\'t affected by the ban.\n\nEarlier, many users trying to access the network instead saw a notice from Turkey\'s telecommunications authority, citing four court orders.\n\nTurkey\'s lawyers\' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey\'s main opposition party also applied for a cancellation.\n\nTwitter\'s @policy account tweeted: ""We stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon.""\n\nEarlier, it sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or ""SMS.""\n\nEuropean Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey — a country that is seeking to join the European Union — as ""groundless, pointless, cowardly."" Other EU officials also voiced concerns.\n\nLutfi Elvan, Turkey\'s minister in charge of transport and communications, said Turkey was merely obeying court orders — although an Istanbul lawyers group argued the court decisions were about blocking access to websites deemed to be violating privacy — not the entire website. The telecommunications authority accused Twitter of violating ""personal rights and the confidentiality of private lives"" and said access would be restored only when Twitter removes illegal content.\n\n""Turkey is not a country that bans the Internet,"" Elvan said. ""We have to stand together against insults and unlawfulness.""\n\nTechnology Minister Fikri Isik said officials were holding talks with Twitter and that the ban would be lifted if an agreement is reached.\n\nThe original source of the leaked recordings is unclear.

29175,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/03/21/turkeys-twitter-ban-is-not-an-example-of-the-streisand-effect/,business,"['\n\nAn image of Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan on a twitter account is pictured through a magnifying glass in this illustration picture taken in Istanbul March 21, 2014. (Murad Sezer/Reuters)\n\nTechPresident reports that the Turkish government’s ban on Twitter has resulted in a big surge in Turkish Twitter activity. Technology geeks use the metaphor of the “Streisand effect” to describe this kind of self-undermining effort to stop news from spreading. When Barbra Streisand tried to sue an environmentalist who had incidentally photographed her house as part of a project on beach erosion, she drew attention to the photo. It was then seen by many more people than would otherwise have seen it. Similarly, the Turkish government’s efforts to block access to possible evidence of corruption have been depicted by techies as a self-defeating move that only makes people more aware of it.\n\nThey’re probably wrong. The Streisand Effect, as journalist Mike Masnick originally defined it, doesn’t really apply here. Most Turks who were potentially interested in Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s recorded phone calls knew about them already. The tapped conversations have been the topic of widespread gossip and speculation in Turkey for weeks. This information would not have languished in obscurity if the Twitter ban hadn’t happened.\n\nIf the government ban does backfire politically, it may be for the same reasons that Egypt’s Arab Spring era crackdown on the Internet failed in 2011. In Egypt, the protests got bigger after Egypt’s Internet access was shut down. Thomas Schelling’s arguments about signaling plausibly help explain why this happened. The blockage sent an unintended signal to the Egyptian public — that the government was so terrified by the demonstrations that it was willing to take the drastic step of blocking the Internet to slow protesters down. This, in turn, made the public more likely to believe that the regime would lose, and more willing to support demonstrations. Egyptian economic and political elites began to defect from the regime, having no desire to lash themselves to the mast of a sinking ship.\n\nSimilarly, the Twitter ban may make Turks more likely to think that the current government is in trouble in the forthcoming elections. It will be particularly interesting to see how economic and political elites react. If the ban leads to them distancing themselves from Erdogan (as Turkey’s president has done, although admittedly he has been unhappy for a while), it will be tougher for Erdogan to hold his electoral coalition together. The fear of defeat can sometimes be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If, alternatively, they hold together, Erdogan’s prospects are less likely to be damaged. In short, the ban will have political consequences if actors interpret it as providing information about Erdogan’s private beliefs about his party’s electoral prospects. It will not have consequences because it highlights new information about Erdogan’s possible corruption, since voters who are likely to be influenced by this information probably know it already.\n\nSchelling’s insights could be applied to other self-defeating efforts by governments to crack down on information-fueled protests. For example, the former Ukrainian government tried to terrify protesters into going home by texting them to tell them that the government knew they had been at the protests (presumably through the geolocation features on their cellphones, or through figuring out which mast their phones had connected to). Schelling’s theory of “bridge-burning” suggests why this backfired. Schelling describes how leaders give their followers incentives to win, by making defeat more costly. If an army burns the bridge behind it, it has nowhere to retreat to, and therefore must win and advance if it is to survive. The Ukrainian government may plausibly have burnt the bridges of the protesters that it was instead trying to discourage. Since they knew that they had been identified, and were likely to be imprisoned and worse if they lost, they had excellently strong incentives to persevere and to win. Which they did; albeit with unpredicted consequences that the world is still trying to figure out.', '(Murad Sezer/Reuters)TechPresident reports that the Turkish government’s ban on Twitter has resulted in a big surge in Turkish Twitter activity.\nTechnology geeks use the metaphor of the “Streisand effect” to describe this kind of self-undermining effort to stop news from spreading.\nThe Streisand Effect, as journalist Mike Masnick originally defined it, doesn’t really apply here.\nThis information would not have languished in obscurity if the Twitter ban hadn’t happened.\nSimilarly, the Twitter ban may make Turks more likely to think that the current government is in trouble in the forthcoming elections.']"

Visibility had improved from Thursday, but no trace was found of the floating objects spotted by a satellite days ago. “Noting that we got no radar detections yesterday, we have replanned the search to be visual. So aircraft flying relatively low, very highly skilled and trained observers looking out of the aircraft windows and looking to see objects,” said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. “It’s about the most inaccessible spot that you could imagine on the face of the Earth, but if there is anything down there we will find it,” Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. The batteries that power the locator beacon on the flight data recorder are expected to last a month, or roughly two more weeks.\n\nPutin makes annexation of Crimea official\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin finalized Russia’s internationally condemned annexation of Crimea on Friday, signing a law that declares the Ukrainian republic to be Russian soil. Putin ordered fireworks displays in Moscow and Crimea, and he publicly joked about U.S. sanctions on his associates, saying, “We should keep our distance from those people who compromise us.” Almost simultaneously in Brussels, EU leaders signed a political association agreement with the new Ukrainian prime minister — part of the same deal that was scrapped by then-President Viktor Yanukovych, igniting months of protests that drove him from power. “This deal meets the aspirations of millions of Ukrainians that want to be a part of the European Union,” Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, visiting Kiev, urged talks between Russia and Ukraine. “At times like this, it is vital that all parties refrain from any provocative actions that could exacerbate an already very tense and very volatile situation,” he said. In Crimea, meanwhile, Ukrainian troops faced a critical choice: Leave, join the Russian military or demobilize. Ukraine was working on evacuating its beleaguered troops, but some said they were still awaiting orders.\n\nTurkey’s attempt to shut down Twitter is a Fail Whale\n\nShut down Twitter, will you? We’ll see. After Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the microblogging site, Turkey’s telecommunications authority said it had blocked access to Twitter. But the tech-savvy opposition quickly found a workaround, and a flood of tweets publicized recordings that appear to incriminate Erdogan and other officials as corrupt. Twitter is so popular in Turkey that Turkish hashtags routinely appear in global trends. Tweets were fast and furious Friday as users swapped instructions on how to change their settings to circumvent the ban. One user spread the word by defacing election posters with instructions on how to beat the censors. Even President Abdullah Gul, once an Erdogan ally, spoke out against the shutdown of Twitter. The White House press secretary also weighed in, releasing a statement that read, “We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association.”\n\nWhy Hawaii’s finest should be free to hire hookers\n\nHonolulu police officers are urging lawmakers not to overturn an exemption that allows them to have sex with hookers while on duty. The Five-0 say they need legal clearance to do the deed when conducting, um, “undercover” investigations — otherwise prostitutes will insist on having sex just to out them as cops. One retired FBI special agent experienced in sex crimes was appalled that Hawaii’s finest would be allowed to have paid sex on the job. “I don’t know of any state or federal law that allows any law enforcement officer undercover to … do what this law is allowing,” said Roger Young. “Once we agree on the price and the sex act, that’s all that you need. That breaks the law.” Lawmakers are revamping Hawaii’s prostitution laws and had proposed scrapping the exemption for officers on duty, though the exemption remains in a bill currently being debated. “The procedures and conduct of the undercover officers are regulated by department rules, which by nature have to be confidential,” Honolulu Police Maj. Jerry Inouye told the state House Judiciary Committee. “Because if prostitution suspects, pimps and other people are privy to that information, they’re going to know exactly how far the undercover officer can and cannot go.” Hook ’em, Danno!\n\nThe Wire, a summary of top national and world news stories from the Associated Press and other wire services, moves weekdays.

Rough translation: Twitter, schmitter! This was the last thing Erdogan said Thursday before the lights went out on Twitter near midnight. “We now have a court order,” declared Erdogan, who’s ensnared in a scandal inflamed by social media over recordings that purportedly reveal corruption in his administration. “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”\n\nOh, everyone’s witnessing it all right.\n\nThe funny thing about a global social-media platform, as some are starting to notice today, is that it’s not as easy as Erdogan might think to shut down by way of an order from a Turkish court.\n\nIndeed, there are 12 million people online in Turkey, and quite a few of them – including some high-ranking government officials in the country – found it quite easy to tweak their domain settings and circumvent the Prime Minister’s effort to “eradicate” the communications tools.\n\nMaking matters worse, the pointless effort drew considerable international attention, all of it bad.\n\n“The United States is deeply concerned that the Turkish government has blocked its citizens’ access to basic communication tools,” White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. “We oppose this restriction on the Turkish people’s access to information, which undermines their ability to exercise freedoms of expression and association and runs contrary to the principles of open governance that are critical to democratic governance and the universal rights that the United States stands for around the world.”\n\nTurkey, let’s not forget, is also under consideration for membership in the European Union, and stunts like these won’t help. “As a candidate country,” the British Foreign Office said, “it is important for Turkey to promote the E.U.’s core values of freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nAnd perhaps most important of all is the reason Erdogan made the move in the first place.\n\nWhen there are corruption allegations , and a government’s instinct is to address the charges by attacking the communications tools people are using to discuss the allegations, it’s time for officials to reevaluate their priorities.\n\nSince December, when a corruption investigation ensnared government officials and businessmen, including the son of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, social media networks including Twitter and YouTube have become critical alternatives to traditional media outlets. A barrage of leaks of dozens of phone calls and documents posted by unidentified critics has presented Mr. Erdogan with perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office. Some of the leaks related to efforts by Mr. Erdogan to control the media in Turkey, where, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, 40 journalists were in jail in 2013. The prime minister was accused of making personal calls to media executives and seeking to have vocal critics fired. The government called the recordings fakes, although independent analysts said they were authentic. One recording purported to be of the prime minister telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly – and angrily – insisted that the recording was fake.', '“Twitter, mwitter!” Turkey Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan cried on Thursday.\nThis was the last thing Erdogan said Thursday before the lights went out on Twitter near midnight.\nA barrage of leaks of dozens of phone calls and documents posted by unidentified critics has presented Mr. Erdogan with perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office.\nThe prime minister was accused of making personal calls to media executives and seeking to have vocal critics fired.\nMr. Erdogan has repeatedly – and angrily – insisted that the recording was fake.']"

Twitter Inc. and Turkish news media also shared some tips, as did Turkish residents through low-tech means such as graffiti and street posters.\n\nREAD MORE: Turkey’s attempt to ban Twitter backfires\n\nThe response to the ban shows why it’s difficult for governments to control the Internet. China and other countries notorious for censoring content have routinely faced efforts by citizens determined to bypass their controls. And in Turkey, people were still tweeting on Friday.\n\nHere’s a look at the ban and the ways Turkish Internet users are circumventing it:\n\nQ. Why is Turkey banning Twitter?\n\nThe ban came as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to “rip out the roots” of the social network. His remarks came after links proliferated on Twitter to recordings that appear to incriminate Erdogan and other officials in corruption. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government’s reputation ahead of local elections this month.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMany people who tried to visit Twitter on Friday got a blocking notice from Turkey’s telecommunications authority that referred to four court orders.\n\nQ. How is Twitter being blocked?\n\nInternet access providers in the country are redirecting Twitter traffic to a website that contains the blocking notice. It appears that Turkish Internet providers are doing so by changing the numeric Internet Protocol address associated with Twitter.com.\n\nThink of the domain name system as an Internet phone book. When you type in Twitter.com, your computer looks up the numeric IP address for Twitter’s website and takes you there. It’s similar to the way you can make calls on your smartphone by looking up your friends’ names rather than memorizing all the phone numbers.\n\nREAD MORE: Is Justin Kripps’ blacklisted website a sign of Internet censorship in Russia?\n\nTurkish service providers can steer you away from Twitter’s website by putting an incorrect IP address for Twitter.com in their domain name servers.\n\nQ. How are people still tweeting in Turkey?\n\nUsers can change the “phone book” their computer uses. The domain name system has multiple copies of these phone books, all of which are supposed to be identical. The Internet access provider usually picks the one used, but users can change settings on their machines to a different one. That way, Twitter.com would pull up the real IP address for Twitter’s website.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nPeople also can use masking services called proxies. A person’s PC or mobile device connects to the proxy, which uses its own domain name servers to reach out to Twitter on the user’s behalf. Turkish access providers know only that the user is reaching the proxy, not Twitter. Instead of a proxy, people can also use virtual private networks, the tools common for accessing secured corporate networks from home. Just like proxies, VPNs reach out to websites on users’ behalf. Plenty of free VPNs exist.\n\nTwitter can also be accessed by text messaging. In fact, the reason tweets are limited to 140 characters is to fit the length constraints of texts. Twitter Inc. posted on its Policy account instructions on how to send tweets through texts. The guidelines are in both English and Turkish. It’s possible to receive texts on followed accounts as well, though users must enable that one account at a time. Keep in mind that this is a Twitter feature that won’t work with other sites that get blocked.\n\nUsers also might be able to turn to Twitter aggregation services such as HootSuite. It’s similar to a proxy in that the aggregation service is what’s making contact with Twitter. The user’s computer looks up the IP address for that service, not Twitter. Many of these services let people both post and read tweets.\n\nQ. What’s the big deal about the ban if it can be circumvented?\n\nThese circumvention techniques aren’t easy for everyone to carry out. Think of the last time you had to help a tech-challenged friend or relative do something relatively simple, such as attaching a photo to an email.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe government also might step up its blocking efforts, as China does every time a new hole pops up. If people are using HootSuite, the IP address for that website can be changed as well. Proxies and VPNs can be blocked, too. If changing the domain name servers proves ineffective, there are other ways to carry out a ban – including content filtering based on keywords.\n\nAndrew Przybylski, a researcher at Oxford Internet Institute in Britain, said Turkey’s techniques so far appear relatively primitive.\n\n“This is Round One of something that could easily escalate,” Przybylski said. The domain name system is “the easiest to block, and then the easiest to get around the block. It’s more the mindset here.”', 'NEW YORK – Not long after Turkey’s prime minister imposed a ban on Twitter, Internet users in Turkey went on – what else?\nREAD MORE: Turkey’s attempt to ban Twitter backfiresThe response to the ban shows why it’s difficult for governments to control the Internet.\nHere’s a look at the ban and the ways Turkish Internet users are circumventing it:Q.\nIt appears that Turkish Internet providers are doing so by changing the numeric Internet Protocol address associated with Twitter.com.\nWhen you type in Twitter.com, your computer looks up the numeric IP address for Twitter’s website and takes you there.']"

It seems to be more than chest-thumping: The site has been experiencing widespread outages since yesterday in the country. But why would Turkey ban Twitter, and make moves to try and ban Facebook and YouTube? Here’s a brief overview as to what’s going on.\n\n\n\nWait, there’s no Twitter in Turkey? At all?\n\nWell, not officially. The ban is not terribly effective, as the Twitter feed of Turkey’s president Abdullah Gül will tell you. But the site is effectively blocked on Turkish servers.\n\nDoes he just really hate hashtags?\n\nNo, he hates being clowned on an international stage by the people he’s supposed to represent. You might remember that last year, protests broke out in Turkey over a heavy-handed police reaction to a sit-in protest over an urban development plan for Gezi Park. That blew up into enormous protests across the country, largely organized through, you guessed it, social media.\n\nBoy, they really care a lot about a park.\n\nIt was really Erdoğan and his policies at issue. Erdoğan has been seen by many as running Turkey less and less like a democracy and more and more like an authoritarian dictatorship. The protests really brought this problem into sharp relief; Turkish media tried to play it off as a minor squabble, much to the mockery of the rest of the world. The heavy-handed police violence didn’t help much either. The fact that Erdoğan was also dumb enough to do this right next to Taksim Square, a site in Turkey where twice left-leaning protesters were injured or killed by a right-wing government, did not help matters.\n\nThis is extremely oversimplifying matters: This being Turkey, there are also religious issues at play, and Erdoğan himself really should have known better, having been imprisoned for reading a poem with religious content in 1999. But the simple fact of the matter is that Erdoğan screwed up, got humiliated on the international stage for it, and now he’s going to try and make sure it doesn’t happen again.\n\n…By doing something enormously visible, clumsy, and obvious.\n\nAt a guess, this is about Erdoğan’s ego. Keep in mind his first reaction to nationwide protests was to get a law put through that lets Turkish authorities shut down any website for “privacy violations.” This was met with concern and not a little contempt in the international community, and considering his equally transparent motives for the Twitter ban, it’s unlikely this will end any better for him.', 'You may have heard that yesterday, the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, “banned” Twitter in Turkey.\nBut why would Turkey ban Twitter, and make moves to try and ban Facebook and YouTube?\nWait, there’s no Twitter in Turkey?\nThe ban is not terribly effective, as the Twitter feed of Turkey’s president Abdullah Gül will tell you.\nIt was really Erdoğan and his policies at issue.']"

I hope this measure will not last long.”\n\nTurkey restricted access to Twitter hours after Mr Erdogan gave a fiery speech in which he vowed to “root out Twitter”.\n\nMr Erdogan is ensnared in a corruption scandal, which he says is orchestrated by his “enemies”, who he claims are using social media to wage the battle.\n\nThe social platform had become a fertile ground for sharing links to leaked recordings that purport to capture corrupt deals being made by members of his administration and even his by own son.\n\n“Twitter, schmitter!” Erdogan had defiantly told his supporters at a rally in the northwestern province of Bursa on Thursday. “I don’t care what the international community says.

Citizens also played their part, using internet sites and even graffiti on walls in Istanbul to spread the instructions.\n\nTurkey is the within the top ten users of Twitter worldwide. Within 12 hours of the ban the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey had been used more than half a million times, mostly by users in Turkey itself. Others, including #OccupyTwitter and #ErdoganBlocksTwitter, were also trending.\n\nThe European Union said it was worried about the move, with Neelie Kroes, the vice president of the European Commission described the blocking of the site as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.”\n\nThe United States embassy in Ankara also took to Twitter to reiterate statements made by President Obama on the importance of free speech.\n\nBut it was the dissent at home that will be of most immediate concern to the prime minister.\n\nMr Erdogan was shaken last June by anti-government protests, but prime minister’s reactions to the corruption probe have produced the most serious challenge to his rule.\n\nHis speeches have been dominated by angry – and sometimes conspiratorial – claims that resemble more those of an autocrat than elected prime minister who was until recently heralded as Turkey’s moderniser.

It came after Mr Erdogan said he would “rip out the roots” of the website at a campaign rally on Thursday for the March 30 municipal elections. Twitter is where leaks to recordings appeared that seemed to implicate him and other top officials in a corruption scandal, which has posed the most serious test to his 11 years in power.\n\nThe content of Mr Gul’s message – and the way it was delivered – was a message to Mr Erdogan’s religiously conservative government, observers said.\n\n“This would certainly upset the prime minister,” said Mustafa Akyol, an author and newspaper columnist. “Disagreements are becoming harder to reconcile.”\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Gul made the headlines by distancing himself from Mr Erdogan’s handling of a corruption scandal that has engulfed the government since last December.\n\nMr Erdogan has called the corruption allegations parts of a foreign plot against Turkey, but Mr Gul dismissed the prime minister’s statement as “worthy of a third world country”.\n\nMr Gul, 63, and Mr Erdogan, 60, both started their careers in an Islamist party later banned by the courts and are co-founders of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) as well as long-time political allies.\n\nMr Gul served as the first AKP prime minister from late 2002 until March 2003, when he made room for Mr Erdogan and became foreign minister.\n\nMr Gul, who is seen as a more liberal politician than Mr Erdogan and a strong supporter of Turkey’s bid to join the European Union, was elected president in 2007 and remains highly respected within the AKP.\n\nAnalysts said Mr Gul wanted to make clear that he did not like the direction that the country was taking under Mr Erdogan.\n\n“This is an effort to counterbalance the harm” done by the Twitter ban, Ilter Turan, a political scientist at Istanbul’s Bilgi University said. The political relationship between Mr Gul and Mr Erdogan was “slowly developing into a more open difference of opinions”.\n\nMr Turan said Mr Erdogan was running the risk of ruining his chances to become president in elections scheduled for August. “By his own actions, he may be disqualifying himself as a candidate”.\n\nSome AKP ministers and members of parliament had displayed a marked “lack of spirit” in executing Mr Erdogan’s orders lately, Mr Turan said.\n\nIf the AKP was to do worse than expected in the March 30 elections, Mr Erdogan’s role as party leader could come into question, he said.\n\nMost polls indicate the AKP, which has led the country through a massive economic boom and has pleased religiously conservative voters by ending a ban of the Islamic headscarf in state institutions, is likely to keep its position as Turkey’s strongest party with around 40 per cent of the vote in the upcoming elections.\n\nBut some polls suggest Mr Erdogan’s party could do badly in some big cities like Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.\n\nMr Akyol, the author, said Mr Erdogan remained popular with many conservative Turks despite the wave of protests after the Twitter ban.\n\n“For the average Erdogan voter, the Twitter ban is not a problem,” he said.\n\nThe attempt to block to Twitter appeared to backfire with many tech-savvy users – besides Mr Gul – circumventing the ban.\n\nBy midday Friday, tweets were continuing unabated as users swapped instructions online on how to change settings. One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticised the ban – in a country that is seeking to join the European Union – as “groundless, pointless, cowardly.”\n\nStefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned.\n\nforeign.desk@thenational.ae', '“If there have been crimes like the violation of people’s rights, only individual pages can be banned by court order,” Mr Gul said on Twitter.\nAnalysts said Mr Gul wanted to make clear that he did not like the direction that the country was taking under Mr Erdogan.\nThe political relationship between Mr Gul and Mr Erdogan was “slowly developing into a more open difference of opinions”.\nBut some polls suggest Mr Erdogan’s party could do badly in some big cities like Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.\nMr Akyol, the author, said Mr Erdogan remained popular with many conservative Turks despite the wave of protests after the Twitter ban.']"

As of last night, the NATO member and European Union candidate had joined those four other countries with dismal freedom of expression records as one of the few nations to have instituted a total ban on access to Twitter. Turkish Twitter users have been quick to circumvent the block, but the move marks yet another disturbing anti-democratic turn for the government of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nThe block on Twitter access started late yesterday, just a few weeks after the government passed a new internet law that gives it enhanced powers to shut websites down and only hours after Erdogan vowed at a campaign rally to ""eradicate"" Twitter, which has been playing a prominent role in recent weeks as the conduit for links to leaked phone calls and documents connecting the PM and other official to corrupt activity. The Hurriyet Daily News provides some interesting background on how the new internet law was used to put the Twitter block in place through executive order, rather than a court action:\n\nTwitter, the social media platform with 12 million Turkish users, has been blocked by the Communication Technologies Institution (BTK), working under the Ministry of Transport, Maritime and Communication. The BTK, which was given extraordinary powers with a recently passed Internet law, used its initiative late last night to block access to Twitter. The institution has released a statement, arguing that there were a number of court rulings that Twitter did not abide by. “The aforementioned website, based abroad, ignored the rulings of the Turkish Republic’s courts. To prevent our citizens from receiving irreparable damage, there was no option left but to block access to Twitter in accordance with the court rulings,” the statement said. Access will be unblocked if Twitter removes “the illegal content,” the BTK warned. The most striking court verdict used as the base of the BTK’s Twitter ban comes from the Anatolia Fifth Criminal Court of Peace. The court issued the ruling, numbered 2014/181, in response to a complaint filed by former Transport Minister Binalı Yıldırım and his son (document obtained by daily Hürriyet). Yıldırım, who is also the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) current mayoral candidate in İzmir, had requested that the court block access to a Twitter account, @oyyokhırsıza (no votes for thievery), and a related blog, claiming “defamation.” @oyyokhırsıza was using strong language to refer to the allegations against Yıldırım and his son. Another two of the court rulings listed as the source of the blocking on the BTK’s website are related to the individual complaints of two citizens.\n\nInternational criticism of the ban was quick to come, with German, British and EU officials all expressing their dismay and the White House also saying it is ""deeply"" concerned by the Twitter ban, calling it ""contrary to democratic governance."" Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, described the block on Twitter as ""a fundamental blow to freedom of expression in Turkey."" But there was concern also expressed from within the Turkish government, with President Abdullah Gul (who, it must be noted, signed the controversial internet bill into law despite being urged to veto it) saying -- via Twitter, no less -- ""The wholesale shuttering of social media platforms cannot be approved. I hope this practice will not last long.""\n\nFrom the perspective of many Turkish Twitter users, the ""wholesale shuttering"" lasted only about as long as it took to fiddle with their proxy settings or figure out some other method by which to post their tweets. As sociologist Zeynep Tufekci wrote:\n\nBy the end of it all, most Trending Topics worldwide, and of course in Turkey, were about the blocking of Twitter, and of course, opposing it. Let alone be deterred, the number of Tweets in Turkish and from Turkey were close to record-breaking levels. People in Turkey had banned the ban.\n\nStill, even if a large number of Turkish Twitter users were able to get around the block, the government\'s move is a deeply disturbing one. With an estimated 10-12 million Twitter users, Turkey has the world\'s eighth highest number of people using the service and the highest penetration rate as a percentage of all internet users. The complete blocking of what has become such a vital source of news and social exchange is another indication of how warped the Erdogan government\'s understanding of the freedom of expression has become and how much the interests of the PM have become conflated with the interests of the state. For the Twitter ban to come so soon after Erdogan promised it would happen is a chilling development, one that suggests that Turkey\'s already crumbling system of checks and balances is almost completely nonexistent at this point and that -- as I wrote in a briefing this week for the World Politics Review website -- the only state institution the PM is now willing to truly defend is himself, no matter what the cost.', ""The BTK, which was given extraordinary powers with a recently passed Internet law, used its initiative late last night to block access to Twitter.\nThe institution has released a statement, arguing that there were a number of court rulings that Twitter did not abide by.\nThe most striking court verdict used as the base of the BTK’s Twitter ban comes from the Anatolia Fifth Criminal Court of Peace.\nStill, even if a large number of Turkish Twitter users were able to get around the block, the government's move is a deeply disturbing one.\nWith an estimated 10-12 million Twitter users, Turkey has the world's eighth highest number of people using the service and the highest penetration rate as a percentage of all internet users.""]"

29241,https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/03/21/escalation-in-erdogans-war-on-online-freedom-of-expression,business,"['Yesterday morning, Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan took another step in his ongoing war against the open internet, blocking Twitter. Earlier in the day, Erdogan told supporters at a campaign rally, “We now have a court order. We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”\n\nAt midnight that evening, roughly 10 million Turkish Twitter users witnessed this ‘power,’ in action. Local media reported that Turkish users trying to access Twitter instead found a website listing the four court rulings given as justification for the shutdown, courtesy of a DNS redirect by local ISPs. The court orders, and the ban, were also available on an official government website.\n\nErdogan’s office explained the reason for the expansive blocking in a statement, saying that Twitter failed to follow Turkish court orders instructing to remove certain links from their service. “If Twitter officials insist on not implementing court orders and rules of law … there will be no other option but to prevent access to Twitter to help satisfy our citizens’ grievances.”\n\nThe blocking of Twitter comes less than a month after the Parliament passed a harsh new internet censorship law, despite universal condemnation from the international human rights community.\n\nThat law, and yesterday’s redirect, have occurred against a backdrop of a flurry corruption allegations, both financial and personal, against Erdogan and others in the ruling AK Party.\n\nThe internet and Turkish social media have played a critical role in the publication of several voice recordings and documents supporting these allegations, including a voice recording of Erdogan warning his son to remove suspected cash bribes from safehouses ahead of reported police raids. While Erdogan claimed that the recording is a fake, the allegations come at a sensitive time for the AK party, just ahead of local elections at the end of March.\n\nUnpopular and ineffective\n\nUnfortunately, Turkish internet users are accustomed to government shutdowns of popular internet services, and have the necessary skills to bypass censorship. Within hours of the blockage settling into place, activists had plastered posters and spraypainted messages on buildings around Istanbul offering instructions for using alternate DNS to access Twitter and circumvent the blockages.\n\nDespite the ban, Turkish Twitter users sent more than half a million tweets during the first ten hours of the ban. This included Turkish President Abdullah Gul — the country’s second highest-ranking AK Party member — who defied the ban to tweet his objection, stating “one cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms.” Many in Turkey are using the hashtag #TwitterisblockedinTurkey to voice their anger and frustration.\n\nIn a perhaps unwitting acknowledgement of the ridiculous nature of the ban, Erdogan himself tweeted a pre-recorded video message to his supporters in the early morning hours after the ban had taken effect.\n\nTwitter itself informed Turkish users that local phone carriers continue to provide access to Twitter via short SMS, tweeting ”Turkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555.”\n\nInternational reaction\n\nErdogan’s blanket blocking of Twitter drew international condemnation. European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes described the ban as “groundless, pointless, cowardly” on her Twitter account. U.S. State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the U.S. remains “very concerned by any suggestion that social media sites could be shut down,” adding that, “an independent and unfettered media is an essential element of democratic, open societies, and crucial to ensuring official transparency and accountability.”\n\nTurkey is expanding its role on the global stage when it comes to internet issues. It is one of the nine nations represented as part of the High-Level Stakeholder Committee for next month’s NetMundial meeting in Brazil, and has been actively involved in digital rights issues at the U.N. Human Rights Council. This fall, it will host the annual Internet Governance Forum (IGF), a high-level gathering of internet policy experts, human rights advocates, and civil society groups.\n\nWith its current record, Turkey can expect the IGF meeting to echo another global internet summit, held nearly ten years ago: the Second Phase of the World Summit on the Information Society, held in Tunis during the era of Ben Ali’s ironclad censorship. It is impossible to credibly discuss the future of the internet in a country in which the internet is not free.Like in Tunisia at the time, Turkey may expect protests alongside the IGF’s discussions and roundtables.\n\nIf Turkey wants to be a global leader on internet policy, it must start by protecting a free and open internet at home.', 'Yesterday morning, Turkey’s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan took another step in his ongoing war against the open internet, blocking Twitter.\nEveryone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”At midnight that evening, roughly 10 million Turkish Twitter users witnessed this ‘power,’ in action.\nUnpopular and ineffectiveUnfortunately, Turkish internet users are accustomed to government shutdowns of popular internet services, and have the necessary skills to bypass censorship.\nDespite the ban, Turkish Twitter users sent more than half a million tweets during the first ten hours of the ban.\nTwitter itself informed Turkish users that local phone carriers continue to provide access to Twitter via short SMS, tweeting ”Turkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS.']"

But the ban backfired almost immediately, proving how much social media outlets undermine efforts to censor free speech.\n\nThe country’s decision to block Twitter comes as the prime minister dodges corruption allegations and gears up for election day on March 30. “We now have a court order. We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says,” Erdogan said during a campaign rally Wednesday. His threat was in response to published tweets linking the prime minister to money laundering scandal, accusations he said were fabricated by unnamed enemies.\n\nErdogan has expressed disapproval of social media before. Twitter helped organize and broadcast last summer’s regime-criticizing protests in Istanbul, with an explosion of millions of tweets supporting the demonstrations. After days of protests, Erdogan said social media was “the worst menace to society.” He also recently threatened to ban YouTube and Facebook, claiming the sites were being used for “all kinds of immorality, all kinds of espionage.”\n\nBut within hours of blocking Twitter, Turkish citizens spread news of the Twitter block. Twitter encouraged people to tweet via SMS, while others recommended using Google DNS to work around it. Access to other social networking sites, such as Facebook, hasn’t been affected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“As I have said many times in the past, at the point where communication technologies have reached today, it is technically impossible to entirely block access to social media platforms used across the world such as Twitter,” tweeted Turkey’s President Abdullah Gul Friday, who vehemently disapproves of the ban along with other officials. In fact, the last time Turkey banned a popular social site, Youtube, Erdogan himself confessed he, along with other citizens, could easily access the site.\n\nEfforts to silence citizens have become more difficult as the world becomes more connected. Research suggests censorship only begets the desire for more freedom online. Regardless of age and income, most people in countries with emerging or developing economies support Internet freedom, a recent Pew Research study found. Opposition to government-sanctioned Web restrictions is strongest in countries that have battled with prohibitive online policies. Most citizens of Venezuela, Lebanon, Chile and Egypt are anti-censorship, the study said. Moreover, social media, namely Twitter, has empowered those countries’ citizens by fueling government protests and expanding awareness. This suggests the ideal of “free speech” spreads globally in step with Internet access, countries that promote censorship won’t be able to keep up.\n\nSocial media — especially Twitter — have been instrumental in not just promoting free speech but effecting political change around the world. Despite more countries clamping down on Internet access, government dissenters still thrive. Shutting down nearly half of the Ukraine’s Russian TV channels didn’t stop the protests in Kyiv. Former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych’s law to restrict certain websites only fueled ongoing protests that eventually led to his ousting. Protesters simply respond to blocked sites by switching platforms to other social networks, such as WhatsApp, to keep the conversation going, underscoring the fact that shutting down a popular social site doesn’t do anything but force the debate to resume elsewhere. Turkish citizens’ rapid response shows how the advent of social media has made it nearly impossible to censor communication of any kind. The Internet has become so ingrained in everyday life that countries’ economic stability hinges on free flowing Internet access. After all, both government supporters and criticizers use social media.\n\nUpdate:\n\nRead more about the issues of press freedom in Turkey by CAP experts Michael Werz and Max Hoffman.', 'But the ban backfired almost immediately, proving how much social media outlets undermine efforts to censor free speech.\nMoreover, social media, namely Twitter, has empowered those countries’ citizens by fueling government protests and expanding awareness.\nSocial media — especially Twitter — have been instrumental in not just promoting free speech but effecting political change around the world.\nThe Internet has become so ingrained in everyday life that countries’ economic stability hinges on free flowing Internet access.\nAfter all, both government supporters and criticizers use social media.']"

One enterprising user spread the word by defacing Turkish election posters with instructions on beating censors.\n\nPresident Abdullah Gul was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets.

29286,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/21/tech-savvy-turks-erdogan-twitter-ban-censorship,business,"['Thursday was Twitter\'s eighth birthday. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan\'s birthday present to the social media giant, and to millions of Turks who use it daily, was to block the site. At about 11.20pm last night, those who wanted to use Twitter were greeted by a message from the Telecommunications Presidency referencing a court order that blocked access to it.\n\nWithin minutes, detailed methods of bypassing the block by changing DNS numbers and using VPNs were shared via Facebook, WhatsApp and text message. Hashtags using the Turkish for ""Twitter Is Blocked in Turkey"", ""Turkey Blocked Twitter"" and ""Dictator Erdoğan"" began trending worldwide almost immediately. When the official Turkish account of Twitter tweeted, ""Turkish users can send Tweets using SMS"" and gave detailed instructions, Turks were already ahead of the game.\n\nActually, there were no shortage of tweets sent from Turkey at all. TwitTurk, a website that records statistics of Turkish Twitter users, reported that more than 500,000 tweets were sent in the first two hours of the ban. Ironically enough, star names of Erdoğan\'s Justice and Development party (AKP), such as deputy prime minister Bülent Arınç and mayor of Ankara Melih Gökçek, continued tweeting well into today.\n\nWhat\'s more, the AKP also continued to create promoted tweets and trends – services Twitter provides for a hefty amount of money. The hashtag ""Gökçek Kuzey Yıldızı"" (Gökçek North Star), a campaign sponsored by AKP\'s Ankara branch to promote Gökçek\'s controversial project to build a giant mosque in the capital, became the number one trending topic in Turkey in the first couple of hours of the ban. Another pro-AKP account promoted the ruling party\'s recent television broadcast, depicting hundreds running towards a Turkish flagpole – in the fashion of zombies from World War Z – after hearing Erdoğan\'s voice reading the national anthem.\n\nAs they did during the Occupy Gezi days, Turkish citizens created memes mocking the Twitter ban. However, neither the jokes nor the fact that tech-savvy Turks bypassed the ban without batting an eyelid are enough to shield us from the grim reality behind recent censorship. Twitter has become pivotal in organising anti-government dissent in the past year: the Occupy Gezi movement, which marches against the recently passed internet censorship bill that allows the government to block any content within four hours without a court order, and the massive street protest and the funeral attended by hundreds of thousands after the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan, were initiated via social media.\n\nTwitter has also become the main channel for talking about corruption allegations implicating Erdoğan and his family. Anonymous accounts leak alleged phone recordings of Erdoğan. Waiting for new recordings to surface around 9pm each night has become the most popular pastime of millions of Turks, who then spread the news like wildfire. These accounts have been announcing that the mother of all recordings will come out on 25 March, a mere five days before the upcoming local elections. Erdoğan, aware of this, said yesterday in an election rally hours before the block took effect: ""We will eradicate Twitter. I do not care what the international community says.""\n\nIt looks like the Turkish public does not care what Erdoğan says either. Recent history around the world and in Turkey shows that social media is a serious threat to autocrats. Ancient censorship mechanisms, archaic politics and Orwellian threats do not work in the face of technological dissent and the voice of the streets.\n\nWhen your old uncle gets you something out-of-touch for your birthday, what do yo do? You say thank you and then return it. Well, thank you Erdoğan, but we do not want your gift of censorship. Here is the receipt.', 'Hashtags using the Turkish for ""Twitter Is Blocked in Turkey"", ""Turkey Blocked Twitter"" and ""Dictator Erdoğan"" began trending worldwide almost immediately.\nWhen the official Turkish account of Twitter tweeted, ""Turkish users can send Tweets using SMS"" and gave detailed instructions, Turks were already ahead of the game.\nTwitTurk, a website that records statistics of Turkish Twitter users, reported that more than 500,000 tweets were sent in the first two hours of the ban.\nAs they did during the Occupy Gezi days, Turkish citizens created memes mocking the Twitter ban.\nErdoğan, aware of this, said yesterday in an election rally hours before the block took effect: ""We will eradicate Twitter.']"

Twitter has announced that it is standing by its users and working on restoring access soon.\n\nWe stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform. We hope to have full access returned soon. — Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) March 21, 2014\n\nToday, the site and its users in the country saw a huge wave of support from around the world, as people rallied around the social network to protest the blockade. The Prime Minister, Tayyip Erdoğan, said he wanted to “wipe out” Twitter and other sites that have been critical of him and a corruption scandal that has been brewing.\n\nIn Turkey, the blockade has had many loopholes for those who want to find them. People have been using SMS messages to post to the site — Twitter’s recommended route — while others have used a workaround by changing their DNS addresses, typically using Google’s DNS and OpenDNS — a route that has become a meme in itself.\n\nGraffiti over symbols of the state and sides of building indicating DNS routes that Turks could use to get around the clumsy ban quickly went viral:\n\nTwitter is blocked in Turkey. On the streets of Istanbul, the action against censorship is graffiti DNS addresses. pic.twitter.com/XcsfN7lJvS — Utku Can (@utku) March 21, 2014\n\nThe ban on Twitter usage, weak and porous as it was, was implemented gradually. Its lifting will also likely take place in pieces. That means when and if Twitter comes back online it may not be for everyone. “I constantly talk to my friends & family. It’s still blocked and everyone is using openDNS to access Twitter,” Turkish expat Halil Kabaca, CEO and Founder at Novarum Software & Consulting, told us by email.\n\nWe’ve heard that there may also be a protest planned over the Internet blocks.\n\nWith Twitter inaccessible for many, we’ve heard people are going to Eksisozluk.com, another popular social site, to communicate more. But the fact that Twitter has such a high international profile, and has been such a touchpoint around other political conflicts has very much amplified this story.\n\n“It is a pretty big deal over here. Everybody is talking about it (ironically, on twitter),” Berna Yildiz, a foreign trade manager for BEM Berk, told us in an email today after we noticed she was Tweeting from Turkey (using a DNS workaround, it turns out). “There was a time they have banned YouTube and it stayed that way for a looong period. But even then, the president said ‘you can find a way, I use YouTube.’ [But] Erdoğan is using Twitter to create a diversion. Nothing else. There have been new regulations to spy on and restrict internet usage a month ago. Because of the tapes released about his corruption.”\n\nTurkey is unfortunately not a stranger to blocking shenanigans. “Turkey is one of our largest traffic sources in Europe,” David Ulevitch, the founder and CEO of OpenDNS, tells us. “This isn’t the first time they’ve blocked sites.” He notes that sites like WordPress in the past have also been blocked. “Using OpenDNS and our dnscrypt client that encrypts DNS is advised.”\n\nIf you need to change your DNS settings to get around the ban, or any future ban, or to speed up your access if it happens to feel slow, head here if you are a using a Mac, and here if you are on a PC. Those instructions will help you use either Google’s Public DNS, or OpenDNS. If one doesn’t work for you, try the other.\n\nTwitter has about 10 million users in Turkey, and this blockade has had the exact opposite effect on awareness of the country’s political situation and those who are opposed to it, even if usage has definitely dropped in the country itself.\n\nAccording to Sysomos, there have been 8.5 million tweets in total in Turkey from 12 AM ET March 19 – 10 AM ET March 21, compared to only 1.2 million tweets in Turkey from 12 AM ET March 21 – 10 AM ET March 21.\n\nAround 1 million of those tweets can be attributed to the fact that the Twitter website is blocked, but users can still send tweets via SMS, Sysomos said.\n\nHowever, in the last 7 days, worldwide tweets that mentioned both “Turkey” and “Twitter” went from a steady 200 per day to 80,000+ per day on March 20 and March 21. In other words, the effect of the ban has backfired. Instead of silencing dissent, it has given it new voice, and momentum.', 'Twitter Says It Is Standing By Its Users In Turkey, Hopes To Have Access ‘Returned Soon’Help appears to be at hand for advocates of free speech in Turkey, where Twitter access has been cut off after the Prime Minister accused it of helping people spread false information about him.\nTwitter has announced that it is standing by its users and working on restoring access soon.\nWe stand with our users in Turkey who rely on Twitter as a vital communications platform.\nIt’s still blocked and everyone is using openDNS to access Twitter,” Turkish expat Halil Kabaca, CEO and Founder at Novarum Software & Consulting, told us by email.\nBut even then, the president said ‘you can find a way, I use YouTube.’ [But] Erdoğan is using Twitter to create a diversion.']"

29294,http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2014/03/21/twitter-and-turkeys-slide-into-dictatorship-erdogan/,business,"['The government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been gradually chipping away at every vestige of democracy in that country for years. Independent press outlets have been suppressed and more journalists are in prison in Turkey than in any other place on earth. Political opponents of his AKP and much of the secular leadership of the military have been jailed, and demonstrators have been brutalized. Despite this terrible record the West, and in particular the Obama administration, have largely turned a blind eye to Turkey’s excesses. But by trying to ban the use of Twitter, Erdoğan may have finally picked a fight that he can’t win in the long run.\n\nThe Turkish government is standing by an order issued by a judge who is friendly to the prime minister to block the use of Twitter in Turkey. The reason for the effort is that social media, such as Twitter and YouTube, is the vehicle for spreading evidence of corruption by Erdoğan’s son and other prominent scions of the country’s Islamist elite. While social media plays an increasingly critical role in the spread of news throughout the free world, it is especially critical now in a country like Turkey because the mainstream press in that country has been effectively silenced by the dictatorial policies of the AKP and its leader. That forced the flow of information elsewhere and Erdoğan’s courts have responded with demands that Twitter and other venues remove the embarrassing content from their sites.\n\nBut by adopting a stand that undermines the notion that Turkey is a modern state that is ready to be integrated into the international economy and the European Union, Erdoğan may have worsened his problems rather than solve them. After 11 years in power during which he has ruthlessly wielded influence, the Turkish leader may have finally crossed the line that separates a feared dictator from a laughingstock. By banning Twitter, Erdoğan has begun to resemble a parody of a despot rather than the strongman who has transformed Turkey from a secular state to an Islamist tyranny.\n\nAs the New York Times reports, his inability to suppress the incriminating information about his son and his regime has sent Erdoğan over the edge:\n\nThe shutdown, which Turks began to notice around midnight, occurred 10 days before local elections and came after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan lashed out at Twitter in an election rally in Bursa, a western town, on Thursday, saying that he did not care about international reactions if national security was at stake. “Twitter, mwitter! We will wipe out roots of all,” Mr. Erdoğan declared in a campaign speech before the pivotal elections on March 30. “They say, ‘Sir, the international community can say this, can say that.’ I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the state of the Republic of Turkey is.” Mr. Erdoğan had faced perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office when unidentified critics began using Twitter and YouTube to leak dozens of phone calls and documents that seemed to tie government officials and business circles close to the government to a graft inquiry that began last December. One of the recordings purports to be of the prime minister himself telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdoğan has repeatedly — and angrily — insisted that the recording was fake.\n\nThis is far from the first instance of Erdoğan’s dictatorial manner. He has run roughshod over all legal opposition and shut down journalistic outlets that were not in his pocket. But perhaps by taking on the popular social media in such an absurd and transparently self-interested manner, a turning point may be reached on international opinion of his regime.\n\nThis is, after all, the same man President Obama described as his best friend among foreign leaders. While other Western heads of state were not quite so fulsome in their praise for Erdoğan, the result was the same, as the AKP’s excesses at home and its support for Hamas in Gaza were ignored because of Turkey’s membership in NATO and its role in supporting opposition to the Assad regime.\n\nWhile the United States has slowly started to edge away from Erdoğan, Washington needs to do more now than merely state its displeasure with the antics of the president’s friend. The same applies to Turkey’s bid for EU membership. Relations with this increasingly despotic Islamist state need to be put on hold until the country and its dictator come to their senses.', 'The government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been gradually chipping away at every vestige of democracy in that country for years.\nDespite this terrible record the West, and in particular the Obama administration, have largely turned a blind eye to Turkey’s excesses.\nBut by trying to ban the use of Twitter, Erdoğan may have finally picked a fight that he can’t win in the long run.\nThe Turkish government is standing by an order issued by a judge who is friendly to the prime minister to block the use of Twitter in Turkey.\nBy banning Twitter, Erdoğan has begun to resemble a parody of a despot rather than the strongman who has transformed Turkey from a secular state to an Islamist tyranny.']"

29314,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/21/turkey-twitter-block-putin-propaganda-research,business,"['Vladimir Putin has never been a fan of a free press or open public debates, but the Ukraine crisis has provided the Kremlin with a new favorite target for cracking down even more harshly on political expression: cyberspace. Last week, Galina Timchenko was ousted as editor of the Russian news site Lenta.ru, after publishing an interview with a right wing Ukrainian nationalist. She was replaced with an editor much more friendly toward Putin and his allies. The websites of opposition leaders Garry Kasparov and Alexei Navalny have also been targeted, along with other sites critical of the Russian president.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan, the embattled Turkish prime minister, recently pushed new censorship legislation through parliament, making it easier for the government to block web content – and now Twitter is restricted across the country.\n\nVenezuela’s Nicolás Maduro has blocked websites covering topics that might be a bit uncomfortable for his government, such as skyrocketing inflation and anti-government protests.\n\nWorld leaders may be cracking down on dissenting voices online – if ever there were a global trend, it’s that the revolution will be tweeted, and then restricted – but research shows there are reasons to be very optimistic about the future of internet freedom.\n\nAccording to Freedom House (pdf), 24 nations have added new laws or regulations that restrict online speech since May 2012. Three years after the Arab Spring began in earnest, and a quarter century after he invented the world wide web, the foundation of Tim Berners-Lee has found that “targeted blocking and filtering of politically sensitive Web content by governments is also on the rise across the globe”.\n\nIndeed, governments are becoming more clever about how to restrict speech in cyberspace, using laws against cybercrime, blasphemy or terrorism. But in a remarkably short period of time, people around the world have embraced the idea of an internet free from censorship. A new report here from the Pew Research Center shows that majorities in 22 of 24 emerging and developing nations from across the globe say it is important that people have access to the internet without government censorship. This includes solid majorities in Putin’s Russia (63%) and Erdogan’s Turkey (58%). And in Maduro’s Venezuela, a stunning 89% oppose internet censorship.\n\nA recent survey by the Pew Research Center shows that for most people, access to the internet without government censorship is important. Image: Courtesy of Pew Research Center\n\nThe data also show why autocrats might have reason to fear open discussions in cyberspace. Internet usage, participation in social networking and support for internet freedom are generally more common among young people, the college educated and those with higher incomes – exactly the groups who are often at the forefront of protest movements and political change. For example, when Hosni Mubarak fell from power in 2011, only 23% of Egyptians said they were getting news and information about the political situation in their country via social networking – however, among college-educated Egyptians the number was 67%.\n\nOverall, there is a strong relationship between internet adoption and support for internet freedom: the higher the percentage of people online in a given country, the greater the opposition to censorship.\n\nAmong the emerging and developing nations we surveyed in 2013, support for an uncensored internet is high in places like Chile and Argentina, where roughly two-thirds of the population goes online; meanwhile, it’s relatively low in countries such as Pakistan, Uganda and Indonesia, where internet penetration remains limited.\n\nOur research shows that once people get access to the internet, they quickly begin incorporating it into their lives. In 19 of 22 nations we polled, half or more of internet users said they go online daily. The data on views about censorship suggest that people not only begin to include the internet in their daily lives, they also bring it into their political thinking, and make free expression on the internet a political priority, just like other civil liberties.\n\nSpeaking in 2010, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton updated Franklin Roosevelt’s Four Freedoms by adding one for the 21st century: the freedom to connect – “the idea that governments should not prevent people from connecting to the internet, to websites, or to each other. The freedom to connect is like the freedom of assembly in cyberspace.”\n\nIt may be a while before the freedom to connect trumps Roosevelt’s original four – freedom of expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. But the internet has already become an important public gathering place, and as access spreads to more and more people around the globe, it will become a central feature of politics nearly everywhere – not just a meme but a reality. Even Putin and Erdogan may not be able to shut down sites quickly enough.', 'According to Freedom House (pdf), 24 nations have added new laws or regulations that restrict online speech since May 2012.\nAnd in Maduro’s Venezuela, a stunning 89% oppose internet censorship.\nA recent survey by the Pew Research Center shows that for most people, access to the internet without government censorship is important.\nOur research shows that once people get access to the internet, they quickly begin incorporating it into their lives.\nIn 19 of 22 nations we polled, half or more of internet users said they go online daily.']"

Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic's state.” A few hours later, Twitter users found the site blocked; instead, they were redirected to a page with a brief statement from the Turkish telecommunications regulator, citing four court orders blocking the site as a “protection measure.”According to the government, the ban was prompted by complaints from ordinary citizens that Twitter users were violating their privacy by posting personal information online: “Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimization of citizens.” In view of the facts stated above, however, it seems a great deal more likely that the ban was actually prompted by the complaints of one citizen in particular: Recep Tayyip Erdoan.What comes next is anyone’s guess.Is this the first in a series of repressive measures? Previously, Erdoan also criticized Facebook, YouTube and mainstream media sites for unflattering reports on protests. Since then, many Turkish TV news outlets and newspapers have adopted self-censorship.While the world remains focused on the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, the Turkish government’s decisive break with democratic norms may prove an even bigger disaster. In addition to removing an important role model for democracy in the Mideast, the Turkish government’s authoritarian turn will provide ammunition for critics. They say Islamist political movements, like Erdoan’s Justice and Development Party, can’t be trusted to uphold democratic values. It could also unbalance already wobbly democracies in neighboring countries like Greece.There is one glimmer of hope in all this: The Turkish president, Abdullah Gül, is taking a stand against the social media crackdown. Although the presidency is a mostly ceremonial position, it carries moral authority and serves as a “bully pulpit” that is hard to silence. On Friday, Gül tweeted (apparently via text message) that “a total shutdown of social media platforms cannot be approved.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement"", 'by Erik Sass , Staff Writer @eriksass1, March 21, 2014Turkey, for years one of the few functioning democracies in the Middle East, is breaking bad.\nPreviously, Erdoan also criticized Facebook, YouTube and mainstream media sites for unflattering reports on protests.\nIn addition to removing an important role model for democracy in the Mideast, the Turkish government’s authoritarian turn will provide ammunition for critics.\nAlthough the presidency is a mostly ceremonial position, it carries moral authority and serves as a “bully pulpit” that is hard to silence.\nOn Friday, Gül tweeted (apparently via text message) that “a total shutdown of social media platforms cannot be approved.”advertisementadvertisement']"

(Reuters/Dado Ruvic)\n\nYou\'d think world leaders would know better. Shut down the Internet (or some services that it hosts), and the users will come after you.\n\nBut, faced with allegations of corruption, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan went ahead Thursday night and banned Twitter anyway. Now Turks are pushing back. Twitter is facilitating the uproar by offering advice on how to evade the ban with text messaging. Other users have turned to virtual private networks (VPNs) to circumvent the blockage.\n\nIn short, Turkey\'s Twitter ban is as porous as the paywall on this Web site. Erdogan\'s attempt to stifle social media isn\'t working, and may even be inflaming the opposition.\n\nThis is hardly the first time a government has responded to a crisis by cracking down on the Internet. Tunisia\'s Zine El Abedine Ben Ali tried it and later got overthrown. Same goes for former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. In Syria, the violence has only worsened since President Bashar al-Assad\'s attempt to smother the Web.\n\nHow do these leaders keep making the same mistakes? Don\'t they learn?\n\nIt shouldn\'t surprise us that these leaders have more in common than just an affinity for dropping the hammer on the Web. Many are also isolated, says Steven Cook, a Middle East scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations who met with Erdogan last April.\n\nErdogan ""is surrounded by young people who are quite afraid of the prime minister and not willing to fill him in on what\'s going on,"" said Cook. ""These are yes-men — the people he takes counsel from are a very small group of people.""\n\nIf the Internet creates filter bubbles that keep us from having to grapple with dissonant views, the filter that afflicts censor-happy regimes like Turkey\'s is arguably even worse. Even if it provokes protests in the short term and hardens opposition against him in the long term, Erdogan might be making a calculated political play for the medium term, said Zeynep Tufekci, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina who follows Turkey closely.\n\n""It\'s not effective for most things, and it backfires in terms of public relations,"" she told me. ""But the government may be able to use it to harden polarization and to solidify its base, allow it to squeak by in elections.""\n\nIn a post on Medium, Tufekci added that most of Erdogan\'s base is not on Twitter.\n\nThere\'s also a historical perspective to Erdogan\'s apparent megalomania, according to Cook.\n\n""As a Turkish Islamist, he has reason to be paranoid,"" he said. ""There is a long history of the old elite of the secular state repressing pious Muslims. He sees it as similar to that — even though he accuses a Muslim cleric"" of stirring up trouble.\n\nIf Erdogan is convinced that he\'s the victim, and sees enemies everywhere, shutting down their ability to associate might seem like a perfectly rational move — at least in the moment. It\'s an age-old move out of the dictators\' playbook: Control the flow of information, and you control the people.\n\nUnfortunately for Erdogan and others like him, it\'s easier than ever not only to get around the controls, but also to tell the rest of the world about them. Why rulers aren\'t more aware of this fact is still a mystery, though.\n\n""When I become a strongman, I\'ll let you know,"" Cook joked.', ""(Reuters/Dado Ruvic)You'd think world leaders would know better.\nBut, faced with allegations of corruption, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan went ahead Thursday night and banned Twitter anyway.\nTwitter is facilitating the uproar by offering advice on how to evade the ban with text messaging.\nErdogan's attempt to stifle social media isn't working, and may even be inflaming the opposition.\nIt's an age-old move out of the dictators' playbook: Control the flow of information, and you control the people.""]"

29337,http://www.itproportal.com/2014/03/21/how-to-access-twitter-in-turkey-4-neat-solutions/,business,"['Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has had it in for Twitter ever since a stream of damaging leaks alleging widespread corruption in his inner circle spread via the social network.\n\nThings got more restrictive back in February, as the Turkish parliament passed a bill designed to tighten control of the Internet, allowing blocks of websites deemed offensive.\n\nOn Thursday, the hammer fell, with Erdoğan promising to ""wipe out Twitter,"" claiming ""They will see the Turkish republic\'s strength.""\n\nAs of last night, the hashtags #TwitterisblockedinTurkey, #TurkeyblockedTwitter and #OccupyTwitter were trending worldwide.\n\nSo here\'s how the Turkish people can show Erdoğan a little strength of their own, and keep the tweets twittering on in the Republic.\n\n1. Tweet through SMS\n\nThat\'s right: the over-zealous censors in Turkey\'s government haven\'t thought of this one. For the time being, Turkish users wondering how to access Twitter in Turkey can send tweets via their mobile network.\n\nTwitter\'s Policy account tweeted last night:\n\nTurkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555.\n\nThis is certainly a good option for Turkish users trying to access Twitter, but some users have voiced worries that this could lead to authorities tracking down individual users and taking action against them.\n\nFor the time being, it\'s probably best not to tweet anything too inflammatory using this method, as remember it will tie your Twitter handle to your phone contract and identity.\n\nWhich brings us on to...\n\n2. Changing DNS\n\nTo the amusement of many online, the Turkish government is using a simple Domain Name System (DNS) block to black out Twitter.\n\nDNS Blocking is a strategy for making it difficult for users to locate specific domains or web sites on the Internet. It was first introduced in 1997 as a means to block spam email from known IP addresses. Your Internet service provider (ISP) simply sees that you\'re trying to connect to Twitter and refuses to serve you, possibly redirecting you to another page.\n\nThe solution is simple in this case: change your DNS. There are many different options for DNS solutions, some paid-for, some free. Your best bet in our view is to use a free solution like Google DNS or OpenDNS.\n\nTurkish users: try some of these out and let us know how much success you have!\n\nUpdate: As of Saturday, the Turkish government has also blocked Google DNS. OpenDNS appears to still be working.\n\n3. Use a VPN\n\nAnother solution is to use a VPN connection.\n\nSetting up a VPN usually requires shelling out a little cash, however there are a number of free options.\n\nCheck out our recent list of the best free-to-use VPN providers out there.\n\nBut be careful: people should be cautious when using free VPNs. They can be unreliable, or in some cases, contain malicious software. Make sure to scan any downloaded files with leading antivirus software, and check around on forums for malware warnings before downloading anything you don\'t 100 per cent trust.\n\nThat\'s not all, though: whatever free VPN product you may consider, bear in mind that there are a few caveats.

It has 7.1 million broadband subscribers, meaning it controls pretty much every high-speed connection in the country.\n\nAs the dominant internet service provider, Turk Telecom can simply add Twitter to its list of blocked websites, and that’s it: every fixed-line internet user in the country is barred from one of the world’s largest social networks.\n\nTurkey is meant to have a deregulated communications market, so why is Turk Telecom the only player?\n\nWell, the regulator BTK actually leaves policy control to the Turkish Communications Ministry, and with a prime minister who’s so vociferous in his criticism of social media, it would be a brave minister who suggests opening up the comms space to more competitors.\n\nIt’s easy to see why Prime Minister Erdogan is so keen to block Twitter: it’s been the source of continuing corruption allegations against him. His forces cleared protesters from Gezi Park and Taksim Square last year – it’s tempting to believe the internet can be as easily controlled.\n\nUnfortunately for him, it is in the internet’s DNA to route traffic around obstructions, and Twitter is no exception.\n\nUsers of the site can simply text their comments which will then emerge as tweets.

Prime minister Recep Tayyib Erdogan said on Thursday before the Twitter blackout that the government now had a court order. Erdogan\'s government has been rocked by revelations of a scandal in social media. Erdogan declared that Turkey would eradicate Twitter and he did not care what the international community said. He added, everyone would witness the power of the Turkish Republic. Erdogan\'s showdown with Twitter had long been coming. In mid-2013, thousands protested against a proposed urban development of Istanbul\'s Taksim Gezi Park, but many said the discontent was more rooted in the government\'s shift away from secularism and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression. As in many countries, social media was instrumental in rallying the protesters, which included as many as 3.5 million people in a nation of 81 million. Outraged by the growing opposition to his administration, Erdogan called all social media the \'\'worst menace to society.\'\' Over the last few months, with the approaching elections social media Erdogan had become increasingly resentful and intolerant of social media. The fact, however remains that Erdogan, who doesn\'t follow anyone, has 4.17 million Twitter followers and has unleashed 3,043 tweets. Two weeks ago, following the release of recordings which showed someone sounding like Erdogan telling his son to dispose of a large sum of cash, the prime minister\'s patience snapped. Calling the recordings a \'\'fabrication\'\' he ultimately blamed social media. Turkey had in the past blocked access to YouTube, but this comes as the first ban on Twitter, which was instrumental in organising flash protests against the government last year. A lawyers\' association, has meanwhile, asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. The country\'s main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation of the court order. European Commission vice president Neelie Kroes criticised the Twitter ban in Turkey - a country that was seeking to join the EU as ""groundless, pointless, cowardly.""

However for many this feels like a deeply personal attack.\n\nAbove: Trying to access Twitter in Turkey\n\nTwitter is a rare space in which individual Turkish citizens are able to collectively voice their criticisms without risk of being beaten or arrested. It is especially potent given Turkey’s dire record on press freedom has left few outlets for alternative news available to the public.\n\nWhile outraged, many of these tweets ridiculed the government for staring a war they cannot win.\n\nBut while the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) – for the time being at least – still controls the streets and much of the press, they have failed to control social media.\n\nThis is not for want of trying. Many AKP politicians have strong Twitter presences, but their attempts to use the medium for their own purposes have consistently met with failure.\n\nSuperficial control\n\n\n\nTweets using AKP-sponsored hashtags are almost always ridiculed. On the other hand, rival hashtags have become crucial in organising political dissent. #BerkinSokakta (to the street for Berkin) became a rallying cry to bring people out to protest the 15-year-old’s death.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to claw back some territory cyberspace, the AKP has turned to an army of automated “twitter bots” to promote their message.\n\nIt was Twitter’s decision to start removing these that may well have sparked the decision to finally ban the site. As undoubtedly did the role Twitter played in spreading the recordings that allegedly implicated Prime Minister Erdogan in a massive corruption scandal.\n\nRead more: Paul Mason on 'Seven reasons why the Turkey Twitter ban matters'\n\n\n\nThat such recordings were also spread on websites like Facebook and were hosted on YouTube shows the weakness of the government’s position. The AKP can, in reality, only superficially control information spread over the internet.\n\nMany areas (including universities) still retain access to Twitter and contributed to a defiant spike in tweets in Turkey since the measure was announced.\n\nTweets to streets\n\n\n\nWhile outraged, many of these tweets ridiculed the government for staring a war they cannot win. The political opposition (especially among the young) has long been tech-savy in Turkey, and spawned the influential “Anonymous” style group RedHack.\n\nWhile a whole generation learnt much from the country’s attempt to ban access to YouTube between March 2007 and October 2010. Across the country people are once again preparing to fire up the proxy servers and VPNs.\n\nWhile the ban might be by passed and ignored, the symbolism will not.

Countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have called for worldwide DNS restrictions before.\n\nBefore the ban was enforced, Erdoğan vowed to “eradicate” Twitter from the country in an election speech, apparently after the company had reportedly refused to delete incriminating audio of him instructing his son to dispose of large amounts of cash in the midst of a police investigation. News of the Twitter restriction soon rippled across the Internet, and instructions for skirting the DNS block using VPN (virtual private networks) and Google DNS–both of which change your IP address–quickly spread.

A Turkish newspaper quoted him as saying he’d gotten a court order for the censorship followed by this dramatic statement: “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”\n\nRelated\n\nFree DNS services worth business consideration It's been almost a year since Google announced its free DNS service known as Google Public DNS, promising a speedier, safer way to surf the Web and sparking concern that Google would become November 18th, 2010 Carolyn Duffy Marsan @itbusinessca Published on:Carolyn Duffy Marsan\n\nBut San Francisco-based Twitter isn’t tolerating the ban. It’s hired a lawyer to meet with Turkey’s Telecommunications Authority in Ankara. The lawyer, Gönenç Gürkaynak, previously worked on a legal case against the ban of Youtube.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter is sharing ways that Turkish residents can circumvent the ban. Its official policy account pointed out sending tweets via text message is still an option on several of Turkey’s wireless carriers:\n\nTurkish users: you can send Tweets using SMS. Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555. — Policy (@policy) March 20, 2014\n\nGoogle’s head of webspam, Matt Cutts, also contributed to workarounds to access Twitter. His recommendation involves changing a computer’s DNS server addresses to use Google’s Public DNS instead of one provided by a Turkish ISP that’s affected by the ban.\n\nGoogle Public DNS is fast with great uptime. Use 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 as your DNS servers. — Matt Cutts (@mattcutts) March 21, 2014\n\nAnother alternative DNS to use is OpenDNS, which also offers detailed instructions on how to change DNS settings for many operating systems. Using a VPN connection based outside of Turkey is another way to avoid the Twitter ban.\n\nProof that many Turkish citizens are finding ways around the censorship is evident on the social network. The Guardian reported that about 17,000 tweets per minute were being posted from the country this morning. Even Turkey’s President Abdullah Gul came out publicly against Erdogan, tweeting that it wasn’t right to impose a ban on social media platforms.\n\nOn the streets of Turkey, graffiti messages spread the word on how to use Google’s Public DNS.\n\nTwitter is blocked in Turkey.

DNS, (domain name system) servers aren\'t something the average internet user would see in action — until something goes wrong. They\'re basically switchboard operators, translating the domain name you type into your browser to the IP address for that site. Google provides has its own public DNS servers, and Turkish tweeters have successfully made their way around the DNS blocks by switching over to them. In order to spread the word, people are spray painting graffiti with Google\'s DNS in highly visible locations.\n\n#twitter blocked in #turkey tonight. folks are painting #google dns numbers onto the posters of the governing party. pic.twitter.com/9vQ7NTgotO — Engin Onder (@enginonder) March 21, 2014\n\nAs Mashable points out, Turkish Twitter users have also had some luck with other reliable global DNS servers, like OpenDNS. This isn\'t the simplest way to circumvent the ban, but it\'s a good one. Google has more detailed instructions on how to switch over to a public DNS, here.\n\nMethod 2: SMS/Texting\n\nTwitter informed Turkish users of this workaround in Turkish and English right after the ban. ""you can send Tweets using SMS,"" the company advised, providing the following instructions for different telecom services: ""Avea and Vodafone text START to 2444. Turkcell text START to 2555."" This is probably the easiest workaround in use, if all you want to do is send some tweets out into the world. For now, at least: as the Wall Street Journal notes, it would be pretty simple for the Turkish government to ask telecom companies working in the country to block those texts, too.\n\nMethod 3: VPNs, Tor, and Proxies\n\nAlthough the DNS and SMS methods seem to be the more reliable options right now, virtual private networks, or VPNs, are already familiar to many internet users in Turkey. They allow a private connection to the internet, and are often used by businesses as a way to allow employees to more securely connect into a network from a remote location. Although it often costs money, users with reliable VPNs should be able to access Twitter with few issues. Turkish tweeters could also download Tor, a standard tool for anonymizing internet use. Or, there are always proxy servers from other countries, another common method that sometimes allows access to content blocked in a certain country.\n\nAll this could change if Turkey decides to use a more robust block on the site, however. And, the country could end up blocking more ways of sharing information. The Prime Minister has implied that he might expand the social media ban to include other sites like Facebook and YouTube.', 'Method 1: Google DNS, or other global DNS serversThe initial Turkish Twitter block appears to be something simple, called a DNS block.\nfolks are painting #google dns numbers onto the posters of the governing party.\npic.twitter.com/9vQ7NTgotO — Engin Onder (@enginonder) March 21, 2014As Mashable points out, Turkish Twitter users have also had some luck with other reliable global DNS servers, like OpenDNS.\nMethod 2: SMS/TextingTwitter informed Turkish users of this workaround in Turkish and English right after the ban.\nAlthough it often costs money, users with reliable VPNs should be able to access Twitter with few issues.']"

Here are some of the reactions:“Efforts to shut down Twitter in order to control the news are not only ultimately futile – they sadly move Turkey away from the embrace of human rights and the rule of law, and closer to autocracy. It’s been said that censorship is the lobby of dictatorship. What’s the point of democracy if you won’t give voters the possibility of making an informed decision?”""We call on Prime Minister [Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan to stop his vitriol against social media in the country and focus on ensuring that all information platforms are free to function freely in advance of local elections. Turkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society.""“This is another fundamental blow to freedom of expression in Turkey and the right to access information, and the closure order should be immediately lifted. The move further signals that the Turkish government has taken an anti-democratic turn which significantly sets back its human rights record.”“Erdoğan had faced perhaps the biggest challenge in his 11 years in office when unidentified critics began using Twitter and YouTube to leak dozens of phone calls and documents that seemed to tie government officials and business circles close to the government to a graft inquiry that began last December. One of the recordings purports to be of the prime minister himself telling his son to get rid of large sums of cash on the morning of Dec. 17, 2013, when the homes of three former ministers’ sons were raided. Mr. Erdoğan has repeatedly — and angrily — insisted that the recording was fake.”“Erdoğan’s showdown with Twitter has been long coming. In mid-2013, thousands of protests ripped across Turkey ostensibly in opposition to a proposed urban development of Istanbul’s Taksim Gezi Park. But many say that discontent was more rooted in the government’s shift away from secularism – Erdoğan is Muslim — and its recent crackdown on freedom of press and expression.”“Twitter use breaks new record in country as Turks defy purge of social media platform by Ankara.”“Erdoğan says he doesn’t care what the international community will say about the blocking of Twitter.“Wiretapped recordings incriminating Erdoğan have been leaking online for the past few weeks. Now Erdoğan reacts. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government criticized Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany’s view of freedom of expression. ‘What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,’ said Mrs. Merkel’s spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz.”“This is an attack on the freedom of thought. Only dictators could dare it.”“Turkey blocks Twitter, is Russia next? Twitter had agreed to cooperate with Russian courts, so, a possible blockage in Russia would be softer than in Turkey.”“Erdoğan is doing it to prove his power.”“Turkey PM blocks Twitter after it became awash with evidence of government ‘corruption’ ahead of elections...but his President tweets on!”', 'Global outcry over Turkey’s Twitter banISTANBULGlobal organizations and the international media have reacted strongly to Turkey’s decision to block Twitter.\nTurkish authorities must stop viewing the media as the enemy and embrace the role of a free press in a democratic society.\nMr. Erdoğan has repeatedly — and angrily — insisted that the recording was fake.”“Erdoğan’s showdown with Twitter has been long coming.\nIn mid-2013, thousands of protests ripped across Turkey ostensibly in opposition to a proposed urban development of Istanbul’s Taksim Gezi Park.\nChancellor Angela Merkel’s government criticized Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany’s view of freedom of expression.']"

The institution has released a statement, arguing that there were a number of court rulings that Twitter did not abide by.“The aforementioned website, based abroad, ignored the rulings of the Turkish Republic’s courts. To prevent our citizens from receiving irreparable damage, there was no option left but to block access to Twitter in accordance with the court rulings,” the statement said. Access will be unblocked if Twitter removes “the illegal content,” the TİB warned.The most striking court verdict used as the base of the TİB's Twitter ban comes from the Anatolia Fifth Criminal Court of Peace. The court issued the ruling, numbered 2014/181, in response to a complaint filed by former Transport Minister Binalı Yıldırım and his son (document obtained by daily Hürriyet).Yıldırım, who is also the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (AKP) current mayoral candidate in İzmir, had requested that the court block access to a Twitter account, @oyyokhırsıza (no votes for thievery), and a related blog, claiming “defamation.” @oyyokhırsıza was using strong language to refer to the allegations against Yıldırım and his son.Another two of the court rulings listed as the source of the blocking on the TİB's website are related to the individual complaints of two citizens.One demanded that Twitter remove a fake account using his name, while another requested the removal of her explicit photos shared through an account without her consent. Adnan Aydın, the lawyer of one of the complainants, said they had never requested a full block of Twitter.The TİB also lists a decision of the Istanbul Chief Prosecutor as another justification for the block, but his office has already denied that it filed such a case.Moreover, the aforementioned court rulings order the authorities to block access to specific URLs, instead of practicing a blanket block on Twitter, as the TİB is doing now.When the recently passed Internet law was promoted by the government and approved by President Abdullah Gül, it was highlighted that authorities would be able to start blocking specific URLs, instead of blocking access to the whole websites, as in the past."", ""Who blocked Twitter in Turkey?\nDinçer Gökçe ISTANBUL / HürriyetA court issued the ruling blocking access to Twitter response to a complaint filed by former Transport Minister Binalı Yıldırım and his son.\nThe institution has released a statement, arguing that there were a number of court rulings that Twitter did not abide by.“The aforementioned website, based abroad, ignored the rulings of the Turkish Republic’s courts.\nTo prevent our citizens from receiving irreparable damage, there was no option left but to block access to Twitter in accordance with the court rulings,” the statement said.\nAccess will be unblocked if Twitter removes “the illegal content,” the TİB warned.The most striking court verdict used as the base of the TİB's Twitter ban comes from the Anatolia Fifth Criminal Court of Peace.""]"

Major newspapers posted instructions offering simple technical workarounds to access the site.\n\n“This is certainly a step backwards in terms of openness, transparency and the democratization process of Turkey,” said Yaman Akdeniz, a law professor at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Restrictions on political speech and discourse of this scale is unacceptable in any country including in Turkey.”\n\nTwitter representatives confirmed reports that the site had been disrupted.\n\n“We\'re looking into this now,” said Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler. The company’s official account offered Turkish cell phone subscribers ways to send tweets via text message.\n\nThe cause of the ban is most certainly political as Turkey prepares for March 30 local elections, seen as a key test of power for the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party, now in its 11th year of rule.\n\nAnonymous users have been posting links to YouTube of audio recordings purporting to be wiretaps that expose rampant corruption within Erdogan\'s inner circle.\n\nThis follows a corruption scandal that erupted Dec. 17 that implicated three cabinet ministers as well as businessmen with close ties to the prime minister’s closest associates.\n\nThe government has responded to the accusations with mass purges of the police and judiciary as well as by ordering evidence destroyed. Erdogan has said the accusations are part of a plot hatched by a former ideological ally, Fethullah Gulen — a Pennsylvania-based Islamic cleric — whom he accuses of conspiring to bring down his government.\n\n“It was just a matter of moment for Prime Minister Erdogan and his men to decide to ban Twitter,” said Erkan Saka, an outspoken blogger and communications lecturer at Bilgi University in Istanbul. “Twitter remains the main channel for freedom of expression and dissemination of corruption file leaks.”\n\nCyber law experts say the ban on Twitter is reminiscent of the YouTube ban that lasted for 18 months from 2008-2010.\n\n“Certainly this is politically motivated just prior to the local elections,” Akdeniz said. “I suspect the decisions were issued prior to the PM\'s speech but they were only executed subsequent to his speech.”\n\nSome of the alleged leaked wiretaps appeared to record Erdogan himself instructing media companies to censor coverage of last spring’s Gezi Park protests. Such censorship — during the protests CNN Türk famously showed a documentary on penguins in Antarctica in place of the news — is another reason why Twitter has been an important tool for Turkish citizens to share information, unrestricted, in real time. Several media companies during Erdogan’s tenure as prime minister have been fined or taken over by companies close to the government.\n\nThe recently passed internet law was panned by press freedom groups, including the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, which warned it would have a chilling effect on free speech. The Turkish government claimed that the law was meant to protect children and the privacy of individuals.\n\nRight now, the warnings from CPJ and other press freedom groups are looking prescient.\n\n“CPJ urges the Turkish government to immediately unblock Twitter, and to respect the press freedom and free expression rights of its citizens,” said Geoffrey King, the group\'s internet advocacy coordinator, late Thursday.', ""BY JACOB RESNECK / GlobalPostIt's hard not to see this as having to do with the audio files Twitter users are passing around involving the prime minister and a corruption investigation.\nISTANBUL — Turkey has blocked Twitter hours after the prime minister vowed he’d “eradicate” the popular social media site.\nOn Thursday night, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed Twitter wasn’t complying with the new law, and told a rally of thousands that he’d bring the site down.\nSeveral media companies during Erdogan’s tenure as prime minister have been fined or taken over by companies close to the government.\nRight now, the warnings from CPJ and other press freedom groups are looking prescient.""]"

He said that individual internet pages should only be blocked if there is a court order on the grounds that a person’s privacy is being violated.\n\nGul co-founded the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party with Erdogan and has remained a close ally, but he is viewed as a more conciliatory figure than the combative prime minister and their relationship has at times appeared strained.\n\nIn the run up to the elections, the president has been hesitant to openly criticise Erdogan, despite the brewing scandal and the latter’s increasing claims of a conspiracy against his government. Erdogan’s ruling AK Party has already tightened internet controls, handed government more influence over the courts and reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a corruption scandal Erdogan has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust him.\n\nTelecoms watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove content.\n\n“Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future victimisation of citizens,” it said.\n\nTwitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread internet disconnections on Thursday night. Some users trying to open the Twitter.com website were taken to a statement apparently from another regulator citing four court orders as the basis for the ban.\n\nEuropean Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said he was ‘gravely concerned’ by the move.\n\n“Being free to communicate and freely choose the means to do it is [a] fundamental EU value,” Fuele wrote on his Twitter account.\n\nTurkey’s financial markets were also unsettled, with the lira weakening to 2.24 against the dollar, shares falling 0.7 per cent and the benchmark 10-year bond rising to 11.24 per cent from 11.12.\n\nSan Francisco-based Twitter said it was looking into the matter but had not issued a formal statement. The company did publish a tweet addressed to Turkish users instructing them on how to continue tweeting via SMS text message.\n\nErdogan was scathing about the social media service on Thursday. “Twitter, mwitter!”, he told thousands of supporters at a rally, in a phrase translating roughly as “Twitter, schmitter!”.\n\n“We will wipe out all of these,” Erdogan said. “The international community can say this, can say that. I don’t care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the republic of Turkey is,” he said in a characteristically unyielding tone.', 'Istanbul: Turkish President Abdullah Gul set himself publicly at odds with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday, saying that it was unacceptable to impose complete bans on social media platforms such as Twitter.\nGul, however, took to Twitter himself to say complete bans on social media platforms were unacceptable and to voice his hope that the block would be short-lived.\n“One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,” Gul tweeted.\nTwitter users in Turkey began reporting widespread internet disconnections on Thursday night.\nErdogan was scathing about the social media service on Thursday.']"

Erdogan’s pretext for shutting down Twitter is the existence of two accounts he claims are slanderous, which have been linking to allegedly fake recordings that show him as corrupt.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre News refresh player – this is the default player for the C4 news site – please do not delete. Ziad\n\nThis is not the first time a government has threatened, or acted, to shut down Twitter when faced with political opposition. When Mubarak did it he was overthrown shortly afterwards.\n\nErdogan enjoys mass support among the conservative Islamist lower-middle class but this has already caused a massive split inside the AK party elite. If it doesn’t signal the end of Erdogan, it is the end of his international credibility.\n\n2. The situation in Turkey is tense. Berkin Elvan was shot in the head by a tear gas canister during last year’s riots over Gezi Park, and died this month. While other members of the Turkish ruling elite tried to calm things down and pay respects, Erdogan went on TV to claim the 15-year-old had “terrorist links”.\n\nThat, and the Twitter ban, are gambits designed to force the secular, young and leftist opposition onto the streets during the election, boosting the turnout of their opponents, the conservative Islamist masses.\n\n3. Last year’s protests were not the work of a “secular elite”. The BBC keeps talking about this: a) many of the people I met in Gezi were Muslims, and not just the anti-capitalist Muslims in their headscarves. Many self-identified as “Muslims who don’t want this country to become Iran”. b) Yes, the children of the old military elite were involved, but what allowed people in Taksim to turn central Istanbul into a police-free commune for several days was the very wide nature of the support. c) The post-Gezi opposition is only an “elite” if the working class, salariat and educated youth are an “elite”. Get your facts right.\n\n4. This is just the latest battle in a global culture war that is raging from the jails of Arizona to the gay underground of Moscow: social conservatism and religious fundamentalism are profoundly challenged by the emergence of the internet, and above all social media.\n\nThey see the combination of personal and sexual freedom with freedom of expression as an extinction-level threat to the institutions that underpin their way of life: nationalism, churches, hierarchies.\n\n5. Erdogan was once the poster-boy for the west in the Middle East. While his current conflict is now with simultaneously the exiled Islamist leader Fethullah Gülen, and the educated and secular leaning generation, and half the police force, and even parts of a habitually craven media establishment… Well, the west had better start finding a new guy to rely on in the region.\n\nThe British Conservatives, who detached themselves from the centre-right EPP in Europe to create the Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (AECR), are now sitting in the same group as Erdogan who has banned Twitter. The AK Party, apart from the Polish Law and Justice party, is the only other political formation in the AECR with any national clout.\n\n6. The ageing elites of the pre-internet age are slowly realising what young people are born knowing: you can’t turn off the social media without turning off modernity and economic life. The workaround Turkish tweeters are using exploits the fundamental strength of the internet: it is a network of networks, containing non-hierarchical pathways that simply do not allow you to switch part of it off.\n\nThis is a signal moment in that process: a moment where a once-respected statesman turns into a Canute-like clown. It’s a moment Homer Simpson’s epithet “Doh!” was invented for, and is already resonating globally with people who have no idea what the domestic Turkish issues are.\n\n7. This is not about Turkey, it’s about the right to be modern. At a fracking conference this week, one of the CEOs said, ruefully, “a protest in one site is a protest everywhere”. By contrast, a Twitter shutdown on one site is a shutdown nowhere. It’s a global advert for the ineffectuality and detachment of political elites, and their opponents are reveling in it.\n\nFollow @paulmasonnews on Twitter', 'ZiadThis is not the first time a government has threatened, or acted, to shut down Twitter when faced with political opposition.\nErdogan enjoys mass support among the conservative Islamist lower-middle class but this has already caused a massive split inside the AK party elite.\nLast year’s protests were not the work of a “secular elite”.\nc) The post-Gezi opposition is only an “elite” if the working class, salariat and educated youth are an “elite”.\nBy contrast, a Twitter shutdown on one site is a shutdown nowhere.']"

The site is a destination for millions of tourists looking for cheap rooms, while giving homeowners a new source of income.\n\nAirbnb's reach spans 160 countries with more than 600,000 listings, and the site has accommodated 11 million guests in its five-year history, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company said it had a record 250,000 guests in one night on New Year's Eve 2013.\n\nThe hotel industry has begun to take notice of the company's tremendous growth.\n\nAirbnb has cut into the industry's market share by offering cheap prices and unconventional accommodations. For example, a person can stay in a large treehouse in Hawaii for under $100 a night, much less than comparable hotel prices in the area.\n\nThe novelty of the living arrangement, along with the cheap rates, has many tourists checking with Airbnb before looking into more traditional accommodations. Airbnb takes 3% from a host's booking fee and 6% to 12% from the fee charged overall to each guest.\n\nThe hotel industry has complained, saying that the site is not subject to the same regulation and tax structure that traditional hotels are, making the competition unfair.\n\nHomeowners in New York and San Francisco have questioned the legality of Airbnb's practices regarding subletting property, and tenants say the site has diminished the supply of rental properties, driving up long-term rents.\n\nAmid the criticism, current valuations of Airbnb make it worth more than Hyatt Hotels (H - Get Report), valued at $8.43 billion, and Wyndham Worldwide (WYN), valued at $9.39 billion, signaling investors see the site as the possible future of travel stay.\n\nTPG Capital's new round of funding indicates that a public offering may be in the company's future. That would give the site fresh capital to expand advertising and hire new employees.\n\nAs a public company, Airbnb could become a marquee name in the world of short-term travel accommodations.\n\n\n\nAt the time of publication, the author had no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\n\nFollow @macroinsights\n\nThis article represents the opinion of a contributor and not necessarily that of TheStreet or its editorial staff."", ""NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- A new round of funding could value Airbnb at over $10 billion, signifying the company's role as a disruptive force in the hotel industry.\nThe site is a destination for millions of tourists looking for cheap rooms, while giving homeowners a new source of income.\nThe hotel industry has begun to take notice of the company's tremendous growth.\nThe hotel industry has complained, saying that the site is not subject to the same regulation and tax structure that traditional hotels are, making the competition unfair.\nFollow @macroinsightsThis article represents the opinion of a contributor and not necessarily that of TheStreet or its editorial staff.""]"

Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $US10 billion, while Palantir, a sophisticated data analysis firm, has raised money at a $US9 billion valuation. The pace of investments appears to be accelerating. Venture capital firms spent $8 billion in the last three months of 2013 investing in the likes of Pinterest, the fast-growing social network, according to data from CB Insights. The hope, as ever, is that these start-ups will eventually be sold or go public at still higher valuations. “I’ve never seen people so encouraged,” said Colin Blaydon, a professor at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “There will be big winners, and investors don’t want to miss out.”\n\nOthers view the valuation race more skeptically. “We’re seeing valuations go nuts,” said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Even so, Mr Ellis conceded that many of the companies now enjoying the limelight are a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many start-ups now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits. Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley’s most celebrated and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Airbnb makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. With 600,000 listings on the company’s site, that could translate into significant revenue. The company doesn’t disclose its financial information.\n\nUnder the business model, one shared with Uber, homes and cars are not just possessions but potential sources of revenue. The model also allows customers to pay lower rates than those charged by traditional service providers like hotels. But with the disruption that companies like Airbnb and Uber promise comes greater legal scrutiny. Airbnb has faced challenges from regulators concerned that the service allows homeowners and renters to avoid paying taxes. Other government agencies are investigating whether these start-ups run afoul of state laws governing rentals. New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, has subpoenaed Airbnb for information on customers in the state who he suspects may be illicitly using its services for their main income. Airbnb has moved in court to quash the information request; a hearing is scheduled for next week. And Uber has battled taxi and limousine commissions in a number of places, including Washington, where the established industries have argued that the service violates local regulations. Those potential hurdles have failed to daunt prospective investors. TPG Growth, for example, participated in a fund-raising round for Uber last year that valued the service at $3.8 billion.\n\n\n\nInvestors are betting that Airbnb will continue to show enormous growth. Its last fund-raising round, in 2012, valued the company at $US2.5 billion. Should its latest efforts to raise capital succeed, it will carry a higher valuation than Wyndham Worldwide, whose market capitalisation stands at $US9.3 billion, or Hyatt, whose market value is $8.4 billion.\n\nThe round would also put a valuation on Airbnb more than twice that of HomeAway, a publicly traded vacation rental company that carried a value of $US3.8 billion as of Thursday. Airbnb’s current investor roll reads like a list of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capital firms. Among them: Sequoia Capital, the only outside investor in WhatsApp; Andreessen Horowitz, an early backer of Facebook; Founders Fund; and even the actor Ashton Kutcher.

At its last funding round two years ago Airbnb reached a valuation of just $2.5bn, yesterday’s valuation gives a strong endorsement to the start-up.

If successful, Airbnb will become one of the richest young tech companies around.\n\nBased on the most recent information available, Airbnb operates in 192 countries and has more than 600,000 current listings.

One challenge that it faces — which will no doubt be expensive — is the company’s fights with public officials, who are asking whether it is violating local regulations.\n\nThese setbacks are common for companies in the sharing economy, with other start-ups, like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar facing increased scrutiny around the globe.\n\nThe sheer size of the round makes this deal outstanding, but what’s potentially more startling is how Airbnb will rank among its publicly held peers once the deal is compete (of course, negotiations can always break down and the deal may never materialize).\n\nCheck out how a $10 billion valuation compares to some of the leading hotel chains and booking sites’ current market caps:\n\n— Expedia: $9.8 billion.\n\n— HomeAway: $3.9 billion.\n\n— Wyndham Worldwide: $9.3 billion.\n\n— Hyatt Hotels: $8.43 billion.\n\n— Priceline: $68.6 billion.\n\n— Orbitz: $878 million.', 'Airbnb is reportedly in talks to raise up to $500 million at a $10 billion valuation, which would make it worth slightly more than publicly held Expedia.\nIf successful, Airbnb will become one of the richest young tech companies around.\nBased on the most recent information available, Airbnb operates in 192 countries and has more than 600,000 current listings.\nHosts set a nightly rate, and Airbnb collects a percentage of the payment.\nCheck out how a $10 billion valuation compares to some of the leading hotel chains and booking sites’ current market caps:— Expedia: $9.8 billion.']"

And according to the WSJ, Brian Chesky, the company\'s chief executive, has major plans for continued expansion; he has indicated that he would like to add more hospitality services, taking the platform beyond simply home and apartment rentals.

But this announcement marks a serious shift in the makeup of Airbnb guests. Back in 2011, about half of all guests were from the U.S., but that’s dropped to below 30 percent.\n\nThat said, the company expects its growth in Europe to accelerate even further.

Its last funding round of $200 million led by Founders Fund valued it at $2.5 billion, while the latest raise, which is expected to include private-equity firm TPG, values the company at around $10 billion.\n\nFor what it’s worth, Airbnb declined to comment on the report of new funding.', 'The company has already raised more than $300 million in funding, but the WSJ reports Airbnb is in “advanced talks” to raise an additional $400 million to $500 million.\nAirbnb said that more than a million guests each from the U.K. and France have booked stays through its platform.\nMeanwhile, more than a million guests have stayed at places listed on Airbnb in both Italy and Spain.\nBut this announcement marks a serious shift in the makeup of Airbnb guests.\nIt forecasts that the number of European guests staying in unique listings will more than double in 2014.']"

Regulators have also focused on Airbnb with concerns and investigations of safety, oversight, and tax collection.\n\nAirbnb: Trouble in rental paradise\n\nAirbnb has recently received quite a bit of bad press with renters finding their homes trashed with used condoms and feces and, on one occasion, having their things thrown out on the street to accommodate a planned sex party.\n\nAfter complaints from hotel owners, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the company to discern whether or not a number of renters were violating a state statute that prohibits sublets of less than a month when not in the property themselves. Airbnb, rather than turning over the information, is fighting the order in court.\n\nDespite this highly-publicized exception, both Airbnb and Uber are championing the “sharing” economy where users are able to offer a ride, a room, etc. for a fee that they set with the companies taking their cut.\n\nThe last round of funding for Airbnb was done in 2012 with a valuation of $2.5 billion. In the two years since, the company has added 160 countries to its rental service, many of which have far less regulations than the United States, and as a result has seen its valuation soar. Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital have all invested in Airbnb in past rounds.\n\nIn addition to its rental fees, Airbnb is actively pursuing additional revenue streams including its own cleaning service for renters in San Francisco and New York.\n\n“We are actively looking to build specific services,” Mr. Chesky said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal in January. “We need to offer more.”', 'A $10 billion valuation would see the online home and apartment marketplace supplant both Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (NYSE:WYN) and Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE:H).\nThe former manages over 7,500 hotels under numerous brands including Ramada and is valued at $9.4 billion.\nHyatt has a valuation of $8.4 billion.\nThe last round of funding for Airbnb was done in 2012 with a valuation of $2.5 billion.\nIn addition to its rental fees, Airbnb is actively pursuing additional revenue streams including its own cleaning service for renters in San Francisco and New York.']"

I read stories like this and it freaks me out to think just what someone might do to my place, and to my stuff.\n\nI seem to be in the minority here, though, because the service has become incredibly popular over the last few years. It took Airbnb four years to serve its first four million guests, and then another five million in just a few months.\n\nAnd now it looks to be raising a gigantic new funding round, at an astounding valuation.\n\nThe the online home-rental company is in ""advanced talks"" to raise a new round worth between $400 million and $500 million, according to a report out from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. Private-equity firm TPG is said to be leading the round.\n\nIf true, the new round would bring the company\'s value to more than $10 billion. It would also more than double Airbnb\'s previous fundings put together.\n\nAirbnb has raised $326 million altogether at a $2.5 billion valuation, including a $117 million Series B round from Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global and General Catalyst and, most recently, a $200 million Series C round from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst Partners, Crunchfund, Ashton Kutcher, and Founders Fund in 2012.\n\nThis latest round would bring Airbnb’s total funding to between $726 million and $826 million, and place it among the world\'s most valuable startups.\n\nHow much money Airbnb makes has not been divulged, but private company analyst Privco has estimated Airbnb’s 2012 revenue to be $189 million. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter forecasted at the beginning of last year that it won’t be long before Airbnb is pulling in $1 billion in revenue per year.\n\nSince its founding in 2008, Airbnb has served more than 11 million total guests. In now operates in over 34,000 cities in 192 countries and has over 600,000 listings around the world.\n\nRecently, the company has been looking to expand beyond ts current room rental service and into more hospitality services. In January it announced that it was piloting a cleaning service in certain zip codes of San Francisco and New York City, where hosts can arrange a cleaning of their listing prior to a guest’s check-in.\n\nThe cleanings are arranged by Handybook and Homejoy, and the cost of the cleaning service is taken from the renter\'s payout for the reservation.\n\n\n\n(Image source: mobile-patterns.com)', ""Airbnb said to be raising between $400 million and $500 million in a round led by TPGHonestly, the idea behind Airbnb makes me really uncomfortable.\nIt took Airbnb four years to serve its first four million guests, and then another five million in just a few months.\nAnd now it looks to be raising a gigantic new funding round, at an astounding valuation.\nThis latest round would bring Airbnb’s total funding to between $726 million and $826 million, and place it among the world's most valuable startups.\nThe cleanings are arranged by Handybook and Homejoy, and the cost of the cleaning service is taken from the renter's payout for the reservation.""]"

Symantec\'s focus moving forward will be to execute on product innovation and bringing new products to market, Gillett said.\n\nSymantec\'s board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer on Thursday, in an move that shocked many Symantec employees, including Gillett. Brown is accomplished at being a stabilizing presence, according to Gillett, who said he will be a knowledgeable leader and organizer during the company\'s transition.\n\nBrown joined Symantec\'s board of directors following the company\'s merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005. Gillett said he worked with Brown in 2012 during his tenure on the company\'s board of directors.\n\n[Related: Symantec Internal Memo: Pace Of Change Was Too Slow ]\n\n""[Brown] will be focused on keeping forward momentum and not stalling as we focus on product activities and accelerating growth,"" Gillett said.\n\nGillett, who joined Symantec in December 2012 after holding senior executive positions at Best Buy and Starbucks, has a deep technical background, having worked in information technology nearly his entire career. He said the Symantec\'s engineering teams have all the pieces in place to build out the portfolio and bring new products to market.\n\nWhen Bennett took the helm in July 2012, he did a lot of streamlining at Symantec via his Symantec 4.0 strategy, including making the company\'s product teams report directly to him. Bennett has previously told CRN that move was aimed at boosting productivity and accelerating innovation, but Gillett said Symantec\'s board of directors didn\'t feel this would enable the the company to bring new products to market quickly enough.\n\nGillett said the ""apparatus and cadence that allows development cycles to be met happen regardless of who is at the top operationally.""\n\nUnder Brown, Symantec\'s project engineering, technical support and research and development activities will all be getting more attention, Gillett said. Symantec\'s executive team is working on a revised list of priorities for its fiscal 2015 strategy and product roadmap, he said.\n\n""The organizational structure, in reporting to Steve, did little in the way of blocking or changing dramatically the progress we\'re making in the product roadmaps, integrating our point products combined with new technology development,"" Gillett said. ""There is nothing I see or know that will be coming that should be cause for any concern for our progress to change.""\n\nGillett urged partners to be patient as the board of directors conducts its search for a new CEO. He said he is an advocate of the channel, having procured goods and services from partners. A consistent effort is being made behind the scenes in transforming Symantec into a channel led organization, Gillett said. ""That importance of that effort has been reinforced to me by our interim CEO,"" he said.\n\nSymantec partners tell CRN that they have welcomed the organizational changes and say its time to reveal more details about the company\'s newly integrated product offerings. Time will tell how this will work out for Symantec, said John Woodall, vice president of engineering at Integrated Archive Systems (IAS), a Palo Alto, Calif.-based solution provider and Symantec channel partner.\n\n""We\'ll have to wait for Symantec 5.0,"" Woodall said. ""We\'ll need time to see how the company does. But whoever comes in to replace Bennett will have to define the company\'s strategy quickly and communicate its plans. This market is too volatile on too many levels.""\n\nSymantec is not going away, Woodall said. ""It\'s a strong company. For us now, it\'s business as usual.""\n\nCRN Senior Editor Joseph F. Kovar contributed to this report.', ""Symantec's focus moving forward will be to execute on product innovation and bringing new products to market, Gillett said.\nSymantec's board of directors appointed Michael Brown as interim president and chief executive officer on Thursday, in an move that shocked many Symantec employees, including Gillett.\nBrown joined Symantec's board of directors following the company's merger with storage giant Veritas Software in July 2005.\nWhen Bennett took the helm in July 2012, he did a lot of streamlining at Symantec via his Symantec 4.0 strategy, including making the company's product teams report directly to him.\nUnder Brown, Symantec's project engineering, technical support and research and development activities will all be getting more attention, Gillett said.""]"

J.J. Thompson,\n\nCEO, Rook Security\n\nMuch of Bennett\'s time at Big Yellow was spent implementing what he termed the Symantec 4.0 strategy, which mostly focused on paring back products, services and staff. Though Symantec\'s stock price more than doubled during his first year, Bennett was unable to maintain that momentum; the stock price has dipped 15% in the past year. Similarly, sales of Symantec\'s line of consumer products, headlined by its Norton-branded endpoint antimalware technology, declined 2.8% in 2013, a foreboding statistic considering how closely linked the company\'s brand is with traditional endpoint security.\n\nChris Rodriguez, network security senior industry analyst at San Antonio, Texas-based consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, said that while Symantec has products in emerging security product segments, such as the high-growth mobile space, the company has struggled to compete against a myriad of upstarts. In mobile, for instance, Rodriguez said security technology from rivals Avast Software and Lookout Inc. is just as effective and often much cheaper, if not free.\n\n\'Bloated\' Symantec facing deep-rooted issues Despite those obvious headwinds, a variety of experts told SearchSecurity that the root of Symantec\'s issues runs much deeper than Bennett, and that much more than a new CEO will be needed to steer the company in the right direction. Kevin McDonald, executive vice president for Irvine, Calif.-based managed IT services provider Alvaka Networks, said that the security industry has largely recognized that ""Symantec was synonymous with bloated,"" from the company\'s software to its staff. While calling the decision to fire Bennett a ""mind-blower,"" McDonald admitted the company may not have innovated enough to stave off emerging powerhouse rivals such as FireEye Inc. that are focused on detecting advanced attacks at the network level. Still, he predicted that the next Symantec CEO would benefit greatly from the moves that Bennett made. ""I felt like there was finally stability in the company and they had somebody that knew how to look at the overall operation and make it work,"" McDonald said. ""Bottom line is I felt like Bennett was paring back some of the bloat, and then expanding in the places he felt they needed to."" John Pescatore, director of emerging security trends at the Bethesda, Md.-based SANS Institute and the former long-time lead security analyst for Gartner Inc., said that many of the issues Bennett faced during his tenure as Symantec CEO actually had much deeper roots, going back to John W. Thompson\'s leadership of the company from 1999 to 2009. Pescatore said Thompson set the tone for the company as it expanded into a variety of markets beyond information security. Pescatore noted that Microsoft\'s entry into the antivirus market threatened Symantec\'s core revenue stream. That trend continued under Bennett\'s predecessor, Enrique Salem, with the company soon providing everything from storage services to desktop management.', ""They don't know who they are, they don't know what they want to do, and that's infiltrating all the way through their organization.\nJ.J.

The company’s shares were down 12.7 percent at $18.25 in late afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.\n\nSymantec’s chief financial officer of seven years, James Beer, resigned last September, while its president of products and services quit in November.\n\nChairman Daniel Schulman said the company was looking for a leader who would drive the next stage of product innovation and growth.\n\nHowever, MKM’s Hernandez said it would be challenging for Symantec to get a new CEO as the market for talent had become competitive.\n\nAnalysts say Symantec has failed to evolve its antivirus and security products fast enough and keep pace with network security software makers such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks.\n\nNetwork security software products are in demand as they analyse business networks and try to preempt cyber attacks, while antivirus software removes threats after computers have already been infected.\n\nResearch firm Gartner said in 2012 that the market for security software was expected to grow about 30 percent to $87 billion by 2016.

On the other hand, Symantec's sales were impacted by the disruptions in customer relationships.\n\nMoreover, the weak PC market is affecting the sales of Symantec's security solutions. As per the latest report from IDC, PC shipments will drop 6.1% in 2014, the third consecutive year of decline. This will affect the sale of Symantec's PC security solutions and business volume to a considerable extent.\n\nTo counter this decline, the company is concentrating more on the mobile business, which will enable it to generate additional volumes.\n\nNonetheless, Symantec reiterated fourth-quarter fiscal 2014 guidance reflecting that the CEO's exit would not have a material impact on the company's operations.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2014, the company expects revenues in the range of $1.615 to $1.655 billion, down from $1.748 billion reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margins are also unchanged at 24.5% to 26.0% compared to 24.1% last year. Management also expects non-GAAP earnings per share between 40 cents and 42 cents compared with 44 cents in the year-ago period.\n\nSymantec is making efforts to attract small and mid-sized businesses with the introduction of enhanced versions of storage management and Internet security solutions. These solutions are primarily targeted at information-driven businesses.\n\nHowever, the company faces increased competition from other bellwethers such as Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Intel ( INTC ).\n\nCurrently, Symantec has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

29553,http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/85064,business,"['As you\'ve probably noted by now, Symantec just announced that CEO Steve Bennett is out and is being replaced by board member Michael Brown on a temporary basis. The board will now conduct a search for a permanent CEO.\n\nUnder Steve Bennett, Symantec announced a new strategy called, ""Symantec 4.0,"" intended to streamline the organization, cut costs, and push organic innovation. A good plan, but my guess is that things weren\'t moving forward as fast as the board wanted, so it decided to make a change. As an outsider, it did seem like Symantec circled the wagons, focused on internal operations, and kept its eyes off the market. Thus, the company now looking for its fourth CEO in the past five years.\n\nSo what should the next CEO of Symantec do? I\'m pretty sure that Symantec\'s board won\'t be calling me to set up an interview, but if I took over as the next CEO of Symantec, I\'d push the company to:\n\n1. Become the leading provider of managed and professional security services. Managed security services are growing twice as fast as product sales while the information security skills shortage gets worse each day. This makes this a no-brainer for Symantec - it already has great services and assets here but needs a few course corrections. First, the company has to become easier to do business with and improve the overall customer experience. Second, the company needs to extend its services more aggressively and supplement managed services with more professional services feet-on-the-street. Finally, Symantec managed services is one of the best-kept secrets in the industry. Symantec needs to put some marketing dough behind this effort to gain visibility and brand recognition.\n\n2. Get active in M&A again. I get the desire for organic growth, but I really don\'t understand why Symantec did a 180 on acquiring companies. Yes, there were questionable moves, like buying PGP and GuardianEdge at the same time, but Symantec also had some winners such as MessageLabs, Mi5, Verisign, and Vontu. Now that the VC bourgeoisie on Sand Hill Rd. is investing heavily in security startups, Symantec should start cherry picking firms, especially those focused on advanced malware (Bit9, Bromium, Cylance, Invincea) big data security analytics (Click Security, Lancope, LogRhythm, etc.), and cloud security (CloudPassage, HyTrust, SkyHigh Networks, etc.). Symantec could also double down on Identity and Access Management by grabbing Courion.\n\n3. Streamline, streamline, streamline. Symantec has been a company with too many products, too many contract types, too many sales teams, etc. In spite of all of this variety and volume, the company\'s financial success always rides on the back of less than ten products such as backup, endpoint security software, SSL certificates, and email security. Steve Bennett recognized this issue and deserves credit for starting the winnowing process but the next CEO has to put his or her foot on the gas and make the tough decisions. Should Symantec divest Altiris (I would say yes)? Should it back out of the MDM market (ditto)? Should it create separate LOBs for storage and security (tough one but yes again)? Symantec needs to follow a GE-type product matrix strategy by investing in successful and promising product areas and get out of all others.\n\n4. Build a cybersecurity architecture and ecosystem. IBM, McAfee, and Trend Micro are pushing hard to create an integrated cybersecurity architecture for emerging enterprise security requirements. Symantec gets this strategy but is a bit late to the party. To overcome this deficit, Symantec should embrace open standards, invest in enterprise software expertise and services, and become a partner nexus for leading network security vendors like Cisco, Check Point, Fortinet, Juniper, and Palo Alto Networks. To expedite this process, Symantec should become a vocal champion of open source security projects as well as standards from groups like the FIDO Alliance, Mitre, NIST, and TCG.\n\n5. Make Symantec products and services easier to sell and consume. Once again, Steve Bennett was on the right track so the new CEO should follow his lead. Customers don\'t have the time to negotiate complex contracts or work with a multitude of sales people. Symantec needs to simplify its sales, go-to-market, and contractual processes, and hire top-tier sales people that can work with CIOs and CISOs rather than network administrators. This strategy should also extend to the channel to enable partner success.\n\n6. Establish Symantec as a center-of-excellence for talented employees. While Symantec recruited a number of new executives under Steve Bennett\'s tenure, it also experienced a serious brain drain of frustrated engineers and managers. For example, Symantec followed a cookie-cutter (and multi-million dollar) plan from Bain, fired a number of senior engineering talent and replaced them with junior people working overseas. This move may have been financially sound but it alienated the engineering community and gave Symantec a bad reputation amongst leading security software engineers. Symantec must emulate Google and establish itself as a center-of-excellence by hiring, supporting, and resourcing the best and brightest who are passionate about making a difference in cybersecurity and data management R&D.\n\nOkay, I may not be qualified to run a multi-billion dollar company, but I\'ve been working with Symantec for over a decade and believe these recommendations could push the company in the right direction. Symantec is a good company with some strong products and dedicated people. Yes, there are hard decisions and difficult times ahead, but I do believe that under the right stewardship, the company could turn around quickly and prosper.', 'As you\'ve probably noted by now, Symantec just announced that CEO Steve Bennett is out and is being replaced by board member Michael Brown on a temporary basis.\nUnder Steve Bennett, Symantec announced a new strategy called, ""Symantec 4.0,"" intended to streamline the organization, cut costs, and push organic innovation.\nSymantec needs to put some marketing dough behind this effort to gain visibility and brand recognition.\nStreamline, streamline, streamline.\nSymantec needs to follow a GE-type product matrix strategy by investing in successful and promising product areas and get out of all others.']"

TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n""We rate SYMANTEC CORP (SYMC) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, reasonable valuation levels, growth in earnings per share, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nThe net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Software industry average. The net income increased by 31.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $216.00 million to $283.00 million.\n\nSYMANTEC CORP has improved earnings per share by 33.3% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, SYMANTEC CORP reported lower earnings of $1.05 versus $1.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.86 versus $1.05).\n\nThe gross profit margin for SYMANTEC CORP is currently very high, coming in at 88.15%. Regardless of SYMC\'s high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.59% trails the industry average.\n\nSYMC, with its decline in revenue, underperformed when compared the industry average of 10.3%.

And Wall Street is definitely concerned, as SYMC stock is off about 12% in today’s trading.\n\nThe company tried to calm things down with its press release, which said that the firing was “the result of an ongoing deliberative process and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.” Yet it seems there must be troubles brewing for SYMC stock.\n\nLet’s face it, Steve Bennett was only at the helm for two years and only came up with his turnaround plan in January 2013. The company has also seen other top executives leave during the past couple months, including CFO James Beer and president of products, Francis deSouza.\n\nIf anything, the Symantec CEO position has been dicey over the years. Keep in mind that the board pushed out Enrique Salem just two years ago. And he only had the job for about three years.\n\nAs for now, the replacement for Steve Bennett will be Michael Brown, a board member and the former CEO of Quantum Corporation, who will hold the Symantec CEO position on an interim basis. SYMC will then begin a search for a permanent leader. However, the process could easily take months to complete. Again, this cannot be good for SYMC stock.\n\nFor example, the company faces intense competition. There is an onslaught of cutting-edge startups that are grabbing a bigger share of the security market. They are also taking advantage of the red-hot IPO market, as seen with the hugely successful deal of FireEye (FEYE).\n\nSYMC stock has also suffered from the lack of a clear-cut mobile strategy. For the most part, the category is a rich target for security products. But SYMC’s efforts have been lackluster. Capitalizing on the void are scrappy startups like Lookout, which have raised substantial amounts of venture capital.\n\nYet the biggest challenge for SYMC stock is the secular decline the traditional PC business. Consider that a large amount of sales come from antivirus software and back-up systems for the desktop. The result is that growth has stalled. During the last nine months of 2013, net revenues fell by about 2%. Yes, that’s a grueling loss as the overall security market continues to show lots of momentum and remains a high priority for enterprises, especially in light of the high-profile breaches at companies like Target (TGT).\n\nIn other words, the new Symantec CEO will have a tough job ahead. And given the company’s track record, he or she will not have much time to show results for the turnaround. Unfortunately, this pressure may make things even tougher for SYMC stock as a new leader won’t have much leeway to try new things and focus on the long-term of the business.\n\nIn other words, maybe Steve Bennett should hope the Symantec CEO position remains an interim thing.\n\nTom Taulli runs the InvestorPlace blog IPO Playbook.

29570,http://www.thestreet.com/story/1554867/1/cyber-security-giant-symantec-sacks-ceo--and-shares-are-on-sale.html,business,"['NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- You only get so long to perform a turnaround. Steve Bennett -- who was replaced as the CEO of the computer security software company Symantec (SYMC) on Thursday -- probably thinks that 20 months was not long enough. But the company\'s board were not convinced. As they wrote in a statement that was released after the market close Thursday:\n\n""This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.""\n\nWhen Bennett joined Symantec, its shares were below $15. During his tenure as CEO, the stock rallied as high as $27, as investors initially agreed with his efforts to streamline and reorganize Symantec\'s product range -- including Norton anti-virus software -- as well as to cut costs. The last two quarterly corporate disclosures, though, have disappointed the market. This appears, at first glance, to have had some influence.\n\nSo what should investors think?\n\nThe shares are down today to levels last seen over a year ago. As of 11:30 a.m., they\'re trading at $18.02, down 13.8% for the day. Year to date, the stock is down 23.4%.\n\nYet the cyber security sector appears to be as attractive as ever. Businesses and consumers, on both their networks and electronic devices, only have a greater need for security over time. That\'s why companies like Check Point Software (CHKP - Get Report) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW - Get Report) have had such strong stock prices recently.\n\nClearly, though, something is not right with Symantec. Accompanying the disappointing recent quarterly results have been a series of resignations (and appointments) to the management team.\n\nMy instinct is that Steve Bennett\'s desire -- as expressed in the last quarterly results conference call in January -- to ""continue to drive improved efficiency and better resource allocation across the company"" has upset too many of the company\'s employees. The approach likely lost the support of the other board members. Combine this with a poor last couple of quarters, and this led to yesterday\'s end to his CEO tenure.\n\nBut Symantec still has a lot going for it. Despite all its recent troubles, Symantec still has strong brands like Norton. It continues to generate free cash. Plus, at the current share price, it has a dividend yield of nearly 3%. It has more than $700 million of outstanding share buyback capability and has net cash on the balance sheet of well over $1 billion. That\'s significant for a company with a market capitalization of under $13 billion. That will have caught the eye of other companies, including those in private equity.\n\nLonger-term technology sector watchers may remember that Intel (INTC - Get Report) purchased Symantec\'s peer McAfee a few years ago.\n\nGiven the importance of cyber security to both businesses and individuals, Symantec\'s troubles and weak share price present a prime time for investors to do their due diligence. It\'s time to act. Embrace the volatility and consider Symantec shares now, when they\'re on sale.\n\nAt the time of publication, the author held no positions in any of the stocks mentioned.\n\nThis article represents the opinion of a contributor and not necessarily that of TheStreet or its editorial staff.', ""Steve Bennett -- who was replaced as the CEO of the computer security software company Symantec (SYMC) on Thursday -- probably thinks that 20 months was not long enough.\nWhen Bennett joined Symantec, its shares were below $15.\nBusinesses and consumers, on both their networks and electronic devices, only have a greater need for security over time.\nLonger-term technology sector watchers may remember that Intel (INTC - Get Report) purchased Symantec's peer McAfee a few years ago.\nEmbrace the volatility and consider Symantec shares now, when they're on sale.""]"

Because Bennett, previously Intuit’s CEO, was widely regarded as moving the company in the right direction, his firing left some industry experts flabbergasted.\n\n“It’s a shocker,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. “This is a major, surprising move that they are getting rid of their CEO just as its recovery is playing out. They’re off to a very positive start. It’s a head-scratcher at this juncture. With him not there, you could see a lot of investors start to throw in the towel.”\n\nBefore the announcement, Symantec’s shares rose 33 cents to $20.91 at the market’s official close. But after the company reported Bennett’s ouster, its stock price fell $1.56, more than 7 percent, in after-hours trading.\n\nMatthew Casey, an analyst with Technology Business Research, also expressed surprise.\n\n“It kind of caught me off guard,” he said. “I know the results of their recent quarters haven’t necessarily been the most flashy in terms of growth.” But he added that the changes Bennett was trying to bring about, which largely involved streamlining Symantec’s business, “were the correct changes that needed to be made.”\n\nBest known for its popular Norton antivirus software, Symantec has struggled in recent years against a proliferation of other security companies, such as Palo Alto Networks and FireEye. Its $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software in 2005, in an effort to expand into the data storage business, also was widely criticized as a mistake.\n\nIn recent years, Symantec’s sales have been flat.\n\nLast summer, Bennett cut about 1,000 jobs from Symantec’s workforce of about 20,000 and tried to find new product niches because slumping demand for personal computers had hurt its anti-virus sales. In recent months, it also has seen its chief technology offer and chief financial offer leave. But Symantec officials were vague about why Bennett was fired.\n\n“We recognize Steve’s contributions to Symantec, including developing and leading a series of successful initiatives focused on organizational realignment, cost reduction and process effectiveness,” the company said in a statement. “These changes have helped establish a solid foundation for Symantec’s future.”\n\nThe statement added that “our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth. This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”\n\nBut that explanation failed to satisfy Rick Holland, a principal analyst at Forrester Research.\n\n“This completely caught me by surprise,” he said. “I wonder what happened, for real.

A special committee of the board will begin looking for a permanent CEO with an executive search firm, Symantec said in a statement yesterday.\n\nBennett, who took over as CEO after Enrique Salem’s ouster in July 2012, has presided over slowing sales growth as a record PC slump curbs spending on Symantec’s antivirus software, which is often bundled with new computers. The stock slumped 13 percent today, bringing the decline in the past year 25 percent. Bennett blamed lower revenue in recent quarters on a sales-force restructuring that was meant to help restart growth and instead disrupted customer relationships.\n\n“It’s jaw-dropping,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. in New York who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. “Bennett is the face of the turnaround at Symantec. Investors bought into him leading this turnaround, so the fact that now he gets fired at this critical juncture, I view it as a major black eye.”\n\nSymantec shares fell to $18.25 at 10:08 a.m. in New York, the lowest since December 2012.\n\nExecutive Exits\n\nSeveral top executives have left the company in recent months, including Francis deSouza, president of products and services, and James Beer, who had been chief financial officer since 2006 and left to become CFO of McKesson Corp.\n\nSymantec remains committed to its target of revenue growth of more than 5 percent by fiscal 2017, Chairman Daniel Schulman said in the statement.\n\n“Our priority is now to identify a leader who can leverage our company’s assets and leadership team to drive the next stage of Symantec’s product innovation and growth,” Schulman said. “This considered decision was the result of an ongoing deliberative process, and not precipitated by any event or impropriety.”\n\nBennett previously served as CEO of TurboTax software maker Intuit Inc., and before that as an executive vice president of General Electric Capital.\n\nSlipping Performance\n\nSymantec shares soared after Bennett’s appointment as CEO of Symantec, more than doubling in his first year on the job on investor optimism that he would deliver more consistent results.\n\nOne of Bennett’s first major actions was eliminating 1,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of staff, in an effort to bolster profit. The honeymoon ended as sales sputtered, top executives left and the PC market worsened, dragging down Symantec’s biggest business unit.\n\nSales in Symantec’s consumer division, which includes the Norton line of antivirus products, fell 2.8 percent to $2.17 billion in the nine months ended Dec. 27. Revenue in the data- backup division declined 2.6 percent to $1.9 billion in the same period.\n\nThe company still likely won’t be able to hit its targets without acquisitions or selling business units, in part because of declines in demand for PC security software, Joel Fishbein Jr., an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, wrote in a research note.\n\nMobile Security\n\nOne area where Symantec has lagged its peers is security software for smartphones and tablets, a growing market that is dominated by companies including Lookout Inc., which has more than 50 million users and has raised more than $131 million from venture capital firms, and NQ Mobile, a Chinese company with more than 100 million active monthly users.\n\nIn recent interviews, Bennett declined to directly discuss the PC industry’s impact on Symantec. In January, he attributed weaker results largely to his overhaul of the sales force, which involved reassigning accounts and training employees to sell different products. He said the company was “making progress” and that the restructuring was complete.\n\n“I’m very pleased with the numbers we’re delivering given the kind of transformation we’ve undergone,” he said in an interview at the time. “Even though we’re a little short on revenue, we’re delivering faster growth for the future.”\n\nSymantec declined to make Bennett available because he’s no longer an employee.
