According to Summit, females made up 60 percent of Friday\'s audience.\n\nSTORY: Is \'Divergent\' Star Shailene Woodley the Next Jennifer Lawrence?\n\nNeil Burger directed the $85 million sci-fi adventure, based on the best-selling book series by Veronica Roth about a young woman who poses a threat to society after failing to fit into one of five strictly controlled factions.\n\nSummit is certainly well versed in selling YA adaptations, being the home of the Twilight franchise. And its parent company, Lionsgate, is the studio behind The Hunger Games.\n\nOn Friday, Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer promoted Divergent\'s strong Thursday night start of $4.9 million in a bid to woo Wall Street. ""We\'re confident that Divergent is on its way to becoming another important franchise for us, and we have just greenlighted the second film, Insurgent,"" he said.\n\nIn November 2008, the first Twilight debuted domestically to $69.6 million; four years later, The Hunger Games opened to a massive $152.5 million, one of the biggest openings of all time. While primarily fueled by younger families, both movies managed to appeal to other demos as well, especially older females. Divergent, however, may not have the same crossover potential and could be hurt among adults by poor reviews.\n\nTheo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoe Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer and Kate Winslet also star in Divergent. The film won\'t begin rolling out internationally in earnest until April 4.\n\nAmong the weekend\'s other new offerings, Disney\'s Muppets Most Wanted is proving a major disappointment, thanks in part to a saturated market for family titles. The sequel, facing competition from holdovers Mr. Peabody & Sherman and Lego Movie, may not crack $18 million in its domestic launch after earning $4.7 million on Friday. The first Muppets grossed $41 million over the Thanksgiving holiday, including $29 million for the weekend.\n\nMuppets Most Wanted is holding at No. 2, followed by Peabody, which grossed $2.7 million on Friday for a projected $11 million-plus weekend.\n\nJames Bobin returns to direct the $54 million Muppets sequel, with Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell and Tina Fey replacing Jason Segel and Amy Adams as the live-action leads. This time out, Kermit and the gang find themselves lured into an international crime caper while on tour in Europe. Muppets Most Wanted has earned solid-to-good reviews, compared to stellar notices for The Muppets.\n\nAlso opening nationwide, although on a much smaller scale, is Christian drama God\'s Not Dead. From Pure Flix Entertainment, the movie placed No. 4 on Friday with $2.8 million, on par with fellow Christian film Fireproof.\n\nPHOTOS: Exclusive Portraits of Shailene Woodley\n\nGod\'s Not Dead is expected to gross $8 million for the weekend from 780 locations, putting it in a close race with holdover 300: Rise of an Empire.\n\nBased on the book of the same name by Rice Broocks and Daniel Bashta\'s song ""Like a Lion,"" God\'s Not Dead stars Shane Harper as a college student whose philosophy professor forces him to sign a declaration that ""God is dead."" When the student refuses, he\'s ordered to prove his position that God exists in a series of debates. Directed by Harold Cronk, the indie movie also stars Kevin Sorbo, Jim Gleason, David A.R. White and Dean Cain.\n\nStruggling at the specialty box office is Lars von Trier\'s unrated sexual opus Nymphomaniac: Volume I. Playing in 22 theaters in top cities, the movie is expected to take in roughly $119,000 for the weekend for an unimpressive theater average of $5,400.', 'New Christian film ""God\'s Not Dead"" is doing solid business, while Lars von Trier\'s unrated sexual opus ""Nymphomaniac"" struggles at specialty box office.\nSummit Entertainment\'s latest YA offering Divergent easily topped the Friday box office with $22.8 million for an expected weekend gross in the $53 million to $54 million range.\nThe first Muppets grossed $41 million over the Thanksgiving holiday, including $29 million for the weekend.\nJames Bobin returns to direct the $54 million Muppets sequel, with Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell and Tina Fey replacing Jason Segel and Amy Adams as the live-action leads.\nMuppets Most Wanted has earned solid-to-good reviews, compared to stellar notices for The Muppets.']"

33295,http://www.inquisitr.com/1182356/the-hunger-games-fans-getting-their-fix-with-divergent/,entertainment,"['The Hunger Games has one of the strongest following of any movie or book series in the United States, let alone the world. Hunger Games fans are having to find something else to occupy their time until this winter when the series will continue on the big screen. Divergent appears to be something these fans can latch onto whie they wait.\n\nDivergent being similar to The Hunger Games isn’t really a mistake. Teen audiences seem to love the dystopian future storyline, especially when it is marked by a strong hero or heroine like The Hunger Games‘ Katniss Everdeen or Divergent‘s Tris. There also needs to be a romantic entanglement for these heroines. Hunger Games fans get that fix in a couple of different entanglements. Divergent has just the one, between Shailene Woodley’s Tris and Theo James’ Four.\n\nThe Hunger Games and Divergent are so similar that reports surfaced not long ago that the two films’ stars, Jennifer Lawrence and Woodley talked often about how to handle the lead roles.\n\nHunger Games fans have definitely transferred their frenzy over the series to this new contender. CNN recently reported Woodley and James were shocked to be greeted at an Atlanta screening of the film by a throng of rather excited fans.\n\nObviously the fact that Divergent is based on a series of books isn’t the only thing that is drawing Hunger Games fans in. The powerful and attractive main characters allow teenage fans of the series watch as people their age are basically saving the world.\n\nThe drama and romantic entanglements have proven popular among Hunger Games, Divergent and Twilight fans. Being based on popular book series doesn’t always equal financial success at the box office. That’s why Forbes says backers of Divergent have spent more than $25 million on promotional tie-ins like “Tris” Barbie dolls and “Four” Ken dolls.\n\nOf course, the real box office success will depend on fans who simply want to see more of a similar series, played out by different people. Katniss Everdeen has the kind of following that other box office characters could only hope to have.\n\nWhether or not Tris Prior can rise to the level of hero worship Katniss has will have a rather large impact into just how successful this movie series can be. While the cards are stacked against Woodley’s character, the excitement over Divergent seems to indicate there is indeed room for two powerful female heroines in Hunger Games lovers’ hearts.', 'Hunger Games fans are having to find something else to occupy their time until this winter when the series will continue on the big screen.\nHunger Games fans get that fix in a couple of different entanglements.\nHunger Games fans have definitely transferred their frenzy over the series to this new contender.\nObviously the fact that Divergent is based on a series of books isn’t the only thing that is drawing Hunger Games fans in.\nThe drama and romantic entanglements have proven popular among Hunger Games, Divergent and Twilight fans.']"

That’s enough for a runaway weekend win and more importantly, to successfully launch the studio’s latest teen franchise, following “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games.”\n\nOn Friday, Lionsgate gave a greenlight to “Insurgent,” the second film in the series, which will arrive next year on March 20. The third installment, “Allegiant,” is scheduled to debut on March 18, 2016.\n\nAlso read: ‘Divergent’ Debut Sends Lionsgate Stock Sliding, What’s Behind the Fall\n\nThe first-day total for the Shailene Woodley-Theo James sci-fi adventure was impressive, but not close to the nearly $36 million that “Twilight”ran up on its first day in November of 2008, on its way to a $69 million opening weekend. And it was nowhere near the $67 million opening day that “The Hunger Games” posted in 2012, on its way to a March record $152.5 million first weekend.\n\nThe PG-13-rated “Divergent” targeted the young women that have made Roth book’s bestsellers, and it was dominating. The critics have been rough on the Neil Burger-directed adventure that co-stars Kate Winslet, Miles Teller, Ashley Judd and Jai Courtney. But first night audiences — 59 percent female and evenly split between those over and under 25 years of age — gave it an “A” CinemaScore (“A+” from those under 18). Nearly $5 million from Thursday night screenings were included in the Friday figure.\n\nThe weekend’s only other wide opener, Disney’s “Muppets Most Wanted,” ran second Friday with $4.6 million. That projects to a soft $17 million weekend for the PG-rated family film starring Tina Fey, Ricky Gervais and Ty Burrell, which the studios and analysts had pegged for $2o million.\n\nAlso read: ‘Divergent’ Star Theo James on Gay Action Heroes, Film’s Bisexual Undertones: ‘I Can See It’\n\nThe low-budget “God’s Not Dead,” about a college student who sets out to prove God’s existence, was in 780 theaters and ran a surprise third Friday with $2.8 million for Freestyle Releasing. That translates to a an impressive $8 million for the weekend, though it will likely be overtaken by last week’s No. 1 movie, DreamWorks Animation’s “Mr. Peabody & Sherman,” which did $2.7 million Friday and is looking at $10.8 million for the three days.\n\n“The Grand Budapest Hotel” continues to impress. Fox Searchlight expanded Wes Anderson‘s ensemble comedy into 304 theaters, up from 66 last week, and it brought in $1.8 million. That’s a $6,210 per-screen average – better than any movie in the market, including the $5,805 of “Divergent, which was in a market-high 3,936 theaters, including 346 Imax sites.\n\nOn its current pace, “Grand Budapest” will finish the weekend with $6.3 million, to raise its total after three weeks to more than $12 million, and wind up seventh, behind “300: Rise of an Empire” and “Need for Speed.”\n\nAlso read: Why ‘Divergent’ Is Conquering the U.S. Box Office Before Overseas\n\nWarner Bros.’ R-rated sword-and-sandals brought in $2.4 million Friday and should come close to $8 million in its third weekend. It’s domestic total is up to $87 million and it’s added another $158 million from abroad.\n\nDreamWorks hot-car video game adaptation starring Aaron Paul of TV’s “Breaking Bad” brought in $2.2 million Friday, a tough 67 percent drop from its opening last week. It should finish around $7 million, which would bring its domestic to nearly $30 million.\n\nJustin Bateman’s directorial debut “Bad Words” expanded from six to 87 theaters and brought in about $141,000 for Focus Features, an OK $1,620 per-screen average for the R-rated spelling bee comedy.\n\nAlso read: ‘Captain America: The Winter Soldier’ Review: Superheroic, Yes, But Smart and Subversive Too\n\nLars von Trier‘s “Nymphomaniac: Volume 1” debuted on 24 screens and brought in about $53,000 for Magnolia Pictures. That’s a pretty good $2,195 per-screen average for the unrated Danish sex drama, which has been available on demand for since March 7.\n\nThe crowd-funded comedy mystery “Veronica Mars” added 56 theaters but took a major 86 percent tumble from its first weekend, and took in just $139,000 for Warner Bros.', '“Divergent” delivered in its first day at the North American box office.\nLionsgate’s big-screen adaptation of Veronica Roth’s young-adult bestseller rolled up $22.8 million Friday and is on pace for a three-day total that could hit $55 million.\nAnd it was nowhere near the $67 million opening day that “The Hunger Games” posted in 2012, on its way to a March record $152.5 million first weekend.\nThat projects to a soft $17 million weekend for the PG-rated family film starring Tina Fey, Ricky Gervais and Ty Burrell, which the studios and analysts had pegged for $2o million.\nBox Office Before OverseasWarner Bros.’ R-rated sword-and-sandals brought in $2.4 million Friday and should come close to $8 million in its third weekend.']"

What's more, that would be a great start given Divergent's modest $87 million production budget.\n\nFinally, remember when Lions Gate acquired Summit Entertainment in early 2012, they had the success of Twilight in mind. To be sure, the first Twilight cost just $37 million to produce and ultimately grossed $392.6 million worldwide. By the time Breaking Dawn Part 2 finally exited theaters in early 2013, the five Twilight films had collectively grossed more than $3.34 billion.\n\nIf the Divergent franchise can do even half as well, I'd consider it a huge success for Lions Gate.\n\nDivergent isn't alone this weekend\n\nSpeaking of modest budgets, let's not forget Disney (NYSE:DIS) is also bringing Muppets Most Wanted to the big screen this weekend. The sequel's primary hurdle, however, will be convincing families to forego repeat viewings of DreamWorks Animation's (NASDAQ:DWA) third-weekend holdover and reigning champion, Mr. Peabody & Sherman.\n\nBut that shouldn't be much of an issue since early tracking data pegs Muppets Most Wanted in the $25 million range -- still short of the original Muppets' $29 million debut, but not too shabby for a $50 million film. As long as Mr. Peabody & Sherman continues its normal downward trend from last weekend's solid $21.8 million take, it should add another $14 million to $18 million to its total over the next three days.\n\nMr. Peabody & Sherman has grossed $154 million worldwide so far, which means it has plenty of work ahead in order to recoup DreamWorks' steep $145 million outlay. As I suggested two weeks ago, however, DreamWorks has already proven it's great at turning seeming box office disasters into successes over the long term, so don't think investors need to worry just yet."", ""Buckle your seatbelts, Divergent fans, because this weekend Lions Gate (NYSE:LGF-A) is bringing your favorite dystopian future to life.\nAs a result, Divergent will likely end up closer to the first Twilight's $69.6 million opening in 2008.\nTo be sure, the first Twilight cost just $37 million to produce and ultimately grossed $392.6 million worldwide.\nIf the Divergent franchise can do even half as well, I'd consider it a huge success for Lions Gate.\nDivergent isn't alone this weekendSpeaking of modest budgets, let's not forget Disney (NYSE:DIS) is also bringing Muppets Most Wanted to the big screen this weekend.""]"

Trading volume of 6.2 million was four times its three-month average.\n\nLionsGate\'s Divergent, a film adaptation of the bestselling young-adult trilogy by Veronica Roth, generated $4.9 million in domestic late-night sales on Thursday, March 20. By way of comparison, the first film in the Twilight franchise made $7 million at midnight showings upon its November 2008 release.\n\nThe movie, which follows a world in which society has been fractured into different factions based on virtues, has been pegged as the studio\'s next Hunger Games, an easy comparison to make given the film\'s plot and target audience.\n\nAccording to Reuters, box office analysts project opening weekend ticket sales between $50 million and $68 million in domestic markets. While that\'s one-third of the $152.5 million generated by the first film in The Hunger Games franchise, it is by no measure weak -- making comparisons to the wildly successful film starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is a high bar to measure any film against.\n\nOn Friday, LionsGate greenlit the film\'s sequel Insurgent, slated for release in March 2015. The third film in the trilogy, Allegiant, is set for a March 2016 debut but the project is yet to be given the greenlight.\n\n""We\'re off to a great start with strong numbers from all regions of the country, urban, suburban and rural alike,"" CEO Jon Feltheimer said in a statement.

Box Office Mojo was more conservative, pinning the number closer to $50 million. The Los Angeles Times split the difference at $55 million.\n\nThe entire movie industry and its observers are in agreement on one point: “Divergent” will succeed where so many recent attempts have failed. As our own Kevin P. Sullivan recently pointed out, Shailene Woodley built serious indie cred prior to this franchise kickoff, just like Jennifer Lawrence before her.\n\nIn the last year and a half, “Vampire Academy,” “The Mortal Instruments,” “Beautiful Creatures” and “The Host” all came and went with little fanfare. “Percy Jackson” and “I Am Number Four” didn’t fare well, either. “Twilight” opened in November 2008 to the tune of $69 million, launching a franchise that eventually made over $3.3 billion around the world. With just two films thus far, “The Hunger Games” series has made $1.5 billion already.\n\nOf course “Divergent” isn’t the only youth-friendly franchise in theaters this weekend. Aiming at a much younger audience in addition to nostalgic parents, “Muppets Most Wanted” looks to capitalize on the success of the 2011 franchise reboot, “The Muppets.” The film starts literally where the last one ended, but the human side of the cast is entirely different. “Muppets Most Wanted” is a heist/caper film that sees the beloved characters manipulated by the scheming Dominic Badguy (the last name is, um, “French”) and his boss, Kermit doppelgänger Constantine, a.k.a. the World’s Most Dangerous Frog.\n\n“Muppets Most Wanted” features Tina Fey as a Russian prison guard, Ty Burrell as a French detective and a big new batch of celebrity cameos, as is the Muppets tradition. Of course, the last one opened over Thanksgiving and had the whole “bringing back the Muppets” angle behind it. “Muppets Most Wanted” is expected to open at #2 this weekend, somewhere in the low to mid $20 million range.\n\nIn limited release, there’s Shia LaBeouf in Lars Von Trier’s “Nymphomaniac: Volume One”; “Blood Ties,” starring Clive Owen and Zoe Saldana, in 25 theaters; an expanded opening for Jason Bateman’s “Bad Words”; and Christian indie “God’s Not Dead,” which includes Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain in its cast.\n\nThe top five should be filled out by holdovers “Mr. Peabody and Sherman,” “300: Rise of an Empire” and Aaron Paul’s “Need for Speed.”', '“Divergent” may very well open north of $60 million at the box office, according to projections from The Hollywood Reporter, Entertainment Weekly and ComingSoon.net.\nBox Office Mojo was more conservative, pinning the number closer to $50 million.\nOf course “Divergent” isn’t the only youth-friendly franchise in theaters this weekend.\n“Muppets Most Wanted” features Tina Fey as a Russian prison guard, Ty Burrell as a French detective and a big new batch of celebrity cameos, as is the Muppets tradition.\n“Muppets Most Wanted” is expected to open at #2 this weekend, somewhere in the low to mid $20 million range.']"
33332,http://www.thewrap.com/divergent-debut-lionsgate-stock-sliding,entertainment,"['Lionsgate’s stock tumbled about 6 percent Friday afternoon even after “Divergent” received an enthusiastic response at the box office and the studio announced it had greenlit a sequel to the futuristic thriller.\n\n“I’m scratching my head,” James Marsh, an entertainment and media analyst with Piper Jaffray, said. “I don’t understand what the big deal is. It’s clearly going to be a real franchise for the company and it will help fill the pipeline after ‘Hunger Games’ wraps up.”\n\n“Divergent” racked up an impressive $4.9 million in late night showings Thursday and is on pace to gross more than $50 million this weekend. Yet investors seem disappointed those figures cannot match or at least nip at the heels of the debuts of two other young adult blockbusters, “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games.”\n\nAlso read: ‘The Twivergent Games: The Saga: Bloody Dawn – Part 1’ Trailer: The Hottest YA Couples Prepare for Battle (Video)\n\nEven before Lionsgate unveiled its initial box office numbers, the markets were skittish. Initial reviews for the film were poor, sending the studio’s share price southward. The stock opened the week trading above $32 and was selling for $28.06 as of Friday afternoon. That’s a painful reception.\n\nThe film seems to be a victim of unrealistic expectations and a healthy dollop of irrational exuberance by investors who falsely believe that all young adult series are created equal. Compounding that misapprehension, were fan sites and publications that kept talking up “Divergent” as a possible successor to “The Hunger Games.”\n\nThose kinds of comparisons ignore the fact that “The Hunger Games” wasn’t just a hit, it was a phenomenon. On its own merits, “Divergent” is still a nice addition to Lionsgate’s balance sheet. Filmed for a relatively economical $80 million, it should make at least $150 million domestically and will perform respectably abroad thanks to an international fan base of the Veronica Roth novels that inspired the film.\n\nThose figures are all the more impressive given that prior to “The Hunger Games” and Lionsgate’s acquisition of the “Twilight” franchise with its 2012 merger with Summit, the studio’s releases grossed an average of $35 million.\n\nIt also shows that the lessons of “The Hunger Games” and “Twilight” can be applied to other films — namely how to identify and develop properties that appeal to teenage moviegoers. Other studios have certainly failed in that regard. Just ask the makers of “Beautiful Creatures” or “The Mortal Instruments” how easy it is to find the next tween blockbuster.\n\nAlso read: ‘Divergent’ Debuts to $4.9 Million, Lionsgate Greenlights ‘Insurgent’\n\n“They’ve done an amazing job of essentially building a studio from scratch,” Matthew Harrigan, a media analyst with Wunderlich Securities, said. “I’m surprised the stock has drifted downward.”\n\nHarrigan said that Lionsgate’s share price is under pressure from lofty box office expectations for “Divergent” and also the disappointing ratings of “Saint George.” The George Lopez vehicle has an interesting model. Lionsgate worked out a deal with FX that will see the network order 90 episodes of the freshman series if its first 10 installments reach a certain ratings threshold. That may not happen given audiences’ cool embrace of “Saint George.”\n\nAlso read: How ‘Divergent’s’ Shailene Woodley Used a Survivalist Weekend to Become Tris\n\nLionsgate is no stranger to having its share price skid on the opening weekend of one of its films. Its stock endured a similar pummeling when “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” opened to a massive $161.1 million domestically. Some analysts had expected a larger figure at the time and the studio’s share prices slid 10 percent. Despite the markets’ reaction, “Catching Fire” became the top grossing domestic release last year, earning $424.4 million stateside.\n\nWhether Lionsgate’s stock hit originated from its big or small screen business, the studio has lined up a stream of sequels and young adult adaptations that could help it achieve its ambitions of becoming one of the dominant players in Hollywood. There are two more “Hunger Games” sequels waiting to be released, a follow-up to “Now You See Me” in the wings and the fantasy adventure “Gods of Egypt” on the horizon.\n\n“The theatrical side has never looked better,” Marsh said. “They’re chock full of potential hits.”\n\nWatch TheWrap’s first original trailer for The Twivergent Games:\n\n', 'Lionsgate’s stock tumbled about 6 percent Friday afternoon even after “Divergent” received an enthusiastic response at the box office and the studio announced it had greenlit a sequel to the futuristic thriller.\nInitial reviews for the film were poor, sending the studio’s share price southward.\nIts stock endured a similar pummeling when “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire” opened to a massive $161.1 million domestically.\nSome analysts had expected a larger figure at the time and the studio’s share prices slid 10 percent.\nThere are two more “Hunger Games” sequels waiting to be released, a follow-up to “Now You See Me” in the wings and the fantasy adventure “Gods of Egypt” on the horizon.']"

That is one of the best preview numbers in recent memory, and compares to starts like Universal’s Despicable Me 2 at $4.7 million and World War Z at $3.6M and went onto gross $66.4M with a similar demographic. DM2 went onto gross $83.5M but that was fueled by family audiences. The action/adventure film, based on the 2011 Veronica Roth novel of the same name, is appealing to the twenty-something crowd who drive the box office on these kinds of films; it was produced by Doug Wick, Lucy Fisher and Pouya Shahbazian. Interestingly, the book doesn’t have the same kind of readership/fan base as say Hunger Games or even Vampire Diaries, so if this movie opens to its expected $50M-$60M+ (as it has been tracking to over the last couple of weeks), it will be a testament to the efforts of Summit who began marketing this title last July at ComicCon and then placed the trailer before Hunger Games: Catching Fire so it got tons of exposure for those perhaps not familiar with the Roth book. They have also been pushing on social media, but Divergent (starring Shailene Woodley and Theo James) is no Hunger Games. Checking in with social engagement experts RelishMix, “Divergent‘s social engagement is less than 50% (of Hunger Games) with heavy paid impressions not converting to social sharing,” said CEO Marc Karzen. And that is a key marketing indicator as the twenty-somethings who live on social platforms.\n\nAdvanced tickets went on sale on March 4 and pre-sales on Fandango sold out half of its tickets in one day, outpacing the first days of sales for the first Twilight when it began its pre-sales, however as we’ve said before no one is expecting this to be a Twilight opening which bowed to $69.6M in its first 3-day with $7M coming from midnight screenings. Also, the first Hobbit grossed $13M in early shows and the second The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug earned $8.8M in early shows and went on to open at $73.6M . The second opened to Divergent will play on 3,936 screens, 346 of which will be IMAX. It will bow internationally on April 4.\n\nSecond place this weekend will go handily to Disney’s Muppets Most Wanted and its No. 2 star Ricky Gervais which is tracking in the high-$20 millions.

According to a survey done by online ticketer Fandango, 66% of “Divergent’s” advanced ticket buyers said they intend to see the film with friends. Pic bows Thursday for evening shows in Imax and other premium-large format locations.\n\nMeanwhile, reviews for “Muppets Most Wanted” have been mostly positive, though less favorable than the 2011 Muppet feature that opened to $29 million over Thanksgiving weekend and grossed more than $88 million domestically. This is only the second first-quarter launch for “The Muppets” franchise, after “Muppets Treasure Island” in 1996.\n\nThe newest “Muppets” pic carries some significant pop culture cachet with young adults, thanks largely to stars Tina Fey and Ty Burrell, as well as a list of other recognizable acting cameos. The film needs to hit with non-families, with “Mr. Peabody & Sherman” still in the game for parents and kids.\n\nPlayability for the “Divergent” adaptation — beyond just fans of Veronica Roth’s dystopian-themed book — is far less certain, however. The film has scored a discouraging 29% score on Rotten Tomatoes vs. the first “Twilight,” which amassed a 49% rating, and “The Hunger Games,” which scored 84%. “Divergent” could use stronger reviews to attract auds not familiar with the book, though the teen audience relies far more heavily on word-of-mouth.\n\nInternationally, the film begins its rollout on April 4 in markets including the U.K., Italy and Mexico, followed a week later by France, Germany, Russia and Australia.\n\nIn an aggressive limited Stateside launch, Freestyle Releasing’s faith-based film “God’s Not Dead,” about a college student who sets out to prove God’s existence, bows at 780 locations. Tracking services anticipate the film will gross nearly $5 million in three days.\n\nAlso, Fox Searchlight expands Wes Anderson’s “The Grand Budapest Hotel” to 304 locations, up from 66 last weekend, when the film grossed a remarkable $55,122 per-screen average.

Relentlessly so.\n\nBut it is a good young adult movie in the dystopian vein that dominates in this science-fiction sub-genre. Harry Potter and The Hunger Games are reference points. Divergent plods down some of the same well-beaten paths, but with guns and zombie drugs as weapons instead of the owls and magic wands of Harry Potter and the bow-and-arrow set that Katniss Everdeen wields so expertly in The Hunger Games.\n\nIn Divergent, there is another empowered female heroine. She is Beatrice ‘Tris’ Prior. And she is played with an interesting blend of gritty determination and natural girlish charm by 22-year-old Shailene Woodley (The Descendants). She is the same age as Jennifer Lawrence was for the first Hunger Games.\n\nDivergent is an introduction to a series based on novelist Veronica Roth’s trilogy of Divergent, Insurgent and Allegiant. With Woodley on board, and the dynamic Theo James in the co-starring role as the mysterious character Four, the series has some promise.\n\nNot that Divergent is as thrilling as the first Hunger Games instalment, or its sequel. Even with a strong lead cast — Woodley and James are surrounded by Ashley Judd, Miles Teller, Ray Stevenson, Jai Courtney, Zoe Kravitz and Kate Winslet as a psycho-villain — the pace, the mood and the tone of the film are too slow, too dark and — yes — just too, too much self-importance to be great. The running time of 139 minutes is excessive for this story.\n\nThe problem is that director Neil Burger, working from an adapted screenplay by Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor, layers in excessive narrative, perhaps to please fans of Roth’s novels. It is not all necessary in this case. The story is actually quite simplistic: 100 years after an apocalyptic war, we are introduced to a human settlement in Chicago where all individuals are organized into sharply defined factions. Each faction has characteristics that all must conform to. Each faction has a role in keeping society balanced. The story reflects on tribalism.\n\nThis is humanity we are talking about, of course. There will be blood in this futuristic microcosm of the race. One faction, the Erudites led by Winslet, is plodding a coup to overthrow the Abnegation group, the selfless government leaders. Tris’ parents are part of Abnegation. But she surprisingly chooses to join Dauntless when she given a chance, because they are the protectors, the peace-keepers.\n\nNaturally, nothing is as it first seems. Woodley’s Tris finds this out the hard way and the drama of Divergent unfolds. The title of the book and the film refers to the “divergent” human beings who do not fit comfortably inside any faction. They are considered dangerous by Erudites.\n\nThe sci-fi world created for the story is a study in visual as well as emotional contrasts, just as in The Hunger Games. Most of the world the Dauntless faction inhabits is dingy, industrial and depressing. It is up to Woodley, James and their co-stars to keep us engaged, including in the emerging and intensely believable romance between the two leads. While I believe they do, some people may have divergent opinions about Divergent.\n\nTwitter: @Bruce_Kirkland\n\nbruce.kirkland@sunmedia.ca', 'Except for some deceptively giddy moments at the beginning, the film version of Divergent is grim.\nHarry Potter and The Hunger Games are reference points.\nShe is the same age as Jennifer Lawrence was for the first Hunger Games.\nNot that Divergent is as thrilling as the first Hunger Games instalment, or its sequel.\nIt is up to Woodley, James and their co-stars to keep us engaged, including in the emerging and intensely believable romance between the two leads.']"

The “Divergent” books, about a society divided into factions by personality traits, have sold more than 17 million copies worldwide.\n\n“Divergent,” opening today, likely won’t attain “Hunger Games” heights at the box office, but a strong start could answer a question hanging over the independent studio once known for comedian Tyler Perry’s films and the “Saw” horror flicks: Can it churn out more blockbuster-sized franchises?\n\nThe pre-opening buzz points to a strong performance for “Divergent.” Opening weekend ticket sales will hit US$50 million (RM164 million) to US$68 million in the United States and Canada, according to projections from Wall Street and box office analysts. That’s below the US$152.5 million for “Hunger Games”, but would be a big enough hit for Lions Gate to forge ahead with sequels planned for 2015 and 2016, they said. The massive “Twilight” vampire series opened with US$69.6 million.\n\n“It has the potential to be a massive franchise,” said Phil Contrino, chief analyst at Boxoffice.com, said of “Divergent”. The movie’s Facebook page has more than 1 million likes, a high number for the first film in a series. “The marketing campaign is doing a good job of highlighting the movie and getting people to go online and show their support.”\n\nTurning a successful book into a hit film is no sure thing, as Hollywood has found with several attempts to excite teen audiences since “Twilight” ended. Movies including “Beautiful Creatures” from Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros, Sony Corp’s “The Mortal Instruments”, and Lions Gate’s “Ender’s Game” didn’t draw massive crowds.\n\nSome early “Divergent” reviews were negative, helping push Lions Gate shares down 9 per cent this week, Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould said. Of 13 reviews on the Rotten Tomatoes website as of Wednesday, 31 per cent were positive.\n\nGould, who rates Lions Gate “overweight”, said he expects young female fans to turn out and produce strong “Divergent” sales, reaching US$150 million in the United States and Canada over its theatrical run.\n\nLions Gate spent US$85 million to produce “Divergent”, plus US$40 million to US$45 million on marketing, according to person with knowledge of the film’s budget. The studio has already recouped about US$70 million of the cost through international licensing deals, the person said.\n\nMaking “Divergent” a success is important for Lions Gate to show investors they can bank on another big franchise outside of “Hunger Games”, said Cowen and Company analyst Doug Creutz.\n\nFrom fiscal years 2013 to 2016, 62 per cent of Lions Gate’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) will come from “Hunger Games” and “Twilight”, Creutz estimates. Lions Gate acquired “Twilight” with the 2012 purchase of Summit Entertainment, the unit that produced “Divergent”.\n\nWhile Lions Gate is growing its TV revenue with shows like AMC Networks Inc’s “Mad Men” and Netflix Inc’s “Orange is the New Black”, it needs new films to replace the revenue from the two current franchises, Creutz said.\n\n“They have two more franchises than they had three years ago,” said Creutz, who rates Lions Gate “market perform”. “Can they do it on a consistent basis? I think that’s still an open question. ‘Divergent’ is an important one for that.” — Reuters', 'The studio behind the mega-hit “Hunger Games” movies is betting again on a popular series of best-selling young adult novels set in a dystopian future.\nThat’s below the US$152.5 million for “Hunger Games”, but would be a big enough hit for Lions Gate to forge ahead with sequels planned for 2015 and 2016, they said.\nSome early “Divergent” reviews were negative, helping push Lions Gate shares down 9 per cent this week, Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould said.\nMaking “Divergent” a success is important for Lions Gate to show investors they can bank on another big franchise outside of “Hunger Games”, said Cowen and Company analyst Doug Creutz.\n“They have two more franchises than they had three years ago,” said Creutz, who rates Lions Gate “market perform”.']"

But can it repeat the success it had with The Hunger Games?\n\nEarly reviews haven\'t been glowing. The film, which follows a world in which society has been fractured into different factions based on virtues, has only received a 34% approval rating on film reviews site Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\n\nIn his review, TIME Magazine\'s Mike Ryan wrote, ""It\'s impossible to ignore the overwhelming sense that we\'ve seen all this before, only with better execution.""\n\nAnd Rolling Stone\'s Peter Travers said, ""The faithful but dramatically flat film version of Divergent, from Veronica Roth\'s 2011 bestseller, couldn\'t stir palpitations in shut-ins. It\'s that bland and lifeless.""\n\nBut what the film\'s success boils down to isn\'t critical acclaim, but teenage response. And in that respect, Divergent looks promising.\n\nAccording to Reuters, box office analysts project opening weekend ticket sales between $50 million and $68 million in domestic markets. While that\'s one-third of the $152.5 million generated by the first film in The Hunger Games franchise, it is by no measure weak -- making comparisons to the wildly successful film starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is a high bar to measure any film against.\n\nGiven the Divergent trilogy has sold more than 17 million copies worldwide, this movie already has an existing fan base to appeal to, let alone new audiences it can draw through marketing and buzz.\n\nMust Read: Warren Buffett\'s 10 Favorite Stocks\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, notable return on equity, solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth and compelling growth in net income. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nLGF\'s revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 4.2%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 12.9%. Growth in the company\'s revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.\n\nPowered by its strong earnings growth of 118.51% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 38.61% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Turning to the future, naturally, any stock can fall in a major bear market. However, in almost any other environment, the stock should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed nice gains in the past year.\n\nLIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CP reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. During the past fiscal year, LIONS GATE ENTERTAINMENT CP turned its bottom line around by earning $1.57 versus -$0.30 in the prior year.\n\nThe net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Media industry. The net income increased by 134.6% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $37.83 million to $88.76 million.\n\nThe company\'s current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior.

But, the YA adaptation looks to be the clear frontrunner and it would not surprise if it doubled the Muppets’ opening returns.\n\nDivergent is one of the first big-budget films of 2014 to target a primarily female audience after weeks of expensive, male-targeted fare. The interest seems to be there for a big opening weekend, too. Beyond the popularity of the books, Fandango is reporting that Divergent accounts for more than 80 percent of its pre-sales. But, it also has a lot to live up to thanks to the unrealistic precedents set by franchises like The Hunger Games and Twilight, where anything under a $70 million opening could be seen as a disappointment.\n\nHere’s how things might play out:\n\n1. Divergent — $60 million\n\nLionsgate’s Summit Entertainment is set to release Divergent in over 3,900 locations (346 of which are IMAX), Friday, with select screenings Thursday night. Adapted from Veronica Roth’s hugely popular series, Divergent imagines a future, dystopian Chicago that’s divided into factions that govern personalities and values. The teenage Tris (Shailene Woodley) is a divergent, meaning she doesn’t fit into a single faction and is considered a threat to the stability of the society. Divergent has been heavily marketed since a preview at Comic-Con and a trailer that debuted in front of Catching Fire. Overall, critics have not been kind to the film. At press time its Rotten Tomatoes score was at a 27 percent. EW’s Owen Gleiberman was not one of the naysayers, though. In his B+ review he wrote: “The director, Neil Burger (the fanciful craftsman who made Limitless and The Illusionist), keeps you invested, staging a rise-of-the-savior-heroine plot so that it seems less ritualistic than it does in the Hunger Games films.” Divergent begins its international push in April.\n\n2. Muppets Most Wanted — $23 million\n\nDisney’s follow-up to their 2011 Muppets relaunch meets up with the gang as Kermit, mistaken for an infamous lookalike criminal, is shipped off to a Siberian prison, while the rest fall under the spell of an ill-intentioned manager (played by Ricky Gervais). The first film pulled in $29.2 million in its first 3-day weekend in theaters over Thanksgiving (it opened wide on a Wednesday). This take, which cost an estimated $55 million to make, opens in 3,194 theaters and should see an opening in the low-to-mid $20 millions. EW’s Chris Nashawaty gave the film a B and wrote: “The songs are infectious, but the rest (despite turns by Tina Fey and Ty Burrell) lacks some of the gang’s usual feel-good joy.”\n\n3. Mr. Peabody and Sherman – $15 million\n\nThanks to good reviews and continued buzz, DreamWorks Animation’s Mr. Peabody and Sherman topped the box office last weekend, falling a modest 32.3 percent from its debut at No. 2. With the increased competition of Muppets Most Wanted, Mr. Peabody could see another 35 to 40 percent drop.\n\n4. 300: Rise of an Empire – $11 million\n\nThe stylish, bloody sequel is poised for another big drop in week three, likely in the 50 percent range. As of Mar. 19, the domestic total was at $83.7 million. For comparison, by the close of the third weekend, the first film had brought in nearly $161.7 million domestically.\n\n5. Need for Speed – $10 million\n\nAfter debuting in third place last weekend, the Aaron Paul-starrer could fall 45 to 50 percent in its second weekend in theaters, unless word-of-mouth buzz from opening weekend audiences proves significant. The $66 million car pic may be skidding domestically, but international audiences seem to be making up for that with over $45.6 million in earnings to date\n\nIn the speciality box office world, the 1970s-set New York crime thriller (starring Clive Owen, Zoe Saldana, Billy Crudup, and Mila Kunis) Blood Ties opens in 25 theaters, as does Lars von Trier’s provocative Nymphomaniac: Volume One. Jason Bateman’s spelling bee comedy Bad Words also expands after a limited opening last weekend.\n\nCheck back at EW.com this weekend for estimates and analysis.', 'Image zoomThe 2014 box office, already up 8 percent from last year, is heating up as Divergent stares down Muppets Most Wanted, both of which open in over 3,000 theaters this weekend.\nBut, the YA adaptation looks to be the clear frontrunner and it would not surprise if it doubled the Muppets’ opening returns.\nThe interest seems to be there for a big opening weekend, too.\nDivergent has been heavily marketed since a preview at Comic-Con and a trailer that debuted in front of Catching Fire.\nWith the increased competition of Muppets Most Wanted, Mr. Peabody could see another 35 to 40 percent drop.']"

But while the film itself may be entirely different, the familiar trailer -- and the perception that comes with it -- could deter moviegoers this weekend.\n\nIn January, BoxOffice.com predicted that the film will open at $50 million. The Hollywood Reporter said that it could earn close to $70 million.\n\nBoth estimates are attainable, but investors won\'t know how well the film has performed until the studio estimates are released on Sunday. The final numbers won\'t be published before Monday afternoon.\n\nRelated: Will Lionsgate\'s \'Divergent\' Become The Next \'Twilight\' Or \'Hunger Games\'?\n\nIn the meantime, investors are turning to other indicators (such as social media) to see if they can figure out how the film will perform. One such investor is Chris Camillo, author of Laughing at Wall Street. He successfully used social media to predict the success of The Hunger Games and invested in Lionsgate. His due diligence paid off, so Benzinga was eager to know what Camillo thought of Divergent.\n\n""First let me tell you that I have not done the extensive diligence on of Divergent that I had done on The Hunger Games,"" Camillo told Benzinga. ""And that\'s really because I believed that the market…I think there\'s more eyes on Divergent than there were on The Hunger Games. Naturally I\'m less interested in it. I\'m gonna make an assumption that they\'re probably a little bit better this time around at pricing this in.""\n\nRegardless, Camillo has kept an eye on Divergent and its success (or lack thereof) in social media.\n\n""The Twitter volume for Divergent going into this opening week is running about 20 to 25 percent of what The Hunger Games had,"" said Camillo.\n\nPut another way, Divergent has 75 to 80 percent less Twitter volume than The Hunger Games.\n\n""Now it\'s very difficult to build out a correlation between raw tweet volume and opening weekend grosses, but it\'s one data point that you should be aware of,"" Camillo added.\n\nBook Sales\n\nThus far, Camillo said that Divergent book sales haven\'t been on par with The Hunger Games.\n\n""But at the same time you\'ll routinely see Divergent being cited for book sales based on its Amazon rank,"" said Camillo. ""And I think that\'s being underrated a bit because the Amazon ranking of Divergent, when you just look at e-books, is considerably higher. Over the past couple of years since The Hunger Games came out, e-books have become a more important metric.""\n\nCrossover Appeal\n\nEven if Divergent book sales continue to climb, the franchise will still have some hurdles to overcome.\n\n""Crossover appeal -- that\'s the big question, right?"" said Camillo. ""Does Divergent have the crossover appeal that The Hunger Games had? That\'s where my hope for Divergent really got deflated.""\n\nRelated: Lionsgate\'s \'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\' Grosses $167M Worldwide Bringing Global Total to $573M\n\nCamillo believes that The Hunger Games had a ""strong crossover appeal"" because of its positive critical reception, ""which Divergent obviously does not have.""\n\n""I know it\'s early and there\'s only a handful of Rotten Tomatoes reviews that have come in,"" Camillo added. ""But both the trade magazines are in, some fairly significant Rotten Tomatoes reviews are in, and they\'re not great. They\'re not terrible, but they\'re certainly not good enough to give Divergent critical crossover appeal that would bring people who would not ordinarily watch a film like Divergent out of the house and into the theater because they think it\'s an \'it\' movie. That is extremely important.""\n\nIf Camillo had seen Rotten Tomatoes reviews in the 80 to 90-plus range (which is what The Hunger Games and its sequel, Catching Fire, received), he said that he would have been intrigued. But that wasn\'t the case.\n\n""I would say the over/under number to disappoint and to have it start to impact Lionsgate\'s stock is $50 million,"" said Camillo. ""If it comes in under $50 million this weekend we have a problem for Lionsgate. I think between $50 million and $70 million, I think that\'s your range of expected opening box office. Anything over $70 million or $80 million, certainly I think that\'s a positive for the stock.""\n\nCamillo does not think that a $50 million (or less) opening would be a ""disaster"" for the franchise. However, he does believe that it could hurt the ""long-term impact of Lionsgate\'s stock.""\n\n""At that point, at under $50 million, Divergent no longer becomes a significant and substantial long-term driver to replace The Hunger Games and Twilight,"" said Camillo.\n\nCould The Third Film Flop?\n\nLast but not least, Camillo said that while Divergent fans are excited for the first two films, they are not as interested in the third chapter -- for obvious reasons.\n\n""So you really need this film to come out of the gate strong if you\'re gonna perceive this to be a Hunger Games/Twilight replacement,"" Camillo concluded. ""That\'s what investors want.""\n\nDisclosure: At the time of this writing, Louis Bedigian had no position in the equities mentioned in this report.', 'Related: Will Lionsgate\'s \'Divergent\' Become The Next \'Twilight\' Or \'Hunger Games\'?\nHe successfully used social media to predict the success of The Hunger Games and invested in Lionsgate.\nPut another way, Divergent has 75 to 80 percent less Twitter volume than The Hunger Games.\nI think between $50 million and $70 million, I think that\'s your range of expected opening box office.\n""At that point, at under $50 million, Divergent no longer becomes a significant and substantial long-term driver to replace The Hunger Games and Twilight,"" said Camillo.']"
33359,http://www.rttnews.com/2289478/divergent-set-to-take-over-box-office-this-weekend.aspx\?type=bx,entertainment,"['With plenty of hype and big aspirations from distributor Lionsgate, teen-friendly fantasy film ""Divergent"" is in position to blow away the competition and land easily as the number one box office draw in the U.S. this weekend. While ""Divergent"" looks to meet blockbuster expectations, Disney\'s ""Muppets Most Wanted"" is also getting a wide release of roughly 3,000 total venues, though competition from ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" could make it difficult to resonate with family audiences. The weekend could also be the first since November that smash hit ""Frozen"" doesn\'t land near the top of the charts, breaking a streak of 16 consecutive weekends in the box office top 10.\n\nComing off of major success with teen audiences with both ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games,"" Lionsgate has high hopes for ""Divergent,"" which is based on the international best-selling trilogy from writer Veronica Roth. Starring Shailene Woodley and Theo James, ""Divergent"" tells the post-apocalyptic story of a civilization that divides the population based on personality. Promising plenty of action and holding a PG-13 rating, ""Divergent"" hopes to be able to reach mainstream audiences across various age groups and could even make a run at the opening of ""The Lego Movie,"" which currently holds the biggest opening of 2014 with $69 million.\n\nBut while ""The Hunger Games"" series has been met by positive critical reviews, ""Divergent"" is gathering a negative critical consensus, potentially pointing toward limited appeal following its first weekend. The good news, however, is that the ""Twilight"" series didn\'t need to have positive reviews to hit big-time with teenage audiences, suggesting that ""Divergent"" could overcome bad reviews thanks to the connection between the book series and readers. Though matching the $150 million+ openings of ""The Hunger Games"" is likely well out of reach for ""Divergent,"" a steady opening in the $60-$65 million range, more in line with the original ""Twilight,"" would be a nice first weekend for an $80 million production and a positive overall sign for Lionsgate.\n\nWith ""Divergent"" taking over a high percentage of teens and action-seekers this weekend, Disney\'s ""Muppets Most Wanted"" hopes to find a few family audiences. But even though the 2011 version of ""The Muppets"" was a quiet success for Disney, it was far from a major smash hit, and this time around the franchise carries on without stars Amy Adams and Jason Segel. Also not helping is the presence of ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"" which started slowly but has since seemed to have caught on with family audiences. Still, with a fairly modest $50 million production budget, some positive reviews and a well-known brand, ""Muppets Most Wanted"" should still get off to a decent start, likely finishing just below the $29 million that ""The Muppets"" opened to back in January of 2011.\n\nAs ""Muppets Most Wanted"" opens near the top of the charts, it should be the first weekend since late-November that Disney\'s ""Frozen"" won\'t land in the top 10. After putting together a strong limited opening toward the end of November, ""Frozen"" would benefit from very positive word-of-mouth and finish its run as one of the top animated hits ever, racking up an enormous $396 million in the U.S. so far and more than $1 billion worldwide. Even with the addition of animated blockbuster ""The Lego Movie"" and more recently ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"" ""Frozen"" managed to hold onto a spot in the top 10 for nearly four months - an uncommonly long box office run in today\'s release system.\n\nThe weekend could also be another rough one for ""Need for Speed,"" an action-thriller that struggled to find mainstream audiences a week ago. With a $66 million production budget, a $17.8 million opening is shy of expectations and a dip of more than 50% from last weekend to this one would be a signal that it doesn\'t have much audience appeal. If ""Need for Speed"" loses a major portion of its intended audience to ""Divergent,"" it could see a fairly swift drop in overall venues in the coming weeks.\n\nNext weekend, director Darren Aronofsky\'s (""Requiem for a Dream,"" ""Black Swan"") passion project ""Noah"" will finally hit theaters, with Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Anthony Hopkins and Emma Watson starring in the biblical epic that is already drawing significant controversy. Also hitting theaters next weekend will be Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s latest action film ""Sabotage,"" with Sam Worthington and Malin Akerman co-starring. Starting off April the following week, ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" will hit theaters, though the Disney distribution has somewhat tempered expectations compared with the other recent Marvel releases.\n\nRTT Box Office Predictions for 3/21/14 - 3/23/14 (in millions):\n\n1) Divergent (Lionsgate): $65\n\n2) Muppets Most Wanted (Disney): $25\n\n3) Mr. Peabody & Sherman (Fox): $12\n\n4) 300: Rise of an Empire (Warner Bros.): $9.6\n\n5) Need for Speed (Disney): $8.2\n\n6) Non-Stop (Universal): $5.8\n\n7) Tyler Perry\'s Single Mom\'s Club (Lionsgate): $4\n\n8) The Lego Movie (Warner Bros.): $4\n\n9) The Grand Budapest Hotel (Fox Searchlight): $3\n\n10) Son of God (Fox): $2.8\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com\n\nEntertainment News', 'With plenty of hype and big aspirations from distributor Lionsgate, teen-friendly fantasy film ""Divergent"" is in position to blow away the competition and land easily as the number one box office draw in the U.S. this weekend.\nThe weekend could also be the first since November that smash hit ""Frozen"" doesn\'t land near the top of the charts, breaking a streak of 16 consecutive weekends in the box office top 10.\nStarring Shailene Woodley and Theo James, ""Divergent"" tells the post-apocalyptic story of a civilization that divides the population based on personality.\nWith ""Divergent"" taking over a high percentage of teens and action-seekers this weekend, Disney\'s ""Muppets Most Wanted"" hopes to find a few family audiences.\nAlso hitting theaters next weekend will be Arnold Schwarzenegger\'s latest action film ""Sabotage,"" with Sam Worthington and Malin Akerman co-starring.']"

33395,http://thestir.cafemom.com/entertainment/170055/paul_walkers_final_fast_furious,entertainment,"['Ever since actor Paul Walker\'s tragic death on November 30th, questions have been swirling about his upcoming role in Fast & Furious 7. Walker had shot a number of scenes for the movie before his car accident, and while Universal eventually confirmed Walker would still be included in the movie, the studio hasn\'t commented on how the franchise would deal with the loss of its leading man.\n\nFilming was put on hold for almost four months, but shooting resumed this week in Atlanta, GA and is expected to last for a period of six to eight weeks. Sources now say that script tweaks have allowed the team to ""retire"" Walker\'s Fast & Furious character -- and yes, he\'ll appear onscreen, thanks to some clever camera trickery.\n\nAccording to a source involved with production, Walker will be added to key scenes via computer graphics:\n\nThey have hired four actors with bodies very similar to Paul’s physique and they will be used for movement and as a base. Paul’s face and voice will be used on top using CGI.\n\nThis is reportedly what\'s being done for Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his unfinished role in Mockingjay Part 2, and it\'s been done before (notably, for actor Oliver Reed in Gladiator following the performer’s sudden death). Using CGI is surely a better choice than, say, Ed Wood\'s Plan 9 from Outer Space where he used recycled footage of the deceased Bela Lugosi and hired his wife\'s chiropractor as an awkward stand-in who constantly kept a cape over his face, but still, it seems … well, a little ethically shady?\n\nI don\'t mean Universal is trying to exploit Walker. I\'m sure Walker had a contract that gave the studio permission to use his likeness in all sorts of ways associated with Fast & Furious, and I know they\'re just trying to figure out a way for him to gracefully exit the franchise while making use of the existing footage.\n\nStill, it reminds me of how dead musicians can now appear onstage thanks to CGI and a reflection technique called ""Pepper\'s Ghost."" Tupac performing posthumously at Coachella, for instance. A CGI version of an actor will become part of their onscreen legacy, whether they would have wanted it that way or not.\n\nActor Crispin Glover famously brought a lawsuit against Back To The Future Part II after he was portrayed in the film using pre-existing footage and an actor wearing facial prosthetics. The case was settled out of court, but apparently there are now clauses in the Screen Actors Guild collective bargaining agreements which state that producers and actors aren\'t allowed to use similar methods to reproduce the likeness of other actors.\n\nI\'m not saying what\'s happening with Fast & Furious 7 is the same thing, but it\'s clearly a grey area. My gut feeling is that Universal will do a completely respectful job with Walker\'s imagery, it\'s just that I can\'t help wondering how this could play out in other scenarios -- now that film technology has advanced so far beyond prosthetics and capes over faces.\n\nWhat do you think about a CGI Paul Walker appearing in Fast & Furious 7?\n\nImage via Universal Pictures', 'Ever since actor Paul Walker\'s tragic death on November 30th, questions have been swirling about his upcoming role in Fast & Furious 7.\nSources now say that script tweaks have allowed the team to ""retire"" Walker\'s Fast & Furious character -- and yes, he\'ll appear onscreen, thanks to some clever camera trickery.\nPaul’s face and voice will be used on top using CGI.\nI\'m not saying what\'s happening with Fast & Furious 7 is the same thing, but it\'s clearly a grey area.\nWhat do you think about a CGI Paul Walker appearing in Fast & Furious 7?']"

Smith Painting and Decorating to repair water damage at her property in 2009. However, Baker said that she was not satisfied by the job after paying $60,000. She asked to company to redo the job, but they refused. Baker eventually finished the job herself.\n\nThe company filed a lawsuit against Baker in September 2010, alleging that she failed to pay them $15,000. The lawsuit was dropped after her lawyer threatened to counter-sue. They filed the lawsuit again, but Baker claimed they did not notify her.\n\nThe company told the court that they could not locate her.

According to the news source, Ray A. Smith Painting & Decorating company is suing Baker, 56, claiming that she owes the company $15,000 for renovations to her Detroit-area home.\n\nToday, Baker spoke with Kevin Frazier, claiming that she learned about the new lawsuit via news reports, as no one successfully contacted her about the current judgment. Baker went on to claim that although the company is suing her for $15,000, she\'s already paid them $60,000 for a job that she had to complete herself.\n\nAccording to Baker, she had water damage in her house and hired the company for drywall repair, paying them a $60,000 insurance claim upfront. Baker told Frazier that after the job was done, she found their work unsatisfactory and asked Ray Smith to come back out to redo a portion of the job. When Ray Smith refused to do so, Baker claims that she finished the job herself.\n\nIn September 2010, Ray Smith filed a lawsuit against Baker, but when her lawyer threatened to counter sue the suit was dropped. She thought the matter was over. In 2011, they filed again but this time did not notify Baker or her lawyer and she was never served. They obtained a ""default judgment"" and waited three years before requesting a ""creditor\'s exam"" as a means of collecting the Judgment, but again did not serve Ms. Baker. Instead, they then went back to the court and said that they tried to serve her several times but could never find Baker, so the court issued a substituted service, which allowed them to just post the new lawsuit on her door. They filed this latest motion when she was once again out of town.\n\nBaker has kept busy with tours since her children have become adults and are out of the house. She has a new album coming soon.\n\nBaker\'s attorney Jamal Hamood told the AP that he plans to file a motion to cancel the warrant.\n\nRelated Gallery', 'While news broke yesterday of an arrest warrant being issued for Anita Baker, the Grammy-winning singer seemed to be the last to find out.\nBaker tells The Insider\'s Kevin Frazier that she feels as if she\'s being terrorized, like it\'s ""almost a form of extortion.""\nToday, Baker spoke with Kevin Frazier, claiming that she learned about the new lawsuit via news reports, as no one successfully contacted her about the current judgment.\nWhen Ray Smith refused to do so, Baker claims that she finished the job herself.\nIn September 2010, Ray Smith filed a lawsuit against Baker, but when her lawyer threatened to counter sue the suit was dropped.']"

Smith Painting & Decorating $15,000 for the renovations. However, the singer-songwriter failed to comply.\n\nIn September 2013, Baker was ordered to appear before the Wayne County Circuit Court for a hearing with the plaintiff. The hearing, called a debtor’s examination, is a process of discovery. As Baker refused to pay the creditor, she was ordered to appear before the court and disclose her assets, which are subject to seizure or garnishment.\n\nAlthough owing debt is not a criminal offense, defendants who fail to appear for a debtor’s examination are subject to arrest.\n\nAs reported by the Detroit Free Press, a bench warrant was issued for Anita Baker’s arrest when she failed to appear in the Wayne County Circuit Court. Attorney Dan Gerow, who represents the plaintiff, said he simply wants Baker to pay the debt.\n\nA native of Toledo, Ohio, Anita Baker was raised by relatives in Detroit, Michigan. As a young woman, she displayed a unique talent for singing and songwriting. Although she began singing in church, she eventually joined a band called Chapter 8.\n\nAnita was born to sing. However, she was heavily criticized by several colleagues. Their disparaging remarks nearly broke her spirit and prompted her to take a hiatus from singing and performing.\n\nWhile working as a secretary in a legal firm, Baker was recruited by an executive with Beverly Glen Records. The company produced her first album, The Songstress, in 1983. The album eventually caught the attention of Elektra Records, who offered her a contact in 1985.\n\nAnita Baker got her big break in 1986 with the release of her second album Rapture. The sings “Sweet Love” and “Caught Up in the Rapture” were instant hits. Her third album, Giving You the Best That I Got, saw similar success.\n\nThroughout the 80s and 90s, the songstress won eight Grammy Awards. Her mellow and emotional style of music was specifically popular on the R&B and Adult Contemporary charts.\n\nIn the 1990s Baker suffered personal tragedy, as she has two miscarriages. Biography.com reports that she took some time off to grieve and focus on her own recovery. However, she eventually gave birth to two sons and returned to the music scene in 1994.\n\nAlthough she remains strongly devoted to her family, Anita Baker has continued to sing and write songs. Her latest setback is certainly troubling but Baker has demonstrated a strong will.

Don’t Care!!!!!! #artforfreedom#rebelheart#revolutionoflove.”\n\nThe first hashtag, #artforfreedom, is a reference to Madge’s global initiative to encourage creative expression, aimed at shedding light on human rights violations. Each month Madonna plans to donate $10,000 to a nonprofit organization selected by a guest curator. Pop princess Katy Perry was the curator for January.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMadonna wears a black lace bra showing ample cleavage in the pic and a black bow tie to boot, but the underarm hair is clearly the photo’s focus. However, it isn’t the first time she’s gone au naturel.\n\nPHOTOS: Madonna’s life in pictures\n\nIn 2011, she told Harper’s Bazaar, “Going to high school, I saw how popular girls had to behave to get the boys. I knew I couldn’t fit into that. So I decided to do the opposite. I refused to wear makeup, to have a hairstyle. I refused to shave. I had hairy armpits.” She added, “The boys in my school would make fun of me. ‘Hairy monster.’ You know, things like that.”\n\nMadonna’s nod to women to embrace their natural body hair is actually on trend. Actress Cameron Diaz, author of “The Body Book,” recently spoke out in an effort to encourage women to keep their pubic hair rather than having it lasered away. And in fashion earlier this year, retailer American Apparel featured lingerie-wearing mannequins with visible pubic hair in a New York City storefront.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to the presumptive message about body hair, Madonna has something to promote, er, say about beauty as well. On the same day the photo was posted, Madge introduced fans to a black-and-white commercial for MDNA Skin. It’s the anti-aging skin care line she began in Japan, and can only be purchased there. “I’ve spent hours on it. Months on it. Years on it. MDNA,” she says in the video. “Transformation. Enigmatic. Substance. Connection. Revolution. Spirit. Intuition. Magic. Mystical. Ambition. Infinity. Immortal.”\n\nPHOTOS: Madonna plays Staples Center\n\nWith that promotion aside, Madonna recently pumped up the hit fantasy series “Games of Thrones” when she dressed up as the show’s character Daenerys Targaryen to celebrate Jewish holiday Purim. The outfit she wore came straight off the body of actress Emilia Clarke, who plays the Queen of Dragons on the show.\n\n“It’s my real costume,” said Clarke, during an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” a few days after Madonna posted the photo.\n\n“I thought I was dreaming,” Clarke said. “I got an email from amazing HBO publicist Mara, saying, ‘Madonna would like to borrow the costume, is that OK?’ ” she remembered. “I thought, ‘God, this must be a dream. This can’t be real.’ ”\n\nIt was. And as if that weren’t enough, Madonna posted three photos of herself in Clarke’s costume to Instagram, her most recent with the caption, “Need my Dragons today! #rebelheart.”\n\nALSO:\n\nAlyssa Milano is pregnant -- Milo’s getting a sibling!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Hemsworth, Elsa Pataky add twin babies to their family\n\nKim Kardashian, Kanye West land Vogue cover, show off baby North\n\nFollow Ministry of Gossip @LATcelebs.\n\n', 'The 55-year-old recently revealed a photo of her fully furry underarm hair -- real or fake -- with the caption “Long hair......

We have come across many amazing inventions. These technological advancements have made our lives much easier, and they also been integrated as a part of our most basic needs. Communication with one another has become very efficient and convenient. There are some setbacks of this technology, but these inventions have the world built around them.\n\nEveryone wants to use these technological innovations. A black and white TV has now evolved into an LED technology with the ability to project images in 3d and now even in 8k resolution which is 16 times more than what we were used to just a few years ago. Maybe even the remote control will lose its use shortly soon, and we will have something even crazier to control our televisions.\n\nIt is not easy to pick the best technological advancements since there have been hundreds of amazing innovations in a time of just 2 decades. Views and opinions differ from person to person. We have considered what we think are the best technological inventions and have made a list.\n\n1. Global Positioning System (GPS)\n\nThe idea of GPS showed up long before smartphones were even an idea. The US Department of Defense developed this system in 1974 to overcome the limits of old navigation systems. GPS identifies a geographical location of the receiver by sending information through satellites in space. The use of GPS today is wide-spread. It is used in commercial flights, military, agriculture, astronomy and many other industries that simply can’t exist without it.\n\nBradford Parkinson, Ivan A. Getting, and Roger L. Easton are all credited with inventing this amazing technology.\n\nThe first modernized GPS satellite was launched in 2005, which made GPS devices commercially available for everyone. Today we can find GPS use in laptops, smartphones, tablets, and a lot of other electronic devices.\n\nIf you have an idea that you think is a promising technological advancement, then we recommend you check out dailyuw.com.\n\n2. Social Networks\n\nToday there are hundreds of social network platforms, so we won’t be focusing on just one. Our best way of communication just 10 years ago was with telephone calls. However, modern social networks took the number 1 place as the best way of communication. Social media first started with websites like Myspace, Hi5, and Friendster. Even though most of these first wave website were short-lived, this amazing idea has changed the way of life of everyone on this planet. We are all connected to each other at all times, whether indirectly or directly.\n\nToday, platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram have taken social networking to a much more advanced level than we could have ever imagined.\n\n3. The touch screen\n\nThe touch screen is probably one of the most heavily used technologies used in these last two decades. Laptops, printers, tablets, educations kiosks, desktops, smartphones, and every other kind of electronic device now has touch screens. Apple holds the place as the first company to launch the first finger touch screen phone without the need for a device to touch the screen. We used to have an underdeveloped touch screen that needed a stylus that quickly lost its appeal after the launch of the iPod.\n\nThe appearance of the touch screen forced one of the world’s biggest technology providers to rework everything of their products.', 'We have considered what we think are the best technological inventions and have made a list.\nEven though most of these first wave website were short-lived, this amazing idea has changed the way of life of everyone on this planet.\nThe touch screenThe touch screen is probably one of the most heavily used technologies used in these last two decades.\nApple holds the place as the first company to launch the first finger touch screen phone without the need for a device to touch the screen.\nThe appearance of the touch screen forced one of the world’s biggest technology providers to rework everything of their products.']"

Let’s just get this out of the way. Even if that armpit picture was timed to coincide with the release of her new advert, even if that was the case - that is besides the point. The point is, why is it, that still, in 2014, despite woman’s hour and twitter and feminist pop songs, a woman with body hair will get so much attention? Whether that attention comes in the form of a snigger on the street or axe-grinders like me writing articles about it. Why does it remain one of the unshakable truths of the universe, that if a woman makes the choice not to shave what her mama gave her, the human race, capable of designing video games, and building really tall buildings, and writing love letters, starts hyperventilating and cursing and spitting at the sight of any hair below the eyebrows of a woman. What the hell is wrong with people?\n\nThe answer to that question dear friends is ‘the patriarchy’. I’ll give you the short version because it’s a really nice day and I\'m getting bored of explaining that it is a very basic and very important human right that women be allowed to choose what they do with their bodies, with their minds, and yes, with their pubis. And no, women do not have a choice. If being jeered, humiliated and exposed, if being told you’re ugly over and over again, is the consequence of being hairy, that does not make a woman’s decision to remove it a choice, it makes it a necessity. If it was a choice, Madonna having a hairy armpit or two would not be news, in the same way that if we lived any sort of half way decent existence, people not wearing make up would not be news. As my friend Ellie put it: “There are quite a lot of people who don\'t wear make up. Mostly they\'re called men.”\n\nSo why then, if women’s big bare faces and furry pits are so totally natural, if they are something that shouldn’t need to be celebrated or shamed but should be allowed to just exist the way that, you know, men’s do. Why did I drop my egg mayonnaise down my dress this morning from sheer excitement when I saw the picture? Because whether I like it or not, it is a brave thing to do. Women’s bodies gross everybody out so much that even for one of the world’s most powerful women, it is a brave thing to do. For some of the fierce feminist warriors that I know, leaving the house without make up on would be a brave thing to do. I believe there is no woman living in the Western world and soon, universe, for whom it is not a brave thing to do. Shall we all just take a quick moment to meditate on that?\n\nDownload the new Indpendent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\nI don’t care if Madonna is attention seeking, not least because that’s her job. I don’t even care if she glued it on, what Madonna did is an act of resistance. Now, I know we’re all waiting for Russell Brand to say something funny so we can share the video and call it a revolution, but screw waiting. This is the revolution. Every time a girl is allowed to make real choices, rather than do what she has to, to survive, that is a revolution. Madonna’s armpit is the revolution. My armpit is the revolution. Beyoncé bringing feminism to millions of young people who otherwise might not have known about it is a revolution. Beyoncé in general is a revolution. Jennifer Lopez making valiant feminist statements to horrific music is a revolution. Men wearing make-up and singing La Isla Bonita on the harp is a revolution.\n\nMadonna has a long history of subverting gender norms, and as she disclosed in this interview, a long history of hairy armpits. She said:\n\n""Drinking beer and smoking weed in the parking lot of my high school was not my idea of being rebellious, because that\'s what everybody did. And I never wanted to do what everybody did. I thought it was cooler to not shave my legs or under my arms. I mean, why did God give us hair there anyways? Why didn\'t guys have to shave there? Why was it accepted in Europe but not in America? No one could answer my questions in a satisfactory manner, so I pushed the envelope even further… But it was hard and it was lonely, and I had to dare myself every day to keep going… And I wondered if it was all worth it, but then I would pull myself together and look at a postcard of Frida Kahlo taped to my wall, and the sight of her mustache consoled me.""\n\nThe issue of body hair is consistently dismissed as something feminists should be over. It will never be over because that girl that Madonna describes will always exist. That girl who wants to be allowed to be herself. I bet that picture is going up on some bedroom walls tonight.', 'Because whether I like it or not, it is a brave thing to do.\nWomen’s bodies gross everybody out so much that even for one of the world’s most powerful women, it is a brave thing to do.\nFor some of the fierce feminist warriors that I know, leaving the house without make up on would be a brave thing to do.\nI believe there is no woman living in the Western world and soon, universe, for whom it is not a brave thing to do.\nMadonna’s armpit is the revolution.']"

In order to stay current, stars now need to have the social media savvy of a young Mark Zuckerberg in order to compete for headlines, YouTube views, and concert sales. Celebrities like Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, and Justin Bieber have clearly internalized the importance of the sensationalist selfie, posing with blunts, booze, and even nearly nude. But refusing to Instagram even a single boring shot comes at a price, as these stars have to consistently up their selfie game in order to garner likes and hold our attention.\n\nTo create a truly newsworthy selfie demands a break with convention—to boldly selfie where no celeb has selfie’d before. This week, Madonna beat the kids at their own game, effortlessly raising the bar of social media sensationalism. Madonna’s selfie features the pop icon in a black bra and bow tie, raising her arm to reveal a thick patch of armpit hair. The image is captioned “Long hair...... Don't Care!!!!!! #artforfreedom #rebelheart #revolutionoflove.”\n\nThe artificial policing of female body hair has long been considered a feminist issue. After all, body hair is natural—a whole lot more natural than grown women who have been waxed to look like Barbie dolls. Images from porn, advertising, and celebrity culture all teach us that body hair just isn’t sexy. A picture of a glamorous woman like Madonna sporting a swathe of pit fuzz is more than just a shock to the system—it’s a deliberate challenge to an artificial standard of beauty. The language that Madonna uses in her caption shows that she is tapping into this feminist movement— her invocation of revolution, rebellion, and freedom makes it clear that she didn’t just accidentally skip her morning shave. But the issue of whether Madonna is truly advocating for women’s liberation or merely courting a TMZ headline is, for lack of a better term, hairy.\n\nMadonna isn’t the only celebrity currently campaigning for a return to the au naturel. Recently, Cameron Diaz announced that she believes that body hair, and pubic hair in particular, is there for a reason. Diaz thinks that agreeing to be waxed, shaved, or trimmed is like saying “I don’t need my nose.”\n\nDiaz and Madonna are both making sane, exciting points about female body hair, arguments that are all the more compelling and intriguing when voiced by traditionally beautiful celebrities. However, it’s hard to believe that they organically came upon these beliefs through media scrutiny, self-reflection, or by auditing an Intro Women’s and Gender Studies seminar. It’s more likely that they’re tapping into a trendy, pro-body hair cultural movement. This year, American Apparel debuted merkin-sporting mannequins in their New York store windows, in a stated exploration of different forms of feminine beauty. Additionally, Gaby Hoffmann showed off a natural below the belt look during her multi-episode arc on the super trendy Girls. And where Bushwick goes, hipster-point hungry celebrities inevitably follow.\n\nAll of these anti-depilatory developments have contributed to a cultural climate in which female body hair is actually becoming sort of cool. But its important to remember that natural topiary hasn’t always been so on trend. As The Guardian noted, Cameron Diaz was telling adorable anecdotes about forcibly grooming a hairy friend just under a year ago. Similarly, Madonna has spent her entire career capitalizing on her sexuality—and she’s never shown off her hairy armpits before. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily make Madonna and Diaz hypocrites. People’s opinions can obviously change and evolve; still, it’s easy to interpret Madonna’s selfie as an effort to garner social media attention through breaking the standard beauty mold, while simultaneously attempting to cash in on a feminist movement that’s clearly hitting its stride. It’s hard to say if Madonna’s selfie is a true call for body positivity, or simply the grown-up version of Miley sticking out her tongue and po sing with a sex toy."", 'To create a truly newsworthy selfie demands a break with convention—to boldly selfie where no celeb has selfie’d before.\nThis week, Madonna beat the kids at their own game, effortlessly raising the bar of social media sensationalism.\n#artforfreedom #rebelheart #revolutionoflove.”The artificial policing of female body hair has long been considered a feminist issue.\nImages from porn, advertising, and celebrity culture all teach us that body hair just isn’t sexy.\nAll of these anti-depilatory developments have contributed to a cultural climate in which female body hair is actually becoming sort of cool.']"

The over the top (yet utterly chic) teen sitcom swept the world and we grew to love and hate Serena van der Woodsen and her flowy blonde locks, broody Chuck Bass and of course, ice queen Blair Waldorf. However it turns out that the show could have gone very differently, as Leighton Meester nearly lost out on Queen B because of her blonde locks.\n\nIn an anniversary profile with Vanity Fair, the cast and crew came together to reflect on their fictional lives in the Upper East Side. The topic of their first auditions came up as well and surprisingly, Leighton actually auditioned first for Serena – not Blair.\n\nAfter reading for Blair during her audition, she felt an instant connection with the character and the showrunners fell in love with her. There was an issue though: her hair was a very Serena van der Woodsen blonde.\n\nJosh said, ‘[Leighton] came in and she was really funny, and really smart and played vulnerable. But there was one problem: she was blonde. And Blake was blonde, obviously; Serena had to be blonde. So, [Leighton] went to the sink and dyed her hair. She wanted it.’\n\nIn real life, Leighton’s probably the furthest thing from Blair Waldorf. She’s more reserved, had a much less glamorous childhood (her mother was imprisoned for drug smuggling, for example) and is now married to Adam Brody of Seth Cohen fame – somebody Blair wouldn’t have even given the time of day. Another Gossip Girl cast member had reservations that she could really step into Waldorf’s heels.\n\nChace Crawford reflected on meeting Leighton and said his initial thought was, ‘I just don’t see her as Blair Waldorf. I can’t see it.’\n\nIt wasn’t long before she snapped on a headband and turned around ‘slyly in her chair’ that he was totally swept away. He said, ‘I just remember thinking, ‘That girl can act. She’s the perfect girl for this.’’\n\nOther surprising tidbits from the interview included the fact that Blake Lively nearly turned the role of Serena down, since she initially wanted to continue her studies at Columbia University. She eventually took the role when the Gossip Girl team allowed her to go one day a week, but as the show became a cultural phenomenon and demanded more from her, she wound up dropping out.\n\nAnd as for the burning question on everybody’s lips: will there be a reboot any time soon? Well, everybody played pretty coy about it. Josh and his fellow show runner Stephanie Savage revealed that they had considered making a film, but that it hadn’t gone anywhere.\n\nHowever, the author of Gossip Girl Cecily Von Ziegesar had other ideas. She admitted to hoping they’d go completely off the wall with a slasher flick version of the series, where Serena returns from boarding school as a serial killer. You know what, we’d totally be down for that."", ""Blondes don't have more fun apparentlyNow here’s something to make you feel old – it’s officially been a decade since Gossip Girl aired.\nThe topic of their first auditions came up as well and surprisingly, Leighton actually auditioned first for Serena – not Blair.\nJosh said, ‘[Leighton] came in and she was really funny, and really smart and played vulnerable.\nShe wanted it.’In real life, Leighton’s probably the furthest thing from Blair Waldorf.\nChace Crawford reflected on meeting Leighton and said his initial thought was, ‘I just don’t see her as Blair Waldorf.""]"

Who is with me???”\n\nApparently many readers were just as displeased as Gellar with the choice, as evidenced across social media. The Vogue official Facebook page has racked up 747 comments as of time of this posting — the majority of which are critical of the editor’s decision to feature Kardashian and West on the cover.\n\nSee photo: James Franco and Seth Rogen Spoof Kanye and Kim Kardashian’s Vogue Cover\n\nSo why are so many people upset with Vogue and its editor? West is a record-breaking music artist, who though is considered controversial for moments such as charging the stage to denounce Taylor Swift‘s MTV VMAs win and for referring to himself as a “genius” during his infamous beef with Jimmy Kimmel, one could argue (and some are) that West has just as much right to a Vogue cover as past cover subjects.\n\nThe harsh criticism across the web seems to be derived mostly over the feeling that Kardashian is merely “famous for being famous,” and hasn’t earned the coveted crowning achievement bestowed by Wintour. Kardashian, who stars on E! reality show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” first rose to fame when a sex tape featuring her and R&B artist Ray J leaked on the Internet.\n\nTraditionally, scoring a Vogue cover has been a feat reserved for and accomplished by Hollywood A-listers, award-winning directors or producers and top fashion industry figures.\n\nSee video: Bill O’Reilly Demands Jay-Z, Kanye West To ‘Knock It Off’\n\nTheWrap pulled a sampling of just some of the comments from fans on Vogue’s Facebook Wall:\n\n“We all knew Vogue was dying, but this is it. The official death of Vogue,” wrote reader Freya Greaves.\n\nJasmine W said: “Well it’s official you don’t need to have an actual respectable talent to be on the cover. You just have to be able to take a dick or be one. And in this case…. Well I don’t think I need to elaborate.”\n\nMichelle A. Morgan added: “Lupita won an Oscar and Kim Kardashian is on the … I can’t even bring myself to say it.”\n\nAlso read: Lena Dunham Rips Jezebel for Publishing Her Un-Retouched Vogue Photos: ‘That Was Messed Up’\n\nThe angry opinions just go on and on from there. Of course the spoofs came as well, first a Muppets one, with Kermit embracing Miss Piggy, then Seth Rogen and James Franco — the duo that also brilliantly remade West’s music video for “Bound 2” — got in on the action.\n\nVogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour penned an editor’s letter defending the decision and preemptively explaining that West did not coerce the magazine into the cover shoot.\n\n“Kanye is an amazing performer and cultural provocateur, while Kim, through her strength of character, has created a place for herself in the glare of the world’s spotlight, and it takes real guts to do that,” Wintour wrote. “I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T.

Issue should come with barf bag. — Nikki Finke (@NikkiFinke) March 21, 2014\n\nA Buzzfeed correspondent also weighed in, not too favorably.\n\nI’m gonna buy the Kanye and Kim Vogue issue just so I can burn it. — Matt Bellassai (@MattBellassai) March 21, 2014\n\nWell, it’s a sale, anyway.\n\nAnother Twitter user wondered how Kardashian’s onetime mentor and pal Paris Hilton might have reacted, seeing as how she never got her own Vogue cover.\n\nIf you think you’re upset about Kim K’s Vogue cover imagine how Paris Hilton feels! “That big butt girl used to arrange my closet” — bevysmith (@bevysmith) March 21, 2014\n\nOne fashion blogger wondered cryptically about the “broader implications” of Vogue editor Anna Wintour, reportedly a friend of Kanye West, choosing to give a cover to “Kimye.”\n\nTo everyone saying this cover doesn’t have broader implications, do some research. #Vogue — THE FASHION LAW (@TheFashionLaw) March 21, 2014\n\nIt was unclear that that blogger meant, but it could be a reference to the fact that there is actually an interracial couple on the cover of Vogue. The last time an African-American man appeared on the Vogue cover was 2008, when NBA star LeBron James appeared with his arm around model Gisele Bundchen — but that cover was widely criticized for making LeBron and by extension, black men in general, look like “King Kong,” exploiting a racially derogatory stereotype.\n\nThe same can’t be said of Kanye West’s appearance on the Vogue cover with his soon-to-be wife Kim Kardashian. If the picture were not on the cover of Vogue it would hardly be controversial or even provocative — except to people with ugly racial prejudices who are, sadly, offended by depictions of interracial relationships.\n\nVogue cover featuring Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nPerhaps the best comment on the entire Vogue affair, however, came from James Franco and Seth Rogen. The Pineapple Express and Freaks and Geeks co-stars earlier parodied Kanye West’s “Bound 2” video, which featured a nude Kim Kardashian appearing to simulate sex on a motorcycle.\n\nBut Franco and Rogen can’t stop making fun of the “Kimye” couple. Here is their tongue-in-cheek take on the new and weirdly controversial Vogue cover. Enjoy!', 'Hollywood blogger Nikki Finke, who never seems to be in a good mood, declared that the Kim Kardashian — Kanye West Vogue issue should “come with a barf bag.”I’m loving the big backlash aimed at Anna Wintour for putting Kim Kardashian on Vogue cover.\nI’m gonna buy the Kanye and Kim Vogue issue just so I can burn it.\nThe same can’t be said of Kanye West’s appearance on the Vogue cover with his soon-to-be wife Kim Kardashian.\nVogue cover featuring Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\nHere is their tongue-in-cheek take on the new and weirdly controversial Vogue cover.']"

Money she earns from Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the Kardashian clothing line, and promotional appearances, will be considered her separate and sole income.""\n\nOf course, this differs from a number of other reports we\'ve seen. This includes the New York Daily News, who recently spoke to Raoul Felder.\n\nMr. Felder has managed a number of high-profile divorces, including Martin Scorsese and former mayor, Rudy Giuliani.

The rich (yes), handsome (questionable) prince. And now it turns out she has a fairy godmother too. And it’s only Anna bloody Wintour. Lucky girl.\n\nAnna W has just granted Kimmy’s wish by putting her smug mug (and Kanye’s grumpy mug) on the cover of fashion bible Vogue. And hasn’t it kicked up a right old storm?\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar has said she’s cancelling her subscription. Countless other fashion bloggers and Vogue readers have taken to Twitter to say how gobsmacked they are that a REALITY STAR, and not just that, a reality star with a SEX TAPE knocking around in cyberspace, on the cover.\n\nIt’s true that Vogue has a reputation of starring only, how do I put this politely, more high-end stars on the cover. You know, the supermodels, the A-List actresses, and beautiful women of the music world and stars who are big names in the fashion industry. And it’s true that Kim doesn’t exactly fit into any of these groups.\n\n(Image: Splash)\n\nShe’s an over exposed star of trashy TV with a family that seem hell-bent on being in the public eye at ALL COSTS. Kim’s no stranger to being on the cover of magazines, but it’s pretty much always through a long-lens accompanied by a caption along the lines of ‘Kim’s post-baby beach body panic’ – or something. She’s beautiful, but she’s no supermodel. She loves her clothes but I’m not sure she could be called fashion forward. You could certainly never call her A-List.\n\nBut is it really that bad? I don’t think so. SMG’s reaction probably shocked me more than the cover. Critics have hit out saying that Vogue has become another trash magazine by featuring Kimye. But have a look at the picture, she looks beautiful and classy. And it’s also really nice to see a woman with the body of a woman and not an 11-year-old boy on the cover of Vogue.\n\n(Image: 2014 Getty Images)\n\nLike it or not, Kim is one of, if not THE, most photographed women in the world right now. She has a wedding coming up that the world will be watching and talking about. Designers are scrapping over who is going to design her wedding gown, which will be photographed again and again and again. The whole Vogue feature is pretty much a showcase of beautiful gowns. The wedding is set to be the wedding of the year, countless stars will be there, swathed in designer threads. There will be features about what the bride is wearing, what the bridesmaids are wearing, what the guests are wearing. The wedding will be a fashion event as much as any awards ceremony is. So it’s not really that surprising to see her on the cover of a fashion mag.\n\nIt doesn’t spell the end of civilisation. It doesn’t mark the downfall of Vogue. It’s just a decision. And a pretty savvy one, look at the amount of publicity it’s got already. And for those of you, who really can’t stand Kim K, don’t worry. She’ll probably turn into a pumpkin at some point soon.\n\n#Vogue', 'Anna W has just granted Kimmy’s wish by putting her smug mug (and Kanye’s grumpy mug) on the cover of fashion bible Vogue.\nIt’s true that Vogue has a reputation of starring only, how do I put this politely, more high-end stars on the cover.\nAnd it’s also really nice to see a woman with the body of a woman and not an 11-year-old boy on the cover of Vogue.\nThere will be features about what the bride is wearing, what the bridesmaids are wearing, what the guests are wearing.\nSo it’s not really that surprising to see her on the cover of a fashion mag.']"

I can\'t even breath!\' [sic]"".\n\nReuters HAPPY KIM: The Vogue cover was a long-held dream for Kim Kardashian.\n\nHowever, actress Sarah Michelle Gellar took to Twitter share her disappointment over editor Anna Wintour\'s cover selection.\n\n""Well......I guess I\'m canceling my Vogue subscription. Who is with me???"" she wrote.\n\nKim\'s best friend Jonathan Cheban stepped up in Kim\'s defence shortly after, writing Sarah a retaliatory message.\n\n""Do u matter?"" he mused while retweeting what the former Buffy the Vampire Slayer star said.\n\nIt was rumoured Kanye had been pleading with his friend Anna to place his Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star fiancee on the cover of Vogue for several months.\n\nSpeculation was rife the editor-and-chief resisted the Yeezus musician\'s request, but in a statement 64-year-old Anna claimed she didn\'t hesitate to feature the couple.\n\n""As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancee on Vogue\'s cover. He did nothing of the sort,"" she wrote.\n\n""The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn\'t true.""\n\nShe went on to explain why the couple earned their spot on the publication\'s cover.\n\n""Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it,"" Anna said.\n\nMORE WEDDING DETAILS\n\nMeanwhile, Beyoncé Knowles has reportedly said that ""under no circumstances"" will she be filmed at Kanye West\'s wedding.\n\nThe hip-hop artist is marrying reality TV star Kim Kardashian in Paris on May 24. There are varied reports about whether the nuptials will be caught on camera for Kim\'s show Keeping Up with the Kardashians. While Kim is generally happy to be filmed, Kanye is known to be more private - although he did allow his proposal to be shot for the series.\n\nKanye is close friends with Jay Z and his wife Beyoncé, who is apparently unhappy with the idea of appearing on the small screen show.\n\n""[She has said that] under no circumstances will she be a part of any filming on the wedding day if it\'s for Kim\'s reality show,"" an insider claimed to RadarOnline.\n\n""Jay and Beyoncé\'s wedding was shrouded in secrecy and extreme lengths were made to make sure their wedding was an intimate affair for friends and family, only. This will be the complete opposite.""\n\nJay and Kanye have been close for years and even released a joint album called Watch the Throne in 2011, which they promoted on tour together.\n\nIt\'s been claimed Kanye and Kim are planning to ask their wedding guests to sign no-disclosure agreements and won\'t allow cell phones during the nuptials. Their superstar-couple pals will likely not be included in that though.\n\nThe details of the nuptials are not known at the moment, although Kim has previously hinted the wedding will be far from the flashy day many are expecting.\n\n""We\'re having a super, super small, intimate wedding,"" she explained. ""As we go along, we\'re realising we want it to be smaller and more intimate than people are imagining and thinking.""\n\nKim tied the knot with Kris Humphries in front of 500 people in 2011. The marriage featured on Keeping Up with the Kardashians and was criticised, as the big day cost millions, with Kim filing for divorce after 72 days.', ""FINALLY: Kim Kardashian's Vogue US cover has finally happened.\nKim Kardashian has finally achieved her high fashion dream: appearing on the cover of Vogue.\nReuters HAPPY KIM: The Vogue cover was a long-held dream for Kim Kardashian.\nHowever, actress Sarah Michelle Gellar took to Twitter share her disappointment over editor Anna Wintour's cover selection.\nThe hip-hop artist is marrying reality TV star Kim Kardashian in Paris on May 24.""]"

She’s got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday.”\n\nNone other than Kanye West, the loudest—and most innovative—voice in hip-hop, made this proclamation to Ryan Seacrest in an interview late last year.\n\nWest finally got his wish.\n\nThe couple will grace the cover of Vogue’s April issue. Shot by famed photographer Annie Leibovitz, the image resembles a mock wedding photo, with Kardashian in a cream-colored wedding gown flanked by West in a blue suit, and is accompanied by the headline: “KIM & KANYE: Their fashionable life and surreal times” as well as the lengthy hashtag “#WORLDSMOSTTALKEDABOUTCOUPLE”—an apparent nod to West’s viral disclaimer that he tapped out amid his mini-feud with late night host Jimmy Kimmel: #NODISRESPECTTOBENAFFLECK.\n\nKardashian was elated by the news.\n\nAnd understandably so. There had been rumors flying for years that Vogue editrix Anna Wintour had it out for Kardashian. New York magazine reported that the reality star-entrepreneur had been banned for years from the Wintour-curated Met Gala, one of the biggest events of the fashion season that attracts every A-lister imaginable. Kardashian finally attended the mega-event last year, accompanied by West, but was conveniently cropped out of Vogue’s Best Dressed gallery. And just last March, a vicious rumor was reported by various publications that Wintour had labeled the reality star-entrepreneur “the worst thing since socks and sandals.”\n\nIn May, Us Weekly reported that West and Kardashian dined with Wintour at her New York City home—just months before the hip-hop impresario proposed to her at San Francisco’s AT&T Park while a 50-person orchestra played Lana Del Rey’s sultry ballad “Young and Beautiful.”\n\nAny rumored beef between fashion’s gatekeeper and the superstar couple has been quashed, according to Wintour’s letter from the editor in the issue.\n\n“Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it. I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T. (Or perhaps that should be to a K?),” she wrote.\n\n“As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on Vogue‘s cover. He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true.”\n\nThere were, nonetheless, hordes of detractors—including Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s Sarah Michelle Gellar, of all people—who took to Twitter to voice their disapproval over the Kimye cover.\n\nSeems a bit precious. Vogue has, after all, previously featured The Spice Girls, Britney Spears, Sienna Miller, and more on its covers, and has been angling towards more celebrity-driven content for ages, so why not Kimye, arguably the fourth most popular celeb couple in the country (after the Obamas, Jay Z-Beyoncé, and Jolie-Pitt)? It's no longer the highbrow mecca of fashion it once was, after all.\n\nWe’ll leave you with West’s perfect reaction to the news."", '“There’s no way Kim Kardashian shouldn’t be on the cover of Vogue, she’s like the most intriguing woman right now.\nShe’s got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday.”None other than Kanye West, the loudest—and most innovative—voice in hip-hop, made this proclamation to Ryan Seacrest in an interview late last year.\nThe couple will grace the cover of Vogue’s April issue.\nThere had been rumors flying for years that Vogue editrix Anna Wintour had it out for Kardashian.\nKardashian finally attended the mega-event last year, accompanied by West, but was conveniently cropped out of Vogue’s Best Dressed gallery.']"

Anna Wintour has not only given in to Kanye’s incessant begging (we know it was this or Anna must have owed him a big favor), but she has actually allowed words to come out of her mouth that are so asinine they’re almost painful to read. First, let’s start with the cover. It reads, “Kim & Kanye, Their Fashionable Life and Surreal Times,” with hashtag #WORLDSMOSTTALKEDABOUTCOUPLE.” We can understand “most talked about,” but perhaps it should have read “#WORLDSMOSTTALKEDABOUTCOUPLE-ANDNOTINAGOODWAY.”\n\nAnd Fashionable life?? Wait…are they actually talking about the SAME Kim that sells her trashy line on the racks of Sears? The one who cannot seem to get a piece of clothing that isn’t too long on her arms and too tight everywhere else? And Kanye? Because he pushes the envelope, that makes him the other half of the “fashionable” couple?\n\nAnna must have had something put in her cocktail upon making her decision to allow them on the cover and when praising Kim. She actually says that K & K “define the culture!” Which culture she is talking about, I am not sure. Perhaps somewhere there is a culture of desperate, angry, ignorant, self-absorbed people running around with trashy, tight clothes who are not able to spell simple words correctly. Kim tweeted about her cover, exclaiming, “I can’t breath!” Yes, and you cannot spell, either.\n\nIf the cover was not nauseating enough for you, here’s what the obviously drugged Anna Wintour said about the couple in the mag, “Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it. I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T. (Or perhaps that should be to a K?)”\n\nShe then goes on to provide a heartwarming disclaimer that she was not “begged” by Kanye for the cover but that it was all her idea. Yes, she really did say that. If that was not bad enough, she goes on, “There’s barely a strand of the modern media that the Kardashian Wests haven’t been able to master, and for good reason: Kanye is an amazing performer and cultural provocateur, while Kim, through her strength of character, has created a place for herself in the glare of the world’s spotlight, and it takes real guts to do that.”\n\nStrength of character? A flea has more character than Kim! Does Anna realize that her “favor” has already cost her several subscriptions and many, many angry Vogue readers? Likely knowing how much they are hated, K & K included daughter North in the photo shoot since she’s the only one of the three people may not completely hate. Kim and Kanye pretend to be parents in the pics. Kim was actually able to have her phone pried out of her hands long enough to hold her daughter before she began shaking and going through selfie-withdrawals.\n\nVogue fans are outraged and many have already commented that they plan to boycott the magazine, while others have already cancelled subscriptions labeling Anna a sell-out. I don’t blame them. It’s hysterical that these two would make the cover of the famed magazine. Maybe overzealous Vogue readers can do the typical Kanye boycott (remember his boycott of LV when the CEO didn’t meet with him?) and turn the tables on him for once, inciting their own boycott, this time against the magazine that placed Kanye and his trashy fiancé on the cover. We already KNOW what you think CDLers, but weigh in anyway…because we want to hear it!\n\nImage credit to FameFlynet / Vogue', 'If your eyes are not yet bleeding from looking at the April cover of Vogue Magazine featuring Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, then lucky you.\nIt reads, “Kim & Kanye, Their Fashionable Life and Surreal Times,” with hashtag #WORLDSMOSTTALKEDABOUTCOUPLE.” We can understand “most talked about,” but perhaps it should have read “#WORLDSMOSTTALKEDABOUTCOUPLE-ANDNOTINAGOODWAY.”And Fashionable life??\nShe actually says that K & K “define the culture!” Which culture she is talking about, I am not sure.\nLikely knowing how much they are hated, K & K included daughter North in the photo shoot since she’s the only one of the three people may not completely hate.\nMaybe overzealous Vogue readers can do the typical Kanye boycott (remember his boycott of LV when the CEO didn’t meet with him?)']"

Kanye has been stomping his little feet like a child in the candy section of the supermarket for some time now and, like a beleaguered mother, Anna Wintour acquiesced to his demands that his talentless, good-for-nothing fiancée be featured on the cover. Kim, never missing an opportunity to brag about assaulting the public with her face and private parts, took to twitter to tweet her excitement.\n\n“This is such a dream come true!!! Thank you @VogueMagazine for this cover! O M GGGGGG!!! I can’t even breath!” she said. I don’t remember her being this excited when she had North. Speaking of North, it appears they’re gonna drag her out for this photo op. This family is living proof that God takes care of fools and babies.\n\nHere’s the thing, if these two were in any way interesting I’d say more power to them. If this magazine sought Kimye out for their contributions to fashion, that would be one thing. But they practically begged to have the cover and only a narcissist can view that as a win. Besides, what can they possibly have to say that would be of note? Furthermore, what could they have to say that hasn’t already been said? They live in a fish bowl and they are doing so of their own volition.\n\nThere is no mystery about them whatsoever, so I doubt the article will be a page turner. Kanye may fancy himself a fashion icon/mogul but Kim does nothing but don whatever horrendous ensemble Kanye sets out for her in the morning. If that’s all it takes, then they may as well put a mall mannequin on the cover. At least the mannequin would have a better personality.\n\nI blame Kris Jenner for this. A social climber with a direct line to Satan is indeed a formidable foe. Any day now, there will be open ice skating in hell because Kanye is relentless and Kim will have the star on the walk of fame…or else. Jay Z and Beyoncé better watch out and never leave any unopened beverages around Kris; I’m sure she has a potion for winning over self righteous snobs and those two are at the top of the list. Before they know it, little Blue Ivy will be a flower girl on a very special episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and they’ll be scratching heir heads wondering how it happened.

The magazine took the idea of the much-anticipated wedding between Kardashian and West and put them on the cover in what looks like wedding attire.\n\nThe video also has her in a few different white wedding-looking gowns and West in a long black coat, in many different scenes and poses. The couple is seen walking along an abandoned highway, hugging their daughter North West, posing against a car and in a formal portrait shoot. Kardashian of course does what she can to show off her massive engagement ring during the video.\n\nKardashian and West both thanked Vogue and their fans for the opportunity on Twitter on Friday (although Kardashian was obviously more excited).\n\nThis is such a dream come true!!!

33904,http://thesource.com/2014/03/21/lay-down-your-arms-the-war-has-been-won/,entertainment,"['Today, Vogue Magazine released their latest spring issue cover, featuring Kanye West and Kim Khardashian, who sports a wedding gown referencing their approaching nuptials. This isn’t the first time that some one in hip hop was able to grace Vogue’s illustrious cover, Beyonce, Rihanna, and Diddy have had their face’s front and center on the magazine. However, this time around seems to hold a much greater significance and brings about tangible proof of something far greater. In the ever fiercely growing cultural war being waged online and in the streets, hip hop has come out, a little scarred and slightly different, the clear victor.\n\n\n\n“Hip hop glorifies violence, drug use, and misogynistic stereotypes,” can be heard from many of critics of the genre. “It will only be fad, its not going to be here in twenty years,” said almost everyone during the 70’s, 80’s, and even during the 90’s. It has been incorrectly deemed dead multiple times or said to have lost sight of the traditional roots from which it came, and therefore, just a commercialized shell of its former self. Asides for the content found in the second hypothetical quote, most of these concerns are still very much present in our beloved genre, especially the distrust of corporate interest meddling with artistic progression. However, still hip hop remains; larger than life and seemingly growing exponentially each year. It is a giant that can’t be stopped, won’t be stopped.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that hip hop was associated with almost every negative aspect of society, causing panic and fear whenever it was brought up in certain circles. There were no magazine covers, very little mainstream awareness, and apathetic interest from those outside its musical reach. However, it didn’t take too much time for some forward thinking rap fans, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to seize the moment and attempt to archive all of the happenings in this small genre. For those reason and more, The Source began, 25 years later it continues to bring you an inside look into the world of hip hop.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the field we created has become larger and larger, growing with rap music itself. There are now a plethora of publications and websites to find information on the latest hip hop news; some with editors whose parents were the championing the anti-rap flag way back when, times are definitely changing.\n\nThere is something about its raw counter cultural message that appeals to the masses, which was originally at the root of its perceived danger. As the young fans matured into full fledged adults, they brought their love of hip hop with them, slowly raising it stake in the mainstream. With shows like Yo MTV Raps and Video Music Box, an increase in the number of publications on the new stand, the rise of radio stations and record labels, millions of fans, and celebrities spring up everyday, society at large could no longer ignore the behemoth that it had ultimately become. Hip hop was everywhere and in everything.\n\nNow, it isn’t a surprise to see Jay Z on Forbes, Beyonce on GQ, and Kanye on the cover of Vogue. This isn’t an article trying to restate the obvious, but to just celebrate the victory that we have achieved. Through all of the terrible adversities, hip hop remains and is now the culture. If you look at pop culture itself right now, its hard to deny that rap music hasn’t had a huge influence. To sell things or to look cool, companies have to go through hip hop or incorporate its perspective. It doesn’t always lead to authentic uses, but its impressive that they have to try.\n\nIt is incredible, hip hop has taken over the world. No matter how conservative you are or how liberal you think you are, you still have to quote Jay Z to get bills passed. Our President quotes rap songs, and his wife feuds with Kanye. This was never supposed to happen, but it did. We got the last laugh, the counter culture has become the culture that jakes need. We get the last laugh. #Winning.', 'In the ever fiercely growing cultural war being waged online and in the streets, hip hop has come out, a little scarred and slightly different, the clear victor.\n“Hip hop glorifies violence, drug use, and misogynistic stereotypes,” can be heard from many of critics of the genre.\nHowever, still hip hop remains; larger than life and seemingly growing exponentially each year.\nSlowly, but surely, the field we created has become larger and larger, growing with rap music itself.\nAs the young fans matured into full fledged adults, they brought their love of hip hop with them, slowly raising it stake in the mainstream.']"

Her parents went on to welcome Khloe Kardashian and Robert Kardashian, Jr. before divorcing in 1991. Jenner later married Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner, with whom she had Kendall and Kylie Jenner. Robert Kardashian, an attorney who worked on the O.J. Simpson murder case, died in 2003 from esophageal cancer.\n\nKardashian first made a name for herself in the pop culture world in 2007 through her leaked sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J, with whom she filmed the explicit footage several years prior. The family, however, parlayed the attention into the E! series “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” which debuted later that year, documenting the clan’s day-to-day lives.\n\nThe series went on to spawn several spinoffs, including “Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami,” “Kourtney and Kim Take New York,” and “Kourtney and Khloe Take The Hamptons.” Kardashian soon became a magazine fixture, posing for “Playboy” and a number of other outlets, and competed on “Dancing with the Stars.” The star has also appeared in a number of other television shows and movies, including “90210,” “30 Rock,” and “Disaster Movie.”\n\nWhile Kardashian has expanded her empire to include boutiques, clothing and makeup lines, books, and the “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood” app, she remains best known for her highly publicized love life. Following a failed marriage to music producer Damon Thomas when she was 19, she wed basketball player Kris Humphries in 2010. Kardashian, however, famously filed for divorce just 72 days later, though the proceedings dragged on for more than a year.\n\nKardashian next embarked on a relationship with rapper Kanye West, and gave birth to their daughter, North, in 2013. The couple married in a lavish wedding in Florence in 2014, which was documented on “Keeping Up With The Kardashians.” In 2015, Kardashian and West welcomed their second child, a son, Saint.\n\nOn October 2, 2016, Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. Five gun-yielding men, dressed as police officers, stormed into Kardashian’s apartment and proceeded to bound and gag her, before stealing $10 million worth of jewelry. As the robbery unfolded, her husband West was performing at The Meadows Music and Arts Festival in Queens, New York. During his performance of “Heartless,” the rapper was notified of the situation and rushed off stage. Three months after the robbery, Kardashian returned to social media after a brief hiatus. The terrifying ordeal was later covered in depth on “Keeping Up With The Kardashians.”\n\nKardashian is slated to appear in “Ocean’s Eight” later this year.', 'Kim Kardashian was born in Los Angeles on October 21, 1980, the second child of Robert Kardashian and Kris Jenner, following Kourtney Kardashian.\nHer parents went on to welcome Khloe Kardashian and Robert Kardashian, Jr. before divorcing in 1991.\nJenner later married Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner, with whom she had Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\nRobert Kardashian, an attorney who worked on the O.J.\nKardashian, however, famously filed for divorce just 72 days later, though the proceedings dragged on for more than a year.']"

The opening, while less than some anticipated, launches Lionsgate\'s third franchise built on young-adult best-sellers.\n\n\n\nWith an audience 59 percent female and half under the age of 25, ""Divergent"" lured young moviegoers with dystopian drama and an upcoming star. ""Divergent,"" though, fell well short of its forerunners: ""Twilight"" opened with $69.6 million in 2008, and ""The Hunger Games"" began with $152.5 million in 2012.\n\nRichie Fay, president of domestic distribution for Lionsgate, called it ""a great beginning for another franchise for the company."" A sequel is already in the works.\n\n\n\n""The key to the success of these franchises is finding the difference and marketing it,"" said Fay. ""It’s not easy. And I think we’re doing it better than anyone else right now, frankly.""\n\n\n\nIn the rush to adapt popular young-adult fiction, Lionsgate has succeeded where many others have floundered. ""Divergent,"" made with a budget of $85 million from Veronica Roth’s best-sellers, follows less stellar results from youth-focused films like ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,"" ’’Vampire Academy"" and ""Beautiful Creatures.""\n\n\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak, calls the ""Divergent"" debut a ""three-peat"" for Lionsgate in a challenging genre that defies ""cookie-cutter, assembly line"" development.\n\n\n\n""They make it look easy,"" says Dergarabedian. ""You’re chasing probably the most fickle audience in the world. They can change their minds on what’s cool in the blink of an eye.""\n\nDisney’s Muppets sequel ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" with Ricky Gervais and Tina Fey, fared poorly, earning just $16.5 million over the weekend. ""The Muppets,"" opened notably better with $29.2 million in 2011, benefiting from the high-profile reboot starring and co-written by Jason Segal.\n\n\n\nDave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney, acknowledged the result was disappointing and somewhat ""head-scratching"" considering advance tracking had suggested ""Muppets Most Wanted"" would draw bigger crowds.\n\n\n\n""There certainly was something in the last Muppets - not having anything available for fans for a while - that satisfied pent up demand that we didn’t have the benefit of this time around,"" Hollis said.\n\n\n\nThe family film market was also more competitive than expected, as 20th Century Fox’s animated ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" has held better than anticipated. In its third week of release, the film - tops at the box office last weekend - slid to third with $11.7 million.\n\n\n\nStudios often seek out late March release dates for family-friendly movies to benefit from spring break vacations. So ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" made for $50 million, could still eke out more at the box office.\n\n\n\nThe surprise of the weekend was the strong performance of the independently released ""God’s Not Dead,"" made to appeal specifically to faith-based audiences. It came in fifth with $8.6 million, despite playing on just 780 screens.\n\n\n\nThe performance of ""God’s Not Dead"" further proves the strong faith-based market for movies, one historically underserved before the runaway success of Mel Gibson’s ""The Passion of the Christ.""\n\n\n\nNext week, Paramount Pictures’ ""Noah,"" directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Russell Crowe, will attempt to cross over to mainstream audiences with a Bible tale. Opening early in Mexico and South Korean, ""Noah"" got off to a strong start overseas, earning $14 million.\n\n\n\nExpanding from 66 to 304 screens, Wes Anderson’s European caper ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" continued to pack theaters in limited release. It earned $6.5 million in its third week of release, with further expansion planned.\n\n\n\nAnd though the crowd-funding of the big-screen edition of cult TV show ""Veronica Mars"" drew much publicity for its successful Kickstarter campaign, the movie has proved only of interest to devoted fans. On 347 screens, it made just $144,000 for Warner Bros., bringing its two-week total to $2.9 million.\n\n\n\n___\n\n\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n\n\n1. ""Divergent,"" $56 million.\n\n\n\n2.

So far, the film’s early overseas bow is significantly ahead of the comparable openings of other such tentpoles as “Gravity” and “Skyfall,” though the controversial film has yet to prove itself domestically where it bows next weekend.\n\nThe weekend’s domestic box office, boosted by stellar Imax and premium large-format perfs for “Divergent,” kept totals ahead of this time last year, when “The Croods” earned $43 million in three days.\n\nFox-DreamWorks Animation’s “Mr. Peabody & Sherman” helped the B.O. stay afloat, grossing $11.7 million in its third frame, for a domestic cume of $81 million. The toon’s stable perf likely drew away some family auds from “Muppets,” which saw the majority of its opening come from parents and kids. (Overwhelmingly, families represented the film’s largest demographic, at 71%.)\n\nMeanwhile, “Divergent” skewed 59% female, with an even split among auds over and under 25. Surprisingly, though, only about half of the film’s opening audience said they had read the book vs. the first installments for “Twilight” and “The Hunger Games,” of which each film adaptation saw more than 70% it’s debut come from filmgoers who had read the book.\n\nLionsgate will begin production on the second installment “Insurgent” in May, with a planned March 20, 2015, release date.\n\nIn an aggressive limited debut at 780 engagements, Freestyle Releasing’s faith-based film “God’s Not Dead” grossed a stellar estimated $8.6 million, averaging $10,973 per screen.

36214,http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/weekend-box-office-divergent-1-muppets-2-opens-weak-gods-dead-surprises/,entertainment,"['I’m not even sure the biggest story of the weekend is Divergent seeming to prove it’s the first young adult franchise since The Hunger Games to prove profitable, though the “A” CinemaScore certainly has me questioning the intelligence of today’s movie going audience once again. Instead it would seem the biggest surprise is God’s Not Dead coming out of nowhere with $9.2 million and a third place finish. I hadn’t even heard of the film until Saturday morning. Goes to show how much I’m paying attention to the faith-based movie market.\n\nIt’s probably best just to begin at the top and with Divergent, which brought in $54.6 million from 3,936 theaters. With an $85 million budget it still has some work to do and I’m really curious to see how it does overseas where it will open in the UK, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Mexico and Finland on April 4, and there are some things to consider when comparing this to Twilight or even Hunger Games.\n\nThe first Twilight cost only $37 million to make and brought in $69.6 million on its opening weekend. The first The Hunger Games did cost more at $78 million, but it brought in $152.5 million on its opening weekend. While Divergent‘s opening looks pretty good, it didn’t exceed expectations and it definitely didn’t bring in any kind of a new audience considering how bad it actually is. So… success? One thing we know is we can definitely expect Insurgent (production begins in May for March 20, 2015 release) and Allegiant, but will the sequels show any box office growth?\n\nThe demographic numbers are interesting when considering that question when you see audiences under the age of 18 gave the movie an “A+” CinemaScore, the gender split is no surprise at 59% female, the age breakdown was 50/50 over and under 25 and only 50% of Divergent‘s audience had read the book compared to 74% for Twilight and 76% for The Hunger Games. It’s that last stat that’s most interesting. Does this merely prove the book wasn’t as popular or those that read the book didn’t want to go see it?\n\nIn second was Muppets Most Wanted opened well below tracking where it was expected to generate a three day weekend in the low-to-mid $20s. Instead, a $17 million opening seems to suggest many were like me and just weren’t that interested in what appeared to be a sequel that seemed like something the studio felt “should” be made rather than the approach of wanting to be made such as the first one, which opened 42% higher at $29.2 million. The “B+” CinemaScore suggests about the same thing as well given audience penchant to inflate their grades.\n\nFourth is where you find God’s Not Dead, which opened in only 780 theaters and managed $9.2 million, which is stronger than 2008’s Kirk Cameron-led Fireproof, which went on to make $33.4 million on a budget of only $500,000. I don’t have any budgetary figures for this one, but I don’t think Kevin Sorbo has a very high asking price.\n\nAnd Wes Anderson‘s The Grand Budapest Hotel proves the director has another hit on his hands as it expanded into 304 theaters where it grossed $6.7 million for a $22,204 per theater average. It still has a ways to go before it tops Anderson’s highest grossing domestic release, The Royal Tenenbaums at $52.6 million, but it still has a lot more theaters to open in as well.\n\nIn other news, Veronica Mars: The Movie didn’t prove to have much of a shelf life, dropping 75% in its second weekend to $468,175. While this doesn’t take into account digital sales or upcoming DVD and Blu-ray sales (it hits store on May 6), this still means it’s likely to fall more than $2 million short of the $5.7 million it raised on Kickstarter. But hey, fans got their movie.\n\nNext weekend sees the release of Noah and Sabotage in wide release, both of which I won’t be seeing until a week later due to scheduling difficulties, but I’m very interested in seeing both, but how will they perform?', 'Instead it would seem the biggest surprise is God’s Not Dead coming out of nowhere with $9.2 million and a third place finish.\nIt’s probably best just to begin at the top and with Divergent, which brought in $54.6 million from 3,936 theaters.\nThe first Twilight cost only $37 million to make and brought in $69.6 million on its opening weekend.\nThe first The Hunger Games did cost more at $78 million, but it brought in $152.5 million on its opening weekend.\nIn other news, Veronica Mars: The Movie didn’t prove to have much of a shelf life, dropping 75% in its second weekend to $468,175.']"

(Publicity photo)\n\n2 out of 4 stars\n\nFirst it was Twilight, then The Hunger Games.\n\nNow it’s Divergent, the latest bestseller Summit-Lionsgate is banking on to become the next book franchise-turned-blockbuster.\n\nDirector Neil Berger takes the first of Veronica Roth’s three-book series and turns it into a 140- minute primer for the series’ next two books – Insurgent and Allegiant – that will hit the big screen sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you haven’t read the book: The story centers on Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley), who like all 16 year olds in the futuristic, war-torn city of Chicago, is required by law to make the biggest decision of her life on Choosing Day.\n\nChicago is divided into five separated factions based on virtues — Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (intelligent), Dauntless (brave), Candor (honest) and Amity (peaceful).\n\nTris was born into Abnegation, but that doesn’t matter. The government tests each teen to determine where they’d fit best, but it’s an individual’s choice of which faction they join.\n\n(Click here for a test to see which faction would be your best fit.)\n\nBut once a choice it made, it’s final. Could you imagine if, as a parent, your kids choose different factions and you rarely — if ever — see each other again since each faction resides in a different part of the city?\n\nIt certainly makes for great cinema, as one faction cheers its newest arrival while another one mourns its loss.\n\nTris, however, has a problem: The test shows she has Abnegation, Erudite and Dauntless qualities, making her a “Divergent,” who are marked for death because in this town, those who don’t conform to a faction may as well be the devil in the government’s eyes.\n\nBut since Tris’ test results are erased, she chooses Dauntless, the city’s police force.\n\nShe seems overmatched in a recruiting class where the weakest are deemed “factionless” and discarded into a group of homeless scavengers, shunned by nearly everyone.\n\nWoodley, who made a name for herself starring opposite George Clooney in 2011’s The Descendents, tries to carry the film, but she’s simply not strong enough to carry so many mediocre characters who aren’t developed. Her character develops a crush on Four (Theo James), who is tasked with molding Dauntless’ newest members into shape, but you’re left wanting to see where the relationship goes. But that’s what sequels are for.\n\nKate Winslet plays Jeanine Matthews, an Erudite plotting to drug the Dauntless into giving her faction control of the city’s Abnegation-run government. Winslet simply isn’t in enough scenes to make the audience hate her, which is the film’s biggest flaw. It’s hard to fall in love with the hero if you don’t despise the bad guy.\n\nJohn McClane has Hans Gruber in Die Hard, Rocky has Ivan Drago in Rocky IV, Clarice Starling has Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs and Batman has the Joker, as one doesn’t shine without the other.\n\nTris has nobody. Berger does a great job transforming her from a weak member of Abnegation to a knife-throwing member of Dauntless, even though she’d still get her butt kicked by The Hunger Games’ Katniss Everdeen.\n\nDivergent mirrors The Hunger Games in many ways, which is good since both books were massively popular and fans will want to watch the movie versions. But books also have niche audiences, especially ones targeted to young adults, which is Roth’s core audience.\n\nIf you loved The Hunger Games, chances are you will like, not love, Divergent. But if you haven’t read the book, you may want to think twice before spending $12 for a ticket, as a matinee may be a better choice.\n\nEither way, at least for the sake of franchise, let’s hope its future is better than its present.\n\n\n\n', '(Publicity photo)2 out of 4 starsFirst it was Twilight, then The Hunger Games.\nNow it’s Divergent, the latest bestseller Summit-Lionsgate is banking on to become the next book franchise-turned-blockbuster.\nChicago is divided into five separated factions based on virtues — Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (intelligent), Dauntless (brave), Candor (honest) and Amity (peaceful).\nDivergent mirrors The Hunger Games in many ways, which is good since both books were massively popular and fans will want to watch the movie versions.\nIf you loved The Hunger Games, chances are you will like, not love, Divergent.']"

After a string of young-adult novel adaptations that has included some big hits along with many big misses, there was curiosity as to whether “Divergent” would be the next “Hunger Games” or the next “Mortal Instruments.”\n\n“Divergent” solidly met expectations without exceeding them. By comparison, the first “Hunger Games” film opened at more than $152 million in March 2012, and the sequel, “Catching Fire,” opened in November 2013 to $158 million and went on to be the top film at the box office last year.\n\nPHOTOS: Imax poster and 50+ images from ‘Divergent’\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is a great start to another franchise,” said Richard Fay, president of domestic distribution at Lionsgate, which released “Divergent.” “We’ve got a lot of runway ahead of us.”\n\nA sequel to “Divergent,” titled “Insurgent,” is scheduled to begin filming in May and will be released next March.\n\nIn second place this weekend was “Muppets Most Wanted,” which took in an estimated $16.5 million -- far short of when “The Muppets” relaunched the venerable series on Thanksgiving weekend in 2011 to the tune of $29 million. James Bobin directed both films, but “Most Wanted” featured new lead actors in Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais.\n\n“Overall it’s a little disappointing,” said Dave Hollis, president of global theatrical distribution at Disney. While noting that tracking had “Most Wanted” opening at more than $20 million, he added that the film is “an asset of the company across many lines of business.” He said it “will likely hit $100 million or more worldwide on a budget of $54 million” and has “a lot of business left to do.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the weekend was “God’s Not Dead,” coming in at No. 5 with an estimated gross of about $8.5 million on just 780 screens. The faith-based film, about a college student defending his beliefs against a professor, features Kevin Sorbo, Dean Cain, Willie and Korie Robertson from the “Duck Dynasty” television show as themselves, and the popular Christian rock group Newsboys.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 19 midnight box-office records\n\n“We knew the possibility was there,” said David A. R. White, a producer as well as star on the film and also a partner in the faith-based film studio Pure Flix. White noted that interest in the film had been building since a trailer was released online last fall, stoked by screenings for some 8,000 pastors across the country.\n\nThe film will likely expand to at least 1,000 screens next weekend, he said.\n\n“A lot of the message that we send is that when you go out and buy a ticket, you’re casting your vote as to the type of entertainment you want to see on a regular basis,” White said. He added that Pure Flix does not see its relationship to mainstream Hollywood as adversarial but rather simply “letting the audience decide if they want more of this, and they clearly do.”\n\nThe big-budget biblical epic “Noah” will be opening in the U.S. next weekend and got a jumpstart in Mexico and Korea this weekend. The film brought in $14 million in these early releases.\n\nAlso noteworthy in the U.S. top 10: “Need for Speed” fell 56% to finish sixth at the box office, with about $7.8 million; and “The Grand Budapest Hotel” climbed to seventh, with $7 million in its continued rollout.\n\n\n\nALSO:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘Divergent’ scores at box office; ‘Muppets’ disappoints\n\n‘Divergent’ conforms to the young adult playbook, reviews say\n\nThe religious drama ‘God’s Not Dead’ surprised at the box office.\n\nFollow Mark Olsen on Twitter: @IndieFocus', 'Directed by Neil Burger and starring Shailene Woodley, “Divergent” tells the story of a young woman fighting for freedom and survival in a dystopian society.\nIn second place this weekend was “Muppets Most Wanted,” which took in an estimated $16.5 million -- far short of when “The Muppets” relaunched the venerable series on Thanksgiving weekend in 2011 to the tune of $29 million.\nJames Bobin directed both films, but “Most Wanted” featured new lead actors in Tina Fey and Ricky Gervais.\nThe film will likely expand to at least 1,000 screens next weekend, he said.\nALSO:Advertisement‘Divergent’ scores at box office; ‘Muppets’ disappoints‘Divergent’ conforms to the young adult playbook, reviews sayThe religious drama ‘God’s Not Dead’ surprised at the box office.']"

While the inevitable comparisons to Twilight and The Hunger Games are apt considering Divergent is another hopeful YA franchise-starter, the film's success proves that a lot more is required (strong cast, proven director, etc.) of these first films beyond the source material.\n\nWhile Lionsgate/Summit had already greenlit Divergent's follow-up, Insurgent, the first film's performance proves the studio has likely found their next big franchise. But first we'll have to see how Divergent performs during its all-important second weekend.\n\nComing in at number 2 is Muppets Most Wanted (read our review) with $16.5 million. That's well behind The Muppets' $29.2 million, but that film did release over the more lucrative Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nAll told, Muppets Most Wanted should hold well thanks to families, but it will struggle to make more than about $50 million. Depending on how well Muppets Most Wanted does worldwide and home video, this could be the last we see of the iconic felt characters for a while.\n\nMr. Peabody & Sherman comes in at number 3 with $11.7 million. While Muppets Most Wanted likely siphoned off a large portion of Mr. Peabody's audience, the Fox Animation film has still accrued a very strong $81 million domestic over three weeks and $183 million worldwide.\n\nIn at number 4 is 300: Rise of an Empire with $8.6 million, which brings its domestic total up to $93 million. While 300: Rise of an Empire is well behind its predecessor, it has accrued $289 million worldwide.\n\nRounding out the top 5 is the Christian drama God's Not Dead with a surprising $8.6 million. Many expected that God's Not Dead would do well enough to make the top 10, but few thought it would do as well as it did. What's more, God's Not Dead's opening weekend tally is one of the best for a Christian-themed film.\n\nComing in at number 6 is Need for Speed with $7.7 million, which brings its domestic total up to $30 million after two weeks. While Need for Speed has struggled to find an audience in North America, it has actually done pretty well for itself overseas, maybe even well enough to earn a sequel. So far, the film has grossed $126 million worldwide.\n\nWes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel (read our review) is the number 7 film with $6.7 million. Despite an increase in theaters, The Grand Budapest Hotel continues to post strong per screen averages, well beyond what is expected of art house films. It might not be the highest grossing Wes Anderson release when all is said and done, but The Grand Budapest Hotel will certainly be up there.\n\nNon-Stop is the number 8 film this weekend with $6.3 million. While this latest Liam Neeson action flick continues to drop week after week, it has still done very well for itself. Non-Stop is currently at $78 million domestic.\n\nIn at number 9 is The LEGO Movie with $4.1 million, which brings its domestic total up $243 million. There isn't much to say about The LEGO Movie that hasn't already been said several times before – it's the highest grossing film of the year (so far) and already secured a follow-up in 2017.\n\nRounding out the top 10 is Tyler Perry's The Single Moms Club with $3.1 million. With only $12 million earned after two weeks, The Single Moms Club is on pace to finish as one of the poorest performing of Tyler Perry's films.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\n[NOTE: These are only weekend box office estimates - based on Friday and Saturday ticket sales coupled with adjusted expectations for Sunday.

Despite very mixed reviews, Divergent earned US$56-million, beating recently-lowered estimates and finishing far ahead of\n\n, which finished in second place with US$16.5-million.\n\nDivergent is the first film in an anticipated teen-warrior trilogy based on the young adult novels by Veronica Roth. The second installment, called Insurgent, is set to begin filming later this spring.\n\nWith its dystopian political backdrop and tough female protagonist, Divergent has glaring similarities to the Hunger Games franchise. Some critics have called it a rip-off. But that is probably fine as far as Lions Gate is concerned, as it controls both franchises. Lions Gate also released the Twilight films, meaning it has virtually cornered the market on multi-part epics for the tweener crowd.\n\nRichard Fay, head of domestic distribution at Lions Gate, said Divergent is “a great beginning” of another franchise for the company.\n\n“The key to the success of these franchises is finding the difference and marketing it,” he told the Associated Press. “It’s not easy. And I think we’re doing it better than anyone else right now, frankly.”\n\nAll the same, Divergent may not be a runaway home run in the vein of Twilight or The Hunger Games.\n\nPre-release estimates had Divergent earning as much as US$68-million on opening weekend. But those predictions were lowered after it pulled in only US$4.9-million on Thursday. Lions Gate shares dropped almost 8% on Friday after the disappointing start. However, the final total of US$56-million was slightly better than expected. It cost US$85-million to make.\n\nBy comparison, the first Twilight film earned US$69.6-million in its opening weekend, while the first Hunger Games film pulled in a whopping US$152.5-million in the same period.\n\nThe Hunger Games enjoyed extremely positive reviews when it came out. But like Twilight, Divergent has not been so fortunate. Only 40% of critics gave it positive reviews, according to Rotten Tomatoes. However, it got an 81% rating from the website’s audience.\n\nThanks largely to the hit teen franchises, Lions Gate has enjoyed parabolic growth in its stock price, which has jumped nearly five-fold since the start of 2010. The company now has a market value of more than US$3.8-billion.\n\nIn addition to the hit movies, the studio was in the spotlight due to its proxy battle with activist shareholder Carl Icahn, who tried to gain control of the company in 2010. The two sides struck a truce in 2011. However, Lions Gate recently agreed to pay US$7.5-million to settle allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose putting millions of new shares into the hands of a “management-friendly director” to help win the proxy fight.\n\nFinancial Post, with files from wire services\n\npkoven@nationalpost.com', 'Despite very mixed reviews, Divergent earned US$56-million, beating recently-lowered estimates and finishing far ahead of, which finished in second place with US$16.5-million.\nBut that is probably fine as far as Lions Gate is concerned, as it controls both franchises.\nLions Gate also released the Twilight films, meaning it has virtually cornered the market on multi-part epics for the tweener crowd.\nRichard Fay, head of domestic distribution at Lions Gate, said Divergent is “a great beginning” of another franchise for the company.\nThanks largely to the hit teen franchises, Lions Gate has enjoyed parabolic growth in its stock price, which has jumped nearly five-fold since the start of 2010.']"

Click here for the full box office estimates of the top 12 films and then check back on Monday for the final figures based on actual box office.\n\nMarch has become a month when studios try out new potential franchises and tentpoles, something that’s proven quite successful in the past. With that in mind, it was no surprise that Summit Entertainment and parent company Lionsgate chose the month to debut the first installment of Veronica Roth’s bestselling Divergent, starring Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoё Kravitz, Tony Goldwyn, Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer and Kate Winslet.\n\nWhile some were expecting it to be the next “Twilight Saga” or “Hunger Games,” it opened decently but modestly in comparison with an estimated $56 million in its first weekend in 3,396 theaters, just over $14,000 per location. $5 million of that amount was brought in on the movie’s 348 IMAX screens with 17 of the film’s Top 20 domestic runs being in the IMAX format.\n\nNot so lucky this week was the return of Jim Henson’s popular talking animals Kermit, Miss Piggy et al in the sequel Muppets Most Wanted (Walt Disney Pictures), featuring humans Tina Fey, Ricky Gervais and Ty Burrell. Despite opening in over 3,000 theaters, it failed to bring in much of an audience, settling for second place with $16.5 million, a far cry from the $41.5 million The Muppets made in its first five days over Thanksgiving 2012.\n\nAfter moving into the top slot last week, DreamWorks Animation’s Mr. Peabody & Sherman (20th Century Fox) dropped to third place with $11.7 million and $81 million total, definitely picking up steam after a weak opening weekend earlier this month.\n\nIt remains ahead of Legendary Pictures’ action sequel 300: Rise of an Empire (Warner Bros.), which also went down one notch to fourth place with $8.7 million (another 55% drop) as it edges its way to $100 million with $93.8 million grossed so far. Overseas, “Rise of an Empire” has grossed $195 million to bring its worldwide total to $289 million.\n\nThe weekend’s biggest surprise had to be the independently-distributed God’s Not Dead (Freestyle Releasing), a movie I knew next to nothing about going into the weekend that somehow was able to get into 780 theaters nationwide with an odd cast that includes Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain. After grossing $2.7 million on Friday, the spiritually-inclined dramedy ended up with $8.6 million for the weekend, which was enough to take fifth place.\n\nSpeaking of religion, Darren Aronofsky’s biblical epic Noah, starring Russell Crowe, Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Jennifer Connelly and Anthony Hopkins, opened one week earlier in Mexico and South Korea before its North American release on Friday, taking the top spot in both countries with $5.7 million and $8.3 million, respectively.\n\nDown 56% from its opening weekend, DreamWorks racing movie Need for Speed, starring Aaron Paul, Imogen Poots and Dominic Cooper, took sixth place with $7.8 million and a measly $30.4 million after ten days. The movie continues to do far better overseas where it took in $29.2 million this weekend to bring its international total to $96.1 million. The movie has grossed $41.7 million in China alone, besting its North American take.\n\nWes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel (Fox Searchlight) continues to do huge business despite still only being in limited release, expanding into 304 theaters on Friday where it earned $6.7 million for the weekend, nearly twice the amount grossed last week. So far, Anderson’s movie has grossed $13 million since opening earlier this month and one expects that Fox Searchlight will continue to expand it across the nation in hopes of it surpassing 2012’s Moonrise Kingdom as Anderson’s highest-grossing film.\n\nLiam Neeson’s Non-Stop (Universal) airplane thriller took eighth place with $6.3 million and a total gross of $78.6 million, while he also provided a voice in the #9 movie, The LEGO Movie (Warner Bros.), which earned $4.1 million and has taken in $243.3 million total.\n\nThe Top 10 brought in an estimated $129.5 million, which is right on par with the same weekend last year when DreamWorks Animation’s The Croods topped the box office with $43.6 million and Olympus Has Fallen took second place with $30.4 million.\n\nAs far as limited releases, Lars von Trier’s controversial sex drama Nymphomaniac: Volume I (Magnolia), starring Charlotte Gainsbourg and Stellan Skarsgard, took in $150 thousand in 24 theaters or $6,250 per site, while the documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune made $36 thousand in 3 theaters in New York and L.A.\n\nClick here for the full box office estimates of the top 12 films.', 'The ComingSoon.net Box Office Report has been updated with studio estimates for the weekend.\nClick here for the full box office estimates of the top 12 films and then check back on Monday for the final figures based on actual box office.\nOverseas, “Rise of an Empire” has grossed $195 million to bring its worldwide total to $289 million.\nAfter grossing $2.7 million on Friday, the spiritually-inclined dramedy ended up with $8.6 million for the weekend, which was enough to take fifth place.\nThe movie continues to do far better overseas where it took in $29.2 million this weekend to bring its international total to $96.1 million.']"

The Amity are peaceful hippie farmers who help others and keep to themselves.\n\nThe Dauntless are the de facto soldiers of the city, a wild pack fueled by the exhilaration that emanates from jumping off L trains. The Candor run the judicial system and are expectedly abrasive and forthright.\n\nAnd lastly, we have Abnegation, heralded for their unabashed selflessness — as a result, this is the faction elected to rule.\n\nTris (Shailene Woodley) is our entry point into all this madness.\n\nIt’s that time in her life where she and many others are forced to take a test that will determine which faction you belong in.\n\nAlthough her origins lie in Abnegation (both of her parents are at the political forefront of the group), she doubts her own identity. It’s a conflict anyone who’s ever been a teenager can relate to.\n\nThe exam serves as the catalytic agent of the film as Tris is deemed a Divergent — someone who, for some inexplicable reason, doesn’t fit into the five factions provided.\n\nWhen it’s time for our perplexed protagonist to make a choice, she chooses to enroll in Dauntless against the will of her parents.\n\nDivergent quickly segues into Tris desperately attempting to fit into her chosen faction. Her Abnegation upbringing didn’t prepare for the dangerous life of the Dauntless soldiers. The inductee process in this faction is one paved with exhausting mental and physical tasks few could endure.\n\nAs the film moves from our protagonist weathering the Dauntless’ bootcamp to her spearheading a covert coup, combat sequences are designed with grating familiarity: the good guys are outmatched by the bad guys, the latter of which will battle the good guys 1 vs. 1, securing their defeat.\n\nSince time immemorial I’ve been baffled by this method of action. Surely no one believes that people physically assault one another in this idiotic manner.\n\nTime after time the odds are stacked against Tris and company as they attempt to prevent Jeanine’s (Kate Winslet) malevolent mind-washing machinations from coming to fruition. And time after time again, our heroes come out of these situations favorably, albeit with a few inevitable casualties.\n\nOf course no one expects Divergent to conclude somberly. We’ve grown accustomed to seeing our heroes prevail, no matter the nefarious threats posed against them.\n\nBut at least Burger could’ve imbued this dystopic universe with a drop of tension. Instead we’re given middling action to the tune of imperceptible and jagged cuts, ensuring complete obfuscation and indifference.\n\nIn hindsight, it’s clear Burger’s two finest efforts, The Illusionist and Limitless, were quality examples of American Hollywood films that effectively balanced art and commerce. Both pictures juggled provocative concepts with a healthy amount of intellect.\n\nDivergent is not different from the rest of Burger’s filmography, as it too dabbles with the prospect of being a smart film about defying categorization in an age where labeling is ubiquitous.\n\nUnfortunately, dabbling is the closest the film ever gets to being something of substance or intrigue. Even in the film’s few cerebral bright spots in which Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor’s middling script examines the illusion of free will and the inherent flaws of factions, Divergent comes up short.\n\nToo often Burger punctuates these ideas — all of which run through Tris — with the aforementioned discordant action.\n\nBut I suppose the main letdown of Divergent is the material given to Woodley. Aside from her endearing eccentricities off camera, her charisma and talents as an actress have been confirmed in both The Descendants and The Spectacular Now.\n\nSadly, the dialogue she was forced to spew here is outright laughable. Perhaps the hackneyed narration and the grating platitudes in which characters interact will work for fervent fans of the novel (of which I have not read).\n\nThat said, it’s difficult to envision a universe where moviegoers will find the screenwriting here compelling.\n\n\n\nConsidering this will undoubtedly be elongated into some sort of franchise, one can only hope Divergent improves upon expansion.', 'Despite being filmed and set in Chicago, Divergent feels like a manufactured product churned out by the Hollywood system.\nStars: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley Judd Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley JuddWith the booming success of the The Hunger Games trilogy in the peripherals, Summit Entertainment seems to be attempting to duplicate a piece of art unable to be duplicated.\nTris (Shailene Woodley) is our entry point into all this madness.\nEven in the film’s few cerebral bright spots in which Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor’s middling script examines the illusion of free will and the inherent flaws of factions, Divergent comes up short.\nConsidering this will undoubtedly be elongated into some sort of franchise, one can only hope Divergent improves upon expansion.']"

(AP Photo/Summit Entertainment, Jaap Buitendijk)\n\nNEW YORK — To go with ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games,"" Lionsgate now has a trio of young-adult franchises with the box-office leading ""Divergent.""\n\nThe teen science-fiction thriller starring Shailene Woodley debuted with $56 million over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. The opening, while less than some anticipated, launches Lionsgate\'s third franchise built on young-adult best-sellers.\n\nWith an audience 59 percent female and half under the age of 25, ""Divergent"" lured young moviegoers with dystopian drama and an upcoming star. ""Divergent,"" though, fell well short of its forerunners: ""Twilight"" opened with $69.6 million in 2008, and ""The Hunger Games"" began with $152.5 million in 2012.\n\nRichie Fay, president of domestic distribution for Lionsgate, called it ""a great beginning for another franchise for the company."" A sequel is already in the works.\n\n""The key to the success of these franchises is finding the difference and marketing it,"" said Fay. ""It\'s not easy. And I think we\'re doing it better than anyone else right now, frankly.""\n\nIn the rush to adapt popular young-adult fiction, Lionsgate has succeeded where many others have floundered. ""Divergent,"" made with a budget of $85 million from Veronica Roth\'s best-sellers, follows less stellar results from youth-focused films like ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,"" \'\'Vampire Academy"" and ""Beautiful Creatures.""\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak, calls the ""Divergent"" debut a ""three-peat"" for Lionsgate in a challenging genre that defies ""cookie-cutter, assembly line"" development.\n\n""They make it look easy,"" says Dergarabedian. ""You\'re chasing probably the most fickle audience in the world. They can change their minds on what\'s cool in the blink of an eye.""\n\nDisney\'s Muppets sequel ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" with Ricky Gervais and Tina Fey, fared poorly, earning just $16.5 million over the weekend. ""The Muppets,"" opened notably better with $29.2 million in 2011, benefiting from the high-profile reboot starring and co-written by Jason Segal.\n\nDave Hollis, head of distribution for Disney, acknowledged the result was disappointing and somewhat ""head-scratching"" considering advance tracking had suggested ""Muppets Most Wanted"" would draw bigger crowds.\n\n""There certainly was something in the last Muppets — not having anything available for fans for a while — that satisfied pent up demand that we didn\'t have the benefit of this time around,"" Hollis said.\n\nThe family film market was also more competitive than expected, as 20th Century Fox\'s animated ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" has held better than anticipated. In its third week of release, the film — tops at the box office last weekend — slid to third with $11.7 million.\n\nStudios often seek out late March release dates for family-friendly movies to benefit from spring break vacations. So ""Muppets Most Wanted,"" made for $50 million, could still eke out more at the box office.\n\nThe surprise of the weekend was the strong performance of the independently released ""God\'s Not Dead,"" made to appeal specifically to faith-based audiences. It came in fifth with $8.6 million, despite playing on just 780 screens.\n\nThe performance of ""God\'s Not Dead"" further proves the strong faith-based market for movies, one historically underserved before the runaway success of Mel Gibson\'s ""The Passion of the Christ.""\n\nNext week, Paramount Pictures\' ""Noah,"" directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Russell Crowe, will attempt to cross over to mainstream audiences with a Bible tale. Opening early in Mexico and South Korean, ""Noah"" got off to a strong start overseas, earning $14 million.\n\nExpanding from 66 to 304 screens, Wes Anderson\'s European caper ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" continued to pack theaters in limited release. It earned $6.5 million in its third week of release, with further expansion planned.\n\nAnd though the crowd-funding of the big-screen edition of cult TV show ""Veronica Mars"" drew much publicity for its successful Kickstarter campaign, the movie has proved only of interest to devoted fans. On 347 screens, it made just $144,000 for Warner Bros., bringing its two-week total to $2.9 million.\n\n___\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak.

The sci-fi drama trounced the mild second place opening for Disney’s Muppets Most Wanted and knocked last week’s champ Mr. Peabody & Sherman down to third place. The religious feature God’s Not Dead made a strong surprise debut in fifth place. Thanks to Divergent, the top ten surged 31% over last weekend’s totals and event managed to edge up two percent over the top ten from one year ago at this time.\n\nWith The Hunger Games: Catching Fire finally heading off to home video after a $424 million theatrical run, the time was right for another film series aimed at tweens to arrive on the scene. Based on a Young Adult book series (the sequel Insurgent is already in the works), the $85 million Lionsgate and Summit Entertainment feature arrived on 3,936 screens Thursday night at 8pm to deliver a whopping $56 million and a big per-screen average of $14,228. The film was directed by Neil Burger and stars Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Kate Winslet, Maggie Q and Jai Courtney. Reviews were largely on the negative side for the feature but fans of the book series gave it a solid “A+” rating on CinemaScore.\n\nWhile Divergent didn’t scale the opening-weekend heights of The Hunger Games or Twilight, the numbers should prove to be encouraging to Lionsgate. Not only was the $56 million opening the biggest for a live-action feature so far this year, the gross wasn’t completely front-loaded. Usually when a big event movie based on a known property opens, the opening day is where most of the money is made for opening weekend. Divergent’s opening day was $22.6 million, followed by a smaller-than-anticipated Saturday drop (-13%) to $19.7 million (Sunday is estimated to be down 31% to $13.6 million).\n\nThat even distribution of opening weekend sales could be a sign that word-of-mouth has already started to spread outside the book series fan base. If that is the case and non-fans begin to pop up to see the movie, Divergent could work its way to $150 million. One thing is for certain, the film’s sizable opening has erased fears that the Young Adult market was starting to dry up (The Hunger Games aside). Before Divergent, the last four attempts to kick-start a YA franchise (Beautiful Creatures, The Host, Mortal Instruments and Vampire Academy) all bombed.\n\nRead our Divergent movie review.\n\nThe Muppets arrived on movie screens during Thanksgiving over two years ago. The critically-acclaimed return of Kermit, Miss Piggy and the gang opened to a big $41.5 million en route to a domestic final haul of $88 million. With critical and viewer loved bestowed upon The Muppets, a sequel was a given: Muppets Most Wanted. While the critical support was there once again for the gang, the audience was not. With competition coming in from the likes of Mr. Peabody & Sherman, The Lego Movie and even Frozen, Muppets Most Wanted arrived on 3,194 screens Friday to earn a mild $16.5 million.\n\nIn addition to strong competition, Most Wanted did not carry with it the novelty of being the first new Muppet feature in well over a decade. Unless word-of-mouth is stellar, Most Wanted will fall short of the $50 million that was spent on the movie’s production, at least domestically. The first movie did enough business overseas that there is a good chance foreign markets will come to the rescue and make the second round of Kermit a bit more Wanted.\n\nAfter climbing to the number one position last weekend, Fox/Dreamworks’ Mr. Peabody & Sherman fell to third while losing 46% of its audience in its third weekend. The animated comedy has earned $81 million so far and should make its way past the $100 million mark by the end of its domestic run, a solid but unspectacular (in relation to production cost) run. Foreign markets have contributed $102 million so far.\n\nIn fourth place was Warner’s blood-soaked sequel 300: Rise of An Empire, which slayed 55% fewer people in its third round to earn $8.6 million on 3,085 screens. To date, the Spartan epic has earned $93.7 million and should finish near the $110 million mark. The movie has earned $195.4 million overseas thus far.\n\nRounding out the top five was Freestyle’s religious-themed drama God’s Not Dead. Opening on 780 screens and no doubt aimed at the same church and other faith-based groups that turned Son of God into a $60 million hit, God’s Not Dead earned a great $8.56 million for a per-screen average of $10,979. The drama stars Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cain and tells the story of a college student challenged by his professor to prove the existence of God.\n\nThe remainder of the top ten is as follows:\n\n6. Need for Speed (Disney) $7.7 million (-56%); $30.4 million\n\n7. The Grand Budapest Hotel (Fox Searchlight) $6.7 million (+85%); $13 million\n\n8. Non-Stop (Universal) $6.3 million (-40%); $78.6 million\n\n9. The Lego Movie (Warner) $4.1 million (-46%); $243.3 million\n\n10. Tyler Perry’s The Single Moms Club (Lionsgate) $3.1 million (-62%); $13 million\n\nNext weekend brings the arrival of the Russell Crowe biblical feature Noah and the Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick Sabotage. Watch for Noah to give Divergent a run for the top spot.

Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) is warned she is Divergent and will never fit into any group. When she discovers a conspiracy by a faction leader (Kate Winslet) to destroy all Divergents, Tris must learn to trust in the mysterious Four (Theo James) before it’s too late.\n\n‘Divergent’ should be a thrilling action-adventure film. The action is most certainly there and overflows, almost to fill in the void of the thrill that is missing. Screenwriters Evan Daugherty and Vanessa Taylor seem to have made a collage of scenes and situations that clash with one another in style and genre. Hence, director Neil Burger struggles to weld the barbarous combats, with philosophy and coy romance.\n\nBut the dystopian drama never fully explains its premise, which comes across as a mishmash of notions from better books and movies. The main defect is that the core five-faction concept doesn’t really seem to hold up. The final lesson dragged out to audiences – that being different isn’t necessarily bad, and that the true enemy is Manichaeism – is a redundant cliché.\n\nShailene Woodley proves to be a gifted and empathetic young actress, in holding-up in the gawky adaptation of Roth’s bestseller. Just as talented is Theo James, whose physique du role for the sensitive-hunk contributes to creating the proper chemistry between Tris and Four. But despite the cuteness of the bashful lovers, the result is pretty disappointing: the first hour of the movie is dedicated to Tris’ martial indoctrination and once the romance approaches for the long coveted spice, passion gets dismissed by puritanism. Amongst other noteworthy performances there is Kate Winslet’s brief appearance as the impassive icy-cold villain that may make worthwhile buying the ticket to see the flick.\n\nNevertheless the “safeword” to adopt during the torturous vision of ‘Divergent’ is the very quote often recurring in the movie: “This isn’t real.”\n\nTechnical: B\n\nActing: B\n\nStory: C\n\nOverall: C+\n\nWritten by: Chiara Spagnoli Gabardi', '‘Divergent’ is set in a world where people are divided into distinct factions based on human virtues.\nTris Prior (Shailene Woodley) is warned she is Divergent and will never fit into any group.\nShailene Woodley proves to be a gifted and empathetic young actress, in holding-up in the gawky adaptation of Roth’s bestseller.\nJust as talented is Theo James, whose physique du role for the sensitive-hunk contributes to creating the proper chemistry between Tris and Four.\nNevertheless the “safeword” to adopt during the torturous vision of ‘Divergent’ is the very quote often recurring in the movie: “This isn’t real.”Technical: BActing: BStory: COverall: C+Written by: Chiara Spagnoli Gabardi']"

36282,http://www.411mania.com/movies/news/317202,entertainment,"['It was all about dystopian young adult fiction at the box office this weekend, and we’re not talking about The Hunger Games. Lionsgate’s Divergent debuted at #1 with ease in the weekend box office results with $56 million. The number is just a touch on the low end for what the studio was hoping for; they were optimistic about a $60 million range opening. However, the film is still expected to be a big win for the studio and is heads and tails about recent YA adaptation disappointments. Critics were not kind to the film and these kinds of projects tend to be very front-loaded due to their passionate fanbases all coming out in droves on opening weekend, but the A CinemaScore should help offset that to give this one life at the box office (at least, until Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The film averaged $14,228 from 3,936 and is on its way to making back the $85 million budget with ease. A second film is already heavy into development.\n\nDebuting at #2 was Muppets Most Wanted. The latest adventure from the well-known characters hit disappointing marks in its debut despite solid critical attention, scoring just $16.5 million domestically and $18 million worldwide. The film was expected by Disney to bring in somewhere in the low $20 million range, so they can’t be happy with this; most likely Mr. Peabody & Sherman’s strength took family audiences away from it. The film scored a B+ CinemaScore and combined with the strong reviews and the traditional legs inherent in the family genre it still has a chance at success with a $50 million budget, but it will be an uphill climb.\n\nSpeaking of Mr. Peabody & Sherman, it was down two spots to #3 with a strong $11.7 million in its third weekend. The DreamWorks Animation film has now grossed $93.7 million domestically and $183.2 million worldwide on a budget of $145 million, making it a hit for DreamWorks despite a disappointing opening weekend.\n\n300: Rise of the Empire was also down two spots, finishing at #4 in its third weekend with $8.7 million. The period action sequel has now grossed $93.8 million domestically and $289.2 million worldwide from a budget of $110 million. It is still on course for $110 million to $125 million domestically.\n\nShocking prognosticators with its strong opening this weekend was God’s Not Dead. The religious drama from Pure Flix Entertainment opened at #5 with $8.6 million in just 780 theaters. This again shows why you can never count out faith-based films, which have a tendency to open well but this one is easily the biggest win to date for the genre. The film, which stars Shane Harper and Kevin Sorbo, averaged $10,979 from 780 theaters. Its budget isn’t known.\n\nNeed For Speed was down three spots in its second weekend, burning out quickly with just $7.8 million. That’s a higher-than-average 58% drop for action/racing films, though it is about on par for video game adaptations. The film has now grossed $30.4 million domestically but its worldwide appeal is solid, with $126.5 million around the world on a $66 million budget.\n\nWes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel continued its climb up the charts, expanding to 304 theaters in its third week of limited release and bringing in $6.8 million to raise a spot to #7. The film continues to hold the highest per-screen average of the week with $22,204 per theater; it has now grossed $12.9 million domestically and $46.1 million worldwide; its budget isn’t known.\n\nDown four spots to #8 in its fourth weekend was Liam Neeson’s Non-Stop. The action-thriller brought in $6.3 million; it has now grossed $78.6 million domestically and $142 million worldwide on a production budget of $50 million.\n\nThe LEGO Movie was down three spots in its seventh week to #7 with $4.1 million. The film has now grossed $243.4 million domestically and $391 million worldwide from a $60 million budget.\n\nTyler Perry’s latest film followed up its weak opening with a steep drop this weekend, as Tyler Perry’s The Single Moms Club fell five spots to #10. The ensemble dramedy brought in $3.1 million for a 62% drop from its already-disappointing opening weekend. Perry’s films always have somewhat larger drops but this is the biggest second-weekend fall since 2010’s Tyler Perry’s Why Did I Get Married Too? This one is more or less a guaranteed flop at this point with just $12.9 million so far and will be the lowest-grossing film in Perry’s career as a director; it is unlikely to top $20 million at this point. No word on the film’s budget.\n\nThe weekend box office tally was $139.6 million, up 0.5% from last year’s take of $138.9 million that was led by The Croods’ $43.6 million opening.\n\nNote: Numbers include Sunday estimates and are three-day estimates. A studio recoups 55% of a film’s grosses on average, meaning it needs to approximately double its budget to be profitable during its theatrical run.\n\nBOX OFFICE TOP TEN (Three-Day Numbers)\n\n1.

36284,http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/divergent-is-a-hit-but-its-no-hunger-games,entertainment,"['While it did not approach the box office heights of fellow female-driven best-seller adaptations Twilight or The Hunger Games, Divergent is a clear, if modest, success. The adaptation of Veronica Roth\'s best-selling novel opened with an estimated $56 million this weekend — including Thursday evening screenings — which places the film neither strapped to a rocket to instant mega-blockbuster ubiquity nor tied to an anchor heading toward instant pop-culture oblivion.\n\nThough there is always a lot riding on the launch of a franchise, Divergent\'s debut had particularly high stakes: Months before the film\'s release, Summit Entertainment had already announced release dates for adaptations of Roth\'s subsequent two books in the series. Insurgent will go into production in May, and will open in North America on March 20, 2015; and the final, controversial installment Allegiant is scheduled to be released on March 18, 2016. With Divergent\'s solid debut, that risk appears to have paid off for Summit.\n\nThe series\' overarching story, which tracks young heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) as she struggles to survive in the unyielding class structure of her dystopian society, has been liberally compared to The Hunger Games series. But Roth\'s psychologically driven narrative lends itself to far less epically scaled, CG-laden action sequences than The Hunger Games did, which is reflected in the film\'s marketing — and, it appears, in its box office returns. (The Hunger Games opened to $152.5 million, almost three times Divergent\'s debut.)\n\nStill, moviegoers were definitely satisfied; it received an ""A"" grade from the audience polling firm CinemaScore (and an ""A+"" from those under 18). That audience was roughly 59% female, and 41% male — a decently balanced gender split considering how female-skewed Twilight, Summit\'s last major franchise, was.\n\nBut the most telling detail from CinemaScore was in how many ticket buyers had read Roth\'s novel: just 50%, in comparison to 76% of the audience for The Hunger Games\'s opening weekend, and 74% for Twilight. The draw for Divergent, it seems, was as much Woodley, co-star Theo James, and the central conceit of the story itself.\n\nIt\'s a promising development for the movie franchise, and an eyebrow-raising one for Hollywood\'s continued pursuit of YA-driven novels as a reliable source for blockbuster franchises. For every sensation like The Hunger Games — or moderate hit like Divergent — there are far more adaptations of YA best-sellers that barely made any blip at all. (R.I.P. Vampire Academy, Ender\'s Game, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, The Host, Beautiful Creatures, I Am Number Four, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire\'s Assistant, Inkheart, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Seeker: The Dark is Rising, and Eragon.) With that dismal success rate, and with Roth\'s readership only accounting for roughly half of Divergent\'s audience, perhaps Hollywood should spend less time analyzing the best-seller list, and more time analyzing whether the books on those lists are suited for the movies in the first place.', ""While it did not approach the box office heights of fellow female-driven best-seller adaptations Twilight or The Hunger Games, Divergent is a clear, if modest, success.\nThe series' overarching story, which tracks young heroine Tris (Shailene Woodley) as she struggles to survive in the unyielding class structure of her dystopian society, has been liberally compared to The Hunger Games series.\nBut Roth's psychologically driven narrative lends itself to far less epically scaled, CG-laden action sequences than The Hunger Games did, which is reflected in the film's marketing — and, it appears, in its box office returns.\n(The Hunger Games opened to $152.5 million, almost three times Divergent's debut.)\nFor every sensation like The Hunger Games — or moderate hit like Divergent — there are far more adaptations of YA best-sellers that barely made any blip at all.""]"

Animated “Mr. Peabody & Sherman,” produced by Dreamworks Animation Inc, took the No. 3 slot with $11.7 million.\n\n“Divergent” is adapted from a popular series of young adult novels by newcomer author Veronica Roth. Ahead of the weekend, forecasters had predicted the film would debut with between $50 million and $68 million in North American (U.S. and Canadian) ticket sales.\n\nShailene Woodley stars in “Divergent” as Tris Prior, a teenager who doesn’t fit in to a faction because she has multiple dominant personality traits, making her a threat to the government. She chooses to join the Dauntless faction of warriors who defend the society’s inhabitants. British actor Theo James plays Four, Tris’ mentor and love interest.\n\nThe debut of “Divergent” fell short of the box office heights of two other young adult franchises. “Hunger Games” started with a massive $152.5 million in March 2012 while “Twilight” opened with $69.6 million in November 2008.\n\nLions Gate said Friday it was confident “Divergent” would become an important franchise for the company and it was moving ahead with the second film in the series, called “Insurgent,” which will reach theaters in March 2015.\n\nNoting that the “Divergent” opening was shy of blockbusters “Hunger Games” and “Twilight,” Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co., said “$56 million is a great opening for any film, and virtually locked down the proposed trilogy.”\n\n“This is something to build on for the series, and with the cast expected to be in high demand, the ‘Divergent’ legacy will continue to grow,” Bock added.\n\nRichie Fay, the studio’s president of domestic distribution, said, “We’re very pleased with the outcome for the franchise launch.”\n\nThe movie’s A+ CinemaScore grade from the under-18 audience bodes well for the coming weeks as spring break and Easter school holidays approach, Fay said, noting, “The young adult audience has been underserved in the last couple of weeks.”\n\nThe company spent $85 million to produce “Divergent,” plus $40 million to $45 million on marketing, according to a person with knowledge of the film’s budget. The studio has recouped about $70 million of the cost through international licensing deals, the person said.\n\n“Muppets Most Wanted,” a sequel to a 2011 “Muppets” movie, stars Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey and Ty Burrell alongside Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and other classic Muppet characters. In the new film, Kermit is imprisoned in a Russian gulag in a case of mistaken identity, while an evil impostor travels with his muppet friends on a European tour.\n\n“Mr. Peabody and Sherman” brought its global sales through three weekends to $172 million. The movie was distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\nRounding out the domestic charts, Greek warrior sequel “300: Rise of an Empire” landed in fourth place with $8.7 million, while the independent faith-based new release “God’s Not Dead” pulled in $8.6 million to claim the No. 5 spot.\n\nWarner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, released “300: Rise of an Empire.” (Reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles and Chris Michaud in New York; Editing by Sophie Hares and Jan Paschal)', '“Divergent” is adapted from a popular series of young adult novels by newcomer author Veronica Roth.\nAhead of the weekend, forecasters had predicted the film would debut with between $50 million and $68 million in North American (U.S. and Canadian) ticket sales.\nThe debut of “Divergent” fell short of the box office heights of two other young adult franchises.\n“Hunger Games” started with a massive $152.5 million in March 2012 while “Twilight” opened with $69.6 million in November 2008.\n“Muppets Most Wanted,” a sequel to a 2011 “Muppets” movie, stars Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey and Ty Burrell alongside Miss Piggy, Kermit the Frog and other classic Muppet characters.']"

That number may sound impressive but in comparison to it’s young adult book to big screen predecessors it’s a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThe Hunger Games made an amazing $67.3 million on it’s opening day of release while Twilight, which didn’t start out with the same level of hype around it as the JLaw franchise, still managed $36 million\n\nWeekend estimates for Divergent were high, thanks to the huge success of Roth’s book plus the combined talents of Lionsgate, the studio behind The Hunger Games and Twilight’s studio Summit. In fact optimistic estimates placed the move’s opening weekend haul as high as $55 to $60 million.\n\nThe film is still proving to be a winner though even if it isn’t stretching to those high numbers. Mixed reviews haven’t put off the Divergent devotees, with the film benefiting from the ready made fan base from Roth’s book, and a number one spot it a near certainty. It’s closest rival so far is Disney’s Muppets Most Wanted which scored $4.7 million Friday and is tracking for an opening weekend of around $15 million.\n\nWe’ll have to wait and see just how many fans flocked to the cinemas this weekend to see Shailene and Theo bring Tris and Four to life.', 'But while the film got off to a great start, the momentum appears to have stalled on Friday, with current studio estimates putting it around the $22.8 million mark.\nIn fact optimistic estimates placed the move’s opening weekend haul as high as $55 to $60 million.\nThe film is still proving to be a winner though even if it isn’t stretching to those high numbers.\nIt’s closest rival so far is Disney’s Muppets Most Wanted which scored $4.7 million Friday and is tracking for an opening weekend of around $15 million.\nWe’ll have to wait and see just how many fans flocked to the cinemas this weekend to see Shailene and Theo bring Tris and Four to life.']"

I wondered if it changed her life in positive ways because I had no reference what a major studio film would feel like.\n\n�She wrote: �You must do it. You will not regret it for a minute. Just don�t do drugs, don�t make a sex tape and don�t go to Whole Foods the day the movie opens.�\n\n�Then she wrote, �The amount of beauty you will find in this kind of strong female role will transcend all the other situations.��\n\nWoodley stars as Beatrice �Tris� Prior in Divergent, the new film based on the first novel of the best-selling Veronica Roth trilogy set in a dystopian future version of Chicago. America has been devastated by a war, and, to keep a fragile peace, society is broken into five factions based on personality traits. Each teenager is required to join one faction or another, based on psychological and neurological profiling, in some cases leaving his or her family forever. The decision is final.\n\nBut Tris� testing reveals aspects of more than one faction. She is a �Divergent� � a wild card who represents a threat to the system.\n\n�A lot of who Tris is resonated with me,� the 23-year-old Woodley said. �When I was Tris� age, I went through an internal struggle. I was raised by two psychologist parents. Compassion and empathy were two things ingrained into my system � just like Tris, who belongs to a caring and charitable faction when the film begins.�\n\nTris decides that she can�t stay in the faction to which she was born and joins a faction of young warriors.\n\n�Tris is raised in a society where she�s taught to be selfless,� Woodley said. �She joins a society where she has to be selfish. At the same time, she must be strong and live her life with integrity � which were two traits I try to achieve in my life. That�s Tris, too.�\n\nWoodley grew up in Simi Valley, Calif., and was only 4 when she began modeling. She went on to make commercials and made her big-screen debut in Replacing Dad (1999).\n\n�I started acting at age 5,� she said. �I�ve been doing this for 17 years, which is crazy.�\n\nHer biggest breaks came when she was cast as Amy Juergens on The Secret Life of the American Teenager (2008-13) and when she won the role playing the daughter of George Clooney�s character in The Descendants (2011). The latter led to Woodley�s first big-screen starring role in The Spectacular Now (2013).\n\nThe actress will follow Divergent with The Fault in Our Stars, due in June.

However, the adaptation might fall short of industry estimates.\n\nDepending on which film guru you spoke to ahead of the film’s release, Divergent was on-track to make approximately $60 million from folks in North America. However, the film’s Thursday evening and Friday totals are painting a somewhat different picture.\n\nAccording to the folks at Forbes, director Neil Burger’s adaptation of Veronica Roth’s young adult novel earned around $22.8 million from curious film fans in the US on Friday. When you toss in the $4.9 million Divergent snagged on Thursday, this pushes the movie’s total to a healthy $27.7 million. Although that number certainly isn’t anything to scoff at, apparently this figure has fallen short of expectations.\n\nSo how much will the adaptation make over the weekend? Variety believes Divergent will ultimately scrape together between $50 million and $53 million during the first few days of release. Lionsgate reported spent around $80 million on the flick, which means the studio shouldn’t have too much trouble recouping the production budget.\n\nWhile it’s unlikely that Divergent will strike the same chord with moviegoers that motion pictures such as The Hunger Games and Twilight did in the past, there’s still a possibility the flick could catch up to its cinematic brethren. Cinema Blend points out that the first Twilight movie made $69 million on opening weekend, a number that Burger’s endeavor could eclipse. No pun intended, of course.\n\nDivergent definitely found success with moviegoers at the box office on Friday, but the same doesn’t ring true for Muppets Most Wanted. The latest installment of the franchise is struggling against the family-oriented competition still hanging around theaters, namely Peabody & Sherman and The Lego Movie.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter believes the Muppets flick may not cross the $18 million mark once the weekend wraps up. This definitely doesn’t bode well for the future of the series, especially since the 2011 reboot was a pretty successful release for the folks at Disney. This sort of things tends to happen when you have a crowded box office.\n\nDivergent fans can rest easy knowing that the sequel is still on the way. According to MTV News, R.I.P.D. director Robert Schwentke’s Insurgent will hit theaters in March of 2015. Unless interest in the series withers and dies on the cinematic vine, Allegiant should arrive at some point in 2016.\n\nAre you surprised that Divergent is a little off-track this weekend?

(They already welcomed their first child together, North, last June.)\n\nSo should we be surprised that the rapper, who’s previously campaigned for his bride-to-be to appear on the cover of Vogue magazine, can place a checkmark next to that goal?\n\nIt’s true. Kardashian and West are appearing on the April issue of Vogue magazine. And this, soon after West proclaimed on Ryan Seacrest’s radio show that it was preposterous it had not yet happened.\n\n“There’s no way Kim Kardashian shouldn’t be on the cover of Vogue,” West told Seacrest back in October. “She’s like the most intriguing woman right now. … and collectively, we’re the most influential in clothing.”\n\n“No one is looking at what Obama is wearing. Michelle Obama can’t Instagram a (bathing suit) pic like what my girl Instagrammed the other day.”\n\nThe cover is vaguely reminiscent of Kardashian’s other high-profile appearance on the front of People magazine in 2011, when she posed with her then-fiancé, basketball player Kris Humphries. Except this time, she’s traded in the contemporary clothing for sumptuous luxury wares.\n\nCalling Kardashian and West #theworldsmosttalkedaboutcouple, Vogue is promising a firsthand look inside the pair’s “fashionable life and surreal times,” including a glimpse of how they interact as parents. The pair’s daughter, North, appears with them in a behind-the-scenes video of the Vogue photo shoot.\n\nThe unveiling of the issue, which arrives on newsstands March 31 and digitally March 24, was met with a mix of reactions, from stunned to supportive to upset.\n\n“Somewhere, Victoria Beckham is flipping a table,” joked one observer. “Vogue negotiates with terrorists,” quipped another.\n\nVogue isn’t a stranger to controversy — earlier this year it was criticized by some for its treatment of “Girls” star Lena Dunham — but the vitriol directed toward Vogue editor Anna Wintour regarding the April issue has been visceral.\n\n“If someone could start a petition to have Anna Wintour fired over this, society would appreciate it,” said @RunBritRun. “Anna Wintour RETIRE NOW. You’re mentally unstable,” chimed in @Jenovia.\n\n“I just wonder what went through Anna Wintour’s mind. Has she gone mad?” asked another onlooker.\n\nGiven the timing of the issue, a handful wondered if Vogue was pulling some sort of elaborate (not to mention expensive) April Fool’s Day prank.\n\nFans of the couple were just as breathless as Kardashian tweeted she was when they spotted the pair’s glossy cover shot.\n\n“If you’re actually mad at Kim and Kanye’s Vogue cover,” tweeted @Kia_Mak, “go outside, start walking and don’t stop until you reach the horizon.”\n\nAdded @PatrickSandberg, “Kim and Kanye refuse to accept the limitations people try to put on them and it’s inspiring. They win.”\n\nMostly, though, it looks some are just confused by the #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple hashtag Vogue is trying to promote.\n\n“Wait,” said @NikiBlasina. “That doesn’t look like Jay-Z and Beyonce.”', '× Kim and Kanye – are they the #worldsmosttalkedabout couple?\nAfter all, he wanted Kim Kardashian for years, and is now set to marry her in May.\n“There’s no way Kim Kardashian shouldn’t be on the cover of Vogue,” West told Seacrest back in October.\n“If someone could start a petition to have Anna Wintour fired over this, society would appreciate it,” said @RunBritRun.\n“If you’re actually mad at Kim and Kanye’s Vogue cover,” tweeted @Kia_Mak, “go outside, start walking and don’t stop until you reach the horizon.”Added @PatrickSandberg, “Kim and Kanye refuse to accept the limitations people try to put on them and it’s inspiring.']"

The question on most people’s minds now is whether West somehow forced editor-in-chief Anna Wintour to put them there. It has been rumored for a while now that Kardashian’s family was pleading with the powerful editor to feature her.\n\nBut Wintour stated Friday that West had no influence on her decision to feature the celebrity couple.\n\nThe relationship between Wintour and the Kardashian family is said to be unfriendly. Rumors have circulated that Wintour consistently banned Kim from the annual Met Gala. She was able to attend in 2013 as West’s date. But then Kardashian was obviously cropped out of a picture when the fashion site made a “Best Dressed” list, showing that Wintour likely still has distaste for the curvaceous celebrity. That same year, Wintour reportedly deemed Kim “the worst thing since socks and sandals.”\n\nEven her sister Kendall Jenner 18, was featured in Vogue before the 33-year-old. Kendall did an online photo shoot for the elite Conde Nast magazine last month.\n\nWest has allegedly been vying to get his fiancé on the cover for some time now, telling Ryan Seacrest last year, “There’s no way Kim Kardashian shouldn’t be on the cover of Vogue, she’s like the most intriguing woman right now. She’s got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday.”\n\nBut Wintour, 64, released a statement on the cover, saying, in part, “As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancée on the Vogue’s cover. He did nothing of the sort. The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true.”\n\nSo after months of pining to be on the cover of Vogue magazine, Kim has gotten her wish. The soon-to-be bride even gives a glimpse as to what to will look like in her wedding dress, as she dons a strapless white Lanvin wedding gown. She shows off her 15-carat diamond ring as West lovingly embraces her from behind.\n\n""This is such a dream come true!!! Thank you @VogueMagazine for this cover! OMGGGGG!!! I can\'t even breath! [sic]"" Kardashian tweeted on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Us Weekly, West and Kardashian will be making May 24 the special day. The wedding will take place in Paris, less than two weeks before West’s 37th birthday.\n\nIn October, in front of her family and friends, West proposed by had a 50-piece orchestra play Lana Del Rey’s “Young and Beautiful,” before playing his own hit song “Knock Me Down.” The couple has been dating since last year, though they have known each other for around a decade. Kardashian was more than happy to say “yes,” later telling E! News, “Last night was truly magical!!! I am the luckiest girl in the world!

The glossy has released the cover of its April issue, and Kardashian stars, along with her fiance Kanye West. Kardashian is wearing a dress that looks more than a tad like a wedding gown she could wear for the couple's forthcoming nuptials, and her gobstopper of an engagement ring can't be missed either.\n\nKanye West and Kim Kardashian on the cover of US Vogue.

I can't even… http://t.co/CbD5ThUqor\n\nWhile the fashion world hasn't always been sure about Kardashian and her reality TV beginnings, West is in with Vogue editor Anna Wintour and has been campaigning hard for this to happen. He recently compared Kardashian to a modern Marilyn Monroe and has courted Wintour with lunch dates and concert tickets. Judging by a behind-the-scenes video of the photo shoot on the magazine's website, the couple have also given the magazine an AAA pass. The Annie Leibovitz images include the couple's daughter North and look like a fantasy version of their wedding photos, complete with private jets and sports cars.

Photograph: Jamie Mccarthy/Getty Images North America\n\nIt all raises the question of what she might wear on the big day itself – 24 May. While the dress Kardashian wore for Vogue looks like a classic bridal gown, we hope she'll choose something a bit more edgy for the actual event.

We are grieving privately… for the life of a successful, talented, kind, generous and extraordinary woman.”\n\nMick Jagger is grieving somewhat more publicly. He was on tour with The Rolling Stones in Australia when he received the news, and was reportedly “devastated.”\n\nOf course, the tour was cancelled, and Jagger returned to Los Angeles.\n\nUnfortunately, a dispute has now arisen over the funeral arrangements. Jagger wanted a small private ceremony in L.A., but the New York Daily News says that her family is making other arrangements. Scott’s family allegedly wants her to be buried near her childhood home in Utah.\n\nIf L’Wren Scott really did commit suicide because of money, that is more difficult to understand than if it was for reasons of the heart.\n\nEither way, it was a tragedy.', 'Contrary to some reports, the L’Wren Scott fashion business was not about to go bankrupt, so what was the real reason for her suicide?\nAccording to The Telegraph, a spokesman for the company said that prospects for business were “encouraging.” He insisted that there were no plans to close the business despite recent speculation.\nBut, If the claims that the business was solvent are true, then what was the real reason why L’Wren Scott hanged herself?\nL’Wren, 49, and Jagger, 70, had been together since 2001, which is an eternity in the entertainment industry.\nIf L’Wren Scott really did commit suicide because of money, that is more difficult to understand than if it was for reasons of the heart.']"

The decision for such a huge act as the Stones to cancel the dates comes with a cost however. Billboard places an estimate at $10 million in losses.\n\nMost of these costs come from deposits on venues, other prepaid rentals made in preparation for the tour, plus the potential cost of storing equipment until the dates can be made up. The band had reportedly hired 60 trucks for transporting its equipment around Australia, a $250,000 cost by itself.\n\nThe good news is that a band such as the Stones probably bought into an insurance policy to cover such an incident as this. These policies cover costs such as the venue deposits in circumstances ""beyond control"" of the band. These typically include sudden deaths of loved ones. Jagger had been dating designer L\'Wren Scott for 13 years prior to her death, which should be more than enough to justify the cancellation of the tour. It\'s morbid, but this is how these things are handled.\n\nPart of Billboard\'s estimates that went into the $10 million number was lost revenue from cancelled shows. The president of Frontier Touring, the Australian company running the Stones\' ""14 On Fire"" tour, has already stated that the company is looking to reschedule the band\'s dates for October and November. Even if the band loses $10 million on the recent cancellations, it can easily make that up in the 14-show tour. The group played only 23 gigs in North America during 2013, which brought in $126 million. Consider it\'s been nearly 20 years since the band played Perth or Adelaide, and you can bet the band will bring in a haul from those shows.\n\nSo no sweat.

That’s why I don’t understand. She was so full of life.” Still, Gauthier acknowledges, “L’Wren was private. She doesn t open herself up easily. You really had to be very close, to know her.”\n\nGauthier first met Scott more than 20 years ago when they worked together in Paris, where she was photographed by legendary photographers Helmut Newton and Guy Bourdain.\n\n“L’Wren was taller than the other models,” recalls Gauthier. “She had incredible proportions, incredible legs. She was always very confident. That s the way she was raised.”\n\nGauthier got a chance to meet Scott’s parents when Scott invited her friend to her Salt Lake City home for Thanksgiving more than 20 years ago, she said.\n\n“She had the sweetest parents,” says Gauthier, who remembers the homemade chocolates Scott’s mother served. Still, she says, Scott knew “her future was not there. She had other kind of ambitions. She had a lot of things in her head of what she could do.”\n\nRELATED: Mick Jagger & L’Wren Scott: Inside Their Love Story\n\nGauthier last saw Scott at a party in June, which the designer hosted at London’s Serpentine Gallery, with Jagger by her side. “You could see that they were very close,” says Gauthier. “They cared for each other very deeply. They had a strong relationship.”\n\nMany years ago, Scott once confided her desire for a family of her own. “She told me one time she would like to have a child,” says Gauthier. “This was over 10 years ago. But she was so discreet and very private. It wasn’t something she often spoke about.”\n\nAccording to a report in The New York Times, Scott had planned to announce she was closing her business this week. “It is difficult to be a designer of high-end clothes without a big group behind you,” says Gauthier of the pressure Scott was facing. “But she could have designed for someone else. She could have started again. She was so talented.”\n\nAfter all, it was her strength that Gauthier remembers. “She always moved forward,” says Gauthier. “She started from nothing. She became a stylist, then she designed clothes for movies and then a designer of her own line. She was always ambitious and thinking of the next thing. She really climbed up the ladder – all by herself.”\n\n“She was always very courageous, which is why I don’t understand what happened,” Gauthier admits. “I’m afraid she was keeping things to herself. She was so proud. It’s so sad because she could have done so much.”\n\n• With reporting by GILLIAN TELLING', 'Image zoom Doug Peters/PA Photos/Abaca USAIn the days since L’Wren Scott’s shocking suicide, loved ones have grappled with the loss of the beloved designer.\n“She was not the type to be depressed,” says her longtime friend, modeling agent Marilyn Gauthier.\nShe was so full of life.” Still, Gauthier acknowledges, “L’Wren was private.\nShe had a lot of things in her head of what she could do.”RELATED: Mick Jagger & L’Wren Scott: Inside Their Love StoryGauthier last saw Scott at a party in June, which the designer hosted at London’s Serpentine Gallery, with Jagger by her side.\nThey had a strong relationship.”Many years ago, Scott once confided her desire for a family of her own.']"

It came from her Mormon upbringing.\n\n“But when things started coming on top, Mick realised something was afoot. He shelled out millions trying to bail her out and the secret mortgage on the home was no different.\n\n“He paid it off straight away. It is the kind of man he is.”\n\nThe property was placed in L’Wren’s company name, Scottland Management, when it was bought in 2010.\n\nHowever on Valentine’s Day 2012, $1,250,000 (£757,000) was issued against the property.

36502,http://oxfordstudent.com/2014/03/22/fashion-and-mental-health-the-one-trend-nobody-mentions/,entertainment,"['Isabella Blow, Alexander McQueen, Ruslana Korshunova and now L’Wren Scott: all people working in the fashion industry who, as far as we know, committed suicide.\n\nThe fashion industry is, sadly, all too used to burying its own in circumstances like these. Alongside all the high glamour, excitement and fun of the business, there is an undeniable darker side. As well as those who have taken their own lives, countless others have suffered from substance abuse problems. Just think of John Galliano, whose antisemitic rant and subsequent downfall was largely attributed to his alcoholism, or the infamous shots of Kate Moss snorting cocaine. Then there are those whose mental wellbeing has been so compromised that they have had to leave their careers, like Christophe Decarnin, who left Balmain in 2011 amid rumours about his mental health. And all of this without even mentioning fashion’s poor record in terms of supporting models with severe eating disorders. Is there something about the fashion business which is simply not conducive to good mental health?\n\nNow it is of course reductive and even disrespectful to simply attribute L’Wren Scott’s death to her involvement in the industry, and the same goes for everyone else mentioned so far. Fashion is not unique in that many other careers have their negative impacts too, moreover there can be various reasons for someone’s depression or addiction which exist outside of the workplace. Yet it is still worth looking at the conditions under which the fashion industry operates and whether these might contribute to a lack of mental wellbeing amongst those who work in it.\n\nThe obvious issue, and the one most oft-quoted by the mainstream media, is the glamorisation which fashion bestows on unhealthy ideals. It is perhaps an inevitable result of a world which seeks to find the most beautiful and thrilling aspects of life, elevate them, and turn them into a product to be bought or else lusted after. We’ve all heard the horror stories of models eating cotton wool in pursuit of that elusive ‘sample size’. Then there’s the image of the typical ‘fashion party’, complete with free-flowing champagne and illegal substances in the back room. True, many editors have now agreed to codes of conduct, stating that they will not use models who are obviously suffering from eating disorders or addictions. But when the ‘heroin chic’ look of the ‘90s is still seen as part of such a desirable lifestyle, is it any surprise that many are still prepared to do anything to achieve it?\n\nAnother factor may well be the way in which the industry thrives on scandal. Whilst those who consistently and without controversy produce excellent results can be respected for their work, it is the designers who divide opinion that really grab the attention of the fashion press. The enfants terribles of fashion are lauded for their bad behaviour, but the pressure of maintaining this reputation can prove an immense strain. Designers are under an obligation to please their buyers, the press, their investors, and their own (often perfectionist) creative ideals. Even worse, in a world where taste changes twice a year, it is always possible that the fashion intelligence will move on, leaving last season’s wunderkind bereft of the attention to which they’ve become accustomed. Isabella Blow allegedly killed herself out of concern for her “waning celebrity status”; the anxiety of remaining ‘in’ with the crowd is perhaps nowhere more intense than it is in the fashion world.\n\nAnyone who has ever watched a documentary which goes behind the scenes before a fashion show will know that it’s a highly stressful environment. The issues noted so far contribute to that, along with the fact that the industry is growing in size. Over 250 designers currently show at New York Fashion Week, so the schedule is tight and competition is heightened. Fashion Week forces designers and their teams to work all hours to put on a show. Meanwhile models, photographers and journalists rush from show to show, often without eating anything, then drinking at after-parties late into the night – hardly a healthy way of doing things.\n\nNone of this is meant to provide a definitive reason for the tragic death of L’Wren Scott or others who have killed themselves, but it will hopefully shed some light on the less attractive aspects of working in fashion. There are still several benefits to being a part of the industry, and many thrive on the adrenaline-fuelled ridiculousness of it all, but it is always useful to re-evaluate how the mental wellbeing of those involved is being affected.

After he was done stomping his foot and pointing his finger in Johnny’s face, he then followed Weir into the bedroom and asked?”to lay with him in the biblical sense.”? The irony and shade of that response is not lost on my super duper liberal ass, Mr. Weir.? Well played!? When Johnny refused, the fight turned physical, and Johnny bit him in self defense.? Of course with the 5-0, marks are all that matters, and since Victor had a big chunk of skin fucked up, Weir was arrested.\n\nAfter Johnny tried to garner up sympathy from those who don’t feel all of this is moot since his sinning ass is going to hell anyway, an email sent from Weir to Voronov was “leaked” to TMZ.?

How could you ever move past such a breech of trust and love?? I don’t think I could.\n\nOf course, this is only the beginning of what is looking like will be my favorite story line this year.? Weir is now saying that Victor is threatening to do interviews himself unless Johnny pays him money (Victor says while both things were mentioned in the same phone call, they weren’t related.

He filed for divorce on February 12, while he was in Sochi.\n\nAnd in a sign that this split may be about to get uglier still, Weir\'s ex released an image of the bite mark he claimed the presenter inflicted on his arm.\n\n\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nSpeaking out: Former figure skater Johnny Weir appeared on Access Hollywood to talk about his divorce from his husband, who he claimed was emotionally abusive and relied on him to make money\n\nAttack: TMZ reported this picture shows the bite marks when Johnny Weir attacked his partner Victor Voronov\n\n\'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,\' he said. \'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in.\n\n\'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.\'\n\nHe said that while the damage couldn\'t be seen on his body, he was controlled emotionally and Voronov forced him to cut out friends, professional contacts and even his mother.\n\nHe added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police.\n\nA picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man\'s forearm.
