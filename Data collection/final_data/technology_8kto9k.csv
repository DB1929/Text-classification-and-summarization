Verizon and Sprint are also expected to offer pre-orders soon.\n\nAT&T\n\nAT&T begins pre-orders today and is offering the Galaxy S5 for $199.99 with a two-year contract and $649.99 sans contract. It’s also available for $25 per month with AT&T’s Next plans. If you want a companion smartwatch, you have three options to buy. You can opt for the Gear 2 for $299, the Gear 2 Neo for $199 and the fitness band Gear Fit for $199. The cellular will start shipping in early April.\n\nFurthermore, if you buy the bundle of the Galaxy S5 and Gear 2 or Gear 2 Neo, you can save $50. It’s a promotional discount and will run till June 5 or while supplies last at AT&T stores.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nAt T-Mobile, you can order the Galaxy S5 for $0 down with a new two-year contract under its Simple Choice Plan. It means you will have to pay 24 equal monthly payments ($0 down + $27.50/mo x 24; total $660). You can also purchase the flagship phone outright for $660.00. T-Mobile will begin pre-orders next week starting from March 24.\n\n“This thing is so hot we’ve already seen over a half a million pre-registrations for the Galaxy S 5,” said John Legere, president and CEO of T-Mobile. “That’s a lot of very smart people grabbing this opportunity to pay nothing down, save more than a grand over the life of the other guys’ contracts, and have T-Mobile pay off every penny of their family’s early termination fees. It’s a brilliant move.”\n\nVerizon and Sprint haven’t announced pricing or availability information, but has added a teaser page on its official websites. The phone is listed as “Coming Soon” on Verizon’s website while you can pre-register on Sprint.\n\nAre you pre-ordering the Galaxy S5 or Gear 2 watches?

Google worked a lot on the performance, for instance, it can run on devices with as little as 512MB of RAM, so if your device has many times that, such as the Galaxy S4 or Galaxy Note 3, it will run buttery smooth. Messaging and the phone dialer have also seen improvements; after all, Google Hangouts is up against some stiff competition.

31451,http://www.gforgames.com/gadgets/samsung-galaxy-f-existence-41172/,technology,"['Samsung Smartphones: Buying Guide Samsung has a myriad of Smartphones with different models which all have different versions and specs. For instance, you can get an A50 with a dual sim or single sim set up. It’s also available in two different ram sizes and capacities. While shopping by brand may narrow things down a little for you, shopping for the right Samsung smartphone can still be challenging. The following short guide should provide you with a cheat sheet. Not only can it be applied to Samsung phones, but you could use it as a reference for any other brand. Storage Capacity: How Much Can Your Phone Hold? The less capacity a phone has, the cheaper it’s likely to be. Most Samsung smartphones have expandable memories. Which basically means they have slots for micro-sd cards. The maximum is usually 512 GB. If you buy a Note 9 with 512 GB of onboard memory and purchase an SD card with 512 GB of capacity, you could establish an entire 1 TB of free space on your phone. I’ve never met anyone who needs that much space. Not even pornography addicts need that much space. But when you’re shopping for your phone, you need to analyze your own space requirements. Will you be loading the phone up with memes, videos, and music or are you just going to use it for day to day activities like chatting, using apps, making phone calls, etc. Always keep in mind that our needs change but luckily there’s cloud storage and micro SD cards to help us. So don’t waste your money on the 128 GB version of the phone, if you know you’re only going to use 10 GB.\n\nBattery Size: How Long Will Your Phone Last Between Charges? One of the most annoying things about smartphones is how many times you have to charge them during the day. Newer smartphones now come with larger batteries. If you know that you’re going to use your smartphone for a lot of gaming, video shooting, editing, and social media, you need to make sure that it can last a while before it prompts you to charge. This is important especially if you consider that most contemporary smartphones don’t come with user-removable batteries. What this means is that you can’t keep a spare battery which can be used to swap out a tired one. But you can get a power bank – which every smartphone user should have. The best way to determine potential phone usage and charge cycles is by looking at the battery’s capacity which is quantified and measured in milliamp-hours (mAh). The more milliamp Hours battery has, the longer it can last on a single charge. When you’re shopping for a Samsung smartphone, look for one with a capacity of 4000 mAh or better. It’s also important to find a phone with fast charging capabilities. It can take a while to fill-up a large battery – even longer if your phone doesn’t have fast charge. Ruggedness: Is Your Phone Water Resistant and Dust Proof? The first waterproof smartphone was the Sony Xperia Z. Today, every other phone has an IP68 rating. I guess people were tired of leaving their phones in rice. Personally, I’ve never had the need for a waterproof phone. As clumsy as I am, I’ve never dropped my phone in the toilet bowl, got it damp while camping or got pushed into a pool while it was one me. Maybe you face such problems. If you’re an outdoorsman then it might be important to invest in a rugged smartphone or at least a rugged cover. While the manufacturers have no problem in telling you how rugged and durable a phone may be, it’s still important to look at the IP code. The IP code, known as the International Protection Marking or the Ingress Protection Marking, quantifies and rates the amount of protection a casing, electronic device or enclosure has against dust, contact, water, and any other intrusions. The IP code is usually written as a string of four alphanumeric characters. Sometimes the IP marking can contain up to five characters. The first four characters are always mandatory. The first two characters are the IP indication (IP), followed by the first digit which is the solid particle protection(0-6), then second digit which marks the liquid ingress protection (0-9). The third digit marks mechanical impact persistence, is no longer used. The fourth character which is often denoted by a single letter is optional. It’s used to mark any additional protection.\n\nWhen you’re looking for a rugged or waterproof phone, you should use the above chart as a reference, especially if the only information the manufacturer has supplied you with is the IP rating/code. Frequently Asked Questions Is Samsung Coming Out With A New Phone in 2019? Samsung has already had a number of notable announcements and releases this year such as the Galaxy Note 10 (23 August 2019) and the S10 Plus (8 March 2019). But there’s still a lot to look forward to. In the coming months, Samsung is expected to release the Galaxy A60 (1 September 2019), Galaxy A90 (8 September 2019), Samsung Galaxy M60 (10 September 2019) and the highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy Fold (18 September 2019). Ultimately, the short answer is yes, Samsung is coming out with a new phone in 2019. They’re almost always coming out with new smartphones. Is Apple or Android Better? The answer depends on the type of user you are. Android is better for power users who want complete control of the way their phones work. Since Apple has a more limited range of smartphones than Samsung does, they can keep a tighter lid on their phones. Which means iPhones are a lot more secure and their operating systems and user interfaces tend to be less buggy. Even with its leaks in the past, Apple has still proven to be more secure than Android has been. If you want freedom, go with Android.

Even though the representatives of the South Korean phone maker didn't reveal the price of the Galaxy S5, they did announce that the handset will become available for purchase in more than 150 countries starting April 11.\n\nEven though some of British retailers revealed the Samsung Galaxy S5 price soon after the launch event, the pricing on the US market was unknown to the public so far. After it was rumored that the Samsung Galaxy S5 will be cheaper than its Galaxy S predecessors, two of the US carriers officially announced the smartphone's pricing, confirming that the S5 will have the same price point as the other Galaxy S smartphones.\n\nAfter AT&T said that they will start accepting Galaxy S5 pre-orders tomorrow, US Cellular officially revealed that they will be selling the Samsung Galaxy S5 at $199 on a two-year contract.\n\nThe carrier also said that they will be selling the Samsung Galaxy S5 in two color options, both being priced at $199 after you agree to sign a two-year deal with them. US Cellular is also throwing in $50 worth of Google Play credit. The S5 will become available for purchase on April 11, but if you want to pre-order it in order to make sure that you'll be among the first to get it, you can do it starting tomorrow, March 21.\n\nUS Cellular also announced they will be carrying the Samsung Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo, and Gear Fit smart wearables. While the Gear 2 will have a price tag of $299, the Gear 2 Neo and Gear Fit will both cost $199.\n\nAs a refresher, the Samsung Galaxy S5 features a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, it has a quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor clocked at 2.5 GHz, 2 GB of RAM, 16/32 GB of native storage expandable using microSD cards (up to 128 GB supported), and a 2,800 mAh battery.\n\nThe GS5 also comes with WiFi, LTE, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, microUSB 3.0, and IR blaster, plus a secondary camera with 2 MP sensor, and 16 MP primary shooter with 4K video recording support. The handset is running Android 4.4.2 KitKat out of the box customized with Samsung's TouchWiz UI. It's also worth noting that the Galaxy S5 also comes with fingerprint sensor and heart rate monitor.\n\nAs usual, Samsung squeezed quite a few software features under the hood of Galaxy S5: Ultra Power Saving Mode (promised to keep the smartphone awake for 24 hours with only 10% battery), Selective Focus (allows the user to choose the focus point after picture was taken), Private Mode (allows you to hide certain apps or files), and many other such goodies."", ""US Cellular Samsung Galaxy S5 Price Is $199 with Two-year ContractSamsung introduced their flagship smartphone for 2014 about a month ago, during the Unpacked 5 event held in Barcelona.\nEven though some of British retailers revealed the Samsung Galaxy S5 price soon after the launch event, the pricing on the US market was unknown to the public so far.\nAfter it was rumored that the Samsung Galaxy S5 will be cheaper than its Galaxy S predecessors, two of the US carriers officially announced the smartphone's pricing, confirming that the S5 will have the same price point as the other Galaxy S smartphones.\nAfter AT&T said that they will start accepting Galaxy S5 pre-orders tomorrow, US Cellular officially revealed that they will be selling the Samsung Galaxy S5 at $199 on a two-year contract.\nUS Cellular also announced they will be carrying the Samsung Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo, and Gear Fit smart wearables.""]"

They\'re also offering a $50 Google Play gift card to those who purchase the device.\n\nWe have also just learned that T-Mobile will be selling the Galaxy S5 for $0 down. That\'s a pretty good deal for a brand new flagship. Keep in mind that you will need to pay off the remainder of the device over the next 24 months. That monthly price will be $27.50 for the Galaxy S5. It appears as though this price is a special introductory deal available to those who pre-order. Pre-orders for the Galaxy S5 on T-Mobile will be starting on March 24th, which is only a few days away. T-Mobile will offer the Galaxy S5 with no contract, of course.

That number blew up to almost half a million names, according to T-Mobile\'s latest report. It\'s almost time to see if that number of people actually translates to the number of devices sold.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 offers users a fingerprint scanner for unlocking the device, as well as a heart rate sensor underneath the camera. Consumers will also get a 16-megapixel rear facing camera and a 2.1-megapixel front facing camera. The screen measures 5.1-inches and will feature Samsung\'s normal hardware home button. The overall form factor of the device resembles the Galaxy S4, however Samsung has decided to use a new ""perforated"" back for this flagship. Samsung has reported that they have sold 200 million Samsung devices worldwide. We\'ll have to see how many Galaxy S5\'s Samsung can sell after the launch date.

Both Samsung Electronics and SK Telecom are still mum on the situation.\n\nMost of wearable devices already on the market, including Samsung’s, are need to be paired to a smartphone (via Bluetooth) to perform most of the operations.

However, it didn’t gain any popularity at that time.\n\nThe market for wearable devices is growing and major companies are diving into it. Even, Motorola has introduced it’s Moto 360 with new design and features. Obviously, this segment is capturing the interest of consumers, but still very few people are willing to spend $300 (an average price of a smart watch) to buy a device that only serves as a companion for your smartphone.\n\nSee Also: LG G Watch for Google slated to launch in second quarter\n\nIf Samsung actually planning to release a smartwatch equipped SIM card slot, it will give a boost to wearable market.

This allows SMS, MMS, video chat, and group chat to all live in one cozy window.\n\n\n\nVerizon and AT&T customers are understandably frustrated that this update is taking so long to come to their specific carriers, especially considering the fact that multi-year contracts make it nearly impossible and very costly to switch to another provider.\n\n\n\nSeveral threads on Verizon\'s community forum express concern, with customers like Jmuscol1 discussing conversations they\'ve had with service reps, ""I spoke at length with a Samsung rep today, and the words \'Verizon adjusting features that they see fit\' and the words \'removal of Data Tethering\' and \'removal of Tabbed view of Settings\' seemed to make their way to light.""\n\n\n\nWhile Verizon has started the roll-out for some customers, a Verizon support team member joined the thread to reassure customers. ""We understand that updates are important,"" Sheritah_vzw wrote. ""As soon as we find out the software release information we pass it along to all of our customers. At this time, we do not have any additional information regarding the Note 3 and and software updates."" The support member then went on to supply a link to Verizon\'s general news page for any further developments that might come up from the company.\n\n\n\nBut AT&T\'s Kitkat update is still missing in action and is said to be delayed due to a major GPS bug that has plagued the AT&T version of the Galaxy Note 3 for several months now.\n\n\n\nAccording to reports, the issue arises when the GPS disconnects automatically during network switches from 4G LTE to 4G. The problem even occurs while the Galaxy Note 3 is charging, but AT&T has yet to fix the bug. Customers are so fed up at this point that a petition has been set up ot Change.org asking At&T to fix the GPS issues or provide the default Samsung OS until the fix is in place.\n\n\n\nDespite this type of negative publicity, it\'s said that AT&T is still selling these Samsung Galaxy Note 3s to customers.\n\n\n\nBut all may not be roses and rainbows for those who are able to get the update. Users are complaining of wi-fi connectivity issues, freezing apps, and severe battery drainage since downloading Kitkat.\n\n\n\nAccording to MobileBloom, one customer claims that his battery life dropped 70 percent in just three hours of sitting idle and only 20 minutes of internet browsing.\n\n\n\nVerizon is expected to finish rolling out the update to all of its customers today while AT&T\'s GPS problems are yet to be solved.\n\n', ""While Samsung Galaxy Note 3 users from T-Mobile, Sprint, and many other international carriers are enjoying the latest features of Android 4.4 Kitkat, both Verizon and AT&T have yet to roll out the anticipated update for all users.\nKitkat also brings an updated version of Google's popular Hangouts app, replacing Google Talk and other Messaging voice and texting apps.\nWhile Verizon has started the roll-out for some customers, a Verizon support team member joined the thread to reassure customers.\nThe problem even occurs while the Galaxy Note 3 is charging, but AT&T has yet to fix the bug.\nDespite this type of negative publicity, it's said that AT&T is still selling these Samsung Galaxy Note 3s to customers.""]"

Well, there's more news inbound, because Samsung has made an appearance, with the presence of a new User Agent profile called the SM-G750A spotted on it's servers. Judging from the device's code name, this looks to be developed for AT&T, and is either the Galaxy S5 Neo or the S5 Mini, with a screen resolution of 720 x 1280. If this is the S5 Mini, then the higher resolution will be an nice upgrade over the S4 Mini which had to make do with a paltry 4.3 inch, 540 x 960 screen with (256ppi).\n\nIt could be the Neo, the trimmed down version of the Galaxy S5, but I would put my money on it being the smaller screened S5 Mini for the following reason; the User Agent profile also revealed that the processor was a quad-core processor clocked at 2.3Ghz, which points towards a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800. To me, the Snapdragon 800 is too close in performance to the S5's Snapdragon 801 CPU, and you would think that Samsung wouldn't want to take the chance of an 800 equipped S5 Neo cannibalising sales from its more prestigious sibling. From past Neo variants, it would stand to reason that if and when the S5 Neo is announced, it will be powered by one of Samsung's proprietary Exynos processors. Naturally, as with all theories, this theory should be taken with an appropriately sized pinch of salt.\n\nAccording to the leak, the SM-G750A was running on Android Version 4.3 Jelly Bean, although when the device is formally announced you would expect it to be running Android 4.4 KitKat. Whilst this isn't exactly going to go head-to-head with Sony's highly praised Z1 Compact, if this is indeed the S5 Mini (and I believe it is), it would show that Samsung are perhaps finally understanding that there is a demand for a decently specced handset with a sub 5-inch display.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe S5 Mini or Neo is expected to be unveiled shortly after the Galaxy S5 is made available on April 11th. If it follows the S4 Mini pricing model, then it should retail for around £320($528). Do you have a preference as to which model it turns out to be?

Samsung\'s three-deep lineup of wearables can get pretty confusing, so here\'s a recap: The Gear Fit is the bracelet-style device with a curved AMOLED display. The Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo use the same form factor as the original Galaxy Gear, with the Gear 2 having a metal watch body and camera and the Gear 2 Neo having a plastic body and no camera. None of them are called ""Galaxy"" anymore because Samsung switched over to its self-made Tizen OS. (Got it? Good.)\n\nAll three watches are due out April 11, and we\'ve even got prices for two of them. The Gear 2 will be $299—the same price as the original Galaxy Gear—and the Gear Fit will come in at $199. This leaves the plastic Gear 2 Neo, which strangely doesn\'t have a price.\n\nNow on to Samsung\'s next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S5. Being a smartphone, the Galaxy S5 is at the mercy of the carriers. The first to announce prices and availability are AT&T and US Cellular. AT&T lists the on-contract price at $199.99 and an off contract price of $649.99. AT&T is running a promotion for the Gear 2: buy a Galaxy S5 and you\'ll get $50 off a Gear 2 or Gear 2 Neo. Preorders for the Galaxy S5 on AT&T start tomorrow, and it will ship in ""early April."" US Cellular preorders start tomorrow, too, but that company is much more specific about the ship date: April 11. You can expect AT&T and the rest of the US carriers to have launch dates around that time. The company doesn\'t seem to be doing a Gear promotion, but it will instead give you $50 in Google Play credits if you preorder an S5.\n\nThere\'s no doubt that the Galaxy S5 will sell millions of units, but Samsung\'s smartwatches may be another story. After seeing Android Wear and the Moto 360, does anyone want a Tizen-based Samsung Gear? We\'ll see.', ""The Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo use the same form factor as the original Galaxy Gear, with the Gear 2 having a metal watch body and camera and the Gear 2 Neo having a plastic body and no camera.\nBeing a smartphone, the Galaxy S5 is at the mercy of the carriers.\nAT&T is running a promotion for the Gear 2: buy a Galaxy S5 and you'll get $50 off a Gear 2 or Gear 2 Neo.\nThere's no doubt that the Galaxy S5 will sell millions of units, but Samsung's smartwatches may be another story.\nAfter seeing Android Wear and the Moto 360, does anyone want a Tizen-based Samsung Gear?""]"

You can get a Samsung Gear 2 for $299, a Gear 2 Neo for $199, or a Gear Fit for $199.\n\nDo you get: a) the Gear 2? b) the Gear 2 Neo? c) the Gear Fit? d) none of the above?\n\nThe Wide World of Wearables has a wide pricing landscape, but when it comes to wristbands it's coming down to dollars. The prices of Samsung's new wearables aren't surprising: the original Galaxy Gear cost $300, and the new version has extra features including a heart rate monitor.\n\nHow do these prices play out against other wearables? Let's check our favorite wearables list and see.\n\nAndrew Hoyle/CNET\n\nWatches: Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo fit right in\n\nThe newest Pebble watch, the Pebble Steel, is $249: more expensive than the Gear 2 Neo and Gear Fit, but less expensive than the Gear 2. It also has fewer features, lacks embedded fitness tracking, and doesn't have a color screen. The original Pebble is $149. The Gear 2 Neo, at only $50 more, seems like a really good deal.\n\nBut, the admittedly cool-looking Gear Fit, which is also basically a watch, is exactly the same price as the Gear 2 Neo. Odd, because the Fit is a more feature-restricted product. You could get the Gear 2 Neo and enjoy everything the Fit offers, plus apps, for the same price.\n\nThe Qualcomm Toq debuted at a lofty $349 but has since lowered its price. $299 is acceptable -- and $199 is quite reasonable -- for a smartwatch. We don't know what Google's sexy new Android Wear watches such as the Moto 360 will cost, but they bear watching. For Samsung, it'll have a big impact.\n\nAndrew Hoyle/CNET\n\nFitness bands: Gear Fit scraping the upper edge\n\nNow what about the Gear Fit? In the fitness-tracker landscape, $199 is a lot. But you could argue, easily, that the Gear Fit has more than any other band we've seen. The $149 Jawbone Up24 and Nike+ FuelBand SE don't have heart-rate monitoring, advanced notifications, or a color touch screen. The $179 Basis Band, a heart-rate-monitoring health watch, is chiefly fitness-focused and lacks the smartwatch extras. But, you can get pedometers, even ones with stationary heart-rate monitors like the Withings Pulse, for $99 -- or even less.\n\nI'd say $199 seems right for the Gear Fit considering all it could possibly do, even if I wish it cost less. But the Gear 2 Neo seems to throw a wrench into the gears, so to speak, of the pricing equation. I'm no longer sure what to get. Obviously, a lot depends on how these devices actually work, and we don't have review units yet. But it looks like Samsung has created a lot of choices...perhaps one too many.\n\nIf anything, these prices seem to make the Gear 2 Neo the most attractive item.

Nope, it's just Samsung's latest strategy to attempt to convince customers to buy their latest flagship device. Samsung really believes in their new device, the Galaxy S5, so much so that they're willing to tell you what you're current phone is missing by presenting it to you with an app that you can install on your current phone. The Galaxy S 5 Experience, as it's being called, sounds more like some sort of weird documentary or even a low budget Sci-Fi flick, but we assure you it is every bit not those things in the slightest. The app goes into detail about some of the most attractive features of the Galaxy S5 with menus and highlights of each one. You can select your category for the feature you want to know more about, and Samsung has graciously provided big beautiful images along with a description of the feature so it can shift the spotlight onto how great it would be, if you owned the phone that had them of course.\n\nThe app provides you with different categories to select from so you can learn more about the specific details that you want to pinpoint first. Perhaps you're really interested in one certain feature of the phone and want to know more. The categories listed are camera, speed, fitness, life, gear, and more, which consists of subcategories called additional features, gallery and accessories, just in case you wanted to check any of those out. Upon glancing through each category I found that there were hands on videos in most of them, as well as an option called Experience that walks you through an interactive slideshow on key details surrounding that specific feature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this a genius move on Samsung's part to rope more people in? You be the judge. It wouldn't be surprising though if this app helped them sell quite a few more handsets. Should any potential customer have missed any of the big announcements surrounding the phone, not to worry because they can learn about it here. And.. all the details are available right from people's finger tips. They don't have to do anything special to track down hands on videos or details about certain features. This won't be getting me to buy a Galaxy S 5 which is the intended purpose for the app, but it is well designed and put together nicely. The images are beautiful especially in immersive mode, and the hands on stuff is useful, jumping you straight to YouTube to watch the videos. If you were on the fence about the Galaxy S5 and want to know more, you can download the Galxay S5 Experience app free from the Play Store."", ""Samsung really believes in their new device, the Galaxy S5, so much so that they're willing to tell you what you're current phone is missing by presenting it to you with an app that you can install on your current phone.\nThe app goes into detail about some of the most attractive features of the Galaxy S5 with menus and highlights of each one.\nPerhaps you're really interested in one certain feature of the phone and want to know more.\nThey don't have to do anything special to track down hands on videos or details about certain features.\nIf you were on the fence about the Galaxy S5 and want to know more, you can download the Galxay S5 Experience app free from the Play Store.""]"

Check out our curated selection of the best Samsung Galaxy S5 deals.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 can be defined by one word: evolution.\n\nThe camera was evolved to give clearer, faster snaps. The fitness-tracking abilities of the S5 are enhanced over the Galaxy S4 by packing in a more powerful S Health app and a dedicated heart rate monitor on the rear. A fingerprint scanner adds to the most secure Galaxy phone ever made.\n\nThe battery is larger, the screen bigger and brighter, the processor quicker and the design altered.\n\nThe spec sheet certainly doesn't let it down: a 2.5GHz quad-core CPU, 2GB of RAM, a 2,800mAh (removable) battery, 16 / 32GB of memory (with up to 128GB extra through microSD), one of the world's most vibrant screens that's been extended to 5.1-inches and added biometrics.\n\nMud still penetrated the casing\n\nHowever, it's hard to point to one stand out feature that will grab the prospective user when they handle the Galaxy S5 for the first time.\n\nAnd now it's been in the market for a long time, and most places aren't even stocking it thanks to the fact the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S7 and now, the Samsung Galaxy S8 have emerged to take the mantle of flagship from Samsung, and both offer a much better experience and design.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5 price\n\nIf you're thinking of still picking the Galaxy S5, it'll set you back £190 in the UK, with the refurbished or second hand markets the place to get your hands on it.\n\nIt'll be about $220 for the same thing, and AU$350. It's a pretty woolly place out there when it comes to buying the Galaxy S5 as most places are running out of stock, so you'll be advised to shop around.\n\nThe thing is, it's packed with much older tech than other phones that cost the same, and it won't be getting an Android Nougat, nor will it receive Android Oreo, thanks to phones powered by Google's OS having a much shorter software upgrade cycle.\n\nSo really think about buying something like the OnePlus 3T instead - you'll be glad you've got something a bit newer.\n\nOK, let's get back to the original review. The phone does still have a lot going for it for the budget-minded and there are some things to consider if you're going for the older model.\n\nAlready sold? Check out the best Samsung Galaxy S5 deals here\n\nThe messaging around the launch of the Galaxy S5 was that Samsung had listened to the consumers and dialled down the gimmicks, focusing instead on what makes a phone special to the consumer.\n\nIt promised a 'fashionable' and 'glam' design, a camera that works in the way you'd want it to and strength through being water resistant.\n\nThere's also the small notion of an improved version - I was told that it was very likely the Galaxy S5 was going to launch with a Samsung Galaxy S5 Prime version in February, with oodles more RAM, a faster processor and QHD screen on board.\n\nHowever, that was pushed back (likely to do with issues in creating the screen in high enough volumes) and has since appeared in the South Korea-only Samsung Galaxy S5 LTE-A version. This one has a Snapdragon 805 CPU, a WQHD screen and all the high end features you can wish for. In short, it's the amazing phone I wish Samsung had announced originally and sold all over the world.\n\nYou can always look at the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, a smaller phone with equal power to the main Galaxy S5, but with a lower-res 720p screen. That's offset by a metal design, although only around the edge of the phone - and Samsung has gone once again for a light weight, rather than making it feel weighty and ergonomic in the hand.\n\nThat phone has a premium design fused with power under the hood - but with a sky high price and the lower-res screen.\n\nIs the Alpha better than the S5? Check out our Samsung Galaxy Alpha review to find out.\n\nThe new Galaxy Alpha, with a metal frame\n\nAnd if you want something a little smaller, then the Galaxy S5 Mini is still available in some places as well. It's a lot like the bigger brother, and the specs have only been dialled down slightly. It's not quite got the raw power but the design aesthetic is there and the heartbeat monitor as well - well worth checking out if you don't want to spend as much.\n\nBut enough of the competition: let's look at one of the key questions that Samsung needed to answer with the Galaxy S5: is it good enough in market that's becoming saturated with decent high-end handsets?\n\nThe water resistance will make a splash with a few buyers\n\nThe simple answer, from the second you hold it in the hand, is no – because the design simply isn't up to the same level as the likes of Apple and HTC.\n\nThat's only a small part of the story though, and underneath the hood Samsung has continued its play of stuffing all the latest specs in and optimising them in a way that doesn't suck down oodles of battery.\n\nWas this phone good enough to keep Samsung fighting with Apple at the top of the sales charts?

The company has done it in the smartphone market for years and recently applied the logic to its tablet game by launching the S Pen-packing Galaxy Note Pro and Galaxy Tab Pro. Customers who want a more hands on approach will likely go for the Galaxy Tab Pro and for users who prefer to use a stylus on steroids, the Galaxy Note Pro has that down with its S Pen.\n\nWhen Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 3 last September, it also introduced its first smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear. Samsung managed to get a lead on Apple and Google, but the Galaxy Gear failed to gain any traction with consumers, reviews were poor and it reportedly had an extremely high return rate.\n\nSamsung isn't going to let the Galaxy Gear ruin its smartwatch future, especially now that Google entered the market with Android Wear and the LG G Watch. The company launched the Gear 2 smartwatch and Gear Fit fitness tracker alongside the Galaxy S5. Samsung has just announced pricing and release date details for its wearables.\n\nThe Gear 2 and Gear Fit will go on sale April 11 and will retail for $295 and $197. Samsung initially said that the Gear 2 would be cheaper than the Galaxy Gear, but that's not the case. The Gear 2 has also dropped the Galaxy moniker since Samsung swapped out Android and is now using its Tizen OS to power the Gear 2. The smartwatch gets much better battery life than its predecessor who only managed to last one day on a charge, while the Gear 2 can now last between two and three days. Samsung has also tweaked the design, making for a lighter and slimmer smartwatch.\n\nThe Gear Fit is more focused on health fitness, but is able to receive notifications like texts a and calls. The device includes a heart rate monitor, pedometer, timer, and stopwatch. The Gear Fit will last around three to four days of normal use.\n\nThe Gear 2 and Gear Fit will join the Samsung Galaxy S5, which also just happens to get released on April 11.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The Gear Fit will set you back $197. Clearly, Samsung is confident in its new hardware. These prices are among the highest for such devices. There are two major shoes waiting to drop, however, which could reset the expectations of what wearables can do and what they should cost.\n\nThe original Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch hit the street last October with a price of $299. Some US wireless network operators offered it for less when bundled with a Galaxy Note 3 smartphone, but those packages still cost a minimum of $400. Its high price was one of the Galaxy Gear's biggest detractors -- it cost an average of $50 to $100 more than most competing devices, which made it a tough sell to many consumers.\n\nSamsung executives admitted this year that they had probably priced the Galaxy Gear too high, and they vowed to sell its successor at a lower price point. Clearly, that didn't happen.\n\n[Samsung is reportedly working on a cellular-enabled smartwatch. Would you buy one? Read Will Samsung Smartwatch Make Voice Calls?]\n\nAt $299, the Gear 2 costs more than the Pebble Steel ($249), the Sony SmartWatch 2 ($199), and the original Pebble ($149). Only the limited-edition Qualcomm Toq has a higher price point ($349). One can argue that the Gear 2 offers more functionality than either of the Pebble devices, which are limited to monochrome displays and lack cameras and heart rate monitors. The Sony SmartWatch 2 lacks a camera, too, but it has a full-color display and solid battery life.\n\nLooking at the Gear Fit, the $197 price point seems more reasonable. It has a smaller display than the Gear 2, lacks a camera, and has a more limited, proprietary operating system. However, it is important to classify the Gear Fit as a fitness band on steroids, rather than a slimmed-down smartwatch. Compared to other fitness bands, the Gear Fit is among the most expensive. The Jawbone Up 24, for example, costs $149, while the Jawbone Up and Fitbit Flex each cost $99. There are dozens of fitness bands that fall into the $50-$100 price range. However, none of these less-costly devices offer a curved, AMOLED touch display, and one could argue that the screen alone offsets the higher price tag of the Gear Fit.\n\nNow, about those two shoes… First, Apple has yet to enter the wearables market. It's been rumored to be prepping a smartwatch for more than a year, but nothing has shown up yet. Whatever Apple comes up with in terms of features and price point has the potential to disrupt -- or at least unsettle -- the current market. This is a big TBD that should be on everyone's radar at least until the fall.\n\nThen there's Google. Just this week, it announced Android Wear, a slimmed-down version of Android for wearable devices. The first Android Wear products will naturally be smartwatches, and Google has a number of hardware partners lined up to make Android-based smartwatches, including LG and Motorola. The LG G Watch and the Motorola Moto 360 will be the first two Google-backed smartwatches to arrive. Neither Motorola nor LG has provided pricing details, but Google offered a pretty good preview of what the watches will be able to do. If these devices are priced aggressively -- or even competitively -- against what's already in the market, they may just turn wrist-based wearables on their head.\n\nInformationWeek Conference is an exclusive two-day event taking place at Interop where you will join fellow technology leaders and CIOs for a packed schedule with learning, information sharing, professional networking, and celebration.

Most recently, reports out of Korea claim that the Galaxy S5 will sell for less than the Galaxy S5 did at launch.\n\nThere has long been speculation that the Galaxy S5 might be priced lower than its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S4. According to ZDNet Korea, the “factory price” for the Galaxy S5 is 800,000 won, approximately $744. Notably, when the Galaxy S4 released last April, it sold for 890,000 won in Korea, approximately $827. Though market pricing does not translate exactly from country to country, many often look at the pricing for Galaxy devices in Samsung’s native South Korea as an indication of global trends in pricing of the manufacturer\'s Galaxy flagship devices.\n\nReports have also surfaced for Galaxy S5 pricing in Taiwan. According to DigiTimes, the 16GB Galaxy S5 will sell for NT$22,900 and the 32GB Galaxy S5 will sell for NT$23,900; these prices translate to $750 and $780, respectively. Notably, the Samsung Galaxy S4 was priced at NT$21,900 during its launch last year, a price slightly lower than the price now suggested for the Galaxy S5. Keep in mind that these Taiwanese prices are not confirmed by Samsung.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung has revealed availability details for the Galaxy S5 in Canada. Eleven Canadian networks, including Rogers, Bell, Telus, Fido, Virgin Mobile, Koodo, MTS, Eastlink, SaskTel, Videotron and Wind Mobile will have the Galaxy S5 available on April 11. According to the manufacturer, the Galaxy S5 “will retail for $229 on select plans.” The Galaxy S5 will be available in Charcoal Black and Shimmery White color options.\n\nAbout the Samsung Galaxy S5\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 includes a 5.1-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display, 2.5GHz quad-core ARM chip (believed to be the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801), 2GB mobile RAM as well as 16GB and 32GB internal storage options with microSD expansion, and networking and connectivity, including 802.11ac MIMO and LTE Cat. 4 and a 2800mAh battery.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 is water- and dust-proof, with an Ingress Protection Rating of IP67. That means the device can function in water for up to 30 minutes in up to 1 meter of water. The 16-megapixel-rear camera on the S5 includes auto-focus technology, selective focus and HDR rich tone. The device also includes a 2.1-megapixel front camera. New sensors on the Galaxy S5 include a heart rate sensor and fingerprint scanner. The latter acts as a simple, yet effective means of security. Easy user verification with the finger scanner can speed up the online purchasing process. It also powers a ""private mode,"" which acts as a personal storage area for confidential documents as well as a ""kid mode,"" where parents can choose apps used by their children.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 is 142.0 x 72.5 x 8.1mm, 145g in dimensions, features USB 3.0 and runs the Android 4.4.2 KitKat operating system. The device’s exterior design features a perforated back panel and four color options: blue, white, black and gold. Samsung also has updated its onscreen environment with a less cluttered user interface and updated settings menu.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.', 'Most recently, reports out of Korea claim that the Galaxy S5 will sell for less than the Galaxy S5 did at launch.\nThere has long been speculation that the Galaxy S5 might be priced lower than its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S4.\nAccording to DigiTimes, the 16GB Galaxy S5 will sell for NT$22,900 and the 32GB Galaxy S5 will sell for NT$23,900; these prices translate to $750 and $780, respectively.\nNotably, the Samsung Galaxy S4 was priced at NT$21,900 during its launch last year, a price slightly lower than the price now suggested for the Galaxy S5.\nAccording to the manufacturer, the Galaxy S5 “will retail for $229 on select plans.” The Galaxy S5 will be available in Charcoal Black and Shimmery White color options.']"

Today, we came across the smartphone concept created by HS Design and it certainly follows the styling of an iPhone 4, 4S, 5 and 5S.\n\nYou can see the renders on this page that some people feel could be a bigger version of the latest iPhone design, so if we were to imagine an iPhone 6 phablet then this could very well be it if the design didn’t change by much. One Product Reviews reader stated, “Love this new Galaxy S6 concept, but it could release as Apple’s iPhone 6 phablet if they took away the Galaxy S6 branding”.\n\nWe previously looked at a possible iPhone 6 release date, and it was clear that many blogs claiming a WWDC 2014 launch were not understanding signals would be there from the supply chain by the end of March. There has been no production news for the 2014 iPhone to date, so you can almost certainly count on a normal fall release for the 8th generation iPhone.\n\nDo you think this Samsung Galaxy S6 concept looks like a bigger iPhone 5/5S? If so, would you like to see an iPhone 6 phablet designed similar to this concept, or do you want a more radical design change?\n\nYou can also see a recent iPhone 6 concept video below our previous article, which takes the “Air” naming to follow the approach with the iPad Air. Again, if you have any good names for the next-generation, then we’d love to hear them in the comments.\n\nOne clear difference between the iPhone 5S and this Galaxy S6 concept is the amount of plastic used. While we understand why Samsung uses plastic, personally, we would prefer to see Apple keep with the use of metal in their iPhone 6 / phablet design.\n\nHow many different ways can you design a smartphone? – this is another important question, especially considering Samsung has been attacked a lot for designing phones like the iPhone. We do expect differences of opinion from Product Reviews readers, but do you feel there’s now a limit on how unique you can make a phones design, or do you have ideas for an iPhone 6 or Galaxy S6 design that would be totally unique and an improvement over current hardware?\n\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts on the above concept and question, so leave a comment below and remember to keep connected to PR for any rumors, concepts, and news in the coming months. It is worth noting that we found the above design on Concept Phones.', 'It looks like someone has been imagining the iPhone 6 phablet design along the lines of Samsung’s Galaxy S6, which is thanks to a new concept that could very well be an Apple device without the clear Galaxy S6 writing.\nOne Product Reviews reader stated, “Love this new Galaxy S6 concept, but it could release as Apple’s iPhone 6 phablet if they took away the Galaxy S6 branding”.\nDo you think this Samsung Galaxy S6 concept looks like a bigger iPhone 5/5S?\nOne clear difference between the iPhone 5S and this Galaxy S6 concept is the amount of plastic used.\nIt is worth noting that we found the above design on Concept Phones.']"

And along with that announcement came information that everyone has been waiting for: the price tags.\n\nCompanies don’t usually give out pricing details until sometime near market launch, but Samsung might not have the luxury of time to play its cards right. Google has just announced its grand wearable platform, ingeniously called Android Wear, that many expect will usher in a new batch of smartwatches.\n\nIn Taiwan, Samsung isn’t being too coy about the pricing information and it has included those bits for everyone to see. The Galaxy Fit, a glorified sports wristband that is expected to appeal to sports-minded tech users, will be carrying a price tag of 5,990 TWD. That roughly translates to $196 when converted. Not that bad considering the amount of features in this thing. But some might still find the price a bit too high for a very limited device.\n\nPerhaps more questionable is the Gear 2, the Tizen-powered successor of the first Samsung smartwatch. It naturally fetches a higher price than the Gear Fit, but at 8,990 TWD, or around $294, it is almost near the Galaxy Gear‘s own price tag when it launched late last year. One can always argue that the improvements justify the price, but the Gear 2 might be a hard sell with the expected flood of Android wearables. Notable is the absence of the Galaxy 2 Neo, the camera-less sibling of the Gear 2, which could suggest a possible scrapping of the strange variant.\n\nSamsung has yet to confirm these figures for the US, though it is unlikely to stray too far from the Taiwanese prices, unless it suddenly cuts the price across the board. In the meantime, you can take another peek at our hands-on of the Gear 2 and the Gear Fit to check if these are wearable devices that you will be rooting for.\n\nVIA: ePrice', 'Samsung Gear 2 and Gear Fit price tag announced in TaiwanSamsung has just recently held a press event in Taiwan announcing its newest Gear 2 and Gear Fit wearables.\nIn Taiwan, Samsung isn’t being too coy about the pricing information and it has included those bits for everyone to see.\nThe Galaxy Fit, a glorified sports wristband that is expected to appeal to sports-minded tech users, will be carrying a price tag of 5,990 TWD.\nIt naturally fetches a higher price than the Gear Fit, but at 8,990 TWD, or around $294, it is almost near the Galaxy Gear‘s own price tag when it launched late last year.\nIn the meantime, you can take another peek at our hands-on of the Gear 2 and the Gear Fit to check if these are wearable devices that you will be rooting for.']"

And if the local prices for the Gear 2 and Gear Fit there match what we can expect here, then we’re looking at a price range that isn’t really that far off from the original Galaxy Gear.\n\nAt its big announcement over in Taiwan, Samsung has included the price tags attached to its latest wearable tech, something it has still failed to do in the US. The Samsung Gear Fit, which is a smart wristband designed for more active users, carries a lighter price of 5,990 TWD, or roughly $196. The Samsung Gear 2, on the other hand, has a rather hefty price tag of $8,990, which is around $294. This closely matches the price that its predecessor, the Android-powered Galaxy Gear, had when it launched.\n\nInterestingly, there have been some differences in Samsung’s Taiwanese event that may be indicative of changes in its lineup. For one, the price tag on the Gear 2 Neo was noticeably missing. It might be that Samsung is toying with the idea of scrapping the variant, whose only difference with the Gear 2 is the absence of a camera, which might not be enough to justify the costs of maintaining a separate device line. Other things that were missing are color options. In Taiwan, it seems that the Gear 2 will only be available in black and orange, while the Gear Fit will only be in black.\n\nPerhaps the most contentious piece of information above is the Gear 2’s price, which is nearly the same as the old Galaxy Gear. On one hand, the polish, improvements, and senors available on the Gear 2 might justify the still high price tag. On the other hand, Samsung might be looking at some very stiff competition, especially cheaper ones, once the market gets inundated with Android Wear devices.\n\nVIA: ePrice', 'And if the local prices for the Gear 2 and Gear Fit there match what we can expect here, then we’re looking at a price range that isn’t really that far off from the original Galaxy Gear.\nThe Samsung Gear Fit, which is a smart wristband designed for more active users, carries a lighter price of 5,990 TWD, or roughly $196.\nThe Samsung Gear 2, on the other hand, has a rather hefty price tag of $8,990, which is around $294.\nIn Taiwan, it seems that the Gear 2 will only be available in black and orange, while the Gear Fit will only be in black.\nPerhaps the most contentious piece of information above is the Gear 2’s price, which is nearly the same as the old Galaxy Gear.']"

The Samsung Galaxy S5 can help any user check his or her pulse. With iPhone, you can only possibly do this with the help of some apps.\n\n2. The S5 is waterproof! This simply means that unlike the iPhone, you can certainly wash it clean of any dirt, debris or bacteria. If you do this on the iPhone, you're sure to have it broken as soon as you dip it wet.\n\n3. Samsung's S5 comes with an SD Card Slot that can offer even larger than 128GB of storage which the iPhone, as everyone have always known, can't.\n\n4. The fingerprint scanner of the iPhone 5s is used to unlock the handheld device. But with the touch scanner of the Samsung Galaxy S5, the user can already pay online items with the help of the Korean tech's partnership with Paypal.\n\n5. Samsung Galaxy S5 allows the user to take better images with the Dynamic HDR and even have the effects shown on the screen. This has not been accomplished yet with iPhone.\n\nThe other amazing advantages of the Korean tech giant's newest flagship phone with regards to the Galaxy S5 vs iPhone 6 battle can be viewed via the Huffington Post UK.\n\nAccording to Gamer Headlines, the OS of the Galaxy S5 is a huge factor in reaching a high amount of sales for it this year. The S5 flagship phone of Samsung for the year is packed with pre-installed Android KitKat OS. Aside from its Samsung Galaxy S5 vs iPhone 6 duel, it can also most likely expect some competition from the upcoming Sony Xperia Z2."", ""The Samsung Galaxy S5 can help any user check his or her pulse.\nSamsung Galaxy S5 allows the user to take better images with the Dynamic HDR and even have the effects shown on the screen.\nThe other amazing advantages of the Korean tech giant's newest flagship phone with regards to the Galaxy S5 vs iPhone 6 battle can be viewed via the Huffington Post UK.\nAccording to Gamer Headlines, the OS of the Galaxy S5 is a huge factor in reaching a high amount of sales for it this year.\nAside from its Samsung Galaxy S5 vs iPhone 6 duel, it can also most likely expect some competition from the upcoming Sony Xperia Z2.""]"
31579,http://blog.programmableweb.com/2014/03/18/samsung-asks-devs-to-start-coding-watch-apps/,technology,"['Samsung and the Tizen Association recently made the Tizen Software Development Kit for Wearables available from the Tizen developer web site. The SDK supports any wearable running Samsung\'s Tizen operating system, but that\'s an extremely limited number of devices at the moment, with just the Samsung Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo smartwatches filling the space.\n\nSamsung debuted the two smartwatches at the Mobile World Congress trade show last month. Though the user interface of the Gear 2 looks similar to the Android-based Galaxy Gear released by Samsung in 2013, both new devices instead run Tizen. Tizen in a Linux-based operating system that Samsung has spent years developing with Intel. Samsung expects active Tizen developers to swoop in and create compelling apps for its new watches.\n\nAccording to Samsung, Tizen already has a decent amount of support, with 100 companies lined up to provide apps and services for the Gear 2 hardware when it goes on sale later this year. That\'s up significantly from the ""several dozen"" it claimed when the devices were first announced.\n\nCompanies from all sorts of industries - fitness, shopping, social media, music, news, sleep management - have stepped up to show their confidence in the new watches. Considering that last year\'s Galaxy Gear was the best-selling smartwatch, the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo have a solid chance of taking the early lead in 2014, too.\n\nFeedly is one such company. It is an RSS reader that for many replaced the now-defunct Google Reader. Feedly is already accessible from desktop browsers, as well as Android and iOS devices.\n\n""We built Feedly to help professionals, students and anyone with a curious mind find and follow the sources of content that matter to them,"" said Edwin Khodabakchian, co-founder and CEO of Feedly. ""Media is now being consumed everywhere, on every screen. We\'re excited to partner with Samsung and bring our world class reading and discovery platform to Gear 2 users.""\n\nKhodabakchian didn\'t say exactly how Feedly will work on the Gear 2 smartwatches, though one can imagine a steady stream of incoming notifications as news breaks.\n\niHeartRadio is another company throwing its support behind Samsung\'s new devices and Tizen operating system.\n\n""iHeartRadio is dedicated to providing even more access to the music, news and entertainment that our listeners love,"" said Brian Lakamp, Clear Channel’s president of digital. ""Wearables are an emerging access point for music fans, and Clear Channel continues to make iHeartRadio available everywhere our users are listening.""\n\nGiven the Gear 2\'s reliance of Bluetooth for media streaming, it\'s not too hard to envision how iHeartRadio will be put to task on the device to control music playback.\n\nThe Tizen SDK for Wearables runs on Windows, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X.

Samsung is targeting developers to create apps for the Samsung Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo and is promoting over 100 apps that are now available for these devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tizen SDK for Wearables is a comprehensive set of tools for developing Samsung Gear applications. It consists of the Tizen Wearable IDE, Emulator, tool-chain, sample applications, and documentation. The Tizen SDK for Wearable runs on Windows, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X.\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n\n\n\nWearable devices are paired with a host device, such as a smartphone or connected tablet, on which they depend for wider connectivity and various services:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gear Manager manages sending and configuring widgets on the wearable device.\n\nThe Wearable Manager Service receives and installs widgets on the wearable device, and forwards setting information to the Gear Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\nSAP (Samsung Accessory Protocol) provides a connection between the host and wearable devices and supports various connectivity technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth classic, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).\n\n\n\n\n\nApps also consist of 2 parts: host applications and wearable-side widgets. Usually, a wearable-side widget and a corresponding application running on the host device operate as a provider and consumer pair. Host applications are developed using the Android APIs, whereas the wearable-side widgets are developed using a Tizen wearable platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Package Structure\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tizen SDK for Wearable allows developers to develop the following types of Gear applications: Linked (Master-Follower), Integrated, and Standalone.\n\n\n\n\n\nGear applications for the Linked (Master-Follower) and Integrated type consist of a host-side application package (APK) and a wearable-side widget, while gear applications for the Standalone type are only wearable-side widgets.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked (Master-Follower) Type - The linked Gear application is not included with the general host application. Developers must install the general host application and the wearable-side widget separately.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrated Type - In an integrated Gear application, the host-side APK contains the general host application. When developers download an integrated Gear application, the general host application in the host-side APK is installed simultaneously with the wearable-side widget.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandalone Type - Developers can use the standalone type, such as a Clock app, when the Gear application does not need a general host application, and can operate independently.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertification Process for Testing Apps on Actual Devices\n\n\n\n\n\nCode signing protects an app from modification and ensures ownership during version upgrade process.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode signing is used in combination with device information. This ensures a signed application runs only on the test devices which are specified. It ensures an application cannot be distributed by someone else even though the application package is leaked.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sign code for an actual device, developers need to create a certificate. Developers can create a CSR(Certificate Signing Request) file and RSA key pair by using the Tizen IDE for Wearable with the actual device ID to test.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers can request a sign to a CSR to certificate authority(CA) by sending CSR file then, CA will return the signed certificate_registration.xml file. This mailing exchange process requires PGP tool to secure the information.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is registering the certificate_registration.xml file to the IDE. It will use RSA key in the host which is created at first step and generate a final certificate which enables the ability to test in actual devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Distribution through Samsung Apps\n\n\n\n\n\nGear Applications will be distributed through a slightly different Samsung Apps platform. A special Samsung Apps only for Samsung Gear has been constructed inside the Gear manager. Without getting confused with mobile apps, Gear users can easily find and download the specific Gear apps they want through this separate Samsung Apps.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app distribution process includes: 1) Connect to Samsung Apps Seller Office ; 2) Set up an account and login; 3) Prepare and submit app through ‘Add New Application’ menu; and 4) App distribution will be completed after the app is reviewed.\n\n\n\n', 'The Tizen SDK for Wearables is a comprehensive set of tools for developing Samsung Gear applications.\nLinked (Master-Follower) Type - The linked Gear application is not included with the general host application.\nIntegrated Type - In an integrated Gear application, the host-side APK contains the general host application.\nA special Samsung Apps only for Samsung Gear has been constructed inside the Gear manager.\nWithout getting confused with mobile apps, Gear users can easily find and download the specific Gear apps they want through this separate Samsung Apps.']"

The episode will feature a biography of one of history's most famous scientists, Isaac Newton. Edmond Halley, best-known for the comet named after him, is the other story told in this upcoming episode.\n\nAt the center of the upcoming episode is mankind's drive to understand the Universe. The show states the greatest reach of this quest is our quest to understand the Cosmos. At one time, every natural occurrence was attributed to the actions of Gods and mystic spirits. When Knowledge Conquered Fear tells the story of how the human race first reached beyond those simple explanations, to find a deeper answer, based on the scientific method.\n\nCary Elwes, famous for his role as Westley in the Princess Bride, will make a guest appearance on the third episode of Cosmos.\n\nThe host tells how Newton's laws of gravity, developed centuries ago, are able to make remarkable predictions today. These laws are used to predict our Milky Way colliding with the giant galaxy in Andromeda in four billion years. Tyson tells his viewers what we expect will happen when the giant clusters of stars collide, in the last peaceful age of our dying Sun.\n\nIsaac Newton was one of history's strangest characters. He developed two of the greatest ideas in science, and launched another branch of astronomy that has dominated research since his time. He also invented a telescope design that is in use today both in space-based observatories, and to bring low-cost telescopes to the masses.\n\nHowever, Newton spent much of his time on religious puzzles, trying to add dates together to find a chronology for events in the Bible. He was also prone to bouts of extreme anger and depression.\n\nEdmond Halley was 13 years younger than Newton, and was the first to calculate the orbit for the comet that now bears his name.

This swarm of rocks and ice glide gently around the outer edges of the Solar System, until they are nudged in toward the Sun.

In a Thursday interview with the Janet Mefferd Show, creationists group Answers In Genesis said that the show, currently hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, lacks scientific balance.\n\nThe creationists accuse the show and its host of being unfair to those who deny evolution. They also say that that the show isn’t giving adequate coverage to intelligent design and young earth creationism.\n\nAnswers In Genesis representative Danny Faulkner lamented that creationists aren’t being offered airtime to share their views on how the world was created and how life began. He added that creationists and their views “aren’t even in the radar for [Cosmos]”.\n\nHe complained: “[Cosmos] wouldn’t even consider [creationists] plausible at all!”\n\nDespite massive evidence for the theory of evolution, creationists insist that the world is only 6000 years old and that life was created by the Judeo-Christian God in 7 days. Creationists also believe that humans descended from a single couple, Adam and Eve.\n\nBecause they believe the Cosmos hasn’t been fair in portraying the other side of evolution, creationists are demanding airtime on the hit science show, saying that program must include religion-based answers creationists offer.\n\nAnswers In Genesis was recently in the scientific spotlight for organizing a, evolution-vs-creation debate which pitted its founder Ken Ham against Bill Nye the Science Guy, who defended evolution. Many found the debate unsatisfactory.\n\nCreationists argue that many world-renowned scientists reject the theory of evolution. One of them is Faulkner, who has a PhD in Astrophysics from Indiana University\n\nSome scientists who are also creationists are Raymond Vahan Damadian, physician and inventor of the MRI machine, cosmologist John Rankin and psychometrician Kenneth Royal.\n\nHowever, others argue against creationists that scientists do not have to be atheists to believe and understand evolution. Many scientists are Christians who also believe in evolution.\n\nThey also argue that creationists aren’t being offered “airtime” on Cosmos because their beliefs fall short of the scientific process.\n\nNevertheless, creationists continue to campaign for the biblical account of creation to be “equally” portrayed together with the theories of the big bang and evolution.\n\nDuring recent weeks, creationists were criticized for reportedly spending $120 million dollars on constructing a huge replica of the Noah’s Ark.

Here\'s the audio, via Right Wing Watch:\n\nAlthough there are scientists in a variety of disciplines who promote creationist beliefs, that\'s a different, more problematic, way of framing how science evaluates evidence. Tyson took on that issue in the first episode of his show:\n\nAs we\'ve touched on here before, Cosmos does take on the issue of religion in a very substantial way. And it doesn\'t deny the compatibility of faith, or the notion of God, with the scientific method. There are plenty of scientists who are also Christian without being creationist in the way that Ken Ham is, because there is little non-Biblical evidence to support any of the major tenets of young earth creationism. Instead, Cosmos posits that belief, any belief, trumps an individual or a society\'s ability to question, to accept and evaluate different ideas. Historically, those institutions limiting scientific advancement have included organized religion.\n\nThe best-case scenario for young earth creationism, as an idea that wants to be taken seriously, is that it continues to get ""equal time"" on the issue of evolution, despite the fact that the theory hasn\'t earned a place at the scientific table. Often, they\'ve been given some of the time they want. Cosmos, however, isn\'t going to give the creationists that satisfaction any time soon.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.', 'Mefferd then argues that Cosmos should have more of ""the old, ‘some scientists say this, others disagree and think this,’"" way of talking about evolution.\nTyson took on that issue in the first episode of his show:As we\'ve touched on here before, Cosmos does take on the issue of religion in a very substantial way.\nAnd it doesn\'t deny the compatibility of faith, or the notion of God, with the scientific method.\nInstead, Cosmos posits that belief, any belief, trumps an individual or a society\'s ability to question, to accept and evaluate different ideas.\nCosmos, however, isn\'t going to give the creationists that satisfaction any time soon.']"

31595,http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/cosmos-doesnt-duck-truth,technology,"['The TV series ""Cosmos"" is the product of huge choices about what to show and how to show it. Neil deGrasse Tyson, the brainy, avuncular host, steers a path aimed at those who know almost nothing about the universe\'s origins and those who have learned a lot. Perhaps the biggest divide he faces is between evolutionists and creationists. While it\'s tempting to assume that overwhelming evidence has put evolution in the driver\'s seat, the fact is that up to half of the population identifies with creationism on the surveys.\n\nThe question here was how Tyson would account for the birth and growth of the universe, up to and including the appearance of life on earth? Given the fact that the 13-part ""Cosmos"" is a commercial television venture, by Fox, audience appeal and the financial gains take priority. Tackling something like evolution head on could cause conflict and a loss of a big chunk of viewers.\n\nThe outcome remains to be seen, but Tyson\'s great credit, he didn\'t blink. He took the matter in hand and declared evolution not just a theory but ""a fact."" To add punch, he chose as an example of random selection the development of the eye over the eons. Creations have used precisely that example in an attempt to prove that organisms such as the eye could not have evolved. Under the theory of ""intelligent design,"" this religious explanation has argued that unless all the pieces of the fully developed eye were in place, nothing would work. The blind, in effect, would be leading the blind.\n\nTyson took the challenge, as have others such as the noted biologist Kenneth Miller at Brown University, to deny that theory with facts gathered along the great chain of Being. Primitive creatures saw things through rudimentary eyes. The mechanism was there from early on. In a ""let\'s make one thing clear"" manner, Tyson firmly staked the premise of the theory on Charles Darwin and his successors.\n\nHe further reached out to defuse creationists by declaring that a scientific proof had been a profoundly ""spiritual"" experience for him. He was no atheist, evolutionist opponent of things spiritual but someone who could embrace both.\n\nVisit EarthBeat, NCR\'s new reporting project that explores the ways Catholics and other faith groups are taking action on the climate crisis.\n\nThough it\'s doubtful that Tyson\'s testimony will change many creationists\' minds, his erudite, soft-spoken, respectful and often playful approach that at least invites changes of heart. He is caught up in the wonder of it all and that itself lends the program an ethereal, uplifting quality that could help mend the tear in American views toward creation.\n\nThat\'s a minor key in this huge symphony of the stars. To depict the adventures of this unimaginably vast space, the graphics are spectacular and the commentary succinct. Watching it with the premises Tyson has laid down makes it possible to affirm his story of the 13.8 billion years from the Big Bang with a Supreme Being involved with it somehow at every step', 'The TV series ""Cosmos"" is the product of huge choices about what to show and how to show it.\nGiven the fact that the 13-part ""Cosmos"" is a commercial television venture, by Fox, audience appeal and the financial gains take priority.\nHe took the matter in hand and declared evolution not just a theory but ""a fact.""\nTyson took the challenge, as have others such as the noted biologist Kenneth Miller at Brown University, to deny that theory with facts gathered along the great chain of Being.\nHe was no atheist, evolutionist opponent of things spiritual but someone who could embrace both.']"

31597,http://thestute.com/2014/03/20/neil-degrasse-tyson-please-speak-out-about-militarization-of-science/,technology,"[""I hope Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, launched on Fox launched two weeks ago, becomes a smash hit, as much so as the 1980 version of Cosmos, hosted by astrophysicist Carl Sagan. I also hope Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of the new series, uses his star power to ignite a much-needed debate about the militarization of American science.\n\nTyson, an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, is already one of the most prominent science communicators in the world. And yet he is so focused on celebrating science that he seems loath to delve into linkages—historic and current—between science and war.\n\nIn 2011 comedian Stephen Colbert asked Tyson whether scientists deserve to be depicted in movies as bad guys, who “lead us to the Terminator or… create the superbug that wipes out the world.”\n\nTyson replied: “When you part the curtains, at the bottom of all that, there’s a politician funding that research… We have scientists who invented the bomb, yes, but somebody had to pay for the bomb, and that was taxpayers. There were war bonds. There was a political action that called for it. Everyone blames the scientists.”\n\nTyson elaborated on these sentiments earlier this year, implying that scientists’ perspective makes them averse to violence. He told Parade Magazine that “when you have a cosmic perspective, when you know how large the universe is and how small we are within it—what Earth looks like from space, how tiny it is in a cosmic void—it’s impossible for you to say, ‘I so don’t like how you think that I’m going to kill you for it.'”\n\nTyson’s statement is “simply wrong,” historian of science Patrick McCray notes in an online “Letter to Neil deGrasse Tyson.” “Consider just one university—Caltech,” McCray writes. “Its physics department was entirely militarized during World War Two and churned out over 1 million of bombardment rockets. Caltech’s Willy Fowler (Nobel Prize, 1983) did pioneering work on nuclear reactions in stars; he also led a secret 1951 study to promote the use of tactical nuclear weapons in the event of a Soviet attack.”\n\nTyson’s attempts to distance science from war, McCray adds, represent “a total disservice” to his predecessor Carl Sagan, who “perhaps more than other scientists of his generation, understood and witnessed how his fellow scientists–especially physicists–had contributed to the arms race… Sagan used Cosmos as a warning for how science–as wonderful as it can be–can also be an awful awesome tool when misused or applied without any sense of humanistic temper.”\n\nBy “militarization of science,” I mean the skewing of science toward martial ends. According to the Federation of American Scientists, a Washington, D.C.-based watchdog group, the 2013 U.S. budget granted $140 billion to all agencies for research and development. More than half of that amount, $71 billion, went to the Defense Department. Another $2.426 billion was allocated to the Department of Energy for “Weapons Activities,” and $729 million went to the Department of Homeland Security for R&D.\n\nMilitary money supports not only physics but also biology, neuroscience and social sciences. Meanwhile, vanishingly few prominent scientists have taken a strong antiwar stance. Other than, perhaps, MIT linguist Noam Chomsky, who is 85, what major scientist today is criticizing U.S. militarism, and raising tough questions about science’s role in perpetuating war? Where is today’s equivalent of Carl Sagan?\n\nBecause historically they have benefitted from war, scientists have a special responsibility to seek war’s end. At the very least, scientists should publicly debate the pros and cons of doing war-related research. Tyson would be the ideal moderator for such a debate.\n\nTyson apparently fears that speaking out about U.S. militarism will undermine his role as a cheerleader for science. According to a recent profile of Tyson in The New Yorker, he “refuses to take explicit political positions in public, or to criticize elected officials, even those who reject evolution; he would rather invest his energies in creating a more enlightened electorate.”\n\nBut Tyson’s celebrity also gives him the opportunity to serve as science’s conscience, as Sagan did. As the historian McCray says in his letter to Tyson, “Cosmos and its promotion is going to give you a big bully pulpit. Use it wisely. Use it like Carl Sagan would have.”\n\n*Postscript: In next week’s column, I’ll post Tyson’s surprising response to this column.\n\nJohn Horgan directs the Center for Science Writings, which is part of the College of Arts & Letters. This column is adapted from one originally published on his Scientific American blog, “Cross-check.”"", ""I also hope Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of the new series, uses his star power to ignite a much-needed debate about the militarization of American science.\nAnd yet he is so focused on celebrating science that he seems loath to delve into linkages—historic and current—between science and war.\n'”Tyson’s statement is “simply wrong,” historian of science Patrick McCray notes in an online “Letter to Neil deGrasse Tyson.” “Consider just one university—Caltech,” McCray writes.\nBecause historically they have benefitted from war, scientists have a special responsibility to seek war’s end.\nUse it like Carl Sagan would have.”*Postscript: In next week’s column, I’ll post Tyson’s surprising response to this column.""]"

Let\'s take an eight-year look back at Twitter to see what the first-ever tweet was, and what happened after.\n\nJack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter wrote the first tweet ever in 2006: ""Just setting up my twtr,"" was what it said.\n\nIn 2006, Dorsey and Twitter\'s other co-founders were indeed just setting it up. The original idea for Twitter sprouted in February 2006 when Dorsey (still an undergrad at NYU) Noah Glass, Evan Williams, and Biz Stone began discussing the idea of using text messages to share statuses. The original idea is normally attributed to Dorsey, who called the idea ""status"" at the time.\n\nSoon after, the name Twitter first appeared in connection to the status update idea. Attributed to Noah Glass, the original spelling of Twitter was twttr, aping the spelling of another successful website at the time, Flickr. The first news covereage of Twitter happened just a few months after the original conception, when Glass told Om Malik of GigaOm about twttr. By August of the same year, Twitter is used to report a mild earthquake in California, giving people a sense of what timely information sharing Twitter could be used for in the future.\n\nThe next big thing to happen for Twitter, which got is current name when the founders (now without Glass) organized and acquired Twitter.com, would be the next March -- of 2007 -- at the South by Southwest Interactive event. This is usually seen as the tipping point for Twitter, as attendees found Twitter a great way to keep in touch with each other and learn about things that were going on at SXSW. Twitter got a big bump in publicity and usage by the end of SXSW 2007.\n\nAfter that, Twitter was spun off from a podcasting company into its own company, and soon the founders received a few million in venture funding, including Amazon.com\'s Jeff Bezos. Dorsey leaves as CEO within a year, and by 2009 Evan Williams is running the company.\n\nWilliams introduced Twitter to a much larger audience in early 2009, by going on Oprah with Ashton Kutcher (the first Twitter user to gain 1 million followers at that time).\n\nThe rest is pretty much history. Since 2009, Twitter has been one of the root causes of the Arab Spring and other demonstration-based political disruptions around the world, and the company continued to raise more funding in the next three years, while expanding its user base to over 100 million.\n\nBy the end of 2012, the year Facebook had its IPO, Twitter announced it had surpassed 200 million monthly active users, and soon after began acquiring smaller companies with valuable tools for the social media service. Finally, in late 2013, Twitter announced it was filling an IPO, which occurred at the end of last year.\n\nFor a short, illustrated version of Twitter\'s eight year history, put together by Mashable, check out this video:\n\n', 'Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter wrote the first tweet ever in 2006: ""Just setting up my twtr,"" was what it said.\nIn 2006, Dorsey and Twitter\'s other co-founders were indeed just setting it up.\nThe original idea is normally attributed to Dorsey, who called the idea ""status"" at the time.\nAttributed to Noah Glass, the original spelling of Twitter was twttr, aping the spelling of another successful website at the time, Flickr.\nFor a short, illustrated version of Twitter\'s eight year history, put together by Mashable, check out this video:']"

The new feature was first noticed by The Verge and, according to users who\'ve been selected as part of the test (so far it only seems to be rolled out on iOS devices), it looks like this:\n\nAdvertisers aside, most users across all social networks are kept in the dark when it comes to the most important engagement metric of all: knowing how many people actually saw what you\'re sharing. While plenty of indicators exist (likes, retweets, comments, favorites), the vast majority of users know very little about what happens when they broadcast an update out into the world. ""When you post on a social network, it\'s almost like trying to give a presentation from behind a curtain. You know who\'s invited and supposed to be listening, but you don\'t know who is actually there in the room,"" Stanford assistant professor Michael S. Bernstein told BuzzFeed last July after releasing a study that showed Facebook users drastically underestimate the size of their general audience, in part because they\'re afraid to know the truth. The decision to show users the number of views a post receives is just the latest in a long series of updates by Twitter designed to increase engagement and bring users back each month. The service recently placed favorite, retweet, and follow buttons prominently inside user timelines on its mobile apps, which, according to Twitter, has increased favorites and retweets by more than 35%. This increase in interactions might also be the reason Twitter finally feels comfortable making this type of metric public.\n\nFor all the potential for increased engagement, there\'s a good reason the ""total views"" metric has been seen as ""the number social networks don\'t want you to see."" Currently, the big social networks shield users from the total view metrics to protect from a potentially hurtful truth: that nobody sees your updates. Or even worse, that they see everything and they just don\'t care. But that concern may be dwindling with the rise in popularity of messaging apps like Snapchat, Kik, Line, and WhatsApp. As users get used to instant feedback through messaging tools like \'read receipts\' there\'s a possibility they have a more realistic idea of their audience size and level of engagement or that they\'ve become somewhat desensitized to constant feedback. Still, unlike Snapchat or WhatsApp, users on Twitter and Facebook often have bigger, more public networks. They\'re both broadcast platforms at heart and often feel much more like a stage or large public venue than a living room. By releasing view counts, Twitter is banking on the hope that users are okay sometimes speaking to an empty room or — worst case scenario — a room that\'s actively ignoring you.', 'According to reports from Twitter users across the service, the social network is experimenting with showing users the exact number of views each tweet receives.\nWhile plenty of indicators exist (likes, retweets, comments, favorites), the vast majority of users know very little about what happens when they broadcast an update out into the world.\nFor all the potential for increased engagement, there\'s a good reason the ""total views"" metric has been seen as ""the number social networks don\'t want you to see.""\nCurrently, the big social networks shield users from the total view metrics to protect from a potentially hurtful truth: that nobody sees your updates.\nStill, unlike Snapchat or WhatsApp, users on Twitter and Facebook often have bigger, more public networks.']"

31618,http://www.business2community.com/twitter/twitter-takes-video-marketing-0820211,technology,"['To rival Facebook’s push into video, Twitter is buffing up its video marketing offerings. Recently, this social media giant brought on YouTube executive Baljeet Singh as a product director in its revenue organization, where he will focus on three paramount tasks: making it easier for Twitter users to find and watch video, adding more video to Twitter via strategic partnerships, and selling video ad units. The company hopes that its increased focus on video will bring about growth in both profits and user base.\n\nOnline video ads are a high-growth area for social networks; eMarketer predicts such spending will surge by 40% this year. Overall, digital video ads will generate $5.75 billion. On a related note, the market research company expects social advertising revenues to grow 31% in 2014, with Twitter experiencing an 87.6% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nVideo will no doubt pave the way for this monumental increase, especially due to its effectiveness when included in a Tweet. Twitter analyzed the content of over two million Tweets sent by thousands of verified users across different fields over the course of a month. It found that, unsurprisingly, adding video, links and photos all result in an impressive boost in the number of Retweets. Tweets that included video specifically, received a 28% boost.\n\nBrands and marketers understand the value of incorporating video content into Tweets; now Twitter is out to impress prospective partners with advertising features such as promoted accounts and its newly announced in-line video for Amplify partners.\n\nRecommended For You\n\nRegister Now\n\nEarlier this year, Twitter introduced a feature that allows brands to promote their accounts rather than individual Tweets. This high exposure ad placement appears when users search for keywords related to the brand. Though this isn’t necessarily video related, it enables companies to reach a wider, more targeted audience (a perk most often associated with Facebook).\n\nTwitter’s latest feature, in-line video, will enable Android and iOS viewers to play video footage with just one click. According to a related article from ReelSEO, “The new initiative…is being rolled out in response to feedback Twitter received on the click-through rates of video previews. The site confirmed that previews of video content led to a 3x increase in watch rates and it expects the preview plus one-click option to improve CTR even further.”\n\nThe feature will be available to 60 major brands, including the NBA, as part of its Amplify video marketing program. As an added bonus, Twitter will host video content directly from its servers to ensure speedy playback.\n\nAs social media is the second most popular way people find videos online, utilizing Twitter’s video marketing features may prove invaluable to companies large and small. Though these features are not widely available as of yet, you can still take advantage of the high engagement rates associated with video in Tweets. People are hungry for video content and delivering it to them in easily digestible Tweet-form will ultimately encourage increased shares and interactions.', 'To rival Facebook’s push into video, Twitter is buffing up its video marketing offerings.\nThough this isn’t necessarily video related, it enables companies to reach a wider, more targeted audience (a perk most often associated with Facebook).\nAs an added bonus, Twitter will host video content directly from its servers to ensure speedy playback.\nAs social media is the second most popular way people find videos online, utilizing Twitter’s video marketing features may prove invaluable to companies large and small.\nPeople are hungry for video content and delivering it to them in easily digestible Tweet-form will ultimately encourage increased shares and interactions.']"

Today, Twitter rolled out once such oddity. By visiting discover.twitter.com/first-tweet, you can see the very first tweet you posted to your account.\n\nIn fact, you can see anyone’s first tweet. (tee-hee)\n\nAnd so, like any good citizen of the internet, I felt it was my responsibility to comb through the first tweets of every game developer worth following on Twitter to find the ones that really stuck out. As you’d expect, 99% of them are people saying “I’m on Twitter now” or “let’s see what this Twitter thing is about.” In an effort to represent the 99% (Occupy Twitter, people!), here’s what Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid and the upcoming The Witness first tweeted:\n\nNow that we have that out of the way, let’s see what those who weren’t ready to just greet their newfound Twitter friends had to say.\n\nRon Gilbert (Monkey Island, The Cave), Steve Gaynor (Gone Home) and even Phil Fish (Fez) – who also has the rare distinction of a ‘last tweet’ – decided to kick off their Twitter careers with a trip to the fridge.\n\nDavid S. Gallant’s first tweet seems almost prophetic. In January 2013 – nearly five years after joining Twitter – David was fired from his soul-crushing employment because his game I Get This Call Every Day mirrored his real life work experience a little too closely.\n\nBut like most of us, John Romero (DOOM) and Ken Levine (Bioshock) just want to get their game on.\n\nNotch (Minecraft) has a somewhat confusing first tweet. Grammar aside, who’s your hero Notch? Is it me?!?\n\nVlambeer (Luftrausers, Ridiculous Fishing) just wants to give you a good dino-sized scare.\n\nBenjamin Rivers’ first tweet is an interesting one. Did you know that in addition to creating Home and the upcoming Alone With You, he’s also an accomplished comics creator? This first tweet is a great reminder that not all game designers are just game designers.\n\nHideo Kojima (Metal Gear) was just so very tired of you pretending to be him on Twitter.\n\nAnd finally, there’s Tim Schafer (Broken Age, Psychonauts), a very obvious liar.', 'The #FirstTweet of your favorite game developersEvery now and then, the internet gets a funky little oddity that provides a surprising amount of amusement for what it is.\nBut like most of us, John Romero (DOOM) and Ken Levine (Bioshock) just want to get their game on.\nDid you know that in addition to creating Home and the upcoming Alone With You, he’s also an accomplished comics creator?\nThis first tweet is a great reminder that not all game designers are just game designers.\nHideo Kojima (Metal Gear) was just so very tired of you pretending to be him on Twitter.']"

31637,http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232355,technology,"['March 21, 2014 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nYou\'ve heard it before: If you have a business, you should be on Twitter. But what if you don\'t know a tweet from a snap?\n\nTwitter can definitely be a beast, but it doesn’t have to be. Think of the Twittersphere as a place where companies and people come together to share ideas, news, interesting stories and cat photos.\n\nIf you\'ve been on the sidelines, hopefully these tips below will give the confidence you need to enter the fray. If you\'ve been on Twitter awhile, here are some reminders of good practices.\n\n1. Put up a profile photo. Depending on your business, use a logo or a photo of yourself. The default “egg” graphic is a dead giveaway of your beginner status.\n\n2. Follow relevant brands & people. This is how you will see what others are posting and it\'s a good first step in cultivating relationships. It\'s also ok to unfollow people. If you\'re not enjoying what someone is saying, purge them and make room for someone else.\n\nRelated: The 10 Essentials of Twitter Etiquette\n\n3. Inject some life into your tweets. Of course your main goal is to sell products or services, attract new clients or broadcast your cause, but not every tweet has to be related to your business. Is your dog visiting your store or office? Tweet a photo of that. Come across a helpful article about how to structure your day? Tweet that and let your followers know why you liked it.\n\n4. Quality not quantity. Don’t have anything to say? It’s okay to keep quiet and let there be some dead air for a little while. That said, don\'t disappear off the map altogether; it\'s important your followers hear from you or they might forget you exist.\n\n5. Use hashtags sparingly. Hashtags are useful for social campaigns or for following along at events like the Oscars or conferences. But use too many and you’re bound to look desperate. Tweets with a massive amount of hashtags look like an ad (or worse, spam!) and your followers will blow right past it. More hashtag tips here.\n\n6. Include photos. Tweets with photos are more likely to get retweeted which will then increase your brands exposure. Keep in mind that Twitter recently adjusted its presentation to give more exposure to photos. If you use other people\'s photos, make sure you credit them.\n\n7. Interact with others. If someone mentions you in a tweet, say ""Thanks!"" If someone you are following shares a useful article, tell them! That is how you get noticed. On the flip side, if someone doesn’t respond to you, don’t sweat it. Everyone is doing a million things these days.\n\n8. Remember the big days and moments. If you don\'t know what to tweet about, try looking at the calendar. For example, when it is St. Patrick\'s Day, tweet something green (like your green shoes or green beer). If it the anniversary of your storefront opening, offer a special discount code to fans. You reached 1,000 followers? Awesome! Thank your fans for your support - and they\'ll likely start tweeting about you. Check out what is trending that day. (If you\'re using your phone, “Trends” can be seen when you swipe left; on the web, you\'ll find them to the left of your feed.) Do you have anything to add to the conversation?\n\n9. Be nice. Don’t fight. Everyone has bad days, but you don\'t need to take to Twitter to share yours. Of course this doesn’t mean you need to pretend everything is perfect either. There is definitely a balance…you’ll figure this one out! Important: Whatever you do, don\'t start or participate in a Twitter fight. Nothing good comes from that.\n\n10. Be patient. You know that most businesses aren\'t successful overnight. So know that you won’t amass tons of followers as soon as you sign up. That said, do not buy followers. It’s misleading and these robots don’t interact with you.\n\n11. Avoid politics. Unless you’re involved in politics, keep your views to yourself. Everyone has opinions, right? But most fans aren\'t following an Etsy shop for its views on Obamacare or a flower shop for its feelings on gun control. Strong opinions on divisive issues can be seen as off-topic and polarizing -- and could end up hurting business.\n\nOne important thing to remember is that it is just Twitter. It is definitely an important piece of your marketing plan, but it’s supposed to be fun, not a source of stress. A good rule of thumb is to think before you tweet so you won\'t say something you\'ll regret later. Have fun out there!\n\nRelated: 6 Steps to Finding Your Twitter Audience', ""But what if you don't know a tweet from a snap?\nIf you've been on Twitter awhile, here are some reminders of good practices.\nTweet that and let your followers know why you liked it.\nIf you don't know what to tweet about, try looking at the calendar.\nEveryone has bad days, but you don't need to take to Twitter to share yours.""]"

In honor of Twitter\'s birthday, here\'s a look at eight unforgettable Twitter fails.\n\n\n\n10 IT Leaders You Should Follow On Twitter (Click image for larger view.)\n\nEight years ago Friday, Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey published the microblog\'s first-ever tweet: ""just setting up my twttr."" Three days later, he uploaded an early sketch of the service to his Flickr account and detailed the evolution of his project, which began in 2000.\n\nOne night in July [2000] I had an idea to make a more ""live"" LiveJournal. Real-time, up-to-date, from the road. Akin to updating your AIM status from wherever you are, and sharing it. For the next 5 years, I thought about this concept and tried to silently introduce it into my various projects... The idea has finally solidified... and taken a novel form. We\'re calling it twttr... It\'s evolved a lot in the past few months.\n\nSince then, more than 240 million users have joined the service and send more than 500 million tweets each day. For brands, Twitter has become an indispensable communication tool, though not without some very memorable missteps.\n\nFrom rogue employees to poorly executed marketing campaigns, here\'s a look at eight unforgettable brand faux pas from Twitter\'s first eight years.\n\n1. McDonald\'s hashtag goes awry\n\nMcDonald\'s meant well when it launched a campaign in 2012 to promote the hashtag #meetthefarmers. McDonald\'s intended it to draw attention to the company\'s fresh produce guarantee. Later that day, it published a tweet that read, "" \'When u make something w/ pride, people can taste it,\' McD potato supplier #McDstories.""\n\nIt was that second hashtag that took off on Twitter and led to thousands of people tweeting McDonald\'s horror stories and other snarky posts. A statement from the McDonald\'s social media director explained that the promotion did not go as intended:\n\nWhile #meetthefarmers was used for the majority of the day and successful in raising awareness of the Supplier Stories campaign, #mcdstories did not go as planned. We quickly pulled #mcdstories and it was promoted for less than two hours. With all social media campaigns, we include contingency plans should the conversation not go as planned. The ability to change midstream helped this small blip from becoming something larger.\n\nHashtag: #lessonlearned\n\n2. JPMorgan Chase cancels Q&A\n\nJPMorgan could have learned a thing or two from McDonald\'s hashtag fiasco when, last November, it asked followers to send questions to an executive using the hashtag #AskJPM.\n\nThe company said it was an opportunity for college students to communicate with an executive. What the company didn\'t expect was the barrage of angry and snarky posts, including ""Can I have my house back?"" JPMorgan Chase cancelled the Q&A.\n\n3. Chrysler\'s temper tantrum\n\nNever confuse your personal Twitter account with your corporate Twitter account. That\'s the lesson one social media professional learned the hard way.\n\n[Social media can be a marketer\'s best friend or worst enemy. Read 10 Worst Social Media Meltdowns Of 2013.]\n\nIn 2011, Chrysler\'s official Twitter account posted a tweet that used inappropriate language and condemned Detroit drivers. The employee, who worked for the agency New Media Strategies, reportedly had a bad commute to work -- and presumably an even worse commute home after he or she was fired.\n\nChrysler later fired the agency, too, and NMS\'s CEO apologized: ""New Media Strategies regrets this unfortunate incident.

It also lists users who favourited, replied to or retweeted the tweets.While several third party social analytics services offer these features, this is the first time users have received a mail from twitter featuring usage statistics like the number of views. This is the first time that Twitter has started registering views based on the number of times a tweet is viewed individually or seen on the timeline.Twitter has also been sending an email newsletter titled ‘Here's what's trending on Twitter this week,’ in which it compiles popular tweets on the basis of engagement among the user’s Twitter connections.

Users are also encouraged to use the hashtag #FirstTweet.\n\n“Millions of prolific tweeters have made Twitter an exciting, fun and powerful place to connect with others,” says Gabriel Stricker, Twitter’s vice president of marketing and communications. “But each of you had to start somewhere.”\n\nIf anything, Twitter celebrated its birthday early — in November — when it went public in the most important technology offering since Facebook’s market debut in May 2012. Twitter has become an essential tool for celebrities, politicians and citizens to share information, opine and vent.\n\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper’s first tweet from 2008 promotes the Conservative Party of Canada’s website.\n\nToronto Mayor Rob Ford’s first tweet, as @TOMayorFord in 2010, is a link to a story about Scarborough from community paper Toronto Observer.\n\nQuestions remain over Twitter’s financial prospects and how the stock will perform once subject to quarterly earnings reports.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nOf course, no first tweet was more notable than the one posted by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on March 21, 2006, which happened to be the first tweet ever published. “Just setting up my twtr,” Dorsey wrote eight years ago. Ironically, Dorsey has been noticeably quiet on Twitter the past few months.\n\nDorsey, a computer programmer from St. Louis who is Twitter’s chairman, considers Twitter a “status updater, a way to say where he was and what he was doing. A place to display yourself, your ego.”\n\nTwitter co-founder Evan “Ev” Williams, a computer-obsessed Nebraska farm boy, has a different opinion. Twitter is a way to learn “where other people were and what other people were doing,” he says.\n\nTwitter has grown quickly in the last eight years, morphing from a simple social network to a public company, making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange late last year. As of last month, Twitter boasted more than 240 million monthly active users.\n\nRelated:\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nHas Twitter growth hit a wall?\n\nGet more business in your inbox Get the business news and analysis that matters most every morning in our Star Business Journal newsletter.

As with other forms of social media like Facebook and Instagram, checking your Twitter feed has become a daily ritual.\n\nToday, March 21, Twitter celebrates its eight birthday, and in doing so decided to give their ever growing followers a little treat. One of the disadvantages of Twitter is that the more you tweet, the harder it is to look back at the tweets you made years ago. Twitter has decided to give you a way to see your first tweet, and the first tweets of others including celebrities. By using the hashtag #FirstTweet and Using a Tweet Tool, you can look back to find your very first Tweet — or for that matter, anyone else’s. All you have to do is just type in your @username, or that of anyone — your best friends, favorite comedian, a celebrity or even presidents.\n\nTwitter had this to say about their anniversary, ""In 2006, people began to say a little something on Twitter through 140-character bursts of plain text. Eight years later, all of you have transformed Twitter into a place to discover new ideas, make real human connections and express yourself freely. So as we mark our 8th birthday, we’d like to say thank you — to you.\n\nMillions of prolific tweeters have made the Twitter platform an exciting, fun and powerful place to connect with others. But each of you had to start somewhere: Today we’re taking a look at some interesting first Tweets — first Tweets that sparked a conversation, used imagery to tell a story, or revealed unfiltered self expression.\n\nHere is Jack Dorsey, Co-Founder & Executive Chairman, Twitter’s first Tweet and 8 other memorable first Tweets — and here’s to you, for making Twitter all that it is.

31696,http://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/features/eight-years-on-twitter-becoming-the-story-498295,technology,"['Twitter marked its eighth birthday with the release of a tool that lets users check their - or anybody\'s - first tweet. Predictably, much like Facebook\'s 10-year ""Look Back"" video , the first tweets are being enthusiastically shared by users, but in these eight years, Twitter has really gone through a lot of change.Unlike Facebook, whose every change gets endlessly scrutinised because of the huge number of users, Twitter has always felt more like a niche community, and the changes haven\'t been discussed as much. The big exception would be late last year, when the company changed the Block functionality - vociferous community response got them to backtrack quickly.Since 2006 though, when Twitter got its start with founder Jack Dorsey first posted ""Just setting up my twttr"", the company has been adding functionality and making changes, and continues to do so. Late last year, Twitter held its IPO . Community practices like RTs and hashtags have been adopted steadily by the company.But this also make Twitter more confusing for people joining late - a jumble of terms such as RT, FF and other keywords that popped up at the beginning of tweets was simply confusing. Over time, much of this has already disappeared into the background, though some parts remain.A BuzzFeed report suggests that Twitter could be doing away with arcane conventions such as the @reply next, and bringing the scaffolding of the company in the background to focus on content.Along the way, Twitter has also been an invaluable tool for journalists. Twitter, more than any other social network, qualifies as social media. It\'s been the first point of information for things such a the Osama Bin Laden raid and the Boston Bombings. More recently, Twitter is also where most of us have been following news on the hunt for MH370.News organisations, brands and individuals are all using Twitter today, often at cross purposes. And in this process, Twitter is both a broadcast platform, and a source of news. When a company head tweets about a product, it\'s treated as an official confirmation; while a poorly thought out joke by a public figure can turn into a major story.Yet, while all this is happening, it is also developing as a powerful medium by itself. The Arab Spring supporters used Twitter to organise; here in India, political parties are seeding grassroots influence to build support online.Thanks to this, Twitter isn\'t just a source, but also a story in and of itself. When a ""selfie"" at the Oscars becomes the most re-tweeted tweet , readers want to know about it. When Katy Perry overtook Justin Beiber as the most followed celebrity on Twitter, that was news too.The question of whether Twitter conversations are fair game for reportage are quite complicated. The stance that most take is that ""Twitter is public"". But when most people have a following in double digits and their tweets usually stay within a circle of friends, is it correct to assume that the whole community actually sees Twitter in those terms?That Twitter is an important medium and one that deserves the focus that it is drawing right now is clear from the simple fact that many people in power want to ban it. Most recently, there have been widespread Twitter outages in Turkey after Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told supporters ""we will wipe out all of these,"" while referring to social media.China blocks Twitter, and Twitter was inaccessible in Egypt in 2011, during the Egyptian protests. In India, many Twitter accounts were blocked after violence in Assam in 2012, while UK Prime Minister David Cameron had threatened to block Twitter during the 2011 England riots.As Twitter continues to grow and change, its identity will go through more shifts, but for now at least, in its eight years, Twitter has already had a major impact on our lives, in ways both trivial and serious.', 'More recently, Twitter is also where most of us have been following news on the hunt for MH370.News organisations, brands and individuals are all using Twitter today, often at cross purposes.\nThe Arab Spring supporters used Twitter to organise; here in India, political parties are seeding grassroots influence to build support online.Thanks to this, Twitter isn\'t just a source, but also a story in and of itself.\nWhen Katy Perry overtook Justin Beiber as the most followed celebrity on Twitter, that was news too.The question of whether Twitter conversations are fair game for reportage are quite complicated.\nMost recently, there have been widespread Twitter outages in Turkey after Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told supporters ""we will wipe out all of these,"" while referring to social media.China blocks Twitter, and Twitter was inaccessible in Egypt in 2011, during the Egyptian protests.\nIn India, many Twitter accounts were blocked after violence in Assam in 2012, while UK Prime Minister David Cameron had threatened to block Twitter during the 2011 England riots.As Twitter continues to grow and change, its identity will go through more shifts, but for now at least, in its eight years, Twitter has already had a major impact on our lives, in ways both trivial and serious.']"

It\'s an amazing and enlightening experience browsing through all these first tweets. Perhaps the most impressive first tweet is the first tweet of all, which was posted by the company\'s founder Jack Dorsey at 4:50 p.m. on March 21, 2006.\n\n""just setting up my twttr,"" Dorsey famously tweeted. That legendary tweet has been retweeted 22,614 times and favorited 20,828 times in the past eight years.\n\nOver the course of his career, President Barack Obama often used Twitter to his advantage, communicating to his most loyal followers about his goals, actions and dreams.

Learn more at http://www.barackobama.com,"" Obama tweeted.\n\nOn a more frivolous note, the current queen of Twitter, Katy Perry\'s first tweet was more of a subtle jab at the microblogging platform than anything:\n\n""Just got into Berlin... feeling better thank you, have my vicks inhaler by my bedside... and P.S. I TWITTTTER! GAH. Such a follower!"" Perry tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, the king of Twitter, Justin Bieber\'s first tweet comes off as super outdated:\n\n""Check out my single ""ONE TIME"" on my myspace and spread the word for me.

But now, thanks to a new Twitter tool, you can zip back to the beginning in an instant.\n\nSimply go to first-tweets.com, enter in your Twitter handle, and your first tweet will be right there for you to be embarrassed by. (If you’re already logged into Twitter, the tool will fill in your handle automatically.) You can also look up the first tweet of any user with a public account. For example, here’s Digital Trends’ first tweet:\n\nThe launch of the #FirstTweet tool is part of Twitter’s eighth birthday celebration. As the company explains the launch on its blog, “Millions of prolific tweeters have made Twitter an exciting, fun and powerful place to connect with others. But each of you had to start somewhere: Today we’re taking a look at some choice first Tweets – first Tweets that sparked a conversation, used imagery to tell a story, or revealed unfiltered self expression.”\n\nAs exciting as that sounds (is?), Twitter’s #FirstTweet tool does have some limitations. You can’t look up your second tweet, for example. Nor can you embed tweets directly from the tool. You can, however, tweet out anyone’s first tweet, which I can only imagine creates some type of rift in the space time continuum that might collapse the universe in on itself, destroying everything everyone has ever loved, for all of eternity past and future.\n\nOkay, that won’t happen. What could happen is that whatever silly thing you happened to be into when you first discovered Twitter could come back to haunt you. For a lot of people, I imagine, the results are something along the lines of “Test” or “Giving this Twitter thing a try” or “Hello world” or some other #FirstTweet kind of thing. Whatever it is you posted, let this tool serve as a reminder that once something is on the Internet, it’s always on the Internet. So be careful what you say now – someone might just make it easier for it to come back and bite you where it hurts.\n\nEnjoy your first tweet!\n\nEditors' Recommendations"", 'But now, thanks to a new Twitter tool, you can zip back to the beginning in an instant.\nSimply go to first-tweets.com, enter in your Twitter handle, and your first tweet will be right there for you to be embarrassed by.\n(If you’re already logged into Twitter, the tool will fill in your handle automatically.)\nFor example, here’s Digital Trends’ first tweet:The launch of the #FirstTweet tool is part of Twitter’s eighth birthday celebration.\n), Twitter’s #FirstTweet tool does have some limitations.']"

First ever tweet\n\nNot the most exciting tweet, granted.\n\nBut it is significant none-the-less.\n\nCo-founder Jack Dorsey sent out the first ever tweet on March 20, 2006.\n\nAt that point, the company was called Twttr, without any vowels because the full version was owned by someone else.\n\nDorsey said Twitter perfectly encapsulated the concept of a micro-blog.\n\n""We came across the word \'twitter\', and it was just perfect,"" he said.\n\n""The definition was \'a short burst of inconsequential information,\' and \'chirps from birds\'. And that\'s exactly what the product was.""\n\n2. Hudson River water landing\n\n(Image: Twitter/JanisKrums)\n\nOn January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 hit a flock of geese as it left LaGuardia Airport in New York City.\n\nThe bird strike caused the plane to lose power in both engines and when the crew realised they would not be able to land on an runway, the decision was made to land on the Hudson River.\n\nAll 155 people were safely evacuated from the plane.\n\nBut one of the most remarkable features of this incredible tale, was that the first picture most people saw about the story had been posted on Twitter.\n\nJanis Krums, a Latvian businessman, was on a nearby passenger ferry which stopped to help.\n\nHe took a picture of the stricken passengers, huddled on the wing of the plane and uploaded to Twitter with the message: ""There\'s a plane in the Hudson. I\'m on the ferry going to pick up the people. Crazy.""\n\n3. Ashton Kutchner first person to reach 1million followers\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nAshton Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach 1 million followers in April 2009, after a race with CNN\'s breaking news feed.\n\nThe achievement was something of a PR stunt, with the actor filmed live as he bid for more followers.\n\nAt the time he was surrounded by his wife, Demi Moore, Soleil Moon Frye and Sean “Diddy” Combs.\n\nKutcher pledged to buy 10,000 mosquito nets to the Malaria No More Fund in return for reaching the landmark.\n\nHe has since gone on to posting such fascinating questions as ""Who would you rather have lead you into a UFC fight? Chuck Norris or Ralph Macchio?"" and pictures of a \'waffle taco\'.\n\n4. Arab Spring 2010\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nFortunately, Twitter has brought us more than just celebrity gossip.\n\nIt has also empowered people and arguably, toppled governments.\n\nIn spring 2010, huge numbers of protesters took to the streets in countries ranging from Tunisia and Egypt to Jordan and Libya, unsatisfied with years of inequality and corrupt government.\n\nThe result was the toppling of several regimes which had held power for decades.\n\nDemonstrators used Twitter to keep each other informed and organise protests, even when governments shut down internet access.\n\nIt also offered an unrestricted platform for political discussion.\n\n5. Haiti earthquake\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIn the aftermath of the enormous earthquake which hit Haiti, aid agencies found Twitter a huge help in driving donations.\n\nThe Red Cross, which had previously added only 10-50 followers a day, gained more than 10,000.\n\nIn less than 48 hours, the American Red Cross had received more than $35m in donations - including $8m directly from texts.\n\n""This breaks all world records for a mobile giving campaign,"" says their spokeswoman, Gloria Huang.\n\n""It\'s been incredible. People have donated more to Haiti than to Hurricane Katrina or the tsunami in Asia.\n\n""And Twitter has played an extremely significant part.""\n\n6. President Obama reelected\n\nThis tweet by President Obama\'s account, shortly after his re-election on November 5, 2012, became the most retweeted post of all time.\n\nHis message to his 22 million followers was retweeted more than half a million times.\n\nThe US election itself was the most tweeted about event in US political history, with some 31 million poll-related posts fired out throughout day.\n\n7. Mars probe finds ice\n\nAll historic announcements will be made on Twitter from now on, it seems.\n\nIn 2008 the site scored a major exclusive when NASA chose to use Mars Phoneix\'s Twitter handle to tell the world that ice had been found on the far-away planet.\n\n""Are you ready to celebrate? Well, get ready: We have ICE!!!!! Yes, ICE, *WATER ICE* on Mars! w00t!!! Best day ever!!"" the message read.\n\n8. Spoof accounts\n\nApart from all the serious stuff, Twitter has also become something of a comedic playground.\n\nAnd perhaps the most popular form of entertainment is the parody account.\n\nFootball figures are a particular favourite, with Arsene Wenger and Sam Allardyce both falling victim to Twitter accounts which make fun of their real-life counterparts.\n\nNotBigSam\'s foul-mouthed and hilarious tweets have attracted more than 150,000 followers since 2009.', ""Twitter is now the global town square - the place where any and every topic is discussed first.\nAshton Kutchner first person to reach 1million followers(Image: Getty)Ashton Kutcher became the first Twitter user to reach 1 million followers in April 2009, after a race with CNN's breaking news feed.\nHaiti earthquake(Image: Getty Images)In the aftermath of the enormous earthquake which hit Haiti, aid agencies found Twitter a huge help in driving donations.\nHis message to his 22 million followers was retweeted more than half a million times.\nYes, ICE, *WATER ICE* on Mars!""]"

But the micro-blogging site is making things more interesting by releasing a new tool that lets you find your first tweet - as well as the first tweets of anyone with a public account.\n\nJust navigate to the first tweet website and type in the Twitter handles of friends, co-workers, celebs, and other luminaries. My first tweet, from Sept. 2009, was about the FCC proposing new net neutrality rules, so some things never change, apparently. The first tweet from PCMag (pictured), meanwhile, from June 2008, was a link to a Michael Miller piece about dispelling iPhone myths and rumors.\n\nOver the years, a number of tech execs have jumped on the Twitter bandwagon, from Bill Gates to Tim Cook. Unfortunately, most peoples\' first tweets are somewhat boring; quick blips about getting set up, being forced to tweet, or a little self-promotion. But it is fun to take a trip down memory lane. In the grand scheme of things, eight years isn\'t a huge amount of time, but in tech, it can be a lifetime. Who knew that 140-character messages would have such an impact on (some of) our daily lives? Check out some of the first tweets from tech\'s biggest names.\n\nTim Cook: Apple\'s CEO just joined Twitter last year and has only sent out about 45 tweets. But many, if not all, of them garnered headlines, like this one about last year\'s iPhone launch.\n\nVisited Retail Stores in Palo Alto today. Seeing so many happy customers reminds us of why we do what we do. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) September 20, 2013\n\nBill Gates: The Microsoft co-founder was a few years ahead of Cook, making his mark on Twitter with a nod to the ""Hello World"" computer program. In four years, he\'s amassed more than 15 million followers with tweets that focus primarily on his philanthropic efforts.\n\n""Hello World."" Hard at work on my foundation letter - publishing on 1/25. — Bill Gates (@BillGates) January 19, 2010\n\nElon Musk: The real-life Tony Stark thwarted an imposter and claimed the @elonmusk Twitter feed in June 2010. Though he has since used Twitter to publicly battle his detractors - from The New York Times to NJ Gov. Chris Christie - he was quite pleasant in his first tweet, even inserting a smiley face.\n\nPlease ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 4, 2010\n\nEric Schmidt: The Google executive chairman - then CEO of the search giant - made his Twitter debut with a plug for an upcoming appearance on CNN. Schmidt is not a terribly prolific tweeter; having only posted 178 messages in just over four years, but has amassed about 783,000 followers.\n\nCNN GPS with Fareed Zakaria on Nov 29th, starts around minute 17; Fareed is a very good interviewer http://bit.ly/6GwGjn — Eric Schmidt (@ericschmidt) December 7, 2009\n\nSteve Wozniak: The Woz\'s first tweet was certainly not boring. But lest you think that the Apple co-founder is a regular at the dance studio, his message was a reference to his season of Dancing With the Stars, from which he was eliminated just a few weeks later.\n\nRare massage (for me), then dance practice. No pain, no gain. Awkward but fun, this dancing. I still can\'t do Macarena. — Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) March 7, 2009\n\nSteven Sinofsky: The former Windows chief unlocked his Twitter account just prior to the launch of Windows 8. But a presence on social media was not enough to keep him around at Redmond; two months later, he was out. He\'s not doing too bad for himself, though, with gigs at Harvard, Andreessen Horowitz, and Box.\n\nMarissa Mayer: Before she was Yahoo\'s CEO, Mayer was a Google exec taking in the sites in Baltimore. Mayer tends to tweet more than some of her CEO counterparts, but it\'s not usually anything personal and focuses largely on Yahoo products.\n\nDiscovered the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore -- extremely cool in terms of art and its philosophies (http://www.avam.org/) — marissamayer (@marissamayer) July 21, 2009\n\nMark Zuckerberg: It\'s probably not surprising that Zuck isn\'t the most active Twitter user. He\'s only posted 19 tweets since 2009, four of which were posted on that first day.\n\n@ooontz I knew you\'d be under ditka — Mark Zuckerberg (@finkd) February 13, 2009\n\nSean Parker: The Napster co-founder, who played an early role in the development of Facebook, gave a shout out (and apology) to Zuckerberg in his first tweet, arguing that Hollywood manager Scooter Braun made him do it.\n\nSorry Zuck, I had to do it eventually. (Actually @scooterbraun made me do it.) — Sean Parker (@sparker) October 3, 2011\n\nDavid Karp: The Tumblr founder had a similar first tweet, claiming that Betaworks founder John Borthwick pressured him into posting.', ""Over the years, a number of tech execs have jumped on the Twitter bandwagon, from Bill Gates to Tim Cook.\nUnfortunately, most peoples' first tweets are somewhat boring; quick blips about getting set up, being forced to tweet, or a little self-promotion.\nTim Cook: Apple's CEO just joined Twitter last year and has only sent out about 45 tweets.\nMarissa Mayer: Before she was Yahoo's CEO, Mayer was a Google exec taking in the sites in Baltimore.\nHe's only posted 19 tweets since 2009, four of which were posted on that first day.""]"

Little did he know that he was about to change the world.\n\nIn the eight years since, Twitter has become a tool of the masses. It is where the Arab Spring was sprung, it\'s where countless protests have been set up, it\'s where wrongdoing has been exposed and it\'s where pop music fans have declared their undying love for Justin Bieber, One Direction and, er, Kingsland Road.\n\nOkay, so it\'s not a perfect place, having had its share of embarrassing moments (#susanalbumparty springs to mind). By and large however it has proven a useful tool and for many an integral part of modern life\n\nHere\'s the story of Twitter in 15 tweets.\n\nThe very first tweet. The tipping point for Twitter\'s popularity came in 2007 however, when the minds behind it went to South by Southwest (SXSW) festival to show off the website. Twitter\'s usage boomed from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.\n\nHashtags are a key part of Twitter and have since been included in other social media platforms as well. They\'re crucial to Instagram and were recently added to Facebook too, allowing people to track events.\n\nOne such event was the Arab Spring, in which social media played a key part. This particular tweet, however, was an early example of Twitter justice in practice. James Buck was a student reporting on anti-government protests in Egypt when he and his translator were arrested. Buck sent this tweet, which quickly reached the masses and resulted in his university hiring a lawyer on his behalf. He was released the very next day.\n\nOne month previously, the Phoenix rover landed on the red planet in a quest for evidence of water. Its endeavours were successful, and on 20 June it tweeted the news that it had found ice ""WATER ICE"" on Mars. ""woo!!! Best day ever!!"" it said, rather embarrassingly.\n\nTwitter has long been a fantastic tool for journalists and citizen journalists alike. Pictures and video live from the scene, wrongdoings exposed in public, and millions calling out Katie Hopkins for being generally awful. Perhaps the most famous example was the above, as one man saw a plane, piloted by heroic Captain Chesley Sullenberger, crashland on the Hudson river.\n\nDuring the Iranian Revolution of 2009, Twitter become a valuable ally of the angry and oppressed. One such account, PersianKiwi, became a valuable source of knowledge from the scene, and was regularly cited by global media.\n\nAny old robot Rover can tweet from space. The first human to do so was astronaut Timothy \'TJ\' Creamer, who asked for questions while he floated aboard the International Space Station.\n\nOn the night of 1 May, 2011, rumours ran rampant on Twitter that the United States had at long last found al-Qaida\'s leader Osama Bin Laden. Long before President Obama made the official announcement, the news was already filtering through Twitter, with former wrestler The Rock even knowing about it before most.\n\nIn Pakistan, one man was also contributing to events, though he had no idea at the time just how momentous they were. Sohaib Athar first tweeted about a ""rare"" overhead helicopter, then later saw the funny side when he discovered he had, unbeknownst to him, liveblogged the Osama raid.\n\nThe first tweet from the top of the world (rather than orbiting it or from another one) came in 2011 when Kenton Cool produced the ""first tweet from the top of the world"" before indulging in some shameless promotion. I have no idea how he tweeted it, my fingers are usually too cold to type coherent sentences during a UK winter, let alone on top of a mountain.\n\nThe former holder of the ""most retweeted tweet of all time"" crown. Obama\'s confirmation of another four years in office also goes to show the strength of how tech savvy a president he is. In winning the presidency in 2008 Obama used social media brilliantly to connect with the powerful young vote.\n\nThe very first tweet from ""God\'s messenger on Earth"". Can\'t God use twitter himself? Such a lazy deity. Pope Benedict resigned as pope only two months later, clearly bitten by the social media bug.\n\nWell, of course this topped things off. At this year\'s Academy Awards Ellen DeGeneres decided she wanted to top Obama\'s tweet and so gathered some A-list buddies (and Lupita Nyong\'o\'s cheeky brother) to take part in a selfie. It should be noted however that ""Ellen\'s selfie"" is actually Bradley Cooper\'s, as he\'s holding the camera.\n\nIt has so far been retweeted nearly 3.5 million times. Ludicrous.', ""Twitter turns eight (Friday) and to celebrate this momentous-ish birthday we've collected the most important tweets in the website's history to tell the story of a social media giant.\nHashtags are a key part of Twitter and have since been included in other social media platforms as well.\nOne such event was the Arab Spring, in which social media played a key part.\nIn winning the presidency in 2008 Obama used social media brilliantly to connect with the powerful young vote.\nPope Benedict resigned as pope only two months later, clearly bitten by the social media bug.""]"

For news outlets, breaking stories has never been so immediate. Since Twitter only allows each message to be 140 characters, media outlets like the New York Times, CNN and others only have room for a one-line description of the news event.\n\nTwitter has also paved the way for the citizen journalist, or someone who happens to be in the right place at the right time with a smartphone that can take high-resolution photos or video. In just a minute, anyone can snap a photo of a traffic accident, tweet it and become the ""first to report"" the story.\n\nTwitter is also a brilliant marketing tool for budding professionals in all sorts of fields. Writers can showcase their blogs, build a following and try to generate ad revenue based on readership. Politicians can reach supporters directly no matter how far away they may be. Twitter has even made its way into the classroom, as it is an effective method for students in super-large lecture halls to pose a question to the professor.\n\nTwitter\'s underlying brilliance is its simplicity. The user has to get his or her message across in 140 characters or use another tweet to continue what you have to say.', 'Users are encouraged to post the link to the site and use the hashtag #FirstTweet.\nTwitter was founded March 21, 2006 and co-founder Jack Dorsey published the first tweet in the history of the social media site, naturally.\njust setting up my twttr — Jack Dorsey (@jack) March 21, 2006Here are the first tweets from some of the most followed accounts, according to TwitterCounter.com.\nWelcome to my new official Twitter page... — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) June 15, 2010testing — CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) January 2, 2007¡Bienvenido a Twitter en español!\nSince Twitter only allows each message to be 140 characters, media outlets like the New York Times, CNN and others only have room for a one-line description of the news event.']"

According to a post by Twitterrific developer Craig Hockenberry, the updates were originally going to be called “twits,” but were changed to “Tweet” following a request from Twitter lead developer Blaine Cook.\n\nAfter that change to the client, it still took Twitter several months to refer to the new term, and it took more than a year for the company to first use “tweet” without quotation marks around it.

The company ended the December quarter with 241 million monthly active users (MAUs), up 30% year over year, with the majority, 184 million, via mobile. The 241 million users was up just 9 million from the prior quarter, not a terribly strong growth rate.\n\nEven worse was the fact that Twitter ended the quarter with 54 million users in the U.S., up just 1 million from the third-quarter.\n\nThe company noted that it reached 148 billion timeline views, a year-over-year increase of 26%, as advertising revenue per thousand timeline views reached $1.49 in the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of 76% year over year.\n\nFor the quarter, Twitter earned 2 cents a share on $242.7 million in revenue during the quarter, as advertising revenue surged 121% year over year to $220 million. Data licensing rose 80% year over year to $23 million.\n\nOn the company\'s earnings call, Costolo noted that some users were having a hard time figuring out the service, and that over 1 billion people had tried the service, and stopped using it.\n\n""For users, we will continue to make the product easier to use and introduce new capabilities that we believe will preserve the experience that core users love while making it easier for new users to understand the product and experience the unique content on our platform right away,"" Costolo said on the call.\n\nOn the call, Costolo laid out four platforms that separates Twitter from other social networks, including the fact that it\'s the only platform that is ""simultaneously public, real-time, conversational and widely distributed.""\n\nIn order to continue enhancing those themes, Costolo noted that Twitter already had a number of initiatives underway to improve them, and make it a more user friendly experience. He mentioned the sign-up process as something that needed work. Once users have signed up, the ""onboarding process"" needs to be better, which Costolo noted leads to ""significantly higher growth over time.""\n\nTwitter has by and large been a text-based social network, but the company is working on making it more visually engaging, and has done so by incorporating pictures into tweets to help drive timeline view growth.\n\nOther initiatives include making Twitter easier to communicate on, both public and private, as well as organizing content. Recent users have noted that the @ signal, long a core of how people use Twitter to respond to others, has been going away in their responses.

31800,http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0322/Huge-chicken-dinosaur-a.k.a.-Mesopotamian-feathered-demon-discovered,technology,"['A beaky, crested dinosaur nicknamed the ""chicken from hell"" has been discovered in both North and South Dakota.\n\nThis was not a ""chicken"" you\'d want to stumble across in the barnyard: The new dino, dubbed Anzu wyliei, was about 11 feet (3.5 meters) long and about 10 feet (3 m) tall. It boasted a flashy head crest and probably wore feathers. Anzu wylieli lived at the same time as Tyrannosaurus rex, but was more lithe and graceful, said study researcher Emma Schachner.\n\n""It\'s a fairly delicate animal compared to the large predators that were living at the time,"" Schachner, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah, told Live Science. [Avian Ancestors: Dinosaurs That Learned to Fly]\n\nFinding a new species\n\nAnzu wylieli\'s story starts about a decade ago with paleontologist Tyler Lyson, now at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of Natural History. Lyson and his team were digging in western North Dakota near the Montana border when they discovered six bones of an unknown species. Schachner worked with Lyson to analyze and classify the bones, and the pair presented the findings as a new species at a paleontology conference soon after.\n\nAt the conference, Matthew Lamanna, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, came over with surprising news: Those six bones were not the only example of this new species out there. A private collector had found two nearly complete skeletons of the same animal in South Dakota, and the Carnegie Museum had just acquired those fossils.\n\n""Matt came over and said, \'Oh my gosh, this is the same specimen that Carnegie spent a lot of money to buy,\'"" Schachner said.\n\nThe researchers agreed that it made no sense to name the species based on six bones when two nearly complete skeletons were awaiting analysis. They worked together over the next decade, also meeting up with the Smithsonian\'s Hans-Dieter Sues.\n\nNaming the hell chicken\n\nThat work has finally come to fruition, with the researchers publishing their findings March 19 in the journal PLOS ONE. It is the first time Schachner has been involved in the naming of a dinosaur.\n\n""That\'s one thing, when you\'re a little kid, you kind of always dream of doing,"" she said.\n\nThe creature has two namesakes. The first, Anzu, translates to mean ""Mesopotamian feathered demon."" The new fossils were not found with feathers, Schachner said, but the dinosaur\'s close relatives had them, and it\'s highly likely Anzu wylieli did, too.\n\nThe second part of the name, wylieli, refers to a boy named Wylie, the grandson of a major donor to the Carnegie Museum. The researchers did kick around some joke names before settling on Anzu wylieli, however. A favorite, Schachner said, was Phobo gallus, which roughly translates to ""fear chicken.""\n\nThe Anzu bones were found in an environment that was once a swampy floodplain. The dinosaur lived during the Late Cretaceous, between about 100 million and 66 million years ago. It was likely omnivorous, eating plants, eggs and perhaps small animals. One of the specimens was found with debris of shells and tiny vertebrae between its ribs and pelvis, but the scientists aren\'t sure whether these fossils represent gut contents or whether they simply washed up next to the dinosaur bones.\n\nThe bones do, however, show evidence of the dinosaurs\' rough-and-tumble existence. The North Dakota specimen has what looks like a broken and slightly healed rib. One of the South Dakota specimens shows bony healing suggesting trauma to the toe.\n\nAnzu wyliei is part of a group called oviraptorosaurs, which are closely related to birds. The dinosaur is also part of an oviraptorosaur subgroup called the caenagnathids, which are an ""enigmatic group of dinosaurs,"" Schachner said.\n\n""They\'re not really well-known,"" she said. ""This is a strong addition to the group where you have the anatomy clearly detailed.""\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

It had a head shaped like a bird’s, a toothless beak, an odd crest on its cranium, hands with big sharp claws, long legs for fast running and was probably covered in feathers.\n\nIt is the largest North American example of a type of bird-like dinosaur well known from Asia. Its extensive remains offer a detailed picture of the North American branch of these dinosaurs that had remained mysterious since their first bones were found about a century ago, the scientists said.\n\nWhat would someone think if they encountered this creature that lived 66 million years ago? “I don’t know whether they would scream and run away, or laugh, because it is just an absurd-looking monster chicken,” said University of Utah paleontologist Emma Schachner, one of the researchers.\n\nAnzu wyliei measured about 3.3m long, 1.5m tall at the hip and weighed about 200kg to 300kg, the researchers said.\n\n“It has the nickname ‘the chicken from hell’. And that’s a pretty good description,” said paleontologist Matt Lamanna of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, who led the research published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\n“If you could get in a time machine and go back to Western North America at the end of the age of dinosaurs and see this thing, I would say your first reaction might be, ‘What a weird looking bird,’” Lamanna added. “It would not look like most people’s conception of a dinosaur.”\n\nScientists think birds arose much earlier from small feathered dinosaurs. The earliest known bird is 150 million years old. This dinosaur’s bird-like traits included a beak, hollow leg bones and air spaces in its backbone, said paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History.\n\nIts bizarre head crest resembled that of the cassowary, a flightless bird native to Australia and New Guinea.\n\nFossils of feathers are extremely rare and they were not found with any of the three partial skeletons of Anzu wyliei. But the researchers believe it had feathers based on fossils of close relatives from China that have clear evidence of them.\n\nA mounted replica skeleton of the new oviraptorosaurian dinosaur species Anzu wyliei on display in the Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibition at Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. – Reuters/Carnegie Museum of Natural History Asian cousins It closely resembles its Asian cousins like Oviraptor, whose fossils have been found brooding over a clutch of its eggs in a bird-like manner. The Asian part of the family includes many well-preserved examples, from ones as small as a turkey to one even bigger than Anzu wyliei. The North American branch until now had been represented by largely fragmentary remains. Anzu wyliei lived at the sunset of the age of dinosaurs, not long before an enormous meteorite is thought to have struck Earth about 65.5 million years ago and wiped them out along with hordes of other creatures, while sparing many birds. It lived in a humid, warm, low-lying environment dotted with rivers and swamps that may have looked like the Louisiana bayou. It was lush with vegetation and plant-eating dinosaurs like the horned Triceratops, armoured Ankylosaurus, dome-headed Pachycephalosaurus and duck-billed Edmontosaurus. But also hanging around the neighbourhood was one of the fiercest predators in Earth’s history, Tyrannosaurus rex. Anzu wyliei may have been an omnivore, munching on leaves, fruits or flowers while also swallowing the occasional mammal foolish enough to cross its path, the researchers said. It probably needed to be careful not to end up on someone else’s menu. “To a T. rex, this thing would not look like a ‘chicken from hell.’ It would look like lunch,” Lamanna said. Its genus name, Anzu, is named after a feathered demon in Sumerian mythology. Its species name, wyliei, honors the grandson of a trustee of the Carnegie museum in Pittsburgh where the lead researcher works. The three sets of bones – which together included almost all parts of the skeleton – come from a region famed for dinosaur remains known as the Hell Creek Formation of the Dakotas and Montana.

Speculation for Pandora\'s fate ranged from a small loss of incremental opportunity in a fast-growing streaming market to the more extreme opinion that Pandora simply wouldn\'t be able to compete and its users would inevitably fall off.\n\nSix months since iTunes Radio\'s launch, Pandora has thrived. Not only has the stock soared 25% since iTunes Radio launched, but users have continued to grow, too. In the company\'s most recent quarter, Pandora monthly active users hit an all-time high of 76.2 million. Even more, Pandora\'s fourth-quarter revenue was up 50% from the year-ago quarter as monetization improved across all dimensions of Pandora\'s business.\n\nBut even after all of Pandora\'s success, the company said in a recent court filing that it still considers Apple a ""major competitor,"" according to AppleInsider. Based on a particular data point that was also revealed in the trial, Pandora has an excellent reason to feel iTunes Radio is a threat.\n\nThe main threat to Pandora\'s future\n\nForty percent of Pandora\'s users access the service through Apple hardware. What happens if Apple beefs up iTunes radio and makes it both more accessible and more compelling? Could this convince a large chunk of these Apple hardware Pandora users to switch to iTunes Radio?\n\nThere is a very good chance iTunes Radio will improve significantly this year. The service is just six months old and has only been featured on one major version of iOS so far. As is typical for the company, Apple\'s native apps will likely benefit from major redesigns when it launches the next version of iOS.\n\n9to5Mac\'s Mark Gurman is one of the first to chime in on one of the key changes iTunes Radio will see this year -- a change that could give iTunes Radio a significant advantage over Pandora on Apple hardware. Gurman says iTunes Radio will get a stand-alone app.\n\nAs a stand-alone application, users will be able to more quickly access iTunes Radio. Psychologically for users, iTunes Radio will be its own app competing with the likes of the Pandora, Spotify, and iHeartRadio apps found on the App Store.\n\nMeanwhile, Pandora\'s recently announced price changes couldn\'t be timed any worse. The company said in a March 18 blog post that it is boosting its price of its ad-free listening experience for new members by 25% in May, giving Pandora a total cost of about $60 per year. Meanwhile, iTunes Radio\'s ad-free annual fee is just $25.\n\nCan Pandora withstand a revamped iTunes Radio?\n\nOn non-Apple devices, absolutely. But as Apple improves iTunes Radio along with its integration and accessibility, it will be increasingly difficult for Pandora to keep its user base on Apple hardware. And, unfortunately for Pandora investors, that user base accounts for nearly half of its listeners.\n\nWhile I love Pandora and personally use it in place of iTunes Radio, a risk profile like this makes the stock itself too risky.', ""Before Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched iTunes Radio, investors were uncertain about the implications Apple's streaming music service could have on Pandora (NYSE:P).\nNot only has the stock soared 25% since iTunes Radio launched, but users have continued to grow, too.\nThe main threat to Pandora's futureForty percent of Pandora's users access the service through Apple hardware.\nCould this convince a large chunk of these Apple hardware Pandora users to switch to iTunes Radio?\nThere is a very good chance iTunes Radio will improve significantly this year.""]"

Launching iTunes on Android, meanwhile, would only benefit Android users, and Jobs certainly had no interest in making Android users happy.\n\nThis apparently took a new turn in the meantime, and it now seems that Apple is no longer so firm in its position to skip Android when it comes to the availability of its iTunes.

In addition to this they are apparently considering launching an Android app for the streaming service to go along with the launch of the service itself, all in an effort to attack the declining sales of US iTunes music downloads according to sources that are close to the matter. People still use iTunes? All jokes aside, it has been difficult for apple to compete with services that offer streaming music at a low price, as the music libraries are competitively similar in size, and listening is unlimited, all for a small monthly fee. Downloading the same number of songs through iTunes that you would have at your disposal with a service like Spotify would take massive amounts of money, even with most songs on iTunes being available as singles with most as low as $0.99 a hit.\n\nIt's interesting to hear these possibilities as Apple and iTunes have always been known to be a partnered exclusive company and service. While Google's popular Google Play Music is available on multiple platforms including Mac, Windows, Android and iOS, Apple's iTunes is only accessible to those who use iOS devices or Mac computers. They have effectively closed themselves off from other possibilities for quite some time, and it used to work for them when they were the dominating force in digital music.

It looks like the time may come where Apple in some form may end up having to play with Google and Android on the play ground in a way they never thought they would. Apple's decisions on whether they will begin to create and implement such a streaming music service that offers unlimited listening from a vast library of music is all in the early stages of discussion still, but would it really come as a shock to anyone if they decided to go through with it?

""Some of it goes into ground water but most of it will drain into rivers, or evaporate.""\n\nThe apparent slowing of sea level rise coincided with what the U.N. panel of climate experts calls a hiatus in global warming at the Earth\'s surface, when temperatures have risen less sharply despite record emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\n""The slowdown in sea level rise ... is due to natural variability in the climate and is not indicative of a slowdown in the effects of global warming,"" Nature Climate Change said.\n\nMany scientists suspect that the ""missing heat"" from a build-up greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is going into the deep oceans as part of natural variations in the climate.\n\nBut, because water expands as it warms, that theory had been hard to reconcile with the apparent slowdown in sea level rise.\n\nSea levels have risen almost 20 cms since 1900.

That defies both my knowledge of the subject and what I have observed over the past 35 years.\n\nI don’t know where Fulks found his information. I could not find any such conclusion from NOAA. So I looked at 65 years of data from NOAA for Portland and found that the average annual temperature has climbed two degrees Fahrenheit since the 1950s. In addition, the number of days above 90 degrees has increased steadily from about seven days per year in the 1950s to 15 days annually over the last decade, and days below freezing have declined from about 45 days to 30 days. Salem has climbed more than one degree, mostly since the 1980s.\n\nEven if Fulks did find a location that bucks the trend, it wouldn’t disprove global warming. It is well-established that carbon dioxide traps heat in the earth’s atmosphere, and that we are adding more every day. But that heat may be distributed unevenly, so there may be some locations that aren’t warming. One must look at surface temperatures for thousands of locations around the globe, not just at one cherry-picked location.\n\nOne must also look at other indicators like ocean temperatures, acidity of oceans, rising sea levels, stratospheric temperature, melting of the Arctic ice cap and the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, receding of glaciers, and the proportion of record high temperatures compared to record lows. Scientists also account for volcanic emissions, urban heat island effect, variations in the solar cycle and other factors to separate natural from human-induced climate change. When scientists look at all these factors comprehensively, the conclusion is inescapable – humans are warming the planet.\n\nThe scientific process is rigorous. Hypotheses and data must meet strict standards and be reviewed by other experts. If challenges can be answered and others can replicate the results, the theory is accepted. If not, it is rejected. Thus scientific knowledge advances step-by-step.\n\nIn this manner, an overwhelming consensus on climate change has emerged. Ninety-seven percent of 12,000 scientific papers on climate change in professional journals in the last decade provide evidence for human-induced climate change; most of the rest are neutral or inconclusive. All the major scientific organizations across multiple disciplines concur, including the National Academy of Sciences, American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Meteorological Society, World Meteorological Organization, American Physical Society, Royal Society, and the International Panel on Climate Change, among others. Even the military, insurers and others have commissioned reviews that verify the findings. While a few lone diehards still refute the body of science, no major scientific organization I know of disagrees.\n\nAs to the reasons for the welcome rebound in salmon runs in the past few years and whether it is permanent, I will defer to fisheries experts. All I will say here is that, while improving ocean conditions certainly help, it is not due to the end of global warming.\n\nJohn Kaufmann lives in Salem and can be reached at jrkaufmann@yahoo.com. He has worked in the energy field for 35 years with the Scientists Institute for Public Information, Oregon Department of Energy, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Some small island states are expected to face very high impacts,” the report says.\n\nIn addition, it warns that cities face particular problems, saying, “Heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, as well as drought and water scarcity, pose risks in urban areas with risks amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas.”\n\nThe report adds that this latter forecast is made with very high confidence.\n\nFurther, climate change will slow economic growth, further erode food security and trigger new poverty traps particularly “in urban areas and emerging hot spots of hunger.”\n\nThis combination of a high-risk region and the special vulnerability of cities make coastal Asian urban centers likely flash points for future conflict and hardship as the planet warms up this century.\n\nAcrid plumes of smoke, produced by forest fires triggered by drought and other factors, are already choking cities across Southeast Asia. In future, this problem is likely to get worse, say the authors.\n\nThe reports warns that other climate change effects will be global.\n\n“Climate change throughout the 21st century will lead to increases in ill-health in many regions, as compared to a baseline without climate change,” it states.\n\n“Examples include greater likelihood of injury, disease, and death due to more intense heat waves and fires; increased likelihood of under-nutrition resulting from diminished food production in poor regions; and increased risks from food-borne and water-borne disease,” it adds.\n\nOther potential crises highlighted include the likelihood that yields of major crops, such as wheat, rice and maize, are likely to decline at rates of up to 2 percent per decade, at a time when demand triggered by world population increases is likely to rise by 14 percent.', 'People in coastal regions of Asia, particularly those living in cities, could face some of the worst effects of global warming, climate experts will warn this week.\nThe report — “Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” — makes it clear that for the first half of this century countries such as the U.K. will avoid the worst impacts of climate change, triggered by rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\nAcrid plumes of smoke, produced by forest fires triggered by drought and other factors, are already choking cities across Southeast Asia.\nThe reports warns that other climate change effects will be global.\n“Climate change throughout the 21st century will lead to increases in ill-health in many regions, as compared to a baseline without climate change,” it states.']"

Unfortunately his piece is long on rhetoric and makes a number of unsupported factual claims.\n\nHe decries the term ""flat earthers"" applied to climate skeptics, but then uses the equally pejorative term ""alarmists"" throughout his piece. If he wants to debate this issue in a spirit of ""calm analysis"", he should dial down his own inflammatory rhetoric.\n\nAbout half of Hurwitz\' column is devoted to rhetoric about the importance of skepticism in scientific progress, which no one denies. He makes only a few factual claims, which fall apart when examined closely. For example:\n\n1. ""Lack of warming over the past 17 years."" This claim cherry-picks 1997, the hottest year on record, as the base line. If you consider the last 40 years, and average out the annual ups and downs, the long-term warming trend becomes evident (http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-cooling-january-2007-to-january-2008.htm). Studies that estimate the thermal content of the whole climate system find that warming has continued throughout the last 17 years (e.g. Nuccitelli et al, Physics Letters A, Oct. 2012). It\'s just happening in places like the oceans and the arctic, where we don\'t see it unless we look.\n\n2. ""Severe worldwide cold waves."" That polar vortex this winter sure was cold. At the same time that was happening, Australia was broiling under temperatures approaching 120 F. Any climate scientist will tell you that climate science does not predict individual events, only statistical trends.\n\n3. Hurwitz claims that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is ""scrambling to salvage their flawed models"" and that their ""recent Statement for Policy Makers"" contained ""several embarrassing walkbacks of previous statements."" He doesn\'t say what these are. You will not find any of this if you look around the IPCC website. The latest Summary for Policy Makers, part of the fifth Assessment Review (October 2013) does no such thing. Instead it reiterates previous conclusions about warming with greater certainty, and for the first time gives the world a ""carbon budget"" that must not be exceeded if we want to keep warming below the internationally agreed limit of 2 degrees C.\n\nPeople wondering if they should be concerned about climate change should read something substantive, like the National Academy of Sciences ""America�s Climate Choices: Final Report"" (2011) which finds that ""the significant risks that climate change poses to human society and the environment provide a strong motivation to move ahead with substantial response efforts.""\n\nRAND BARTHEL\n\nMendon', 'Michael Hurwitz\'s March 15 guest column ""Are climate skeptics flat-earthers?""\nUnfortunately his piece is long on rhetoric and makes a number of unsupported factual claims.\nHe decries the term ""flat earthers"" applied to climate skeptics, but then uses the equally pejorative term ""alarmists"" throughout his piece.\nIf he wants to debate this issue in a spirit of ""calm analysis"", he should dial down his own inflammatory rhetoric.\nHurwitz claims that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is ""scrambling to salvage their flawed models"" and that their ""recent Statement for Policy Makers"" contained ""several embarrassing walkbacks of previous statements.""']"

There is significant risk of increased damage and death from heatwaves caused by more frequent extreme high temperatures. Flood risks would be worse, with the draft report warning of increasing damage from inundation. The draft says these new extremes imply Australia's mammoth mining industry will be increasingly vulnerable without adaptation measures. It points out the loss of coal export revenue of $5 billion to $9 billion when mines were flooded in 2011. Tourism faces major threats, the draft says. The Great Barrier Reef - with an estimated $51.4 billion in revenue to 2100 - is expected to degrade under all climate change scenarios, reducing its attraction to visitors. Australia's $1.8 billion skiing industry is identified as most negatively affected, with little option for it to counteract threats such as retreating snow. Maintaining skiing conditions until at least 2020 would require $100 million in investment in new snow guns and water supplies.\n\nA 4 per cent reduction in the gross value of beef, sheep and wool is expected with 3 degrees of warming above the 1980-99 baseline. Dairy output is projected to decline in all regions, except Tasmania, under 1 degree of warming by 2030. Of the major risks identified for Australia, the draft says the loss of high-altitude ecosystems and deterioration in coral reefs appear difficult to avoid, even with effective global cuts to greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation. It finds modelling shows the range of many wildlife species will contract, including koalas, platypus and banksia. Jean Palutikof, a review editor of the assessment and director of Australia's National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, said while adaptation measures were important, there were limits to what the world could achieve, and it was important to cut global emissions to ensure thresholds were not reached. ''It is quite black-and-white there is a risk we will go beyond the limits of the natural environment and human society to adapt to the climate,'' Professor Palutikof said. A spokesman for Environment Minister Greg Hunt said the government recognised the importance of adapting to climate change, pointing to the refunding of the research facility, which it has asked to ''focus on putting practical adaptation information in the hands of decision-makers so we can build a stronger and more resilient Australia''.\n\nFuture may be fraught as rising tides and hunger drive millions from homelands FOOD The world is hungry and increasingly so. Demand for the three staple food crops – rice, wheat and maize – is expected to grow by 14 per cent every decade until 2050. Meeting that demand will be hard at the best of times. CSIRO’s Mark Howden, a lead author of the food security chapter in the report, says the yields of food produced by most primary crops is presently growing by only about 1 per cent a decade. The draft IPCC assessment finds global warming will result in average global crop yields declining by up to 2 per cent a decade. Dr Howden says food crops will remain relatively stable with less than 1 degree of warming. But as temperatures rise above that they will feel the heat. And the more heat, the less crops will be produced.\n\nSECURITY The nightmare security scenario envisaged under climate change is a war between the bigger nations and millions of refugees driven from their homelands by rising seas. Melbourne University political geographer Professor Jon Barnett is a lead author of the new security chapter in the draft report. He says the published evidence makes clear that extreme weather will displace large numbers of people. But it also shows people tend to return once a threat subsides, meaning displacement is often temporary. The report says by 2100, without help, hundreds of millions will be affected and displaced by coastal flooding and land loss. The real concern will be the poor and vulnerable who will have no means of escape. The IPCC assessment also looks at whether climate change will cause more armed conflicts, an area Professor Barnett says is deeply contested. Climate change could also shape security policy and heighten tensions between nations over such issues as shared water resources and fish stocks.\n\nNATURAL WORLD Loading At the top of Australia’s mountains, the world is closing in. As the planet warms, snow is disappearing and the montane environment is receding. Macquarie University biologist Lesley Hughes, a lead author of the Australasian chapter, says habitat contraction is one of the key challenges already emerging as a result of climate change. She says if warming intensifies during the next decades the overall global picture for ecosystems, plants and animals is bleak. A leaked draft of the report concludes that many species are already shifting their range, seasonal activities, migration patterns and interactions in response to climate change. Professor Hughes says the main driver of extinction will continue to be land-use change up to 2 degrees of warming; any higher and climate change will become the predominant factor."", 'Flood risks would be worse, with the draft report warning of increasing damage from inundation.\nThe Great Barrier Reef - with an estimated $51.4 billion in revenue to 2100 - is expected to degrade under all climate change scenarios, reducing its attraction to visitors.\nThe IPCC assessment also looks at whether climate change will cause more armed conflicts, an area Professor Barnett says is deeply contested.\nClimate change could also shape security policy and heighten tensions between nations over such issues as shared water resources and fish stocks.\nMacquarie University biologist Lesley Hughes, a lead author of the Australasian chapter, says habitat contraction is one of the key challenges already emerging as a result of climate change.']"

35773,http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/heat_extremes_threaten_crop_yields_20140322,technology,"['By Tim Radford, Climate News NetworkThis piece originally appeared at Climate News Network.\n\nLONDON — Rampant climate change driven by ever-rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere poses a serious threat to world food supply, according to a new study in Environmental Research Letters.\n\nThe hazard comes not from high average temperatures, but the likelihood of heat extremes at times when crops are most sensitive to stress. And the message is: those communities that rely on maize as a staple are more at risk than most.\n\nDelphine Derying of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia in the UK and colleagues looked at one of the big puzzles of the coming decades: what will global warming do for crop yields?\n\nIt is not a simple question: climate change must mean more evaporation, more precipitation, longer growing seasons, more warmth, and higher levels of the carbon dioxide that plants exploit by photosynthesis (the process they use to convert light into chemical energy), so the consequence ought to be greater yields. But as every farmer knows, what matters most is the timing of all that warmth, rain, and those dry spells in which the harvest can ripen.\n\nDanger in extremes\n\nThere is a second consideration. Climate is the sum of all events. Rather than a steady overall rise in daily temperatures, an increasing number of ever-larger regions are predicted to experience ever more intense extremes of heat, and sometimes cold. Plants can be very sensitive to extremes of heat at flowering time: if the thermometer goes up, the pollen becomes increasingly sterile and less seed is likely to be set. So an extended heat wave in the wrong season could be calamitous.\n\nThe Tyndall team included the assumption that nothing would be done about climate change – that is, that governments, industry and people would continue with a business-as-usual scenario. They then chose three well-studied and vital crops – spring wheat, maize and soybean – and tested predictions under 72 different climate change scenarios for the rest of this century.\n\nThey allowed for the already-established benign effects of carbon dioxide-driven warming, one of which is that plants can make more tissue and at the same time use water more efficiently, and therefore respond more effectively to drought conditions. They also looked for the outcomes in places where yields could be most vulnerable: for example, the North American corn belt.\n\nEmissions cuts essential\n\nWhat they found was that – if carbon dioxide fertilisation effects are not taken into account – then maize, wheat and soya yields are all likely to fall, in all five top-producing countries for each of these crops.\n\nWhen they factored in the benefits of more CO2 in the atmosphere, the picture changed. There would be positive impacts on soya and wheat, but not on maize.\n\nThere is another proviso: so far, the benefits of extra CO2 have been confirmed in experimental plant laboratories. The experience in the fields 60 years in the future may be rather different. And in any case, these positive impacts could be severely offset by extremes of heat at the moment when the crops were most vulnerable, so overall, harvests remain at risk.\n\nThe best answer, the scientists argue, is to attempt to limit climate change. “Climate mitigation policy would help reduce risks of serious negative impacts on maize worldwide and reduce risks of extreme heat stress that threaten global crop production,” says Deryng.', 'The hazard comes not from high average temperatures, but the likelihood of heat extremes at times when crops are most sensitive to stress.\nRather than a steady overall rise in daily temperatures, an increasing number of ever-larger regions are predicted to experience ever more intense extremes of heat, and sometimes cold.\nThe Tyndall team included the assumption that nothing would be done about climate change – that is, that governments, industry and people would continue with a business-as-usual scenario.\nThe best answer, the scientists argue, is to attempt to limit climate change.\n“Climate mitigation policy would help reduce risks of serious negative impacts on maize worldwide and reduce risks of extreme heat stress that threaten global crop production,” says Deryng.']"

Their credentials are impressive.\n\nChristy is director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, and was a lead author of the 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nCurry is a professor and chairwoman of the School of Earth & Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nLindzen, an Alfred P. Sloan professor of meteorology at MIT from 1983 to 2013, is currently a distinguished senior fellow in the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute.\n\nA question the American Physical Society panel will address is one we ask repeatedly: Why wasn\'t the current global temperature stasis, with no discernible change in the past 15 years, not predicted by any of the climate models used by the IPCC, part of the United Nations?\n\nThe APS announcement lists among its questions to be answered: ""How long must the stasis persist before there would be a firm declaration of a problem with the models?""\n\nIn a nod to the likelihood that nature, not man, calls the shots, another APS audit question asks the panel: ""What do you see as the likelihood of solar influences beyond TSI (total solar irradiance)?

According to oceanographers, this is cause for concern, as the current is believed to “hide” heat and carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n“Our observations are showing us that there is less formation of these deep waters near Antarctica,” Irina Marinov of the University of Pennsylvania said in a statement. “This is worrisome because, if this is the case, we’re likely going to see less uptake of human produced, or anthropogenic, heat and carbon dioxide by the ocean, making this a positive feedback loop for climate change.”\n\nMarinov and her colleagues observed satellite images -- taken between 1974 and 1976 -- of a large ice-free area, called a polynya, in the Weddell Sea. Polynyas form when warm water of North Atlantic origin is pushed up toward the Southern Ocean’s surface. In a separate process, brine released during the sea-ice formation process produces a reservoir of cold, salty waters at the surface of the Weddell Sea. Because this situation is not stable, the heavy surface waters mix with the warmer, lighter waters underneath in a process called open-sea convection.\n\nAccording to scientists, polynyas were not observed in the Weddell Sea after 1976, leading researchers to believe they were rare events. However, the researchers suggest in the new study that polynyas were likely more common in the pre-industrial era, before anthropogenic climate change took hold.\n\nClimate change leads to more rainfall around Antarctica, which results in greater levels of fresh water at the surface. According to scientists, fresh water is more buoyant than saltwater and so it doesn’t sink through the layers of the ocean as saltier water does, which leads to fewer polynyas and less open-sea convection in the Southern Ocean.\n\n“This is important because this process of deep convection that happens in polynyas is a big contribution to Antarctic Bottom Water, these deep currents that feed the rest of the ocean,” Marinov said.\n\nThe researchers used 36 climate models that simulate climate-change patterns, seven of which suggest that increased fresh water in the Southern Ocean could stop convection from occurring altogether by 2030 -- something that could have implications for current and future climate change.\n\n“With climate change, we predict that the ocean will lose some of its deep, natural carbon in the future, partly because the temperature warming effect is so strong,” Marinov said.', '“Our observations are showing us that there is less formation of these deep waters near Antarctica,” Irina Marinov of the University of Pennsylvania said in a statement.\nBecause this situation is not stable, the heavy surface waters mix with the warmer, lighter waters underneath in a process called open-sea convection.\nHowever, the researchers suggest in the new study that polynyas were likely more common in the pre-industrial era, before anthropogenic climate change took hold.\nClimate change leads to more rainfall around Antarctica, which results in greater levels of fresh water at the surface.\n“With climate change, we predict that the ocean will lose some of its deep, natural carbon in the future, partly because the temperature warming effect is so strong,” Marinov said.']"

But there\'s a catch: Most think they\'ll be long gone before the consequences become catastrophic.\n\nThe survey adds nuance to the story told by a recent Gallup poll that showed most do not consider global warming to be a ""serious threat"" to themselves.\n\nBoth surveys found that many Americans think at least some consequences of climate change have already hit. Forty-nine percent in the HuffPost/YouGov poll said they have already felt its impact, while only 32 percent said they had not. Nineteen percent weren\'t sure. Even more -- 62 percent -- said they thought they would personally feel the impact of climate change at some point in their lifetimes.\n\nSimilarly, the Gallup poll found that 54 percent of Americans think the effects of global warming have already begun. A total of 65 percent said that the effects either had already begun, would begin in the next few years or would begin within their lifetimes.\n\nAmong the consequences that most Americans expect to see within their own lifetimes, according to the HuffPost/YouGov poll, are more frequent or intense storms like hurricanes (59 percent), greater difficulty in growing crops (53 percent) and certain areas possibly becoming less habitable (50 percent). Forty-nine percent said climate change will lead to rising sea levels that threaten coastal areas.\n\nStill, the Gallup poll found that only 36 percent of Americans expect global warming to pose a ""serious threat to you or your way of life within your lifetime."" The HuffPost/YouGov poll likewise found that only 36 percent think climate change will cause major harm to the United States during their lifetimes, while 33 percent think it will cause minor harm and 18 percent think it will cause no harm at all.\n\nBeyond the span of their own lives, however, the HuffPost/YouGov poll shows that most Americans do see the impact of climate change as dire.\n\nFifty-six percent said that climate change will pose a serious threat to the American way of life at some point in the future, while only 26 percent said it won\'t. And by a 54 percent to 28 percent margin, most think that it will even pose a serious threat to human life.\n\nAmericans\' feeling that climate change will have extreme consequences, but just not soon, may explain why they told Gallup both that they worry about the environment fairly little compared to other issues and that the environment should be given priority even if it curbs economic growth.\n\nWhite House senior counselor John Podesta cited polls showing that Americans don\'t yet place a high priority on dealing with climate change as a major reason for the launch of the Obama administration\'s Climate Data Initiative on Wednesday.\n\nConcern about climate change divides along party lines. The HuffPost/YouGov poll found Republicans much less likely than Democrats or independents to say that they had felt the impact of climate change or to predict future consequences of any sort. Of course, Republicans are also much less likely to say that human-caused climate change is occurring at all. Eighty-one percent of Democrats, 53 percent of independents and only 27 percent of Republicans said they think climate change is happening as a result of human activity.\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted March 15-17 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov\'s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

One measure has slowed, namely the global mean surface temperature, but it is still within the IPCC model warming projections. It still remains high and the last decade has been the warmest on record. A wide range of climate quantities continue to show change with the continued decline in Arctic sea ice and a rise in global sea level. Examples of slowing for a decade or so have been seen in the past in observations and have been simulated in the climate models. Global averages hide a lot of variation. Most of the surface slowdown has occurred from December through February in North America and Europe due to big outbreaks of cold, wintry weather.\n\nClaim 2: ""The alarmists do not have a theory but, at most have a hypothesis. Their �settled science� is dogma."" Mr. Hurwitz\'s ignorance is stunning. Climate science is a science because it is based on well-understood theories of physics, chemistry, and biology. It is also stunningly complex, because humans are trying to understand one of the most complicated interlocking systems known to man. Many areas of ignorance exist, but the general outline of what the linkages are is known. All science relies on models to pursue answers to questions and to gain understanding. The climate is always changing.

But what relation does this have to financial markets?\n\nBritain's Environmental Audit Committee has recently warned that global efforts to combat climate change could in due course pose a risk to financial stability.\n\nCoal, oil and gas companies are a substantial part of the stock market, certainly in the UK, and their share price is determined, among other factors, by the size of their fossil fuel reserves.\n\nThe carbon contained in these reserves is three times more than we can burn if we are to avoid dangerous climate change.\n\nFossil fuel companies are over-valued\n\nIn other words, unless we find a cheap way to capture and store carbon, two-thirds of the fossil fuel reserves of coal, oil and gas majors will have to remain under ground. These companies, it would appear, are overvalued.\n\nThere is little evidence that the market shares this concern. Optimists and green investors point to a growing interest in environmental, social and corporate governance investment. Green bonds are booming, although they are issued mostly by blue chip companies, and investors are sheltered from actual green risk.\n\nBut much of the energy industry has a very different view. Here, the talk is of a new age of fossil fuels, of abundant new reserves from unconventional sources - in particular shale gas, which has already transformed the energy market in the US.\n\nSo who is right: those who look forward to a resurgence of fossil fuels or those who warn about unburnable carbon?\n\nWill the laws ever be effective?\n\nIt is hard to blame hard-nosed city analysts for being doubtful about tight carbon constraints, especially if their valuations focus on the short-term.\n\nFew countries have made a significant dent into their greenhouse gas emissions. Where emissions have come down, it has often been because of unconnected factors, such as the economic crisis in Europe or the advent of shale gas in the US.\n\nCity analysts will also point out that climate laws do not guarantee policy certainty. In the 2008 Climate Change Act the UK has one of the most sophisticated climate change laws, which gives UK climate change policy a clear long-term direction.\n\nBut it has not prevented short-term policy alterations, as today’s budget statement may again show. Australian investors will make a similar observation about their policy environment.\n\nIt is also the case that not all climate change laws are as authoritative as the UK’s Climate Change Act or Mexico’s General Law on Climate Change. Particularly in developing countries climate policy is often made by executive order rather than passed by parliament.\n\nCarbon cutters do mean business\n\nBut these provisions can be powerful too: China's current five-year plan includes constraints on carbon emissions per GDP that are on a par with Britain’s carbon budgets, if these were expressed in the same way.\n\nThe UK’s third carbon budget translates into a reduction in carbon intensity of 39% by 2020, relative to 2005, compared with China’s ambition of a 40-45% cut.\n\nMore tangibly, policy makers are increasingly willing to penalise emissions by putting a price on carbon. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme may be ailing, but through a combination of taxes, trading schemes and regulation OECD countries impose carbon penalties.\n\nPrices range from less than £8 per tonne of CO 2 produced in Mexico, New Zealand and the United States to over £70 per tonne of CO 2 in Germany, Japan, Norway, South Korea and Switzerland.\n\nThe impact of these measures on firm performance has so far been modest, but they have given an edge to firms that are willing to cut their emissions.\n\nClimate laws are driven by ... other climate laws\n\nA tentative finding from the analysis of the 500 climate laws so far is that one of the most powerful drivers of climate legislation is the number of climate laws passed elsewhere.\n\nThere appears to be a strong element of peer pressure and intergovernmental knowledge exchange. If this is confirmed, it would point towards a self-reinforcing cycle.\n\nThe more climate change laws are passed - and the current pace is one new law per country every 18-20 months - the more ready policymakers become to take further action. The financial sector would do well to take note.\n\nSam Fankhauser is Co-Director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.

Climate expert Roger Pielke presented evidence of no trend in extreme weather events to the U.S. senate committee on environment and public works in July.\n\nOn March 5, 2014, the Global Warming Policy Foundation of the U.K. released a report entitled Oversensitive: How the IPCC hid the good news on global warming, complete with a forward by esteemed American atmospheric scientist Judith Curry, indicating the impact of carbon dioxide on climate change has been significantly overstated by the IPCC.\n\nBut that hasn’t stopped organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund from continuing to raise fears of catastrophic global warming.\n\nAccording to its website, the World Bank is heavily invested in low-carbon projects for the Third World, while the IMF is touting the benefits of carbon taxes even as the carbon markets in Europe have collapsed completely, to the point that Germany has gone back to building over 20 coal plants because the carbon risk of increased taxes to investors is now considered negligible.\n\nThe IMF is also pushing for a carbon tax in the U.S., despite clear evidence from Europe that carbon taxes and related greenhouse gas reduction targets have driven millions of citizens into “heat-or-eat” poverty, destroyed shareholder value in utility companies, destabilized the power grid and caused electrical rates to jump 37 per cent since 2005. Benny Peiser of the Global Warming Policy Foundation calls this “one of the biggest wealth transfers from poor to rich in modern European history.”\n\nAll this makes one wonder why the World Economic Forum, IMF and World Bank are being so obstinate in maintaining an increasingly discredited position.\n\nSo many roads lead to Chicago, climate change, carbon and Lagarde’s tenure at Baker and McKenzie, a Chicago law firm recognized “as one of the first global law firms to establish a climate-change practice.” U.S. President Barack Obama spent over six years as a board member of the Joyce Foundation that financed the founding of the Chicago Climate Exchange, which eventually collapsed. The Joyce Foundation also funds TIDES and other ENGOs that loudly proclaim climate terror despite no scientific evidence.\n\nBut as Fox News reported in 2010, the collapse of the Chicago Climate Exchange simply meant a strategy shift, as the Obama administration is pushing ahead with a piecemeal approach to instituting carbon taxes.\n\nClimate carbon bagging is a lucrative business for the right people. In a power-point presentation from 2007, Baker McKenzie gave us an example: a Chinese plant sells its emissions credits; a private fund and the World Bank buy them, then resell them through “the IM process” and the World Bank, raising “$1.2 billion in 23 minutes.”\n\nBy contrast, the Financial Conduct Authority of the U.K. reported in September that not a single ordinary investor has made any money in carbon credits. Ordinary investors are not able to sell or trade carbon credits once acquired.\n\nAmerican industry is recoiling from the thought of additional Environmental Protection Agency “carbon pollution” regulations. So should Canadians, because carbon hysteria has nothing to do with saving the planet.\n\nNew evidence, including the 16-year pause in global warming, shows carbon dioxide is not a control knob on climate, yet the World Economic Forum, IMF and World Bank continue with conning the climate and the rest of us.\n\nIt’s time we all stopped being suckers for climate scare.\n\nMichelle Stirling-Anosh is the communications manager of Friends of Science.', 'The World Economic Forum, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank all continue to propagate a catastrophic scenario of future climate change.\nEven the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has overstated the impact of carbon dioxide and the effect of human factors on climate change over the past 25 years, has never stooped this low.\nEven NASA and the IPCC have acknowledged there has been a 16-plus year natural pause in global warming.\nBut that hasn’t stopped organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund from continuing to raise fears of catastrophic global warming.\nClimate carbon bagging is a lucrative business for the right people.']"

Bolivia has been invited as it is the chair of the G-77 and China group, Nepal as the chair of the least developed countries group and Nauru as chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS).\n\nThe Warsaw CoP was not able to achieve anything substantial and was criticized for failing to reach a deal before the final 2015 CoP, but it did manage to strike an agreement over something called the International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (IMLD).\n\nIMLD will be an international mechanism to provide the world’s most vulnerable populations with better protection against loss and damage caused by extreme weather events and slow onset events, such as rising sea levels.\n\nA senior environment ministry official who requested anonymity said that the BASIC group of countries will assess the outcomes of the Warsaw conference and plan a roadmap for the upcoming United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference in Bonn, Germany in June this year.\n\nUNFCCC is an international non-binding convention and 195 nations are parties to it. Its aim is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.\n\nClimate talks by the United Nations were launched two decades ago after scientists warned that humans were warming the planet by pumping carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nThe environment ministry official quoted above added that representatives of the four BASIC countries will also discuss various elements for the 2015 CoP in Paris, where countries will aim to sign a new agreement on climate change. “We will figure out what the BASIC group wants the new agreement to look like,"" the official added. The expected new agreement in Paris will be aimed at convincing countries to cut down their emissions of harmful gases in order to minimise the effects of climate change.\n\nOther initiatives such as renewable energy and energy efficiency will also be discussed over the two days.\n\n“While the first day will be the meeting of the negotiators, the second day will be the ministerial discussion,"" the official said.\n\nThe four nations will also prepare plans for the UN secretary general’s climate summit in New York on 23 September, an event that aims to “mobilize political commitment for the conclusion of a global agreement by 2015, as well as to spur enhanced action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resilient communities"", according to the UN website.', 'The meeting of the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) group on 23-24 March in New Delhi follows the conference of parties (CoP) on climate change held in Warsaw last year.\nG-77 countries include some of the world’s poorest as well as smallest that could be overwhelmed by the effects of climate change.\nOn Friday, Prodipto Ghosh, a member of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s council on climate change, said that it is important for the BASIC group to coordinate its position.\nThe environment ministry official quoted above added that representatives of the four BASIC countries will also discuss various elements for the 2015 CoP in Paris, where countries will aim to sign a new agreement on climate change.\n“We will figure out what the BASIC group wants the new agreement to look like,"" the official added.']"

Now, says Ralph Keeling of the Scripps Institution for Oceanography, we\'re on track to ""see values dwelling over 400 in April and May. It\'s just a matter of time before it stays over 400 forever.""\n\nThis pronouncement comes the same week the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) released a report and the White House, a website, that seek to illustrate the effects of climate change and advance dialogue about it.\n\n""We believe we have an obligation to inform the public and policymakers about what science is showing about any issue in modern life, and climate is a particularly pressing one,"" said AAAS CEO Alan Leshner. ""As the voice of the scientific community, we need to share what we know and bring policymakers to the table to discuss how to deal with the issue.""\n\nThe AAAS report offers three messages about climate change: (1) it is happening, and humans are the cause; (2) risks posed by climate change are high and potentially damaging; and (3) the sooner we act, the lower the risks and costs. The report takes readers through a series of potential consequences of climate change that include accelerated sea level rise and food shortages as a result of the increasing difficulty of growing crops.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s next report, due out at the end of the month, is expected to touch on one of these topics. A leaked draft obtained by The Independent suggests that climate change will reduce crop yields by 2 percent per decade for the rest of the century. One study out now in the journal Nature Climate Change finds crop yields--specifically rice, corn and wheat--will decline more than 25 percent as a result of climate change.\n\nNavy Tests Space Solar Idea\n\nCalifornia and Texas topped a list of the 10 best states for clean energy jobs last year. The largest job creator? The solar industry.\n\nNow, the impact of solar technology could extend into outer space. The United States Navy is working on a project that could, in theory, allow for the capture of enough solar power to run military bases and even cities. The Navy is working on ""sandwich"" modules or prototypes far larger than the International Space Station that would collect solar power while aboard an orbiting satellite. Specifically, a photovoltaic panel atop the satellite would absorb the sun\'s energy. An electronics system would convert the energy into a radio frequency sent back to Earth.\n\n""People might not associate radio waves with carrying energy, because they think of them for communications, like radio, TV, or cell phones,"" said Paul Jaffe, a spacecraft engineer leading the project. ""They don\'t think about them as carrying usable amounts of energy.""\n\nThe idea of capturing solar power in space is not a new idea. The International Academy of Astronautics recently suggested that space solar technology would be viable in the next 30 years.\n\nDecision on U.S. Oil Exports Complex\n\nIn 2013, crude oil production in the United States reached its highest level since 1989--a roughly 15 percent increase from 2012, according the Energy Information Administration.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis and record-setting levels of U.S. oil production have some policymakers and industry officials calling for the reversal of a ban on most crude oil exports. Opponents and proponents disagree about the impact to consumers should the ban be lifted.\n\n""I think it is realistic that the U.S. could be energy self-sufficient by the end of this decade,"" said Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. ""We\'re already the world\'s largest natural gas producer (and) last year crude oil production surpassed levels not seen since the 1980s.""\n\nThe topic\'s varying angles dominated discuss at the annual IHS CERAWeek energy conference in Houston recently.\n\nThe Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news. It is produced each Thursday by Duke University\'s Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.', 'The AAAS report offers three messages about climate change: (1) it is happening, and humans are the cause; (2) risks posed by climate change are high and potentially damaging; and (3) the sooner we act, the lower the risks and costs.\nA leaked draft obtained by The Independent suggests that climate change will reduce crop yields by 2 percent per decade for the rest of the century.\nOne study out now in the journal Nature Climate Change finds crop yields--specifically rice, corn and wheat--will decline more than 25 percent as a result of climate change.\nThe International Academy of Astronautics recently suggested that space solar technology would be viable in the next 30 years.\nThe Climate Post offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news.']"

But the price of these CERs, generated by the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism and which companies can buy to offset their emissions, has since crashed, largely as a result of the oversupply of carbon credits within the EU’s emissions trading scheme, leaving the Adaptation Fund foundering.

35809,http://www.theonlinerocket.com/campus-life/2014/03/23/cosmos-brings-visually-stunning-science-to-network-television/,technology,"['In a visually thrilling showcase of the universe worthy of the highest definition television and stunning enough to captivate in a style that seems designed to be seen in a planetarium, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey brings science to the public in an entertaining and easy to understand way. Cosmos is certainly not just for astrophysics geeks, covering a variety of topics ranging from larger than the known universe to smaller than a molecule of DNA. One of the first things that caught my attention about Cosmos was executive producer Seth MacFarlane, creator of Fox’s Family Guy. Cosmos is part CGI, part animation, and part camera filming.\n\nWhile MacFarlane’s influence can be seen in the show’s animated portions, there is, thankfully, a lack of crude humor about sex and Hitler. Compared to the spectacular CGI, the animation falls flat and is dull for the viewer. It doesn’t help that the portions selected to utilize animation have been less exciting topics to begin with, usually centered around history and people through time.\n\nThe soothing, always relaxed voiced Neil deGrasse Tyson, proves a suitable host for Cosmos. The only flaw in his role as a science communicator being that he sometimes sounds less like he is having a conversation and more like he is rehearsing a dramatic monologue. Otherwise, Tyson does a fantastic job of presenting material, sidestepping commonly made mistakes and conveying important ideas. He makes it clear that evolution is not goal-oriented, it is not survival of the fittest, and Pluto is not a planet. One of Tyson’s early claims to fame was his leading role in the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. As director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, Tyson is fittingly a very approachable figure for showing audiences the world of science, seen in Cosmos by his speaking in the premiere about his time discovering what he wanted to do with the rest of his life and feeling like a nobody from the Bronx. It is clear that Tyson sees the message of Cosmos to be that science is for anyone and everyone.\n\nThe content in the show supports this message. It is never anything so complex that a middle school student could not follow along, but interesting enough that an adult will also find themselves listening closely. Most have learned it at some point, but Cosmos presents it in a way that does not assume the viewers remember. For example, the second episode explains how DNA is replicated and what it is used for.\n\nThe material covered in the show would be in any seventh grade science book, but showing the DNA molecule being replicated, explaining how closely related we are to other animals, and how random mutations drive evolution are just some of the ways that Cosmos brings science to life (pun intended). It is pure science, open for anyone and waiting to be explored. Cosmos gives children and adults alike the opportunity to let their imaginations run wild and see the limitless potential that is present in our world. If you have yet to see an episode, Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey can be seen Sundays at 9:00 p.m. on Fox and Mondays at 10:00 p.m. on the National Geographic channel.', 'Cosmos is certainly not just for astrophysics geeks, covering a variety of topics ranging from larger than the known universe to smaller than a molecule of DNA.\nOne of the first things that caught my attention about Cosmos was executive producer Seth MacFarlane, creator of Fox’s Family Guy.\nIt is clear that Tyson sees the message of Cosmos to be that science is for anyone and everyone.\nMost have learned it at some point, but Cosmos presents it in a way that does not assume the viewers remember.\nCosmos gives children and adults alike the opportunity to let their imaginations run wild and see the limitless potential that is present in our world.']"

Comets are usually defined as either short-period or long-period objects, and Halley’s Comet is considered a short-period comet, as its recurring orbit period is less than 200 years.\n\nThe comet was named after Halley following the publication of “A Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets” in 1705 in which the polymath concluded that, based on the historical evidence, a particular comet was making return trips around Earth on a periodic basis, reports Space.com.\n\nFox has released three clips from the upcoming “Cosmos” episode. The first video, which can be viewed above, gives a short explanation of the orbit of Halley’s Comet and how the sun pulls the comet. The second video, below, explores what happens when Halley’s Comet gets closer to Earth.\n\nThe third clip explores the future of the Milky Way and the predicted galactic merger with the Andromeda galaxy. According to recent observations, the Andromeda galaxy will collide with the Milky Way in about four billion years although any impact between stars is unlikely.\n\nWhile the merger will be a spectacular event, it is unlikely that it will be viewed from Earth, as recent studies say the planet will only be habitable for another 1.75 billion years. At the time, the Earth will have exited the habitable zone and the closer distance to the sun will mean an increase in surface temperatures that will evaporate the oceans.\n\n“Cosmos” will also look at the relationship between Halley and Newton.

They say the hit show, a reboot of Carl Sagan’s popular 1980s documentary series, “Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,” should give more airtime to creationists.\n\nDuring an interview with “The Janet Mefferd Show,” Danny Faulkner, a creationist and astronomy professor from the Christian non-profit organization Answers in Genesis, said the show is biased against creationist scientists and that there are plenty of scientists who consider creationism a valid theory for how Earth came to be.\n\n“Creationists aren’t even on the radar screen for them, they wouldn’t even consider us plausible at all,” Faulkner told Janet Mefferd in response to her asking if “Cosmos” producers “ever give creationists some time.”\n\n“Consideration of special creationism is definitely not open to discussion it would seem,” he continued.\n\nAnswers in Genesis is the same group that hosted the Ken Ham-Bill Nye debate in February. The organization promotes an origin-of-life theory based on a literal interpretation of the first book of the Bible. The group rejects modern evolutionary biology in favor of a worldview that includes life beginning 6,000 years ago.\n\nAnswers in Genesis also runs the Creation Museum, a 60,000-square-foot museum located in Petersburg, Ky., that was established to promote a young Earth creationist perspective.\n\nTyson has previously stated that he will not debate creationists on the issue of evolution. The astrophysicist said he’s not anti-religion, he just takes issue with people who don’t know how science works.\n\n""Any time you have a doctrine where that is the truth that you assert, and that what you call the truth is unassailable, you\'ve got doctrine, you\'ve got dogma on your hands,” Tyson said in an interview, according to Mother Jones. “And so ‘Cosmos’ is…an offering of science, and a reminder that dogma does not advance science; it actually regresses it.”\n\nTyson has also directly rebuked science deniers.\n\n“At its best, it’s showing you how and why science matters to us as a civilization and as a species,” Tyson said of the show. “If you don’t know science in the 21st century, just move back to the cave, because that’s where we’re going to leave you as we move forward.”\n\nYou can listen to a clip from Faulkner’s interview with “The Janet Mefferd Show” here, courtesy of Right Wing Watch:\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Danny Faulkner\'s interview was with ""Right Wing Watch.""

On April 8, Microsoft cuts off its security support for Windows XP, the operating system still used in 10.4 per cent of internet-connected PCs.\n\nThat means two things: (a) malware-makers will focus attention on Windows XP computers and (b) those who haven\'t bothered to upgrade to Windows 7 or Windows 8 will eventually get hit. Microsoft has been warning of this cut-off for five years. And yet thousands of Irish organisations – including banks and sensitive government departments – still have Windows XP.\n\nI\'ve been writing about this for 18 months. I\'ve spoken to companies and semi-state bodies about why they haven\'t updated their machines, and a common thread has emerged.\n\n* ""Ah, Microsoft will never adhere to that – they\'ll back down.""\n\nThis is one that I actually heard from the mouth of one of the most senior government IT managers. The theory was that if enough big organisations said they weren\'t switching over, Microsoft would have to relent and abandon the XP cut-off.\n\nThat gamble has backfired spectacularly, not least on the Government, which has now been forced to stump up an additional €3.3m in IT security cover (from Microsoft) because various departments\' Windows XP machines haven\'t yet been upgraded.\n\n* ""It\'s not that simple – we have software applications that work with XP.""\n\nThis is a genuine issue for any company or State body that had bespoke applications or software made for them. If you change the underlying operating system, some applications need to be completely overhauled, including a potentially lengthy re-testing phase. In other words, it could take time and money. But now it\'s going to need changing anyway. And all against a backdrop of heightened infection risks.\n\n* ""We\'ve put off upgrading our systems until next year and we\'ll have to make do until then.""\n\nThis is a very common one among small firms, who also cite ""other priorities"" as a reason for not getting around to upgrading their systems. ""I\'ve 101 things that need to be done, so I don\'t have that much time to be chasing new IT investments,"" is how one small business owner described her struggle to get on top of the Windows XP issue.\n\nUnfortunately, this class of business owner is probably first in line to be walloped by any malware out there. Ironically, they may also end up being the biggest customers of IT systems specialists – to clear up their problems – in the next six months.\n\n* ""Can\'t we just update our anti-virus software?""\n\nNice try, but that one won\'t fully work either. Anti-virus software works partially on the basis that the operating system is patched to a reasonable degree. It doesn\'t work when there are gaping holes in the rubric of the layer it\'s supposed to supplement.\n\n* ""This is just a trick to get us to spend more money and I\'m not falling for it.""\n\nThis attitude, while rare, does exist among small firms. It is most heard among the kind of people who think that any upgraded iPhone is ""a con"" or that it\'s always, as a rule, better off waiting to avail of a new laptop or tablet ""when they\'re cheaper"".\n\nSunday Indo Business', ""On April 8, Microsoft cuts off its security support for Windows XP, the operating system still used in 10.4 per cent of internet-connected PCs.\nOn April 8, Microsoft cuts off its security support for Windows XP, the operating system still used in 10.4 per cent of internet-connected PCs.\nThat means two things: (a) malware-makers will focus attention on Windows XP computers and (b) those who haven't bothered to upgrade to Windows 7 or Windows 8 will eventually get hit.\nAnd yet thousands of Irish organisations – including banks and sensitive government departments – still have Windows XP.\nIf you change the underlying operating system, some applications need to be completely overhauled, including a potentially lengthy re-testing phase.""]"

35842,http://bitcoinmagazine.com/11337/hold-bitcoins-april-8-2014-might-defining-moment-bitcoin-history/,technology,"['Mark your calendars for April 8. It’s been a target day of dread for thousands of companies’ IT departments counting down the days before they cross the “finished” line. There are currently armies of IT folks throughout the world in a race to upgrade Microsoft Windows XP operating systems to modern versions of Windows before Microsoft officially pulls the plug. Windows XP is now a 13 year old operating system released only a month before the 9/11 attacks. This was arguably Microsoft’s most popular and longest lasting trusted version of Windows they’ve published. It is so popular that even though they stopped selling it to the public years ago, company IT departments have been slow to migrate to new versions of Windows including Windows 7 or the unpopular Windows 8.\n\nA recent PCWorld Magazine poll shows Windows XP still runningon almost 30%of all installed PCs. This is over four times the install base of the 18 month old Windows 8. For the bitcoin community, this matters because of one extremely important factor:PCI compliance. April 8 is the last date Microsoft will publish the latest round of security fixes for Windows XP known in the IT departments as the monthly “Patch Tuesday”. The first reported vulnerability after that date means the computer is unsecured and no longer compliant with the laws established by the PCI organization that grants authority to use the credit card payment networks.\n\nThe credit card industry’s authority organization has issued rules and requirements designed to ensure that ALL companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. As of April 9, any PC continuing to run Windows XP without the expensive extended Microsoft support contract will likely be considered non compliant.https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-WindowsXPV4_(1).pdf\n\nAs such, they may be barred from being allowed on the payment network. This includes ATM machines, which the organization estimates to be over 420,000 in the US alone and 95% of them are estimated to be running various versions of Windows XP underneath.

While there are a few improvements in Update that mouse-hugging folks (like me) will appreciate, the overall impression is that Microsoft has stuck more baling wire and chewing gum on the old Windows 8 mess.\n\nIn short, don\'t expect much. If you\'re using Windows 8.1 and a mouse -- heaven help you -- installing the update is an uninspiring no-brainer. If you\'re running Windows 8.1 on a touch-first device, there\'s very little that warrants a second look, much less an upgrade.\n\n[ Windows 8 left you blue? Then check out Windows Red, InfoWorld\'s plan to fix Microsoft\'s contested OS. | Bring it back: 9 Windows Start menus for Windows 8 | Stay abreast of key Microsoft technologies in our Technology: Microsoft newsletter. ]\n\nImprovements to the Metro Start screen\n\nMany of the Windows 8.1 Update improvements to the Metro side of Win 8.1 are directed at mouse users. That\'s a remarkable statement, given that Metro\'s raison d\'être always has been the touch-centric user.\n\nThe most obvious change you\'ll see on the Metro Start screen is the inclusion of two icons to the right of the user\'s name and picture (see Figure 1). These two icons, for Power and for Search, make these very common actions -- formerly hidden -- much more discoverable.\n\nIn Windows 8.1, if you want to turn off the PC, you have to swipe from the right (or press Windows-C), choose Settings, tap the Power icon at the bottom of the screen, and choose How to Power Down. If you\'d never seen the Metro Start screen before, how would you guess to turn off the darn thing? Throwing it on the floor doesn\'t count. (You could press the computer\'s power button and hold it, but many people don\'t think of that.)\n\nThe Search icon chips away at the same class of problems: In Metro, there are many ways to skin multiple cats, but it isn\'t at all obvious how to invoke any of them. To use the jargon, ""discoverability"" in Metro sucks (that\'s a technical term).\n\nIn the case of search in Win8/8.1, you can swipe from the right and choose the Search charm. Or you can press Windows-C and choose the Search charm. Or you can press Windows-S. Or you can just start typing (if you have a physical keyboard) and the search panel appears. But normal people don\'t know these strokes by osmosis, so they spend ages trying to figure out how to search. The new Search icon on the Metro Start screen clearly points the way.\n\nWindows 8.1 Update also brings a Metro tile-manipulation capability that\'s a little bit more than a mouse-oriented parlor trick. In Win8/8.1, if you right-click on a Metro Start screen tile, you see options in a pane at the bottom of the screen -- called the application bar -- to unpin the tile from the Start screen, uninstall the app, resize the tile, pin the program to the taskbar (for programs that run on the legacy Windows Desktop), or turn the ""live"" animation on or off. With the update installed, you get the same choices, but they appear as an old-fashioned cascading right-click contextual menu (also shown in Figure 1).\n\nOne variation that may be useful to some users: If you right-click on an empty part of the Metro Start screen, you\'re given the chance to assign names to your groups of tiles.', ""Clearly, the prime directive behind Windows 8.1 Update (variously called Windows 8.1 Update 1, Windows 8.1 GDR 1, Windows 8.1 2014 Update, Windows 8.1.1, and Windows 8.2) was to improve the lot of the beleaguered mouse-and-keyboard user thrust into the Jekyll-and-Hyde dichotomy of Metro and Desktop.\nIf you're using Windows 8.1 and a mouse -- heaven help you -- installing the update is an uninspiring no-brainer.\nIf you're running Windows 8.1 on a touch-first device, there's very little that warrants a second look, much less an upgrade.\n| Bring it back: 9 Windows Start menus for Windows 8 | Stay abreast of key Microsoft technologies in our Technology: Microsoft newsletter. ]\nImprovements to the Metro Start screenMany of the Windows 8.1 Update improvements to the Metro side of Win 8.1 are directed at mouse users.""]"

It’s a dirty bunch indeed, the waste between them accounting for nearly half a billion wasted seafood meals in the U.S. alone.\n\nCulled by Oceana, the largest international organization for ocean conservation, the fisheries are ranked based on bycatch—the amount of unwanted creatures caught while commercial fishing. Combined, they’re responsible for 50 percent of reported bycatch nationwide.\n\nAt the dirtiest fishery, Southeast Snapper-Grouper Longline Fishery, 66 percent of the animals caught are discarded—a number that includes more than 400,000 sharks in just one year. Close behind is California Set Gillnet Fishery, where 65 percent of animals caught are thrown away. The other seven dispensaries, spanning from coast to coast, are death traps for thousands of sea organisms each year. (Read the full list here).\n\n“We’re allowing the capture and death of whales, dolphins, porpoises, turtles, and more,” Dominique Cano-Stocco, campaign director for Oceana tells The Daily Beast. While it’s technically a pro-ocean conservation organization, Oceana stresses that it’s pro-fishing too—but the safe kind. In the interest of bringing in huge quantities, commercial fishing techniques have turned grisly. “Gillnets,” or as Cano-Stacco refers to them “walls of death” are nets that can be as long as two miles. Meant to capture fish by the gills (hence the name), they snare anything from sea turtles to dolphins. “Trawls,” which Cano-Stacco has nicknamed “the bulldozers of the ocean,” are long nets that are dragged along the ocean floor, taking no prisoners in their path. “No matter if you’re looking at animal conservation, ecosystems, or just waste in general—at all nine fisheries, it’s a bad story,” she says.\n\nWith wide-reaching nets, catches are unintentionally trapping and killing thousands of unwanted bait. It’s a problem that is crippling the efforts of ocean conservationist nationwide. “If we don’t clean up these particular fishing gears then we’re continuing to throw away millions of pounds of fish every year as waste,” says Cano-Stacco. “It’s absurd.”\n\nThe gut-wrenching data, retrieved from the National Marine Fisheries Service, exposes bycatch as the dark and deadly underbelly of commercial fishing. “It’s still the largest threat to maintaining fish populations and ecosystems,” says Cano-Stacco. While scientists and the government (NOAA) have known about bycatch for a long time, their efforts to combat it have not been effective. “We’ve made great progress in the fight against this, but not enough.”\n\nFor the ocean conservation community it’s the knowledge that the senseless deaths could be avoided that is most infuriating. Banning gill nets and trawls, enforcing a system of accurate counting, and capping the number of waste, has the potential to completely change the world of commercial fishing.\n\nAs it stands now, the commercial fishing industry is eclipsing even the most advanced efforts to preserve the ocean’s natural habitat and protect endangered species. Cano-Stacco, for one, hopes that the study highlights not simply the problem, but the urgency for a solution. “If you don’t get bycatch under control, the other government programs won’t work,” says Cano-Stacco. “If you do, you not only save the ocean, you provide a potential solution to the human overpopulation crisis in the process.”', 'Fisheries reveals the nine dirtiest fisheries in the United States.\nCulled by Oceana, the largest international organization for ocean conservation, the fisheries are ranked based on bycatch—the amount of unwanted creatures caught while commercial fishing.\nIn the interest of bringing in huge quantities, commercial fishing techniques have turned grisly.\n“It’s absurd.”The gut-wrenching data, retrieved from the National Marine Fisheries Service, exposes bycatch as the dark and deadly underbelly of commercial fishing.\nAs it stands now, the commercial fishing industry is eclipsing even the most advanced efforts to preserve the ocean’s natural habitat and protect endangered species.']"

And it\'s often impossible to know where a fillet of fish or a few frozen shrimp came from — and, perhaps more importantly, just how they were caught.\n\nFortunately, activists are doing the homework for us, and what they\'re telling us could make your next fish dinner a little less tasty.\n\nAccording to a report released Thursday by the environmental group Oceana, commercial fishermen in the U.S. annually throw overboard as much as 2 billion pounds of so-called bycatch, much of which is edible fish equivalent to at least a half-billion seafood meals. Incredibly, much of this waste includes some of the most valuable — and delectable — seafood species in the world, like bluefin tuna, swordfish and Pacific halibut.\n\nThe report, compiled from data from the National Marine Fisheries Service, a federal agency, singles out the nine most wasteful fisheries in the U.S., who were responsible for 340 million pounds of bycatch in 2011. The ""dirtiest"" fisheries include the Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawling industry; the California set gillnet fishery, which targets halibut and white sea bass; and the longline fishery for red snapper and grouper. Gillnetted Pacific swordfish, Atlantic swordfish caught on longlines, and cod, haddock, monkfish and flounder caught by North Atlantic trawlers also come from fisheries on the list.\n\nThe reason these fisheries are throwing away so many fish? It\'s mainly the types of commercial gear they\'re using, which are designed to catch as many fish as possible, says Oceana.\n\nAnd if you\'ve eaten U.S. shrimp, halibut or red snapper, there\'s a good chance it has come from one of these fisheries. Their fish and shrimp are sold in markets and restaurants across the U.S. and around the world, according to Gib Brogan, the fisheries campaign manager with Oceana.\n\n""It\'s being sold all over the place,"" he says.\n\nBrogan says fishing regulations are partly to blame for wasted seafood. That\'s because fishermen who have permits to catch certain species must throw back other valuable species they accidentally catch — even if the fish are dead.\n\nFor example, trawling vessels in Alaska — boats that drag giant nets behind them to catch flounder and sole — threw back 2 million pounds of Pacific halibut and 5 million pounds of Pacific cod in a single year, according to Oceana\'s report. Brogan says a lot, if not most, of the bycatch caught with trawl nets, gillnets and longlines is dead or dying by the time it\'s returned to the water.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Oceana Courtesy of Oceana\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawling industry throws back about two-thirds, by weight, of its total catch, the report says. So do swordfish gillnetters in offshore California waters and those fishing closer to shore for halibut and white sea bass. Sea turtles, seabirds and various marine mammals are also among the detritus. Longline snapper and grouper fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico, for example, threw back 400,000 sharks in 2010.\n\nSuch information is critical for fishery managers and environmentalists who advocate for catching seafood with more sustainable fishing gear. But unless you study the fishing industry for a living, it\'s tough for a consumer to avoid these fisheries when shopping for seafood. Nonetheless, groups like Oceana, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have been trying to educate consumers about the bycatch issue through seafood buying guides and other campaigns.\n\n""As a concept, people get what bycatch is and they don\'t like it,"" says Sheila Bowman, with the Monterey Bay Aquarium\'s Seafood Watch. ""But the data is often too hard for shoppers to put into context and act on.""\n\nAccording to Whole Foods Markets, the high-end retailer, 59 percent of its shoppers surveyed in 2013 said they believed how a fish is caught is important. The company has pledged to sell seafood that\'s as sustainable as possible.\n\n""But most people don\'t even know what \'gear type\' means,"" says Margaret Wittenberg, vice president of quality standards at Whole Foods Markets. ""They care about sustainability, and they want to make a good choice, and they know that we\'ve done the homework for them.""\n\nJust as consumers and retailers are starting to understand the severity of bycatch issues, some fishermen also seem to be taking it more seriously. In the Gulf of Mexico, a group of several dozen fishermen catching snapper and grouper have begun using weaker hooks on their longlines that break or bend when large sharks and other potential bycatch species take a bait.\n\n""In general, these [fishermen] don\'t want to catch fish they can\'t sell,"" says Eric Brazer, with the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders\' Alliance.\n\nHe says the fishermen he represents have made efforts to create demand for lower-value species, like the lane snapper, silk snapper and at least two species of porgy — fish that often get tossed back dead. ""Our goal is to have a zero-discard fishery by creating markets for these species,"" says Brazer.\n\nTj Tate, with Gulf Wild, a sustainability program that marks seafood with detailed place-of-origin tags, says many fishermen are seeing financial incentive to change their practices and reduce their bycatch.\n\n""It\'s not effective for fishermen to be spending time handling and trying to release sharks or undersized fish that they can\'t sell,"" she says. ""They\'re losing fishing time.""\n\nBowman at Seafood Watch says she supports the efforts of groups like Oceana to inform consumers about wasteful fishing industries. But she notes that in the crusade to curb wasteful fishing practices, less information might sometimes be more.\n\n""People don\'t want to know all this,"" she says.

The worst-offender list includes two industries on the West Coast:\n\nCalifornia set gillnet fishery catches white seabass and California halibut, but also ensnares sea lions, sharks and many other fish species, with a 65 percent discard rate.\n\nCalifornia drift gillnet fishery catches swordfish and thresher sharks, but they also snare over 100 marine mammals per year including large whales, dolphins, seals and sea lions, plus many blue sharks, other sharks, ocean sun fish and others that are thrown overboard. Overall, the fishery tosses about 63% of its catch overboard.\n\nThe other offenders are:\n\nSoutheast snapper-grouper longline fishery (66 percent discarded): More than 400,000 sharks were captured and discarded in one year.\n\nSoutheast shrimp trawl fishery (64 percent discarded): For every pound of shrimp landed, 1 pound of billfish is discarded; thousands of sea turtles are killed annually.\n\nGulf of Alaska flatfish trawl fishery (35% discarded): More than 34 million pounds of fish were thrown overboard in one year, including 2 million pounds of halibut and 5 million pounds of cod\n\nNortheast bottom trawl (35 percent discarded): More than 50 million pounds of fish are thrown overboard every year.\n\nMid-Atlantic bottom trawl fishery (33 percent discarded): Almost 200 marine mammals and 350 sea turtles were captured or killed in one year\n\nAtlantic highly migratory species longline fishery (23 percent discarded): More than 75 percent of the wasted fish in this fishery are valuable tuna, swordfish and other billfish targeted by the fishery.\n\nNew England and Mid-Atlantic gillnet fishery (16 percent discarded): More than 2,000 dolphins, porpoises and seals were captured in one year.\n\nFisheries in Oregon did not make the list, though Oceana is concerned about the state’s pink shrimp fishery, which uses large trawl nets.\n\nFor a decade, the fishery off Oregon has used so-called excluder grates, which allow the small shrimp to be captured but reject larger species. But the grate does not protect eulachon smelt, a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which are captured by the trawlers.\n\nThe smelt are an important forage fish for salmon and seabirds.

Some fisheries discard more than they bring to port,” says Oceana’s report.\n\nThe discarded fish are referred to as “bycatch.” They are the catch of non-target fish and ocean wildlife, including what is brought to port and what is discarded at sea. “Bycatch is one of the biggest challenges facing the U.S. today,” Can-Stocco said. “It’s one of the largest threats to the proper management of our fisheries and to the health of our oceans and marine ecosystems,” she added.\n\n“Discarding large quantities of fish can lead to overfishing, prevent populations from recovering after decades of over exploitation, and disrupt the natural balance of marine ecosystems. Indeed, some valuable overfished populations are unable to recover because of persistent high levels of bycatch,” said Can-Stocco.\n\nAccording to Oceana, “the extensive use of bottom trawls, and dredges used for commercial fishing cause more direct and avoidable damage to the ocean floor, than any other human activity in the world. Bottom trawls and dredges are so destructive they effectively clear-cut everything on the ocean floor. Trawls and dredges use large, heavy nets kept open by doors, weighing as much as several tons each, many of which drag across large areas of seafloor to catch fish that live on or near the ocean floor.”\n\nBased on data published by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Oceana’s report has identified nine “dirty” fisheries that have some of the worst bycatch in the United States. All of these fisheries in Oceana’s “worst-by-catch” list either use trawls, gillnets, or longlines (lines with baited hooks) to catch fish. “These three fishing gears are some of the world’s most unsustainable and destructive,” said Cano-Stocco. As a result, they injure and kill thousands of protected and endangered species every year. These nine fisheries are responsible for more than fifty percent of reported bycatch in the U.S. They only bring in seven percent of landings, and discard and waste, almost as much as they keep.\n\nOceana strives to develop better management strategies to prevent the high level of unnecessary slaughter in our oceans. “Proven solutions and innovative management strategies can significally reduce the unnecessary deaths of sharks, sea turtles, dolphins and other marine life, while maintaining vibrant fisheries,” said Dr. Geoff Shester, California program director at Oceana.\n\nAnother faster and more productive alternative to prevent “bycatch,” is to stop fishing and leave the sea creatures alone. This will benefit both marine life, and the natural ecosystem. Also, consumers will no longer have to be concerned about whether dolphins, sea turtles, or other “bycatch,” are on their dinner plates."", '“Approximately 17-22 percent of what fishermen catch every year is discarded at sea, likely already dead or dying.\nIndeed, some valuable overfished populations are unable to recover because of persistent high levels of bycatch,” said Can-Stocco.\nAll of these fisheries in Oceana’s “worst-by-catch” list either use trawls, gillnets, or longlines (lines with baited hooks) to catch fish.\nAnother faster and more productive alternative to prevent “bycatch,” is to stop fishing and leave the sea creatures alone.\nAlso, consumers will no longer have to be concerned about whether dolphins, sea turtles, or other “bycatch,” are on their dinner plates.']"

The report says the equivalent of 1 billion seafood meals per year are being thrown back into the oceans. The list contained in the new report from the group Oceana addresses the “bycatch,” which is when ocean wildlife and non-targeted fish are brought up by fishing practices and then dumped back into the sea. The report entitled, “Wasted Catch: Unsolved Bycatch Problems in U.S. Fisheries,” says that, while there has been progress in the past decade, the bycatch still results in about 20 percent of the catch being thrown away each year. “Anything can be bycatch,” said Dominique Cano-Stocco, campaign director at Oceana. “Whether it’s the thousands of sea turtles that are caught to bring you shrimp or the millions of pounds of cod and halibut that are thrown overboard after fishermen have reached their quota, bycatch is a waste of our ocean’s resources. Bycatch also represents a real economic loss when one fisherman trashes another fisherman’s catch.” Fishing methods differ, although most involved in the issue believe that open-ocean long-line trawlers and gillnet fisheries do the most harm. “Hundreds of thousands of dolphins, whales, sharks, sea birds, sea turtles and fish needlessly die each year as a result of indiscriminate fishing gear,” said Amanda Keledjian, report author and a marine scientist at Oceana. “It’s no wonder that bycatch is such a significant problem, with trawls as wide as football fields, long lines extending up to 50 miles with thousands of baited hooks and gillnets up to two miles long. The good news is that there are solutions – bycatch is avoidable.” Unfortunately, the bycatch problem in the U.S. is likely much worse than realized because most fisheries do not have adequate monitoring in place to document exactly what and how much is caught and subsequently discarded. In some fisheries, as few as one in 100 fishing trips carry impartial observers to document the catch, while many are not monitored at all, leading to large gaps in knowledge and poor-quality data. Oceana claims that reducing the bycatch is a win-win for fishermen and conservationists because healthy oceans lead to renewed abundance while preventing the needless deaths of whales, dolphins, seals and sea turtles.

This is known as bycatch, and according to a new report released by the nonprofit conservation group, Oceana, it's a growing concern among nine U.S. fisheries.\n\n“Anything can be bycatch,” Dominique Cano-Stocco, campaign director at Oceana, said in a statement. “Whether it’s the thousands of sea turtles that are caught to bring you shrimp or the millions of pounds of cod and halibut that are thrown overboard after fishermen have reached their quota, bycatch is a waste of our ocean’s resources.”\n\nDepending on the type of fishing gear used, fishermen tend to catch everything from dolphins to sea turtles and sharks. These inadvertent catches are usually thrown overboard and tend to be injured, dead or dying.\n\nThe majority of bycatch tends to come from open ocean trawl, longline and gillnet fisheries. Researchers estimate that 20 percent of what fishermen catch in the U.S. is thrown away each year.

I'm guessing you probably wouldn't order that fish anymore. Unfortunately, U.S. fisheries unnecessarily kill marine life and waste tons of edible fish every day.\n\nA new report by Oceana uncovered the staggering amount of wasted seafood and marine life, known as bycatch, in nine U.S. fisheries.\n\nFishermen usually target one type of seafood, a specific type of fish, but depending upon the type of fishing gear they use, they often catch enormous amounts of species that aren't on their list. Swordfish and cod gillnet fishermen sometimes haul up dolphins, gulf shrimp trawlers often catch sea turtles in their massive nets, and snapper-grouper longliners hook hundreds of thousands of sharks. These animals are usually tossed overboard, injured, dying or dead.\n\nThe scale of the problem is staggering -- several U.S. fisheries actually throw away more marine life than they keep. Researchers estimate that an average of 20 percent of what is caught in the U.S. is thrown away each year, wasting approximately 2 billion pounds of seafood and killing hundreds of thousands of whales, dolphins, sharks, seals and sea turtles.\n\nBycatch is a problem for many fisheries, but some are worse than others. Using government data, Oceana's new report identifies nine fisheries with some of the worst bycatch in the U.S. These nine fisheries are responsible for more than half of reported bycatch in the country. The figures are astounding -- four fisheries discard 63 to 66 percent of everything they catch. If you can't quite grasp just how much that is, think of it this way: These nine fisheries waste almost half a billion seafood meals.\n\nRecently, the scallop fishery was allowed to throw away more flounder than flounder fishermen were allowed to catch and keep. The southeast shrimp trawl fishery kills 50,000 sea turtles each year, while the southeast snapper-grouper longline fishery captures and discards more than 400,000 sharks each year. On the Pacific coast, the California drift gillnet fishery killed or entangled more than 550 whales, dolphins and seals in the last five years, including endangered sperm whales.\n\nThe good news is that bycatch is a fixable problem. We need to accurately count everything that we catch, limit the amount of wasted catch in each fishery using science-based limits, and avoid catching non-target species by using more selective fishing gear.\n\nThese three steps would go a long way toward reducing bycatch and would improve the economic security of U.S. fisheries. Reducing bycatch will improve fishing efficiency and reduce fishery closures. It also leaves more fish in the sea to build healthy fish populations, which ensure that our ecosystems stay balanced and resilient in the face of threats like climate change and pollution.\n\nThe government isn't adequately analyzing or reporting bycatch data, but Oceana is pushing to solve this problem. Consumers can help, too. Look for sustainable, U.S.-caught seafood, and consult existing reference guides to avoid species caught with gillnets, longlines and trawls, which have high levels of bycatch. Help us put an end to the waste, and keep our fisheries healthy and our oceans abundant."", ""A new report by Oceana uncovered the staggering amount of wasted seafood and marine life, known as bycatch, in nine U.S. fisheries.\nSwordfish and cod gillnet fishermen sometimes haul up dolphins, gulf shrimp trawlers often catch sea turtles in their massive nets, and snapper-grouper longliners hook hundreds of thousands of sharks.\nIf you can't quite grasp just how much that is, think of it this way: These nine fisheries waste almost half a billion seafood meals.\nRecently, the scallop fishery was allowed to throw away more flounder than flounder fishermen were allowed to catch and keep.\nWe need to accurately count everything that we catch, limit the amount of wasted catch in each fishery using science-based limits, and avoid catching non-target species by using more selective fishing gear.""]"

Still, they advise the federal government to also count the number of bycatch per fishery and impose a limit, whether daily or annually.

The discards harm efforts to restore depleted fish stocks and kill such protected marine species as whales, dolphins, seals and sea turtles.\n\n�Bycatch, or the catch of non-target fish and ocean wildlife, is one of the largest threats to maintaining healthy fish populations and marine ecosystems around the world,� the report states.\n\nOceana, a well-known conservation group that has sued federal fisheries agencies in the past, has long battled the bycatch issue.\n\n�Bycatch has been a persistent problem for decades, because it remains largely undocumented,� the report reads. �Bycatch includes not only entangled wildlife, but also discarded fish that could not be brought to port because they were the wrong size, poor quality, low market value or prohibited for conservation reasons.�\n\nSo fishermen toss them overboard � and many do not survive.\n\nAmong what it calls the nation�s �nine dirty fisheries� are three off Rhode Island: Northeast bottom trawling (groundfish, whiting), mid-Atlantic bottom trawling (scup, flounder, sea bass), and New England/mid-Atlantic gillnetters (monkfish, groundfish, skates). In trawling, nets are towed through the water, while gillnets are set and anchored.\n\nRhode Island fisheries regulators acknowledge that bycatch continues to be a problem. It�s a particularly difficult one to resolve, but progress has been made, they say.\n\n�It�s an issue we grapple with � how to turn discarded fish into landed fish so they are not wasted,� said Mark Gibson, deputy chief of marine fisheries, who represents the state on the New England Fishery Management Council.\n\nRobert Ballou, assistant to the director at the Department of Environmental Management, said that in their efforts to address overfishing, regulators have long relied on a variety of measures. These include minimum sizes to protect juveniles and volume limits aimed at reducing pressure on regulated species. While these result in fish being caught that must be thrown back, without such measures, fishing on depleted stocks would be unlimited, he said.\n\nIt�s a Catch-22, he said, for which no perfect solution has been found.\n\n�It�s at the top of everyone�s list, or least it should be. No one would disagree with that,� Ballou said.\n\nHe and Gibson both said that regulators are supportive of innovations in fish methods and gear to address bycatch. For example, said Ballou, fishermen are voluntarily taking part in reporting incidents of river herring mixing with sea herring. Since it�s illegal to catch scarcer river herring, the reports, which are immediately shared with the fleet in conjunction with the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth, can help fishermen avoid areas where the two species are mixing.\n\nAnother example is a trawl that Rhode Island fisherman Phil Ruhle helped design to net haddock but allow depleted cod to escape.\n\nDespite these advances, said Ballou, �I�m sure [Oceana�s] response would be �it�s not enough.��\n\nThe report does offer recommendations on remedies.\n\nOceana calls for improved bycatch reporting and extensive onboard monitoring.\n\n�In 2001, a federal court ordered the New England groundfish fishery to develop a standard approach to reporting bycatch,� the report reads. �In 2004 and again in 2007, the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils established bycatch reporting protocols, but they did not include enough observers to accurately estimate bycatch in a range of fisheries.�\n\nOceana also supports incentives for fishermen to reduce bycatch and the promotion of more selective fishing gear.\n\nGibson said that, unfortunately, there�s one big problem with putting government observers on board fishing vessels.\n\n�It�s very costly,� he said, noting that in New England alone full coverage would amount to 12,000 days at sea. �We�re trying to move toward more electronic monitoring.�', '�Bycatch, or the catch of non-target fish and ocean wildlife, is one of the largest threats to maintaining healthy fish populations and marine ecosystems around the world,� the report states.\nRhode Island fisheries regulators acknowledge that bycatch continues to be a problem.\nAnother example is a trawl that Rhode Island fisherman Phil Ruhle helped design to net haddock but allow depleted cod to escape.\nOceana calls for improved bycatch reporting and extensive onboard monitoring.\n�In 2001, a federal court ordered the New England groundfish fishery to develop a standard approach to reporting bycatch,� the report reads.']"

The numbers indicate how many data sources were available in each region.\n\nBycatch may include seabirds, sea turtles and marine mammals. When these animals are accidentally tangled up in fishing lines or nets, nobody wins. It not only harms the local ecological balance, it also damages fishing gear and costs the industry time and money.\n\nBycatch mitigation\n\nWhile this new analysis illustrates that bycatch is a complex, global process, the good news is that several strategies already exist to prevent bycatch, many of them developed by the fishing industry. For example, by varying the depth at which lines and nets are deployed, by using specially designed lures and hooks, and by employing turtle excluder devices, fisheries have increased target catch and reduced bycatch.\n\n“Some of the earliest bycatch issues involved marine mammals taken in tuna nets and shrimp trawls that drowned sea turtles,” Mr Crowder said. “The problems were ultimately solved by scientists who clearly defined the problems and by managers and fishermen who sought innovative fishing methods to allow fisheries and protected species to coexist.”\n\nIn the past, much of the research done in this area focused on specific species or on specific fleets. While those snapshots have been important and useful, Ms Lewison said, they’ve missed the larger, integrated picture.\n\n“If you’re a turtle, you probably don’t care about what country, or what type of gear or which fleet catches you,” Ms Lewison said. “You just care that you got caught.”\n\nLooking globally\n\nThat’s the attitude Ms Lewison and her colleagues applied to their latest study, published March 17 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. As part of a research initiative funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the scientists looked at hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, reports and symposia proceedings published between 1990 and 2008 to obtain a global perspective on what kinds of animals were being caught, where they were being caught, and the types of gear in which they were trapped. The researchers then compiled all of this information into a single comprehensive map and dataset.\n\n“We call this the whole enchilada,” Ms Lewison said. “It highlights the importance of looking at the bycatch issue across different species, fishing gears and countries. When you do that, it is clear that to address bycatch, fishing nations need to work together to report and mitigate bycatch. No single country can fix this. “\n\nThe study also revealed gaps in the available bycatch data, such as the lack of information on small-scale and coastal fisheries and from many ocean regions that are heavily fished by commercial fleets.\n\n“Industry has taken the lead in developing mitigation in many countries, but these measures aren’t used everywhere,” Mr Crowder said. “The fact is that as long as we have a fishing industry, we’re going to have an ecological footprint. We need to use the best-available data, science and technology to reduce that footprint as much as we can.”', 'A new in-depth analysis of global bycatch data provides fisheries and the conservation community with the best information yet to help mitigate the ecological damage of bycatch and helps identify where mitigation measures are most needed.\n“Bycatch are the animals they don’t want or mean to catch.”Cumulative Impacts.This figure illustrates the cumulative impacts of megafauna bycatch by region.\nWhile those snapshots have been important and useful, Ms Lewison said, they’ve missed the larger, integrated picture.\n“It highlights the importance of looking at the bycatch issue across different species, fishing gears and countries.\nWhen you do that, it is clear that to address bycatch, fishing nations need to work together to report and mitigate bycatch.']"

The issue flared up earlier this year following news that Netflix streaming speeds for customers of ISPs including Verizon and Comcast were slowing, as these firms attempted to extract a fee from Netflix in exchange for connecting directly to their networks and resolving the issue.\n\nNetflix announced an agreement with Comcast last month in which it will indeed pay for a connection, and has been in talks with Verizon as well. But Hastings said the company was engaging in these talks “reluctantly.”\n\n“If this kind of leverage is effective against Netflix, which is pretty large, imagine the plight of smaller services today and in the future,” Hastings wrote.\n\n“Netflix believes strong net neutrality is critical, but in the near term we will in cases pay the toll to the powerful ISPs to protect our consumer experience.”\n\nNet neutrality advocates faced a setback earlier this year, when Verizon convinced a judge to strike down the Federal Communications Commission’s regulations on the issue. The FCC is now attempting to craft new net neutrality regulations that will better withstand legal scrutiny.\n\nBut the FCC’s rules will only cover how ISPs treat traffic on their own networks; they don’t address the issue of connections between networks, which is at the heart of the Netflix dispute.\n\n“The traditional form of net neutrality which was recently overturned by a Verizon lawsuit is important, but insufficient,” Hastings said. “Without strong net neutrality, big ISPs can demand potentially escalating fees for the interconnection required to deliver high quality service.”\n\nOther big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs.\n\nGiven the massive amount of data consumption Netflix generates — around a third of traffic online during peak hours — the big ISPs argue that it should help foot the bill for delivery.\n\nBut Hastings says Netflix is simply satisfying requests from the ISPs’ customers, who pay steep monthly bills in the expectation that their content will be delivered at a certain speed regardless of where it comes from. In many places, he noted, consumers have just one or two choices for broadband Internet service.\n\n“The big ISPs can make these demands — driving up costs and prices for everyone else — because of their market position,” Hastings wrote.\n\nComcast vice president David Cohen said in a statement that the FCC’s net neutrality rules were never designed to deal with paid connections between networks, “which have been an essential part of the growth of the Internet for two decades.”\n\n“Providers like Netflix have always paid for their interconnection to the Internet and have always had ample options to ensure that their customers receive an optimal performance through all ISPs,” Cohen said. “We are happy that Comcast and Netflix were able to reach an amicable, market-based solution to our interconnection issues and believe that our agreement demonstrates the effectiveness of the market as a mechanism to deal with these matters.”\n\nVerizon declined to comment; AT&T and Time Warner Cable did not respond to requests for comment.', '× Netflix blasts Internet providers: ‘Consumers deserve better’NEW YORK (CNNMoney) — Netflix isn’t backing down in its fight against the country’s largest Internet service providers.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings sounded off Thursday against big ISPs like Verizon and Comcast, accusing them of compromising Internet freedom and degrading the experience of consumers.\nThe FCC is now attempting to craft new net neutrality regulations that will better withstand legal scrutiny.\n“The traditional form of net neutrality which was recently overturned by a Verizon lawsuit is important, but insufficient,” Hastings said.\n“Without strong net neutrality, big ISPs can demand potentially escalating fees for the interconnection required to deliver high quality service.”Other big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Facebook, already have paid-connection deals with big ISPs.']"

I spent the first month basically wandering alone and not seeing anyone else wearing Glass at all. Then I hooked up with Seattle Glass Explorers Artists and Developers Incubator, which meets every Friday afternoon. Because I have a day job, I can’t be there every Friday, but I’ve been there a few times, and met the core people from the incubator at a few other functions. They are really very smart and kind people. At any rate, I have some new friends and some new things to learn. These are both things I find energizing.\n\nSecond, I’ve learned that people’s reactions to Glass vary along a bell curve. The most common reaction, and the middle of the curve, is mild curiosity. For most people, Glass is just not that big a deal. They’re curious, will ask a few questions, and then the conversation moves on.\n\nThe curiosity side fades to fascination. Some people are really interested in Glass. Glass Explorers, futurists, and science fiction writers, entrepreneurs, young people in technology, and a few random others who find Glass interesting. These people want to try it on, to understand it, and in some cases are actively interested in using Glass for good. Think applications that make the world a better place or simply make things easier. After all, hands-free computing is awesome. Good for inspectors, dog trainers, health care workers, house cleaners…the list goes on.\n\nOn the other hand, the disinterest side of the bell curve fades to fear, which I find is almost always based on misunderstanding. There are people who are convinced that Glass is always on and always recording, and always being watched by some evil human being at Google. None of the above are true. In most cases, I’ve found people are willing to learn and to often change their attitude about Glass when they understand it better. Generally, this group of people does not come from the tech community, but a few times I’ve been surprised by conspiracy-theory level worries from people who really aught to know better, like DBA’s and other people with college degrees.\n\nBest thing about Glass today? It’s lovely to be able to do some basic computing without needing my hands for much of it (Glass is not entirely hands free). Next best? The potential is amazing.\n\nThere is a certain awkwardness to Glass in many situations. Sometimes I don’t use it for days. I usually like wearing it, and I wish I had more time to learn more about it and try out more applications. Some of this awkwardness comes from the fact that Glass is still an expensive limited edition, some comes from the very idea of wearing a camera on your face (or anything electronic on your face), and some is that the user interface is still rough around the edges in spite of really good apps like the turn by turn directions.\n\nThe current conversation about Glass is really waiting for a clear sign from Google about next steps. For example, most development is small stuff since VC funding is hard to go after for a product with no release date, no cost, and no clearly communicated direction. In the meantime, I’m still out here exploring Glass and enjoying the process.', 'It seemed like I should give people a bit of an update about Google Glass, and what the experience of being a Glass Explorer has been like for me.\nI spent the first month basically wandering alone and not seeing anyone else wearing Glass at all.\nGlass Explorers, futurists, and science fiction writers, entrepreneurs, young people in technology, and a few random others who find Glass interesting.\nThere are people who are convinced that Glass is always on and always recording, and always being watched by some evil human being at Google.\nThe current conversation about Glass is really waiting for a clear sign from Google about next steps.']"

I don’t like being killed over and over because I do not log hundreds of hours in the same game. I was a little skeptical of Titanfall at first because of the multiplayer only aspect. I played the beta and managed to enjoy myself, even though I was not the best player on the team.\n\nGiant Robots have my attention no matter what. I was willing to forgive Titanfall’s game setup if I could feed my secret ‘Pacific Rim’ fantasy. The first game I played changed my entire outlook on multiplayer for first person shooters (FPS). 6 vs 6 matches sound small on paper to someone who lived for Warhawk on PS3’s 16 vs 16. The presence of ‘dumber’ computer controlled characters called “Grunts” gives you plenty to kill. Grunts are also an opportunity to gain in game experience even if you cannot manage to kill a player controlled pilot. My first few times playing I scored better than I had anticipated. Even though I was getting slaughtered every time I faced another pilot, the game still managed to make everything fun.\n\nTitanfall is fun. I know that sounds dumb but, in all aspects the game is fun. Movement by your pilot is an absolute blast. As a pilot, you can run along walls, hang on walls, and double jump. Traversing the map alone can be the highlight of a match. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop or wall jumping in between close buildings feels like it’s something out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The combat is similar to your normal FPS but, the presence of Titans and Anti-Titan weapons changes the mix. The weapons are neat but the pilot weapons are nothing out of the ordinary. The one unique pilot weapon is the “Smart Pistol” which locks automatically to a target when in range. Trust me, it is more difficult to use than it sounds on paper. The pilot abilities offer a nice change up for game play with things like cloaking (nearly impossible to see when in a Titan) and Radar. For completing certain challenges and actions you are rewarded with single use ‘burn cards’. Burn cards offer an edge in battle whether it be 80 seconds off your Titan build or unlimited sprint.\n\nTitan combat is where the game truly shines and stands out above the other FPS games on the market. Titans are huge and somewhat slow (they are capable of dashing but only small distances) but they have incredible fire power. Weapons like machine guns, rockets, and grenade launchers, and a plasma rifle (my favorite) are what you can expect to use as a Titan. Like pilots, Titans also have special abilities for defense and offense. Each of the 3 Titans have their own unique ability (unlimited dash, increased damage output, and advanced shields) that take time to charge up and last only a few seconds. Other than the main weapon, Titans also are equipped with the pilot’s choice between three different forms of missiles. The multiple weapons and abilities make it easy for you to pick a load-out to match your play style.\n\nTitan on Titan combat is amazing and was shown off a good bit before the game was launched. Like many other members of the gaming community, I was worried that Titans would basically be an ‘instant win’. Not the case. As I mentioned, each pilot starts with an Anti-Titan weapon. Titans are able to crush pilots by stepping on them and one direct shot from most Titan weapons will instantly kill pilots. Titans are slow compared to pilots and their weapons are not as accurate for shooting such small targets. Pilots are also able to jump on the back of Titans to damage their ‘core’ directly and bring them down much faster. All of these factors make up a system with checks and balances to make sure that the game stays fair.\n\nI’ve logged dozens of hours on Titanfall. Almost 100 matches in and the game remains fresh and exciting. I purchased an Xbox One for this game and I have not regretted it. My only complaint with the game is the story. The struggle between the Militia and IMC is secondary to what is going on in the missions. To be honest, I have very little idea of what even happened as far as the plot even after playing through the campaign twice. I really do not think the majority of players will be playing for the story. Titan combat and unique pilot combat really makes this game stand out over all the rest. The game lives up to all of the hype. The developers have promised more content and game types in the near future. If you are even on the fence about Titanfall, get it—you will not be disappointed.\n\nTitanfall is rated M and is available now on Xbox One and PC and will be releasing in April for the Xbox 360', 'The weapons are neat but the pilot weapons are nothing out of the ordinary.\nThe one unique pilot weapon is the “Smart Pistol” which locks automatically to a target when in range.\nTitan combat is where the game truly shines and stands out above the other FPS games on the market.\nTitan on Titan combat is amazing and was shown off a good bit before the game was launched.\nTitan combat and unique pilot combat really makes this game stand out over all the rest.']"

Andrew Burton/Getty Images In the not-too-distant future, it may be possible to create a digital mugshot from DNA.\n\nResearchers from Pennsylvania State University, led by anthropologist Mark Shriver, published a study this week on their attempts to understand how our genetic code influences our facial structure.\n\nThat research, say the authors of the study, will one day make it possible to predict criminals’ appearances based only on, say, a strand of hair left at a crime scene.\n\nAlthough things like sex, skin tone, and eye and hair colors are relatively easy to predict from DNA, facial structures have always been more of a mystery. Faces are complicated, and how one part is shaped can strongly influence other parts of the face. To tackle such a complex project, the researchers took pictures of 532 people of mixed European and West African ancestry from three different regions. They then made 3D images of those faces, overlaying each of them with 7,000 data points to determine variation among faces. Nature explains what they did next:\n\nNext, the authors compared the volunteers’ genomes to identify points at which the DNA differed by a single base, called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). To narrow down the search, they focused on genes thought to be involved in facial development, such as those that shape the head in early embryonic development, and those that are mutated in disorders associated with features such as cleft palate. Then, taking into account the person’s sex and ancestry, they calculated the statistical likelihood that a given SNP was involved in determining a particular facial feature.\n\nIn the end, the scientists found 24 SNPs on 20 different genes, all of which control facial structure to some extent. Of course, a person’s entire appearance isn’t solely dictated by his or her DNA, and current methods for testing DNA are by no means falling by the wayside. “Human facial diversity is substantial, complex, and largely scientifically unexplained,” write the researchers in the study’s abstract, published in PLOS Genetics. Still, their predictive model can already create a crude facial model based only on genetic code, and the project’s usefulness for detectives is already being tested.

Researchers from the U.S. and Belgium have developed a computer program that renders a crude genetic “mugshot” from a small sample of DNA.\n\nForensics can already predict eye and hair color relatively easily. Io9 notes that criminal investigators can even use maggots to extract a victim’s DNA from their unidentifiable body or find hidden faces by zooming into hi-res photos of eyes. But the face is a complex structure that’s more difficult to map from just one DNA sample.\n\nAccording to New Scientist, researchers used a stereoscopic camera to make 3D images of roughly 600 volunteers with mixed European and West African ancestry. They identified more than 7,000 distinct points on the face to see how sex and racial ancestry affect the position of these points. The variations were used to develop a statistical model that reconstructs the overall shape of a person’s face.\n\nThe team also isolated 24 genetic variants, called single nucleotide polymorphisms, which play a role in shaping a face, such as those that shape the head during embryonic development. Lastly, researchers had volunteers rate the 600 faces on perceived ethnicity as well as on a scale of masculinity and femininity.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal PLOS Genetics, says this process could allow investigators to make computer-generated mugshots from genetic material left at a crime scene.\n\n“We show that facial variation with regard to sex, ancestry, and genes can be systematically studied with our methods, allowing us to lay the foundation for predictive modeling of faces,” the authors note. “Such predictive modeling could be forensically useful; for example, DNA left at crime scenes could be tested and faces predicted in order to help to narrow the pool of potential suspects.

And yet, the ability to compare genetic information against known standards only helps if your criminal has their genotype in a government database; otherwise, investigators must already have a suspect to test against their evidence. Even bleeding-edge technologies for drawing genuinely novel information from DNA provide broad characteristics at best; a guess at the suspect’s ethnicity, hair colour, and perhaps a six-inch range for height.\n\nNow, researchers in the US and Belgium have teamed up to make such estimates far, far more accurate. They hope that routine genetic analysis could be the basis for basic facial reconstruction, providing a computer-generated sketch for criminals that nobody (living) ever actually saw. Their results are, as you can see below, startlingly accurate at times — but the limitations of their methodology mean that they still have a long way to go before they’re ready for the courtroom.\n\nThe basic insight at use in this research is that genetic analysis doesn’t have to progress in a purely mechanistic way. Many past attempts in forensic genetics have looked at the impact of a particular gene on the molecular level, following it through from genotype to the probability of having a physical trait. That’s fine for something simple like eye colour, but facial features are influenced by an unknown number of genes. To simplify matters, the researchers looked at more than 75 genes known to create facial abnormalities when mutated, reasoning that if less common mutations can cause improper development then more common mutations might cause normal facial variation. Their research returned 20 genes of interest to face-shape.\n\nMore than 600 volunteers of mixed ethnic backgrounds (to increase genetic diversity in the sample) had their faces scanned into high-resolution digital meshes, which were in turn analyzed for nine facial landmarks. These landmarks, like the position of the pupils, cheekbones, and tip of the nose, relate to the team’s 20 genes of interest. By doing detailed analysis of the relationship between face-shape and genotype, the researchers hope to make a database that can read an unidentified genome to make educated guesses about the location of each facial landmark. Generating a mesh that interpolates between the points (with a few other basic considerations like sex taken into account) leads to the computational mugshot.\n\nThis sort of analysis has already been in very preliminary use for some the world’s most desperate cases — crimes of a nature that ensure there will be no pushback against police methodology. The most famous case so far involved the 2004 bombings in Madrid, which saw genetic analysis correctly predict the ethnic background of the criminals. That insight provoked relatively little controversy in the context of hunting the murderers of several hundred innocent commuters — but in the general legal system, any technology that pinpoints racial history is likely to spark heated legal debate.\n\nNo matter how the technology progresses, these computational mugshots will likely always fall into the same legal category as today’s artist-drawn sketches from witness descriptions — they will be legally useless. We have good reasons for excluding artist renderings from admissibility (they tend to cause an unacceptable number of false positives) and those reasons hold true for the computational kind. Only so much information can be gleaned from “facial landmarks” and just like the human memory, genes only tell part of the story. Everything from disease to drug use to injury to tattoos to the normal ageing process can throw genetic descriptions off-target.\n\nThat’s not to say that they can’t be helpful in an investigation, in narrowing suspects and helping detectives stay on the right path, but that’s a far cry from direct admissibility as evidence. It will likely be useful more as a disconfirming technology that proves certain suspects can’t be the perpetrator, as it narrows the range of possibilities for various physical traits. Staying out of the courtroom will earn this software some leeway in the public sphere, but that will last only until the first national manhunt launched in pursuit of a computer-generated person.', 'Travel records, fingerprints, and even eye-witness testimony tend to be minimized in relation to the certainty of genetic testing: if independently checked genetic analysis says you were at the crime scene, then you (or your identical twin) were at the scene.\nNow, researchers in the US and Belgium have teamed up to make such estimates far, far more accurate.\nThey hope that routine genetic analysis could be the basis for basic facial reconstruction, providing a computer-generated sketch for criminals that nobody (living) ever actually saw.\nThe basic insight at use in this research is that genetic analysis doesn’t have to progress in a purely mechanistic way.\nThe most famous case so far involved the 2004 bombings in Madrid, which saw genetic analysis correctly predict the ethnic background of the criminals.']"

Researchers have developed a computer program that can create a crude three-dimensional (3D) model of a face from a DNA sample.\n\nUsing genes to predict eye and hair color is relatively easy. But the complex structure of the face makes it more valuable as a forensic tool — and more difficult to connect to genetic variation, says anthropologist Mark Shriver of Pennsylvania State University in University Park, who led the work, published today in PLOS Genetics.\n\nShriver and his colleagues took high-resolution images of the faces of 592 people of mixed European and West African ancestry living in the United States, Brazil and Cape Verde. They used these images to create 3D models, laying a grid of more than 7,000 data points on the surface of the digital face and determining by how much particular points on a given face varied from the average: whether the nose was flatter, for instance, or the cheekbones wider. They had volunteers rate the faces on a scale of masculinity and femininity, as well as on perceived ethnicity.\n\nNext, the authors compared the volunteers’ genomes to identify points at which the DNA differed by a single base, called a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). To narrow down the search, they focused on genes thought to be involved in facial development, such as those that shape the head in early embryonic development, and those that are mutated in disorders associated with features such as cleft palate. Then, taking into account the person’s sex and ancestry, they calculated the statistical likelihood that a given SNP was involved in determining a particular facial feature.\n\nThis pinpointed 24 SNPs across 20 genes that were significantly associated with facial shape. A computer program the team developed using the data can turn a DNA sequence from an unknown individual into a predictive 3D facial model (see 'Face to face'). Shriver says that the group is now trying to integrate more people and genes, and look at additional traits, such as hair texture and sex-specific differences.\n\nDifficult deduction\n\nKun Tang, a biologist at the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences in China, says that facial reconstruction is turning out to be much more difficult than predicting, say, skin pigmentation. “One thing we’re certain of: there's no single gene that suddenly makes your nose big or small,” he says. The task is complicated further, he adds, by environmental factors, such as exposure to specific climates, which is hypothesized to influence the structure of faces.\n\nTang’s group has also been looking for genes associated with individual facial features, using an even more detailed scan that produces 30,000 data points per face. In a paper published in December 2013, Tang and his colleagues reported taking similar high-resolution 3D images of 1,001 Han Chinese, and trying to connect the faces to their genomes. The researchers found five SNPs — different ones from those identified by Shriver’s group — that were significantly correlated with several facial features. For instance, one gene known to be involved in causing cleft palate strongly predicted lip shape in Han Chinese women. Tang says the group is now in the process of adding thousands more people of different ethnicities from around the country to see whether there are regional differences in facial structure.\n\nManfred Kayser, a forensic molecular biologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, says that although these 3D-modelling tools could be very useful in the future as the genetic predictors are developed, at present the genetic analyses in the two papers are of limited value.\n\nEven seemingly simple features such as height have proved difficult to predict. A recent paper from Kayser’s lab reported an analysis of nearly 10,000 Dutch volunteers, taking 180 SNPs into account. It found that it was possible to predict whether a person would be unusually tall with reasonable accuracy, but not nearly as well as eye color can be predicted. “This is a large number of SNPs explaining a not-so-large number of height variations,” he says.\n\nFaces will be much more difficult, he adds, and creating a test that looks at all of the possible SNPs will be a technical challenge requiring samples of high-quality DNA in more than trace amounts — a luxury that forensic investigators rarely have.\n\nThis article is reproduced with permission from the magazine Nature.

Shriver, from Penn State.\n\nThe researchers looked at both actual physical face shape and genetic markers of face shape. For physical face shape, the researchers used populations of mixed West African and European ancestry from the U.S., Brazil and Cape Verde.

They then used statistical methods to determine the relationship between the variation in the faces and the effects of sex, genomic ancestry and genes that affect the shape of the head and face.\n\nTo identify these genes, the researchers looked at known genetic mutations that cause facial and cranial deformation because these genes in their normal variations might also affect the face and head. For example, one gene affects the lips, another changes the shape and configuration of the bones around the eyes, and another influences the shape of the mid face and skull.\n\nEventually, the researchers think that they might approximate the image of a parent from the DNA of children or better visualize some ofancestors by examining DNA.

New finds from the dinosaur may reveal details about how the terrible lizards went extinct.\n\nThis feathered dinosaur lived at the end of the reign of the reptiles. Including its tail, this creature stretched 11 feet long, weighed 500 pounds, and had thin, muscular limbs, perfect for tearing into prey with razor-sharp claws. This chicken from Hell roamed the areas that now make up the states of Montana, Wyoming and the Dakotas.\n\nFossils of the species recovered so far consist of partial skeletons from three individuals. Together, the remains make up nearly one entire body.\n\nAnzu wyliei is a member of a group of feathered dinosaurs called Oviraptorosauria. This group of dinosaurs has been classified by paleontologists for almost 100 years. Study of the group has been based on skeletons found in Asia as well as some fragments from North America.\n\nAnzu wyliei was found in the Hell Creek Formation, near the borders between the four states. This area, full of clays, sandstones and mudstones, was once a swampy forest. Now, the area is rich with fossils from the late Cretaceous era, the last era of the dinosaurs.\n\nThe three dinosaur fossils were known for a while, but never recognized as a new species until now. Lead author of an article accompanying the finding was Matthew Lamanna of the Carnegie Museum. Co-authors include Hans-Dieter Sues and Tyler Larson from the Smithsonian Institution, Emma Schachner from the University of Utah.\n\nChicken from Hell may not be a fitting term for the animal, however. As far as researchers can tell, the animal did not hunt big game.\n\n""Anzu and other caenagnathids may have favored well-watered floodplain settings over channel margins, and were probably ecological generalists that fed upon vegetation, small animals, and perhaps eggs,"" researchers wrote in the accompanying article.\n\nThe Carnegie Museum of Natural History owned two of the fossils, which were found just 50 feet apart from one another in South Dakota. Tyler Lyson first spotted the third dinosaur in North Dakota when he was a teenager. He is now a post-doctorate researcher at the National History Museum, and co-author of the paper.\n\nPaleontologists working on the two finds read papers released by the other team. Each group became convinced their dinosaurs might be related. The two teams met at a conference of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in 2006. They soon realized they were working on the same animal, and they spent years constructing a nearly-complete skeleton.\n\nSome researchers point out the extinction of the dinosaurs was well-underway before 65 million years ago. For these feathered reptiles, however, they appeared to be thriving until the day the asteroid hit.\n\nRecreation of the skeleton of Anzu wyliei is detailed in the online journal Plos One.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

Its fossils offer further clues to how the dinosaurs became extinct 66 million years ago.\n\nAnzu wyliei is a strange, bird-like creature that has a bony crest on top of a beaky head and a long tail like a lizard. The animal was identified from the partial remains of three skeletons collected in North and South Dakota. It is reported in PLoS ONE journal. “We had inklings that there might be such a creature out there, but now with these bones we have 80% of the skeleton and can really look in detail at the structure of this animal and make inferences about its biology,” says Hans Sues, curator of vertebrate palaeontology in the department of palaeobiology at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC.\n\n“Anzu is really bizarre, even by dinosaur standards. “The skull has this extraordinarily tall and thin crest with a snout and a huge beak with sharp edges and a strange sliding jaw joint,” that could be used to cut up vegetation and meat, he says. The size of a small car, the dinosaur also had claws and feathers on its upper arms. It belongs to a group of dinosaurs known as Oviraptorosauria. Most evidence of their existence comes from fossils discovered in Central and East Asia.\n\nThe Anzu bones are the first detailed evidence that oviraptorosaurs also lived in North America.\n\nThe specimens were found in a geological formation known as Hell Creek, which has been extensively explored and is the source of many dinosaur fossils discovered in North America. Scientists have nicknamed it “the chicken from Hell” because of its appearance and where it was found.\n\nThe site is important because it was formed in the last two million years of the Cretaceous Period, just before dinosaurs were wiped out by an asteroid strike. Many researchers have argued that the dinosaurs were already in decline because of climate change.\n\nBut according to Dr Sues and his team, the discovery of Anzu offers further proof that many species were still evolving and dinosaur communities were diverse and flourishing.\n\n“This is consistent with the idea that a mass extinction was caused by the great asteroid impact 66 million years ago. It’s clear that dinosaurs were still quite diverse until the very end,” says Dr Sues.', 'Share:BBCWashington -US scientists have announced the discovery of a new species of dinosaur.\nThe size of a small car, the dinosaur also had claws and feathers on its upper arms.\nThe specimens were found in a geological formation known as Hell Creek, which has been extensively explored and is the source of many dinosaur fossils discovered in North America.\nScientists have nicknamed it “the chicken from Hell” because of its appearance and where it was found.\nBut according to Dr Sues and his team, the discovery of Anzu offers further proof that many species were still evolving and dinosaur communities were diverse and flourishing.']"

Unveiling what it simply calls the Smart Lamp, these Bluetooth-enabled bulbs are designed to give a touch of automation and tech savvy into homes without the need to replace existing bulb fixtures.\n\nBulbs with smarts seem to be slowly on the rise. Last month, Philips gave a preview of its Intelligent Lighting technology which communicates with mobile devices via a combination of visual light communication or VLC and Bluetooth LE (Low Energy). While LG’s new bulbs are less exotic than that, after all, they’re meant to mostly be use inside residential spaces, they are no less capable.\n\nCommunication with the LG Smart Lamp happens through Bluetooth as well. All it needs on the smartphone side is a specialized app for Android devices running Android 4.3 or higher. iOS version 6 and latter are also supported, but the app is currently still unavailable. Functionality isn’t really that complicated and basically comes in two modes. Security mode turns on the lights at specified times, as if the owner was really at home while Play mode adds a bit of fun into the atmosphere by dimming or blinking the lights depending on the currently playing song. LG also throws in a pinch of notification, by flashing the lights when you receive a call. Perfect for times when you forget your phone in another room.\n\nPerhaps the best part of LG Smart Lamps is that they don’t need a different socket and can simply be slapped into regular bulb sockets. It is also advertised to be 80 percent more efficient than regular light bulbs and can last up to 10 years on an average use of 5 hours a day. Naturally, it will also cost more than your regular light bulb, fetching a 35,000 won price tag in Korea, roughly converted to $32, per bulb. International availability is currently still unknown.\n\nSOURCE: LG\n\nVIA: SlashGear', 'LG has just revealed one of its little incursions into the smart home territory.\nCommunication with the LG Smart Lamp happens through Bluetooth as well.\nPerhaps the best part of LG Smart Lamps is that they don’t need a different socket and can simply be slapped into regular bulb sockets.\nIt is also advertised to be 80 percent more efficient than regular light bulbs and can last up to 10 years on an average use of 5 hours a day.\nNaturally, it will also cost more than your regular light bulb, fetching a 35,000 won price tag in Korea, roughly converted to $32, per bulb.']"

Smarter than just turning on or off with a timer or smart phone, well LG wants to make your lighting dance with the music. LG announced their take on the \'smart\' LED light bulb, first smart light out of the company. The \'smart\' LED from LG can be controlled by Android which should be a given, and iOS with a special feature only for Android. LED\'s have the longest life and use up less energy, but more than that, they\'re easier to make in colors. So yes, this LED will come in color and in Day White. There will be an app to control the lights available for Android 4.3 and higher, and just like any other smart appliance or home product. Should be very similar to what we have seen already from Belkin WeMo lighting and outlets. When it comes to iOS, if you are concerned, the app will be available for iOS 6 and higher. Like we touched on earlier though, there will be some differences in controls between Android and iOS.\n\nBoth Android and iOS will have control over basic functions of the lights. Turn them on, turn them off, and with any good smart light, a security option as well. The security option is a way to set the lights on a timer, meaning on and off at certain times while you are away. However, that is all that iOS will be able to accomplish, and where Android gets a couple of more interesting features. As we know, LG caters a bit more to consumers of the Android persuasion, and rightfully so, being that the majority of their consumers, if not all of them, are using Android. Using the Android app, you can access ""Play Mode"". Using this mode, will make the lights blink or dim in cadence with the beat of whatever music you are playing. Turning your room into a club dance floor is a neat trick but even better, is turning your lights into some sort of assistant. ""Play Mode"" will also allow you the option of making your lights flash when you get a phone call. That way, if your ringtone is on silent, at least your lights can give you away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has been no word yet as to when you can get your hands on these bulbs, but the pricing has been given. For the US, we are looking at around $32 per bulb it would seem. That may seem pricey for a lightbulb, but remember, these are LED lights, so they can last you for about ten years.

Hue requires a ZigBee base station, rather than connecting directly to a phone via Bluetooth, unlike LG’s system and the Lumen TL800 we reviewed back in January.\n\nThe advantage of the app control is that you can control basic features like dimming the light or turning them on or off. There are also several interesting modes to the bulb, for example there is a Security Mode and Play Mode. In the Security Mode, the bulb behaves as if the owner of the home is turning it on, even though they may be away. A specified area lights up at a specified time, and this can be set up throughout the house.\n\nIn the Play Mode, the lights adjust the brightness to suit the mood and beat of the songs being played. For example, if the music is upbeat and peppy, LG Smart Lamp will recreate a party atmosphere; blinking lights an all.\n\nThe only hitch for now is that the Play Mode is available only the Android devices. Folks with iOS will have to wait.\n\nAnother important feature is that the lights tend flash when you are receiving an incoming call; this is very helpful when you’ve forgotten to get your phone out of the bag.

There are several key bits of information to watch for.\n\nOffice for iPad confirmed\n\nReports that Microsoft would be bringing its Office suite to the iPad sent Microsoft\'s stock price to a one-year high. March 27 is the date that these reports will -- presumably -- be confirmed, which could give the stock another boost. This is big news for Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), as well as BYOD trends in general, since an Office option on the iPad will make workplace mobile environments more flexible. Microsoft is accepting the risk that Surface sales may fall if consumers choose the iPad Office option instead, but an Office app for Apple tablets has been needed ever since the iPad\'s release.\n\nIf the news is confirmed, it could give Apple a boost, too. Currently trading slightly below its historical average, including times earnings and price-to-sales, Apple may look attractive for some buyers now. But, good news from Microsoft about the iPad could have synergies with Apple\'s stock as well, leading to new price growth.\n\nWindows Phone updates\n\nMicrosoft has already demonstrated its Windows 8.1 update for its phone line, showing new features such as greater cloud connectivity and a new Windows Store interface. The Build conference is a strong opportunity to dig deeper into the update and release more information on any new apps or compatibility. This is especially true when it comes to mobile/social functions that Microsoft has been investing in lately, including the acquisition of business social network Yammer and a $15 million partnership with Foursquare.\n\nHints about Windows 9 could also surface, perhaps including plans with new phone partners like Lenovo, LG, ZTE, and Foxconn, which Microsoft recently announced back in February. Signs that the phone division of Microsoft is not a waste of investment would be welcome.\n\nMore 365 info\n\nMicrosoft has already used March conferences to speak about Microsoft Office 365 and how it seeks to combine cloud power, big data, and new mobile capabilities in one big package. Nadella now has the opportunity to elaborate on Office 365, particularly when it comes to mobile devices.\n\nConclusion\n\nHow will the new Groups feature, with its cloud-based unification and connections to SharePoint and Yammer, empower mobile users? What new benefits does OneDrive bring to the mix? Can additional demonstration of Office Graph prove it is more of a utility than a gimmick? The Build conference may be the time to provide answers consumers are waiting for.\n\nIt may also be the time to unveil some entirely new apps and features. A newsfeed-like, intelligent app codenamed ""Oslo"" has also been previewed, but the official name and details remain unknown. Showing more about this interface app and other upcoming products, like OneDrive for Business (set for release in April), could encourage developers, consumers and investors alike.', ""Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) press event at the Build Conference in San Francisco on March 27 is drawing close.\nThe conference is also a chance for Microsoft to explain its new mobile/cloud strategy, confirm rumors regarding Office, and show where its next updates are headed.\nThe conference provides an opportunity to see where such investment will be placed, and what other businesses stand to benefit.\nOffice for iPad confirmedReports that Microsoft would be bringing its Office suite to the iPad sent Microsoft's stock price to a one-year high.\nWindows Phone updatesMicrosoft has already demonstrated its Windows 8.1 update for its phone line, showing new features such as greater cloud connectivity and a new Windows Store interface.""]"

35990,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/23/more-evidence-that-microsoft-needs-office-for-ipad.aspx,technology,"[""Ever since Apple launched the iPad, the storyline of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office for iPad has been impossible to bury. Even so, it has been four years since Steve Jobs unveiled Apple's tablet and Microsoft's dominant productivity suite still hasn't made it to iOS. But with productivity software competitors gaining traction in mobile, Microsoft finally appears to be ready to launch a version of Office for iPad.\n\nShares jumped about 4% on Tuesday when Reuters reported that new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would unveil Office for iPad on March 27. Judging by the rally in Microsoft's stock price that has sent shares to levels not reached since the dot.com boom in 2000, it is pretty clear that investors are excited about the software -- and for good reason.\n\nWaiting is no longer an option\n\nThere are various estimates of just how much money Microsoft is losing by not having a version of Office for the iPad. While the estimates differ, they all seem to suggest that Microsoft is missing out on a significant opportunity.\n\nOne comes from Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Holt, who estimates that if the suite is priced at $60 for an annual subscription, about 30% of iPad users would buy the software. The end result? Apple could generate a whopping $2.5 billion in revenue annually -- and that's after the 30% App Store commission. Based on his claim that 30%-40% of Mac users install Office on their Apple computers, a 30% installation rate among iPad users sounds reasonable.\n\nTaking Holt's estimate further, assuming 35% of this revenue hits the bottom line, Office for iPad could grow Microsoft's annual net income by about 4%. That's a significant gain for a cash cow like Microsoft.\n\nBut the move to launch Office for iPad would have significant intangible benefits, too. Particularly, it would give Office a competitive position in a space where productivity suite competitors are mounting. Both Google and Apple now offer versions of their productivity software for free. And beyond the big tech giants, there are hundreds of other productivity software alternatives in the App Store.\n\nFurther, Microsoft's launch of Office for iPad could send the long-awaited signal to investors that it is ready to take on a cross-platform approach. A recent comment from Microsoft's Thorsten Hubschen, who oversees Office in Germany, that the company is renewing its Office for Mac efforts also supports the idea that Microsoft is headed toward a cross-platform strategy.\n\nA change of direction?\n\nFor Microsoft investors, a launch of a version of the productivity software for the world's most popular tablet should provide incremental confidence in the company's ability to shift its products to a mobile-dominated future. Further, the launch of Office for iPad signals that Microsoft is finally ready to make the important shift to a cross-platform software environment -- an imperative move that best happens sooner than later."", ""Ever since Apple launched the iPad, the storyline of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office for iPad has been impossible to bury.\nBut with productivity software competitors gaining traction in mobile, Microsoft finally appears to be ready to launch a version of Office for iPad.\nShares jumped about 4% on Tuesday when Reuters reported that new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would unveil Office for iPad on March 27.\nBased on his claim that 30%-40% of Mac users install Office on their Apple computers, a 30% installation rate among iPad users sounds reasonable.\nBut the move to launch Office for iPad would have significant intangible benefits, too.""]"
35991,http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/microsoft-office-on-ipad-too-little-too-late--1235918,technology,"['Well, it\'s happening: Microsoft is bringing elements of its Office suite, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint, to iPad in a bid to win over the ever expanding tablet user base, which has largely been neglected by Redmond.\n\nAside from its Office suites on the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, which operate predominately within the \'Desktop\' mode of Windows 8 rather than being bespoke apps design for tablets, Microsoft has done very little to appease iPads users. It did hint repeatedly that Office would ""one day"" be coming to iOS, but never actually delivered a final version, until now.\n\nWhether Office on iPad is a success or not remains to be seen, but will rely heavily on the way Microsoft chooses to implement the app(s). We can\'t know the implementation that Microsoft will choose to use for Office on iPad, but we know the options.\n\nOne option is to use Office 365, Microsoft\'s subscription service for Office. Microsoft\'s Surface devices require Office 365 to run the Office suite hinting at the path Microsoft may choose to take for Office on iPad.\n\nFor £79.99 (US$99.99, AU$119) a year, or £7.99 (US$9.99, AU$12) a month, Microsoft 365 gives you OneDrive (née SkyDrive) storage, international Skype minutes, all of the Office suite and syncing between devices.\n\nIt would stand to reason that the iPad version would require this to work, but is it necessarily the best way for Microsoft to go about it?\n\nThe answer to that question is likely no. Microsoft will know this because the iPad is still not seen as a ""creation"" device, mainly due to the lack of keyboard.\n\nWays to pay\n\nMany users will balk at having to pay a monthly fee in order to use a programme they will most likely use infrequently. It will be used to edit a few documents they have been sent via email or to change a document while travelling without a laptop. Of course some users will sign up, but not as many as Microsoft would want considering the effort that has gone into porting Office to iOS.\n\nA far better alternative would be the more Apple-esque route of charging a small fee per app (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) and offering an in-app purchase of Office 365 if the customer wishes to sync documents seamlessly across devices.\n\nWhile this would mean sending 30% of all sales to Apple, the consumer would receive a more cohesive experience that would rival Apple\'s own productivity suite. According to data from App Annie, Pages, the Apple equivalent of Word, has been in the top 40 apps all time, despite charging £6.99 (US $9.99, AU$10.49) up until September 2013. Microsoft will likely want to replicate this success to make their foray into iOS worthwhile.\n\nAccording to a tweet sent to MacRumors Microsoft could choose to bundle the suite into a single app, allowing users limited functionality but offering the app for free.\n\nThis strategy lends itself to the casual user who wishes to edit very simple files, but falls far short of beating Apple\'s offerings on the platform which are also free, offer near-desktop levels of editing ability and can export to both Microsoft and Apple\'s productivity suites. Users may download the app on a whim but decide that Apple\'s apps are superior in both value and function.\n\nWhatever Microsoft chooses to announce at its event later this month will be compared directly to Apple\'s iWork suite by both technology critics and the general public, a fact Microsoft should be wary of.\n\nBefore September 2013 Apple\'s offerings came at the cost of £21 (about US$30, AU$32) for all three available apps, a bar too high for many. Now, however, the apps are free, meaning that anyone can download and compare them to Microsoft\'s offerings and users could well decide that Microsoft has delivered too little too late.', ""Whether Office on iPad is a success or not remains to be seen, but will rely heavily on the way Microsoft chooses to implement the app(s).\nWe can't know the implementation that Microsoft will choose to use for Office on iPad, but we know the options.\nOne option is to use Office 365, Microsoft's subscription service for Office.\nMicrosoft's Surface devices require Office 365 to run the Office suite hinting at the path Microsoft may choose to take for Office on iPad.\nFor £79.99 (US$99.99, AU$119) a year, or £7.99 (US$9.99, AU$12) a month, Microsoft 365 gives you OneDrive (née SkyDrive) storage, international Skype minutes, all of the Office suite and syncing between devices.""]"

Here are four worth looking at.\n\nThe smaller machines that won't leave you stuck in the middle\n\nDell Venue 8 Pro from €300 (32GB)\n\nRating ****\n\nFor those who need their office software, the advantage that Windows tablets have over Android or iPad rivals is that they allow 'normal' PC software to be loaded.\n\nIn other words, you don't have to rely on apps (which is just as well, as the Windows app store is still a little thin). Dell's Venue 8 Pro is significantly cheaper and does much of what Microsoft's machine can do.\n\nIt uses Windows 8.1, which means you can use pretty much any work software you want on it.\n\nIt feels well made and has 32GB of storage on board, which matches what most tablets in the same price range offer. I think that is a reasonably decent work tablet.\n\niPad mini Retina from €400 (16GB)\n\nRating *****\n\nWithout any doubt whatsoever, this is Apple's best iPad – whatever you plan on using it for. Nicely compact and with a great screen, the premium machine gets access to more business-related apps than any of its rivals.\n\nThat's the tablet's real edge here, even if its extra power under the hood and svelte looks don't hurt.\n\nThere's also an impressive array of accessories available, including properly designed cases and keyboards.\n\nFinally – if you need more convincing – because this is a newer iPad it won't become obsolete (and hence unable to update to future iOS versions) for at least three years.\n\nLG GPad €300\n\nRating ****\n\nWhen it comes to the business tablet, Android devices are distinct outsiders – for a few reasons. Superficially, they have neither the reassuring simple brand of Apple's iPad nor the business-centric focus of a Windows device.\n\nThere are also significant concerns over security management relative to other platforms. Nevertheless, I think that it would be a big mistake to overlook LG's superior 8-inch GPad.\n\nIts slim design and high-end screen make it a genuinely worthy adversary for Apple's iPad mini on the hardware side. It also has a really decent battery. Few Android tablets beat this one.\n\nToshiba Encore €300 (32GB)\n\nRating ****\n\nThe 8-inch Encore, which uses Windows 8.1, doesn't have anything of the elegance that a machine like Microsoft's (larger) Surface Pro has.\n\nAesthetically, it strongly resembles an old iPhone 3G blown up about four times in size.\n\nThe screen is functional but feels a bit cheap. The tablet's Intel Atom power is reasonable, not impressive: it's understandably slower than a full-powered personal computer.\n\nHowever, it comes with a lot less bloatware than an average Windows laptop, so this makes it more efficient. Some versions of this tablet come with Microsoft Office already loaded.\n\nSunday Indo Business"", ""But what about smaller tablets in the business world?\nA new wave of mid-size machines, typically with an 8-inch screen, is cropping up for consideration.\nBut what about smaller tablets in the business world?\nA new wave of mid-size machines, typically with an 8-inch screen, is cropping up for consideration.\nThe smaller machines that won't leave you stuck in the middleDell Venue 8 Pro from €300 (32GB)Rating ****For those who need their office software, the advantage that Windows tablets have over Android or iPad rivals is that they allow 'normal' PC software to be loaded.""]"

However, as a tech-guy, I always have my eye on what smartphones and tablets people are using in public. From my observations, iPhones and iPads still reign supreme for tweens. And so, it is not surprising that 12 year old Victoria asked her dad for an iPad Mini.\n\nWhile many kids are whiny brats nowadays, she took a more responsible approach and created a presentation as to why buying it is a good idea. Her father, rather than simply giving in and buying it, instead tweeted Microsoft to give it a chance for rebuttal. Microsoft responded to her presentation in epic fashion.\n\nVictoria\'s presentation included a poster-board with iPad Mini facts. It highlighted that it had access to many apps, including ones for education. I was a kid once, and recall using ""education"" as a guise to get everything from my first computer to a Super Nintendo (Mario Paint is like having an art teacher!). However, I am sure she is sincere as she looks like a good kid.\n\nMicrosoft\'s rebuttal also included a poster-board presentation, highlighting the benefits of the Surface 2. The poster mentions portability, a great camera and educational benefits. Laughably, it also highlights ""great apps"". While there are many good apps available in the Microsoft Store, I wouldn\'t call any of them truly great. Of course, ""great"" is subjective, so I don\'t fault the statement.\n\nWhile Microsoft could have stopped there, it didn\'t. Instead, the company invited her to a local brick and mortar store to try it out. As you can see in the below video, they welcomed her with applause and a Surface donning her nickname, ""Vic"". She seemed overwhelmed by the experience -- a bit nervous and camera shy.\n\nOnce inside the store, the employees showed her the tablet and asked for her favorite color. Her response of ""purple"" was met with (surprise, surprise), confirmation that a keyboard cover came in that color. The happy-faced male employee also explained that the integrated-kickstand negates the need for a cover with one. He also highlighted the fact that rather than use iWork (Numbers, Pages, etc.), she can use Office.\n\nUltimately, she chooses the Surface 2, as well as some accessories. This seems like a major score for Microsoft right? A feel good story? Not so fast -- the devil is in the details. The video shows no money being exchanged, so it is not clear if it was donated to Victoria or if she bought it. BetaNews reached out to a Microsoft representative, who replied by saying ""they have nothing to share beyond the blog"". I then tweeted her dad, but he failed to reply.\n\nWhether she bought it or not, the Surface 2 is a great tablet. However, I am a bit concerned about the app situation. While the tween should be satisfied that Facebook and Twitter are represented, there are many that aren\'t, such as Candy Crush Saga. She may be disappointed when she finds out that she doesn\'t have access to all the apps her iPad-owning friends do.\n\nWhat do you think, did she make a good choice? Tell me in the comments.', 'I have no idea what 12-year old kids are interested in -- I am guessing Justin Bieber and Instagram; lord only knows.\nAnd so, it is not surprising that 12 year old Victoria asked her dad for an iPad Mini.\nHer father, rather than simply giving in and buying it, instead tweeted Microsoft to give it a chance for rebuttal.\nLaughably, it also highlights ""great apps"".\nWhile there are many good apps available in the Microsoft Store, I wouldn\'t call any of them truly great.']"
35994,http://www.gizmag.com/surface-power-cover-review/31332/pictures,technology,"['Thinking about buying a hybrid PC that runs full Windows? Well, then battery life had better be on your radar, or you might end up with a device that conks out after just a few hours. If you own a Microsoft Surface, then that\'s becoming less of an issue. We\'ve been testing a new accessory that can make a big difference in extending its uptimes. Read on, as Gizmag reviews the Surface Power Cover.\n\nMicrosoft says that the Power Cover can extend Surfaces\' battery life by ""up to 70 percent."" It plays nicely with all four Surfaces: the Windows RT-running Surface RT and Surface 2, and the full Windows-running Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2.\n\nIf you\'ve seen Microsoft\'s Type Cover 2 for Surface, then you already have a pretty good idea of what you\'re getting from the Power Cover. This is basically a thicker and heavier version of the Type Cover 2, only with a built-in battery. It also doesn\'t have the Type Cover 2\'s backlit keys. That\'s probably because they use extra power, which would kinda defeat the whole purpose.\n\nThe Power Cover adds some considerable weight and thickness over the Type Cover 2, but we think it\'s worth it\n\nI had been using the Type Cover 2 for a couple of weeks before switching to the Power Cover, and when I picked this sucker up, I really noticed a difference. This is a pretty damn heavy keyboard cover. At 535 g (1.18 lb), it\'s actually 110 percent heavier than the Type Cover 2. It\'s also 90 percent thicker.\n\nThat part doesn\'t bother me though. Lightness isn\'t exactly the Surface Pros\' forte to begin with, so what\'s a little extra heft? When I feel that weight, I just remind myself how much extra juice I\'m getting out of the deal. As far as I\'m concerned, it\'s a small price to pay for all-day battery life.\n\nOn lap, I think that extra weight is actually an advantage. The Type Cover 2 is firmer than the somewhat-flimsy Type Cover 1, but the Power Cover takes it to another level. It\'s a firmer foundation, and much closer to the feeling of using a standard laptop.\n\nThe Power Cover has the same terrific keys found on the Type Cover 2\n\nAnd yes, the Power Cover does make a big difference with battery life. Using the Pro 2 with the Type Cover 2, I can usually make it through a good portion of the day without charging. But if I\'m doing a lot of Photoshopping, I still have to juice it up on breaks or things might get tight. With the Power Cover attached, I don\'t have to pay much attention to battery life at all. Even on days when I spent a few hours in Photoshop, the Pro 2 lasted throughout the workday. For a full-blown PC, that\'s a pretty big deal.\n\nI did a more formal test too, streaming Netflix over Wi-Fi with brightness set at 75 percent. There the Pro 2 saw about a 33 percent increase with the Power Cover attached. On the original Surface Pro, which has much shorter battery life, the Power Cover gave it about a 67 percent boost. I\'m not sure if video tests are the best way to test a full-blown PC\'s battery life, as there are a lot more background processes running than on mobile devices like the iPad. But you get the picture: the Power Cover can give the original Pro respectable uptimes, and it can turn the Pro 2 into an all-day machine – even under pretty heavy use.\n\nWindows registers the Power Cover as a second battery, which drains first\n\nHow does it work? Well, when you look at Windows\' battery life popup, you see Battery #1 (your Surface) and Battery #2 (the Power Cover). The Surface uses the Power Cover\'s juice first. Only when the Power Cover is drained (or detached) does it start using the Surface\'s internal battery.\n\nWhen you\'re charging, the inverse is true. It powers up the Surface first, then after it reaches 80 percent full, it juices up the Power Cover. After the Power Cover reaches 80 percent, it finishes charging the Surface. Then it finishes charging the Cover.\n\nThe Power Cover can turn the Surface Pro 2 into an all-day machine\n\nThe Power Cover ain\'t cheap, at US$200. And when you\'re looking at the Surface Pro 2, which starts at $900 and moves all the way up to $1,800, things are starting to get pretty damn expensive. But if you spend any time doing things like Photoshopping, video-editing, or gaming, then you might find that it\'s worth it. It\'s ""only"" $70 more than the Type Cover 2, and I think it gives you more bang for your buck. Apart from the missing backlit keys, it\'s just as good of a keyboard, with a firmer base, and hours of extra battery life.\n\nAnd if you own the original Surface Pro, the Power Cover can breathe new life into your PC. From my experience, I\'d say its uptimes with the Power Cover should be pretty close to those of the Surface Pro 2 without the Power Cover. If you were trying to avoid upgrading to the second-gen model, then this $200 accessory might be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nThe Power Cover retails for US$200\n\nGizmag highly recommends the Power Cover for any Surface Pro or Pro 2 owner looking to eke out a few extra hours of battery life. If you own the Surface RT or Surface 2, your battery life is probably already good enough without it. The Power Cover is available now from the product page below.\n\nFor more on the latest Surfaces, you can check out Gizmag\'s reviews of the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2.\n\nProduct page: Microsoft\n\nEdited on April 26 to more accurately describe the charging process', ""It plays nicely with all four Surfaces: the Windows RT-running Surface RT and Surface 2, and the full Windows-running Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2.\nThe Power Cover adds some considerable weight and thickness over the Type Cover 2, but we think it's worth itI had been using the Type Cover 2 for a couple of weeks before switching to the Power Cover, and when I picked this sucker up, I really noticed a difference.\nThe Type Cover 2 is firmer than the somewhat-flimsy Type Cover 1, but the Power Cover takes it to another level.\nThe Power Cover has the same terrific keys found on the Type Cover 2And yes, the Power Cover does make a big difference with battery life.\nThe Power Cover can turn the Surface Pro 2 into an all-day machineThe Power Cover ain't cheap, at US$200.""]"

Speaking at the release of the 2013-14 State of the Future annual report, Dennis M. Bushnell, Chief Scientist at NASA’s Langley Research Center, said the human race has to start thinking about emigrating to other worlds. “Essentially, there’s too many of us,” Bushnell told the gathering. “We’ve been far too successful as the human animal.

Terraforming Mars has been studied many times, often with the conclusion that it is theoretically feasible but not currently possible given the resources that are needed and the amount of time and funding that would be required to fulfill those needs.

Both the Moon and Venus would present different challenges in terraforming, and everything beyond Mars is deemed unsuitable or unreachable, given current technology and engineering. The report said our civilization was on the brink of collapse due to mismanagement of resources and a subsequent analysis by a prominent NASA scientist said we have too many people and not enough planet , suggesting that within 120 years, the human species will need at least one more planet and more likely three.Speaking at the release of the 2013-14 State of the Future annual report, Dennis M.

36019,http://www.gurufocus.com/news/252206/microsoft-was-just-trying-to-protect-itself,technology,"['In the latest turn of events, the tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is under the public and media scrutiny for invading the privacy of an employee by looking into his personal mails and chats. In 2012 the company came to know that Alex Kibkalo, one of its ex-employees, had leaked Microsoft software through an anonymous blogger that could give power to hackers and pose as a potential threat to all Microsoft users across the globe. As a measure to control that, the tech giant pulled private information from the blogger’s Hotmail and Windows Live accounts and all this rolled down to the recent arrest of Alex.\n\nActions and their reactions\n\nIn all this, while Microsoft saved the world, it got entangled in a nasty controversy regarding its legal and ethical rights. From the company’s standpoint, it was just trying to protect itself from internal and external threats and under such desperate circumstances it was forced to undertake such desperate measures.\n\nWhile many consider this action to be breach of trust, whatever Microsoft did was very well within its legal rights. The company says that it’s allowed to take such drastic steps as and when it’s required to and all this is supported by the agreements mentioned in its terms of service – under most exceptional circumstances the company can force its way into the user’s account and read and disclose private information, if the situation calls for the same.\n\nIn this particular case, the company’s legal team could gather sufficient evidence that the blogger was attempting to sell the illegally obtained Microsoft software. On the basis of those, the company made its move without seeking a warrant, though it’s could have got one if it wanted it. However, Microsoft’s point is, it didn’t require a warrant since all the information was stored in its own servers on its own premises.\n\nWhy so much drama?\n\nMicrosoft’s actions have stirred some questions regarding how protected is the data that the millions of users have trusted the company with. Emails have become crucial to our existence and are loaded with thousands or even millions of personal confidential information. Automatically huge power lies in the hands of the company. But, with great power comes great responsibility. The question is -is Microsoft being responsible enough? And, is Microsoft considering the user’s personal confidential information to be its own property?\n\nHowever, these are not the only reasons for so much of hue and cry. The matter is much broader and not just about a single company – Microsoft. All the third-party email service providers have huge volumes of data stored in their servers which, its seems now, they can legally track in to and extract valuable information and there’s no stopping them since the legalities regarding hosting providers are such.\n\nThe hosting business is primarily based on trust – trust that the general users have on the service provider regarding keeping their private data confidential and out of reach of others, But Microsoft’s move has damaged the trust factor. Not only Microsoft, even Yahoo (YHOO), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have such powers since the user’s emails are stored on their servers and are directed through their protocols and encrypted by them only.\n\nDamage control by Microsoft\n\nWith so many questions ramping up, Microsoft has realized the sensitiveness of the matter and has announced to outline refreshed internal policies that would provide better mental satisfaction to its users in regard to the confidentiality of their data. Going forward, the company will seek the permission from an outside lawyer who will be former federal judge before it marches into someone’s private space. The company also would release transparency reports about the number of such searches conducted by them and number of user accounts that have been affected. Microsoft’s deputy general counsel John Frank also clearly mentioned that the company will surely take a much more thorough path before it ever looks into a non-employee’s Hotmail account.\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nAll the hosting service providers need to keep in mind that trust once lost is very difficult to earn back. Even a company as huge as Microsoft won’t be able to stand the blows of lost trust. After all, without trust, why would anyone choose Microsoft Hotmail over Gmail or Yahoo Mail? However, I believe the company has understood the crucial nature of the incident and has taken adequate measures to avoid future controversies.\n\nThe current actions on Microsoft’s part were just to protect it and the company had no intentions to barge into anyone else’s privacy. Had the accused been a non-employee, surely the company would have gone for necessary approvals. This time I am certainly going to give Microsoft a pass, however, the company needs to be more careful when dealing with situations like the current one.', 'In 2012 the company came to know that Alex Kibkalo, one of its ex-employees, had leaked Microsoft software through an anonymous blogger that could give power to hackers and pose as a potential threat to all Microsoft users across the globe.\nActions and their reactionsIn all this, while Microsoft saved the world, it got entangled in a nasty controversy regarding its legal and ethical rights.\nFrom the company’s standpoint, it was just trying to protect itself from internal and external threats and under such desperate circumstances it was forced to undertake such desperate measures.\nWhile many consider this action to be breach of trust, whatever Microsoft did was very well within its legal rights.\nThe matter is much broader and not just about a single company – Microsoft.']"

Microsoft admitted in federal court documents that it forced its way into a blogger’s Hotmail account to track down and stop a potentially catastrophic leak of sensitive software. The company says its decision is justified.\n\nFrom the company’s point of view, desperate times call for desperate measures.\n\n“In this case, we took extraordinary actions based on the specific circumstances,” said John Frank, one of the company’s top lawyers, in a blog post Thursday night.\n\nAccording to an FBI complaint, Microsoft in 2012 discovered that an ex-employee had leaked proprietary software to an anonymous blogger. Fearing that could empower hackers, Microsoft’s lawyers approved emergency “content pulls” of the blogger’s accounts to track it down. Company investigators entered the blogger’s Hotmail account, then pored over emails and instant messages on Windows Live. The internal investigation led to the arrest on Wednesday of Alex Kibkalo, a former Microsoft employee based in Lebanon.\n\nAlthough the move could be perceived as a breach of trust, Microsoft says it’s allowed to make such unilateral decisions. It pointed to its terms of service: When you use Microsoft communication products — Outlook, Hotmail, Windows Live — you agree to “this type of review … in the most exceptional circumstances,” Frank wrote.\n\nMicrosoft’s legal team thought there was enough evidence suggesting the blogger would try selling the illegally obtained intellectual property. In such instances, law enforcement agents would typically seek a warrant, but Microsoft said it didn’t need one. The servers storing the information are on its own property.\n\nGinger McCall, a director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said those actions are deeply troubling, because they show “Microsoft clearly believes that the users’ personal data belongs to Microsoft, not the users themselves.”\n\n“This is part of the broader problem with privacy policies,” she said. “There are hidden terms that the users don’t actually know are there. If the terms were out in the open, people would be horrified by them.”\n\nMicrosoft recognizes that it’s a sensitive topic, especially as the nation grapples with revelations about the extent of warrantless surveillance on Americans by their own government — spying that Microsoft and other major tech companies have loudly criticized.\n\nThat’s why Microsoft is instituting a new policy: In the future, it’ll loop in an outside lawyer who’s a former federal judge and seek his or her approval.\n\nIn a move that might be deemed ironic, Microsoft will now add its own internal searches to its biannual transparency reports on government surveillance.\n\nSource: CNN', 'Microsoft is defending its right to break into customers’ accounts and read their emails.\nMicrosoft admitted in federal court documents that it forced its way into a blogger’s Hotmail account to track down and stop a potentially catastrophic leak of sensitive software.\nAccording to an FBI complaint, Microsoft in 2012 discovered that an ex-employee had leaked proprietary software to an anonymous blogger.\nCompany investigators entered the blogger’s Hotmail account, then pored over emails and instant messages on Windows Live.\nAlthough the move could be perceived as a breach of trust, Microsoft says it’s allowed to make such unilateral decisions.']"

36039,http://redmondmag.com/blogs/the-schwartz-report/2014/03/did-microsoft-cross-the-line.aspx,technology,"['Did Microsoft Cross the Line in Searching Hotmail Account for Employee Theft?\n\nA former Microsoft employee was arrested in Seattle earlier this week after the company searched his Hotmail account and found evidence he was allegedly leaking information and code to a blogger who ended up illegally selling pirated software.\n\nAlex Kibkalo, a former Microsoft architect, is accused of stealing trade secrets and leaking Windows 8 code to an unnamed French blogger while working for Microsoft. Kibkalo, a Russian national who also has worked for Microsoft in Lebanon, also allegedly bragged about breaking into the Redmond campus and stealing the Microsoft Activation Server Software Development Kit, a proprietary solution aimed at preventing unauthorized distribution of the company\'s software and licenses, SeatlePI reported Thursday.\n\nThe move forced Microsoft to admit it had scanned a user account on its Hotmail service to obtain evidence. This comes at a time when many customers lack trust that Microsoft and others are taking enough measures to ensure their privacy of information in the services. Revelations of the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance efforts by Edward Snowden and accusations that Microsoft and others were cooperating with the NSA has heightened those fears, despite efforts by the players involved to ensure such cooperation is limited to rare instances where there are court orders.\n\nIn this case, Kibkalo made it quite easy for Microsoft to discover his alleged acts. One must wonder why he or the blogger would use the company\'s e-mail service to communicate. Putting that aside, Microsoft accessed the e-mails without a court order because apparently the company legally didn\'t need a court order to search its own service. But the company did obtain court orders for other aspects of the investigation, said Microsoft Deputy Counsel John Frank, in a blog post published last night.\n\nFrank justified Microsoft\'s decision to access the e-mails in its Hotmail service and it appears Microsoft didn\'t violate any laws or its own policies, though some question the wisdom of its actions. ""We took extraordinary actions based on the specific circumstances,"" Frank said. ""We received information that indicated an employee was providing stolen intellectual property [IP], including code relating to our activation process, to a third party who, in turn, had a history of trafficking for profit in this type of material. In order to protect our customers and the security and integrity of our products, we conducted an investigation over many months with law enforcement agencies in multiple countries. This included the issuance of a court order for the search of a home relating to evidence of the criminal acts involved. The investigation repeatedly identified clear evidence that the third party involved intended to sell Microsoft IP and had done so in the past.""\n\nLikely anticipating customers and privacy advocates might be unnerved by the fact that it dipped into its own servers despite the probable cause of the alleged criminal activity, Frank said Microsoft is stepping up its policies for the way it handles such discovery in the future. ""While our actions were within our policies and applicable law in this previous case, we understand the concerns that people have,"" he said.\n\nMoving forward, he said Microsoft will not search customer e-mail or other services unless there\'s evidence of a crime that would justify a court order. In addition, Microsoft will turn to a former judge who will now determine if the probable cause would justify a court order and even in those instances, the searches would be limited to searching for the information centered around the suspected activity, not other data, and that it would be supervised by counsel.\n\nTo ensure transparency, Microsoft will publish whatever searches it has conducted as part of its biannual transparency reports, he said. ""The privacy of our customers is incredibly important to us,"" he said.

Amid constant news stories that the U.S. government has access to a seemingly unlimited amount of our private data, we\'re now learning that at least one company we trust our privacy too also think it\'s OK to read private emails – so long as it feels it has to.\n\nMicrosoft has been in the headlines recently because of a unique situation, but one still very much worth noting, in which a blogger was receiving tips from a, now former, employee on the company\'s operations. The blogger happened to be using a Hotmail address, so Microsoft figured it would just tap in and figure out who the leaks were coming from.\n\n""We believe that Outlook and Hotmail email are and should be private,"" Microsoft\'s deputy general counsel and vice president of legal and corporate affairs John Frank said.

We received information that indicated an employee was providing stolen intellectual property, including code relating to our activation process, to a third party who, in turn, had a history of trafficking for profit in this type of material.""\n\nFrank argues that Microsoft made the move to protect customers and its own IP and that it worked with ""law enforcement agencies in multiple countries"" because the third party person intended to sell Microsoft\'s trade secrets. Microsoft took part of the investigation into its own hands to dig into the ""third party\'s Microsoft operated accounts."" It says its actions were ""within [its] policies and applicable law,"" but that\'s a gray area – at least to us.\n\nJournalists by right do not have to reveal sources.

In the aforementioned lawsuit, for example, TechnoBuffalo prevailed and we did not have to reveal our sources on a specific leak we published.\n\nThe blogger hasn\'t been identified, but Microsoft does still have a right to protect its IP. There\'s just a very fine line here – of course bloggers and journalists make money off of producing news. That is how it currently, and always has, worked. If a Microsoft employee was spilling secrets, as employees at a lot of firms are apt to do, then that\'s on Microsoft to control.

He also allegedly bragged about breaking into Microsoft\'s campus and stealing the company\'s ""Activation Server Software Development Kit,"" a proprietary system aimed at preventing unauthorized distribution of the company\'s software and licenses.\n\nNews of the arrest prompted Microsoft to admit it had scanned a user\'s Hotmail account to obtain evidence against Kibkalo. This comes at a time of growing consumer doubts about whether Microsoft and other service providers are taking enough measures to ensure the privacy of their information. Revelations made by whistle-blower Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency\'s surveillance efforts and accusations that Microsoft and others cooperated with the NSA have heightened those doubts, despite assurances from service providers that such cooperation was limited to rare instances where there were court orders.\n\nIn Kibkalo\'s case, Microsoft accessed the e-mails without a court order, but only because the company apparently did not legally need a court order to search its own service. However, Microsoft did obtain court orders for other aspects of the investigation, said Microsoft Deputy Counsel John Frank in a blog post published Thursday night.\n\n""We took extraordinary actions based on the specific circumstances,"" Frank said. ""We received information that indicated an employee was providing stolen intellectual property, including code relating to our activation process, to a third party who, in turn, had a history of trafficking for profit in this type of material. In order to protect our customers and the security and integrity of our products, we conducted an investigation over many months with law enforcement agencies in multiple countries. This included the issuance of a court order for the search of a home relating to evidence of the criminal acts involved. The investigation repeatedly identified clear evidence that the third party involved intended to sell Microsoft IP and had done so in the past.""\n\nWhile it appears Microsoft didn\'t violate any laws or its own policies, some are questioning the wisdom of its actions. Frank said Microsoft is stepping up its policies for the way it handles such discovery in the future, likely in anticipation of concerns from customers and privacy advocates about the fact that Microsoft dipped into its own servers despite the probable cause of the alleged criminal activity.\n\n""While our actions were within our policies and applicable law in this previous case, we understand the concerns that people have,"" he said.\n\nMoving forward, he said Microsoft will not search customer e-mails or other services unless there is evidence of a crime that would justify a court order. In addition, Microsoft will turn to a former judge who will determine if the probable cause would justify a court order. If a court order is found to be justified, Microsoft\'s searches will be supervised by counsel and will be limited to searching for information centered around the suspected activity, not other data.\n\nTo ensure transparency, Microsoft will publish whatever searches it has conducted as part of its biannual transparency reports, Frank said.\n\n""The privacy of our customers is incredibly important to us,"" he said.

Microsoft has spent today in damage-control mode, changing its internal policies and rushing to point out that they could have gotten a warrant if they’d needed one. By all indications, the fallout is just beginning.\n\nOur data is held on their servers, routed by their protocols\n\nBut while Microsoft is certainly having a bad week, the problem is much bigger than any single company. For the vast majority of people, our email system is based on third-party access, whether it\'s Microsoft, Google, Apple or whoever else you decide to trust. Our data is held on their servers, routed by their protocols, and they hold the keys to any encryption that protects it. The deal works because they\'re providing important services, paying our server bills, and for the most part, we trust them. But this week\'s Microsoft news has chipped away at that trust, and for many, it\'s made us realize just how frightening the system is without it.\n\nThey own the servers, and there\'s no legal or technical safeguard to keep them from looking at what\'s inside\n\nWe\'ve known for a while that email providers could look into your inbox, but the assumption was that they wouldn\'t. Even a giant like Microsoft is likely to sustain lasting damage, simply because there are so many options for free web-based email. Why stick with Microsoft if you trust Apple or Google more? But while companies have created a real marketplace for privacy and trust, you\'ll find the same structural problems at every major service. Ad-supported email means companies have to scan your inbox for data, so they need access to every corner of your inbox. (That\'s been the basis of Microsoft\'s Google-bashing ""Scroogled"" campaign.) Free email also means someone else is hosting it; they own the servers, and there\'s no legal or technical safeguard to keep them from looking at what\'s inside.\n\n""We may access or disclose information ... to protect the rights or property of Microsoft.""\n\nA close look at company privacy policies only underlines the fact. As Microsoft pointed out its initial statement, ""Microsoft’s terms of service make clear our permission for this type of review."" Look at the company privacy policy, and you’ll see that\'s true: ""We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to ... protect the rights or property of Microsoft."" That’s a straightforward description of what happened in the Hotmail case.\n\nYou’ll find similar language in the privacy policies from Yahoo and Google. Yahoo reserves the right to look through your emails to ""protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Yahoo, its users and the public."" Google’s language is nearly identical, saying it will access user data ""if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to … protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google."" Apple is a little better, but not much, promising to disclose user content ""if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate."" What counts as public importance, exactly?\n\nWhat’s worse, the current laws won’t do anything to stop them. For standard law enforcement, it takes a warrant to read a person\'s email — but there\'s no such restriction on hosting providers. Peeking into your clients\' inbox is bad form, but it\'s perfectly legal. Even if the rights weren\'t reserved in the terms of service, it\'s not clear there are even grounds for a lawsuit. Without stronger privacy laws, all companies have to worry about is bad PR.\n\nPeeking into your clients\' inbox is bad form, but it\'s perfectly legal\n\nMicrosoft\'s mole hunt isn\'t unprecedented either. There have been LOVEINT-style abuses of sysadmin access, as when a Google engineer was fired for spying on friends\' chat logs. Last year, Harvard searched its own professors\' email accounts as part of a cheating investigation. (The dean behind the search stepped down a few months later.) But those are just the instances we\'re aware of. In all likelihood, there are dozens of similar incidents that were simply never made public, encouraged by the open nature of third-party hosting. As long as the access is legal and technically feasible, there\'s no reason to think it will stop.\n\nAs long as the access is legal, there\'s no reason to think it will stop\n\nAnyone living a modern and complicated life over email is left in an awkward place. The crypto crowd has an easy answer: use end-to-end encryption, locking up emails with GnuPG and online chats with programs like Cryptocat. You can hold your own keys, making sure no one can decrypt the message but the person you\'re sending it to, and count on open-source code reviews to expose anyone who tries to slip a backdoor into the code.\n\nIt\'s a good system and it works, but for most users, it\'s still a bunch of extra inconvenience for no obvious benefit. In the end, it\'s easier to blame Microsoft for violating our trust and move onto the next company, with the same data practices and the same terms of service. With Google, Apple, Yahoo, and countless other free webmail services waiting in the wings, there are plenty of options to choose from. They\'d never do a thing like this... right?', 'For the vast majority of people, our email system is based on third-party access, whether it\'s Microsoft, Google, Apple or whoever else you decide to trust.\nEven a giant like Microsoft is likely to sustain lasting damage, simply because there are so many options for free web-based email.\nWhy stick with Microsoft if you trust Apple or Google more?\nBut while companies have created a real marketplace for privacy and trust, you\'ll find the same structural problems at every major service.\nAs Microsoft pointed out its initial statement, ""Microsoft’s terms of service make clear our permission for this type of review.""']"

The company doesn\'t think so, but promised some changes in how it will handle these questions in the future.\n\nEarlier this week, a former Microsoft employee was arrested for stealing and sending trade secrets to someone outside the company. It appears the recipient, an unidentified blogger based in France, had contacted another individual to verify the authenticity of one of the leaked items, according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Western Washington. The individual alerted Microsoft to a possible theft, which prompted the company to launch an internal investigation and search the blogger\'s Hotmail account to identify the original leaker.\n\n""In this case, we took extraordinary actions based on the specific circumstances,"" John Frank, a Microsoft deputy general counsel and vice-president of legal and corporate affairs, said in a statement posted on Microsoft TechNet.\n\nWas This Legal?\n\nThe fact that Microsoft read emails in a user\'s Hotmail account without notifying the user or obtaining a court order raised questions over what the company is allowed to do with user data. Frank defended the search because Hotmail terms of service allowed the company access under ""exceptional circumstances."" The actual terms of service states the user agrees Microsoft may access, disclose or preserve users\' personal information and content when the company thinks that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, to prevent loss of life or serious physical injury to anyone, or to protect the rights or property of Microsoft or its customers.\n\n""We apply a rigorous process before reviewing such content. In this case, there was a thorough review by a legal team separate from the investigating team and strong evidence of a criminal act that met a standard comparable to that required to obtain a legal order to search other sites,"" Frank said. There wasn\'t a legal process that covered investigations relating to ""information stored on servers located on our own premises.""\n\n""Courts do not, however, issue orders authorizing someone to search themselves, since obviously no such order is needed,"" Frank said.\n\n""In this case, it does appear that Microsoft\'s terms of service permit the company to have taken the action that it did,"" said Nate Cardozo, an attorney with digital civil-liberties organization Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Seattle-Times, before adding, ""from our perspective, it was clearly not the right thing for Microsoft to have done this."" Cardozo felt Microsoft still should have gotten a warrant first.\n\nAdopting New Policies\n\nEven though Microsoft acted legally, the company has decided to change some of its policies to cover future situations. ""We will not conduct a search of customer email and other services unless the circumstances would justify a court order, if one were available,"" Frank said.\n\nAt the moment, a legal team separate from the actual investigating team assesses evidence to determine if there\'s enough for a court order. From now on, an outside attorney who\'s also a former federal judge will make that assessment. The search will proceed only if that attorney agrees there\'s sufficient evidence for a court order.\n\nMicrosoft will also publish the number of times it conducted these types of searches and number of accounts affected in its bi-annual transparency reports.\n\nThinking Ahead\n\nThis situation isn\'t unique to just Microsoft or Hotmail. When we agree to hand over our communications to another provider, whether we are talking about Google, Twitter, Facebook, Yahoo, or Microsoft, we have to accept there will be some level of snooping involved. The question is just how much you are comfortable with this. There are a number of secure messaging and anonymous email providers promising to make your communications ephmeral. Is that the direction people want to go? It\'s a question we are all grappling with in this day of surveillance, and there are no easy answers.\n\nvia Flickr user Wayne Wilkinson', 'Does Microsoft need a court order in order to peer into a user\'s Hotmail account?\nThe fact that Microsoft read emails in a user\'s Hotmail account without notifying the user or obtaining a court order raised questions over what the company is allowed to do with user data.\n""We will not conduct a search of customer email and other services unless the circumstances would justify a court order, if one were available,"" Frank said.\nAt the moment, a legal team separate from the actual investigating team assesses evidence to determine if there\'s enough for a court order.\nThe search will proceed only if that attorney agrees there\'s sufficient evidence for a court order.']"

According to the criminal complaint filed by US prosecutors, Russian national Alex Kibkalo admitted to the software maker's investigators that he provided confidential information to the blogger, which include a program that protects against copyright infringement. The lawsuit was filed against Kibkalo following his arrest yesterday. Kibkalo's actions would most likely fall under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, of which the Cornell University Law School defined as the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret with the intention that the offense could benefit a foreign entity. He will not be able to post bail, according to federal court filings in Seattle.\n\nThe discovery of the theft was revealed by an unnamed person, who told Microsoft in 2012 that he had been contacted by the blogger to help the latter review the code for the Microsoft Activation Server Software Development Kit, Bloomberg said. According to the complaint, the Kit is a product that was developed by Microsoft for in-house use only. Prosecutors were quoted as saying that the probe into the trade secret leak led to Kibkalo, who had been working for Microsoft for seven years as a software architect in Lebanon.\n\nWhen Bloomberg contacted Russell Leonard, a federal public defender who was assigned on Kibkalo's case, the lawyer had not responded immediately to the news agency's phone message yesterday after business hours.\n\nWashington-based advocacy organization The Center for Responsible Enterprise & Trade had released a study on the economic effects of the trade-secret thefts. The study of the interest group, which is led by former Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Pamela Passman, identified that one of the potential misappropriators of trade secrets are malicious insiders, or personnel who are employed or connected with an entity or its affiliate. Other misappropriators identified in the study are nation states, competitors, transnational organized crime and activist hackers."", ""An ex-employee of Microsoft Corp has been arrested and filed charges of stealing the firm's trade secrets to a blogger in France, Bloomberg said.\nThe lawsuit was filed against Kibkalo following his arrest yesterday.\nAccording to the complaint, the Kit is a product that was developed by Microsoft for in-house use only.\nWashington-based advocacy organization The Center for Responsible Enterprise & Trade had released a study on the economic effects of the trade-secret thefts.\nOther misappropriators identified in the study are nation states, competitors, transnational organized crime and activist hackers.""]"

Each and every community values different things with common denominator among all of them being the preciousness of the adornment, whether it’s objective or subjective.\n\nfashion jewerly sets, dating anniversary necklace, wedding anniversary necklace or of course, when asking for someone’s hand – engagement ring. Let’s take for example different rituals of coming of age such as the Bat and Bar Mitzvah, the Rumspringa, the Bullet Ant Initiation, the Quinceanera, Sweet 16, and others. Stepping into womanhood and manhood is celebrated all over the planet, with each culture and place doing it in their inherent way. The milepost of adolescent girls turning into women and adolescent boys becoming men is of profound personal and collective importance. Such practices vary according to the country and culture in which the boys and girls are raised. Not as a rule, but in very many instances, folks will put on their best gear, which might include uniquely significant jewelry, such as stone necklace design.\n\nLet’s Talk About Jewellery & Jewelry From Jerusalem\n\nOur spoken language is as multivocal in regards to jewelry as the diversity of notions we hold on them, the materials they are made of and their prices. The names that are used appear to comunicate mixed feelings regarding how we see our habit of self-adornment: on the one hand we use such words as bauble, trinket, knicknack; they sway towards certain flippancy and commonness. On the other hand however, in all times, jewellery have been displayed on the rich and powerful to exhibit fortune and status.\n\nThe Connection Between Jewells, Israel and Jerusalem Jewelry\n\nJewellery are spoken of in the Old Testament as well as in the Bible on many occasions where folks receive gifts of jewells for their deeds from Almighty or people. The subject of stories and fairytales, glorious age-old Silk Road had run a very long way starting in China leading East with its tail curving in the Mediterranean. The grand trading route passed mainly in Asia, including Tibet, North India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Myanmar. The sea path travelled through Red Sea and kept climbing up towards the North. Beside silk, spices, and perfume, jewelry comprised an important part of the commerce along this route. The Silk Road had invariably changed the areas it went through, and nowadays Israel has an outstanding variety of unique Christian jewellery as well as jewellery stores in the Old City Jerusalem. Judaica designers are well-appreciated all around the world with branches stretching widely: Los-Angeles, London, Venice, online, and more.Those shops are perfect for those who are looking to buy items of Israeli jewelry artists. One of the most notable Jerusalem stores is Moriah Jewelry. Their works can be found also in shops in Los-Angeles as well as Judaica web store.\n\nPersonal Side of Jewellery\n\nPieces of jewellery can at times be as personal as underclothing. As an enhancing component of our attire, they are centrally objects of emotional value. But other articles of clothing behave that wayalso. We might all agree with the truth that our feelings are essential to our reactions. This is the reason we will wear specific wardrobe items when embarking on an important date, and this outfit will be probably nothing like what we wear when we go to movies.Jewellery are so much more to a person than just aimlessly dangling and shining bibelot.

And we took initial steps in that direction with the introduction of media forward timelines and in-line social actions in October, and we\'re already starting to see early signs that those initiatives are working well.""\n\nAnd Schiller, also asked to clarify, specifically commented that Twitter is not planning to phase out hashtags and @replies. Rather, ""there\'s a lot of creative thinking going on around how to make Twitter more and more intuitive. Watch this space,"" she tweeted.\n\nSo what might Twitter be up to, then? It\'s possible that the company could be looking to wrap replies and hashtags directly into the interface of a given Tweet itself, similar to how it pulled the more archaic ""RT"" text out of users\' updates and into their own little ""retweeted by"" descriptors above said retweets on the service.\n\nHowever, Buzzfeed has gotten its hands on some screenshots that indicate Twitter is in fact eliminating @replies within the alpha test group for its Android app. These @replies are automatically deleted when a user includes them in a comment; the user\'s comment is instead threaded into a conversation, graphically \x96 which seems to work well for one-on-one conversations. We\'re not quite sure how eliminating the @reply will make larger conversations among groups of users (whose @replies can change, depending on who you\'re trying to talk to at any given point) less confusing.\n\nOf course, Twitter could also just do threaded conversations message board-style, we suppose. Nevertheless, confusion continues: Twitter might not be removing @replies, claim representatives, but it sure seems to be doing so. Or, at least, testing out the possibility.', 'Is Twitter possibly thinking of new ways to go about organizing Tweets by topic and/or presenting replies in a useful, easy-to-read fashion?\nTo most, that description read like this: Twitter is getting rid of hashtags and @replies.\nAnd Schiller, also asked to clarify, specifically commented that Twitter is not planning to phase out hashtags and @replies.\nOf course, Twitter could also just do threaded conversations message board-style, we suppose.\nNevertheless, confusion continues: Twitter might not be removing @replies, claim representatives, but it sure seems to be doing so.']"

Sure, Twitter helps people stay connected, like every other social media product, but it also has the added bonus of helping to spread news quicker than just about any other service. The utility of Twitter, as a tech product, is fantastic, and assures they will have at least a decent amount of longevity.\n\nThe “who uses it?” is a little more troubling. If Twitter’s user base was a single person, that person would be young (good), a citizen of a developed country (okay), and technically literate (bad.) That last point is troublesome because to truly grow, Twitter has to be adopted by a wide swath of the world’s population, and not just the most tech-savvy slice of it.\n\nTo a person who’s used Twitter for a long time, the idea that it can seem daunting or confusing seems preposterous. But make no mistake, the people running Twitter have recognized this to be exactly the case, admitting after their disappointing earnings report that they need to simplify the platform.\n\nAnd that means cutting out the jargon. Again, to people already on Twitter, @ replies and hashtags are an essential part of the language. But to the uninitiated, they can be confusing and off-putting. So Twitter’s thinking about phasing them out. And if they want to grow it’s the best thing to do.\n\nTo be sure, the functionality of @ replies and hashtags will remain in place, but they will no longer be included in the tweets themselves. What will come out is a cleaner Twitter: one without the quirks its devotees love, but also without the quirks people who don’t use Twitter yet might not understand.\n\nBecause for a tech company, the answer of “who uses it?” shouldn’t be “those in the know” it should be “everybody.”\n\nDISCLOSURE: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors, and do not represent the views of equities.com.

36108,http://investorplace.com/2014/03/9-things-broken-twitter/,technology,"['Yesterday we told you Twitter (TWTR) is trying to make itself easier to use.\n\nToday we’re identifying all the things that are broken on Twitter. If fixed, they’d make the service so much easier to navigate.\n\nRight now, Twitter’s core appeal is to people obsessed with the media, sports celebrities and tech. Conversely, your mom is probably not on Twitter.\n\nThat’s a problem because up to 1 billion people — moms included — have tried Twitter and largely abandoned it, leaving the service struggling to find new users. In the last quarter, Twitter added only 1 million users in the U.S. (Facebook, for comparison, added double that number even though it is much older than Twitter and largely matured as an American network years ago.)\n\nCEO Dick Costolo believes part of the problem may be the way software code symbols like “@” and “#” are frequently used on Twitter. It may be hard to believe if you work in Silicon Valley or Manhattan, but millions of normal people just don’t know — or care — what a “hashtag” is.\n\nHere’s what’s broken.\n\n1. #ThisStuffIsOftenMeaningless\n\nFunctions like @, #, RT, MT and #FF are meaningless to most people. Twitter needs to be conducted in plain English if it is to grow beyond its 241 million users. Other social media like Facebook and Tumblr use hot links or highlights if you reply or mention others on those sites — but the words themselves are largely unadorned by code symbols.\n\n2. Twitter punishes you for replying\n\nThe beauty of Twitter — you’re constrained to 140 character per message — sometimes becomes ugly if you’re trying to reply to more than one person at once. Twitter handles count as part of those 140 letters, severely limiting your ability to reply to them coherently. Note that on Instagram, no one is constrained to short messages, but users generally only publish short messages because the system is designed in such a way to encourage them.\n\n3. Twitter is useless for group messaging.\n\nOne of the reasons messaging apps like WhatsApp are so popular is that it’s impossible to have a group message conversation on Twitter because usernames take up all the conversation space. Twitter has largely ceded this function to other messaging apps.\n\n4. The direct message function is genuinely confusing.\n\nAnthony Weiner screwed up the difference between an @reply and a direct message, and now New York has a different mayor. You can use a “d:” function to send a direct message to another user that won’t be seen by others but … so many people have screwed this up that “Twitter DM fail” is its own meme. Every single social and messaging app on the planet has made direct messaging super simple and super safe. Twitter should follow suit.\n\n5. You begin with zero friends.\n\nA Business Insider reader noted recently that “Everyone who signs up begins with exactly 0 followers, which makes every new user a LOSER.” It’s true — open a new Twitter account and none of your friends are there. The desktop version does not ask to pull friends from your email contact lists. You have to go searching for them yourself. This is work.\n\n6. Even if you have some friends, you quickly learn you are not popular.\n\nTwitter becomes a lot more fun if you start to attract a sizeable following. Anyone can become “Twitter famous,” but that takes a lot of work and originality. Generally, people do not want social media to become a chore. They want it to be easy. So there are two classes of Twitter users: Famous people like celebrities or journalists whose jobs generate a stream of new content, and everyone else. “Everyone else” is not where you want to be. Facebook, by contrast, lets anyone be “popular” because the vast majority of people already have a couple hundred friends, family members and coworkers they can add to their network.\n\n7. You can’t see your entire follower list at once.\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to see a lit of all the people you’re following — or all your followers — you’re out of luck. You can click to get the list, but it comes up as an endless scroll, and one mistake click sends you right back to the beginning. It’s difficult to sort them, too.\n\n8. It takes too many clicks to navigate around Twitter.\n\nTwitter often requires users to click or tap twice or more to get to the thing they’re actually interested in. This occurs most frequently when you click on someone’s name on Twitter, and instead of getting a list of their tweets you get a truncated summary of their account. You have to click again on their tweet stream to see what they’re saying. This is a user-interface tic with Twitter, the New York Times noted that to see a video users often have to click three times before arriving at the content they want.\n\n9. Fix search.\n\nTwitter search is great for finding out what is happening on Twitter right now. It’s terrible if you want to find old tweets, your own old tweets, or to search the tweet archive of a single individual. Search remains the universal way in which navigation on the web and on mobile is conducted, so getting this wrong is a strategic issue.\n\nSee Also:', 'Today we’re identifying all the things that are broken on Twitter.\nTwitter punishes you for replyingThe beauty of Twitter — you’re constrained to 140 character per message — sometimes becomes ugly if you’re trying to reply to more than one person at once.\nEvery single social and messaging app on the planet has made direct messaging super simple and super safe.\nSo there are two classes of Twitter users: Famous people like celebrities or journalists whose jobs generate a stream of new content, and everyone else.\nTwitter search is great for finding out what is happening on Twitter right now.']"

It’s all still very vague at the moment, but an Android test group has already seen tweets with the at-reply taken out.\n\nNothing has been confirmed as yet, but it certainly looks as though Twitter could be paving the way for some important new updates.Another week, another social media craze has swept our newsfeeds, but this time (thankfully) it’s not videos of oiks downing pints of vodka and toilet water. No make-up selfies have been flooding Facebook with people taking their slap off to raise awareness for breast cancer. Amazingly, Cancer Research has seen a surge in donations since the trend took off, with over 800,000 people putting their hands in their pockets to raise £1 million in just 24 hours. They have said that there were an “unprecedented” number of text donations throughout the day yesterday, and that looks set to continue today.There has been a lot of conversation about the craze, with a lot of people getting on their high horse about the fact that just posting a selfie doesn’t actually do any good, you need to be donating the money as well. Whilst I agree that it’s a bit shoddy if you’re posting a selfie to try and raise awareness for anything, and then don’t donate to charity to support the cause, it’s clear that the whole selfie phenomenon has actually helped to raise money. My favourite thing about it though is the people that try to claim that they’ve posted a no make-up selfie, but they’re covered in the orange stuff. I’ve even seen one where the subject was wearing false eyelashes. You’re not fooling anyone, hen.It happens so regularly now that it should probably make the news when Katie Hopkins doesn’t piss everyone off on Twitter. She’s done it again this time though, by making “outrageous” comments about Channel 5’s ‘Big ‘Can’t Pay’ Debt Debate’ show, which aired on Monday.To summarise, she essentially managed to make everybody furious by saying that she supported payday lenders, labelling them a “decent business model”. That, combined with the fact that she shouted down anyone who tried to disagree with her, meant that she was serious Twitter fodder.In more selfie news, a US news station has been forced to apologise after it showed a penis selfie live on air duing a broadcast about a helicopter crash.The show on Fox 31 Denver was showing Twitter images of the crash in Seattle, Washington, when they decided to scroll through one users pictures, which included one of Edward Scissorhands, and the offending penis image. The camera quickly cut away from the offending image, and back to the shocked faces of the news team.

The one you started following because they seemed attractive but they’re actually really dull\n\nYou saw their avatar somewhere, thought ‘well, hello there!’, followed them, tried to subtly hit on them by favouriting as many of their tweets as possible, but eventually gave up because there was nothing to favourite. You would unfollow them but in your head there is still a chance that they will DM you one day and, well, they still occasionally post selfies you can lovingly stare at. You big creep.\n\n2.

You thought they’d be funny, but boy is it painful to watch them try so hard.

Few other social media networks use @ as a way of indicating who you\'re talking to.\n\nBut at Twitter, @ is at the core of a crucial debate within the company about how to get Twitter\'s user-base growing again. Some people - including CEO Dick Costolo - think the shorthand codes used on Twitter may be deterring new users from joining the site. Unless you already know what they mean, terms like @, #, RT, MT and #FF are meaningless.\n\nThey look like computer code, and if there\'s one thing that ordinary users hate, it\'s code. Ordinary users are Twitter\'s future: the millions of people Twitter needs to join and stick with the company in order to get meaningful growth in the years to come.\n\nBut in terms of attracting those ordinary people, Twitter is currently dead in the water: The service added only 1 million users in the U.S. last quarter, bringing its American audience to 54 million. Twitter had 241 million users worldwide in Q4 2013, adding only 9 million in total from the prior period.\n\nWorse, up to 1 billion people have tried Twitter and then stopped using it, according to a company that tracks Twitter statistics.\n\nOn Twitter\'s last earnings call, the company\'s stock tanked despite good financial results when it became clear that ""timeline views"" - a key measure of user engagement - had actually declined.\n\nCostolo was hammered by analysts on that call wanting to know whether the company had a grip on its flagging user stats. Costolo told them he was running several experiments on Twitter to make the service simpler and easier for new users to get on board.\n\nHe explained that Twitter was aware that new users had difficulty figuring out the best ways to use Twitter, and the company was working on making it easier so that they ""get it"" instantly: ""It\'s not just \'get it\' in the first weeks or months on Twitter, it\'s \'get it\' on the first day on Twitter ... so that\'s a focus.""\n\nNow we\'re seeing some of those experiments in the wild. In addition to the removal of @ for some users, Twitter\'s head of news recently suggested that @ and # may be anachronisms that need to be axed in favor of a simpler, Facebook-style way of replying or mentioning other users.\n\nIn fact, @ and # may come to be regarded as huge failures at Twitter, rather than part of its charming idiosyncratic language, according to BuzzFeed:\n\nUnlike Facebook, which asks for obvious information and then uses it to make obvious connections, Twitter demands significant time and energy from the user up front. It doesn\'t fully succeed in telling you how to use the service; it fails, utterly, to tell why you should. Those willing to stick around long enough are rewarded with a peculiar sense of something that could best be described as belonging.\n\nCostolo told CNBC he believed the codes were ""confusing"":\n\n""That language and scaffolding can be confusing and opaque,"" Costolo said. To solve the problem of so-called Twitter quitters who log in once and never come back, he said, it needs to be ""clear and simple.""\n\nWhether @ lives or dies may seem trivial. But @ may in fact turn out to be key to saving Twitter. If 1 billion try and then abandon Twitter because they can\'t be bothered learning the difference between ""@"" and "".@"" - note the period! - then Costolo would have to admit that Twitter is broken as long as it remains dependent on code symbols.', 'Some Twitter users are noticing that the ""@"" symbol has been removed from their replies in what appears to be an experiment on the network to make Twitter easier for new users.\nSome people - including CEO Dick Costolo - think the shorthand codes used on Twitter may be deterring new users from joining the site.\nThey look like computer code, and if there\'s one thing that ordinary users hate, it\'s code.\nTwitter had 241 million users worldwide in Q4 2013, adding only 9 million in total from the prior period.\nWorse, up to 1 billion people have tried Twitter and then stopped using it, according to a company that tracks Twitter statistics.']"

36132,http://www.buzzfeed.com/charliewarzel/is-twitter-phasing-out-hashtags-and-at-replies,technology,"['At least that\'s the impression Vivian Schiller, head of news at Twitter, gave addressing the crowd two days ago at the Newspaper Association of America\'s mediaXchange conference in Denver. During her talk, Schiller called at-replies and hashtags ""arcane"" and hinted that Twitter might soon move them into the background of the service.\n\nWhat will Twitter look like in a year? Two years? A lot less like itself.\n\nUnlike Schiller\'s, Costolo\'s statement makes no specific mention of hashtags and at-replies, suggesting that Schiller may have accidentally hinted at specific targets for upgrade. While it\'s not immediately clear how this disappearance would work, it\'s possible that at-replies will be auto-replaced by formal Twitter names, like they are on Facebook.\n\nIt wouldn\'t be the first time Twitter phased out one of its vestigial appendages. Twitter\'s all but killed the original incarnation of the retweet or, as Twitter obsessives have now come to know it, the ""manual retweet."" In its earlier days, the retweet was a user-generated feature; users had to physically add the ""RT"" shorthand to a tweet to share it with their followers. It was primitive and confusing to the uninitiated.\n\nIn 2009, Twitter formalized the feature by baking the retweet function into the platform. This is what its looks like now:\n\nFormalized retweets were less cumbersome, allowed information to spread quicker and with better attribution, and, perhaps most importantly, removed a thin layer of weird jargon for new users to get used to.\n\nWhich brings us back to Schiller\'s hint.\n\nTwitter, at its core, is a strange service; its foundational feature is an arbitrary 140-character limit. This was surely vital to Twitter\'s success, but it\'s also the source of all its ""cryptic and opaque"" language — a rough collection of shorthands and initialisms (RT, MT, #FF) and hacks, born out of user quirks and necessary behaviors. Ask a longtime user to tell you about their first experience with Twitter and they\'ll probably lead with some variation of, ""Somebody showed me how to use it..."" The idea being that, unlike most social networks, you don\'t usually just discover and use Twitter, you are taught, or at least climb a fairly steep learning curve.\n\nUnlike Facebook, which asks for obvious information and then uses it to make obvious connections, Twitter demands significant time and energy from the user up front. It doesn\'t fully succeed in telling you how to use the service; it fails, utterly, to tell why you should. Those willing to stick around long enough are rewarded with a peculiar sense of something that could best be described as belonging.\n\nBut that hard-earned belonging is less important now to post-IPO Twitter. The service has a very real growth problem. Users sign up, but they don\'t stick around. There\'s more than one reason for this, but the problem, at least in Costolo\'s mind, lies somewhere inside the ""scaffolding."" (Costolo used the exact same language in a CNBC interview the day of Twitter\'s IPO.)\n\nTwitter\'s very public evolution from a text-based update service to a multimedia stream has been well-documented, and distinctly directional: Each change inches it toward becoming more accessible and less strange. If at-replies and hashtags recede into the background, Twitter will likely become faster, better optimized for tweets to move quickly and gather interactions. It will also look a lot more like its competitors.\n\nWhen Twitter announced it would be formally incorporating retweets in 2009, Biz Stone cited the user-generated feature as ""a great example of Twitter teaching us what it wants to be."" But that was a very different Twitter. Back then, the scaffolding was out in the open, inviting users to climb and play and fiddle and destroy — to make it their own. Today, though, Twitter is a company with a good idea of what it is, and an even better idea of what it wants to be.\n\nAnd don\'t discount the possibility that Twitter is still refining its metaphor. Real scaffolding doesn\'t ""move into the background."" It\'s temporary. It disappears — it is removed — to reveal the completed structure.\n\nUpdated — March 19, 1:51 p.m. ET: Schiller notes that Twitter is not getting rid of at-replies and retweets altogether. When BuzzFeed asked if there was any chance that at-replies and hashtags could become more formalized/pushed into background like retweets, Schiller remained vague:', 'During her talk, Schiller called at-replies and hashtags ""arcane"" and hinted that Twitter might soon move them into the background of the service.\nUnlike Schiller\'s, Costolo\'s statement makes no specific mention of hashtags and at-replies, suggesting that Schiller may have accidentally hinted at specific targets for upgrade.\nIf at-replies and hashtags recede into the background, Twitter will likely become faster, better optimized for tweets to move quickly and gather interactions.\nET: Schiller notes that Twitter is not getting rid of at-replies and retweets altogether.\nWhen BuzzFeed asked if there was any chance that at-replies and hashtags could become more formalized/pushed into background like retweets, Schiller remained vague:']"
36133,http://wallstreetpr.com/twitter-inc-nysetwtr-monetize-or-perish-17640,technology,"['Boston, MA 03/19/2014 (wallstreetpr) – After its listing on November 7, 2013, the Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) stock price has mostly soared and reached a peaked at $73.31 on December 26. It reported a loss of $511 million in its 4Q2013 results. As Twitter CEO, Dick Costolo, makes his first China trip — where it has been banned since 2009 — investors are in a bit of a quandary as to whether Twitter will be able to keep growing its user base or not. In recent months, Twitter’s user growth seems to have stalled.\n\nHowever, Twitter is particularly suited for mobile devices and with smartphones out-selling desktop PCs and tablets six-to-one, there’s still scope for growth for Twitter. Apart from user growth, Twitter has to show that it can effectively monetize its hundreds of millions of users. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) is already doing a tight-rope walk in terms of how much advertising to show in users’ timelines. Twitter too, will be grappling with similar challenges. User engagement is another issue and the conventional wisdom is that Facebook gets more user engagement than Twitter.\n\nTwitter As Global Public Square\n\nBut that conventional wisdom may not be universally valid. Facebook users tend to interact in closed groups whereas Twitter is like a global public square. After all, Ellen DeGeneres tweeted her Oscar selfie. When a news breaks and people are curious to get the latest updates about it, Twitter is the perfect medium. Everyone is sharing and speculating about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 on Twitter. When sports or other cultural events are in progress, people take to Twitter to post their comments with the appropriate hashtags. No wonder Facebook has borrowed ideas from Twitter including verified accounts and hashtags.\n\nMaking of a Twitter Addict\n\nTwitter is the perfect social media for people who want to explore personalities and ideas cutting across borders. All the celebrities are present on Twitter pushing their latest movies and albums and so on. Most political leaders of the world are on Twitter sharing their platforms and ideas with their followers. All sports stars are present on Twitter as well. Writers like Salman Rushdie, science writers like Phil Plait, new Cosmos host and science communicator non pareil, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, are on Twitter too. It takes time for new users to understand Twitter and find people and Twitter handles that will interest them. But once Twitter users discover their favorite Twitter handles, Twitter grows almost into an addiction. The Twitter family is only expanding and that expansion is nowhere near saturated.\n\nTwitter is still innovating by adding new features such as those looping six-second Vine videos. Expect more of these innovations. While Twitter has its share of naysayers and short sellers, Twitter is still in a growing phase and it will keep growing for sure.', 'However, Twitter is particularly suited for mobile devices and with smartphones out-selling desktop PCs and tablets six-to-one, there’s still scope for growth for Twitter.\nApart from user growth, Twitter has to show that it can effectively monetize its hundreds of millions of users.\nMost political leaders of the world are on Twitter sharing their platforms and ideas with their followers.\nIt takes time for new users to understand Twitter and find people and Twitter handles that will interest them.\nBut once Twitter users discover their favorite Twitter handles, Twitter grows almost into an addiction.']"

His wordsmay have proven true for Apple\'s iTunes, but not with other music-streaming services.\n\nAccording to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), though iTunes\' rates declined, profit of music-streaming services like Spotify and Pandora One progressed.

According to Billboard Magazine, Apple is ready to launch a service that would rival Spotify and provide a subscription to the iTunes library. From Mashable:\n\nThe company took its first major step into streaming last year with the launch of iTunes Radio, a service similar to Pandora that allows users to listen to, and curate radio stations based on genres and types of artists. They also have the option to buy any song being played. By moving toward a model similar to Spotify, as the report suggested, Apple could effectively offer music fans more tunes at a lower price. An anonymous source from one major label told Billboard, “They are feeling out some people at labels on thoughts about transitioning its customers from iTunes proper to a streaming service … So when you buy a song for $1.29, and you put it in your library, iTunes might send an email pointing out that for a total of, say, $8 a month you can access that song plus all the music in the iTunes store.

Pandora is fun on the go and Google music allows access to your library via a cloud service.\n\nI wouldn’t be shocked if Apple allowed you to access iTunes the same way and with the introduction of an Android version of iTunes, it could very well be a tech war on all fronts with Apple on the offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, my uncle is still awaiting the return of 8-track tapes to the mainstream.

Now, according to a report by Billboard, which previously broke a lot of correct details about iTunes Radio before its release, Apple is taking the next step towards a Spotify-type version of iTunes Radio.\n\nApple\'s iTunes Radio is a lot like Pandora in its current form. You can build stations off of a track, artist, or genre selection, tell iTunes Radio to ""play more like this"" or ""never play this song"" and customize how strict or loose your stations are in exploring music styles beyond your selection.\n\nBut you can\'t play specific tracks on demand, as you can with Spotify.\n\nBut that may eventually change, if Billboard\'s report on Apple\'s moves within the music industry is correct (again). Billboard says Apple is pondering an on-demand streaming option that would let people listen to entire tracks without buying them.\n\nThe report describes talks going on between Apple and record labels on the prospects of allowing a paid on demand streaming service. And while Apple founder Steve Jobs always thought fans would never subscribe for a music service, preferring to keep the iTunes purchasing system instead, iTunes Radio already has an indirect form of a subscription service in iTunes Match, which for about $25 per year, people can remove the ads that intermittently play on iTunes Radio along with the service\'s main feature, cloud-based music.\n\nBut even with iTunes Match, you have to buy tracks at full price in the iTunes Store if you want access to them at any time. This, once a strength of Apple\'s music service, is increasingly becoming a liability. Digital album sales in the U.S., according to Nielsen, were recently down 13 percent and individual digital track sales are down 11 percent from last year. Meanwhile, streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and YouTube have grown by almost 40 percent in the last two years, according to Billboard, and as much as 51 percent worldwide.\n\nThose are compelling reasons for Apple to look into an on demand streaming service, along with a big competitor in Amazon rumored to introduce a Spotify-like music service of its own this year -- but don\'t get your hopes up too high. Negotiations for various digital music distribution rights packages with different labels, and for different countries, can be daunting and slow.\n\n""This is an incredibly complex task, just to figure out what we needed to do,"" said one executive involved in the process to Billboard. ""When you start going into smaller countries and trying to get it fixed, you can find 14 versions of a single in, say, Belgium, and many of the versions might be the wrong one for that market."" The fact that Apple is such a huge and influential player in the digital music market, making up more than 40 percent of music industry profits on records in the U.S., will make negotiations even more painstaking, because any changes Apple makes will have a significant impact on all of the record labels.\n\nPerhaps even more exciting (for the segment of iTunes fans who happen to own an Android smartphone, at least), Billboard also says that Apple is considering making an iTunes app for Android phones. Again, this was something that was never considered as an option by former Apple leader Steve Jobs.\n\nAccording to the Verge, Jobs was quoted in Walter Isaacson\'s official biography saying that he didn\'t ""see an advantage of putting [Apple\'s] own music app on Android, except to make users happy,"" adding that ""I don\'t want to make Android users happy."" But CEO Tim Cook has spoken on record about the possibility of porting Apple software to Android with a much more forgiving tone, saying in 2013 that Apple would ""have no religious issue with doing that. If we thought it made sense for us to do that, we would do that.""', ""Apple launched iTunes Radio, a streaming service integrated into iOS 7 and the latest versions of iTunes, last year.\nNow, according to a report by Billboard, which previously broke a lot of correct details about iTunes Radio before its release, Apple is taking the next step towards a Spotify-type version of iTunes Radio.\nApple's iTunes Radio is a lot like Pandora in its current form.\nThe report describes talks going on between Apple and record labels on the prospects of allowing a paid on demand streaming service.\nNegotiations for various digital music distribution rights packages with different labels, and for different countries, can be daunting and slow.""]"

If you happened to be keeping tabs on mobile news yesterday, you were likely to find a surprising gem of a rumor fall into our laps: iTunes for Android, with an added possibility of iTunes offering a streaming music service. While there are plenty of music applications already on the market for Android, iTunes is probably one of the oldest music services out there - one of which we never thought would actually be ported for use on Android.\n\nAlthough just a rumor at this point, it’s an interesting one. Many people have been using the iTunes media player for more than a decade on their computers, using the service to store and purchase music in a way unlike any other. Before iTunes, if you wanted a song you either bought the entire album or jumped through hoops to pirate the music illegally. When iTunes came along, though, previewing and purchasing individual songs from an album was not only a possibility, but easy to do. For just $0.99 a song, you could create your own playlist without the unwated fluff. The program ended up being wildly successful, especially once the iPod was brought into the picture.\n\nApple has been holding onto iTunes as an Apple exclusive in the smartphone era, and for a while it seemed that they could do that without any repercussions. After all, the iPhone was as popular as ever at the start, and for a long time other platforms weren’t seen as a threat. People who used iTunes and the iPod were inclined to get the iPhone as well for easy iTunes syncing. But as Android started picking up the pace and a variety of successful third-party music applications hit the market, iTunes was starting to look irrelevant as it was left unchanged. The big thing these days? Streaming music applications.\n\nThe thing about iTunes was that it was easier for its time. Paying $0.99 for individual songs worked out for a lot of people who didn’t want to pay $10.99-$15.99 for a full album if they just wanted one or two songs. However, if you have a whole bunch of individual songs that you want to buy, it wouldn’t take long to start racking up a playlist of 500 or more songs, and that’s a lot of money. So what’s the solution? Streaming music players, which gives you the option of creating your own playlists for a premium subscription each month, or stream for free with commercials in between. With streaming music playlists, there are virtually no limits. It’s something that the massive iTunes library could offer and probably be successful with.\n\niTunes would have its own benefits that would set it apart from other streaming music applications as well, given that iTunes also offers a variety of e-books, magazines and videos that people can purchase. If iTunes were to tier its subscription services to include these alternatives as well, with the addition of being offered on Android, Apple could find itself the new favorite among streaming services (most of which solely offer music).\n\nIt would also be interesting in the sense that Apple is typically not known for sharing its services with Google. You see Google services all over the iPhone, but you hardly ever see the reverse. Android doesn’t offer Apple Maps, iMessage, iCloud or iTunes; however, iPhone users do have the option of using Google Maps, Hangouts, Drive and Google Play Music. Although I don’t expect that Apple would start handing over all of its services to Google, it would be a start, and likely a good one at that.\n\nIt’s just a rumor right now, of course, but it’s an interesting one for sure. It might be nice to start seeing some Apple services pop up on the Play Store for a change.\n\nReaders, what are your thoughts on iTunes for Android? If it turned out iTunes offered streaming music, would you try them out?

We put iTunes on Windows in order to sell more iPods. But I don’t see an advantage of putting our own music app on Android, except to make Android users happy. And I don’t want to make Android users happy.”\n\nYet, circumstances may have forced the iPhone maker, Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL) to consider taking a decision, it has long avoided.\n\nDownloads Slide\n\nThis year, U.S. digital album sales at Apple’s iTunes Music Store, are down 13 percent for the week ended March 9, and digital track sales are down 11 percent from last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan. iTunes store being the largest music retailer have already identified a trend where users are more likely to live stream their choice of music rather than download them.\n\nEven as download sales have gone down, revenue from streaming services are on the up, according to a report released on March 18 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), showing that streaming services such as Spotify(SPTF), Pandora(NYSE:P) and YouTube generated $1.4 billion in subscription, advertising and licensing revenues in the U.S. last year, up 39 percent from 2012, while downloads revenue were down 3.2 percent to $2.9 billion.\n\nRear Guard action\n\nTo deal with this problem, Apple is set to explore a multi-pronged strategy to check the double-digit drops in iTunes downloads\n\nThe first of them would be to launch an on-demand streaming service that would rival Spotify and Beats Music. The streaming industry which has grown by 51% last year, clearly show a paradigm shift in the music industry, with users choosing streaming services’ all-you-can-listen model over downloading.\n\nApple is considering a range of strategies to boost up the iTunes Store. iTunes executive Robert Kondrk, has suggested creating exclusive album-release windows in which digital versions of the albums would go on sale even before the CD release.\n\nHowever, the most exciting of them all are the news of Apple thinking about adding an iTunes App for Android phones, from Google which has been growing faster than the iPhone.\n\nDeparting thoughts\n\nWe can sit and criticize this move citing reasons like iPhone might lose its exclusivity and the possibility of users switching over to cheaper android phones. However, if we think rationally, even if iTunes is made available to Android, it won’t be done for free. Even the On-Demand subscription, like iTunes radio would be a good source of earning revenue.\n\nIf Apple remains rigid about the superiority of their platform and their phone – they’ll be ignoring a huge segment of people. It’s very similar to the iTunes to Windows switch. Just like putting iTunes on Windows meant more sales of iPods, putting an iTunes Radio On-Demand App on Android will mean more subscriptions.

According to a new report from Billboard, Apple is looking for ways to drive more revenue as sales of media slump. The Cupertino company is also looking to create a music service to rival the likes of Pandora and Spotify, according to the same report.\n\n\n\nApple is also reportedly considering spinning iTunes radio away from iTunes, and into its own app. That service would likely be the Spotify-esque service we’re hearing about, which quite honestly needs a bit of work. The winning strategy for streaming seems to be access to a library in its entirety, not fed via radio station. All Access from the Play Store accomplishes that nicely.\n\nApple could also be offering incentives to music labels for early release of albums on iTunes. The strategy is believed to be for iTunes to get a record a week ahead of CD launches, with sales of singles not available via iTunes until the CD hits stores. That, again, seems a band-aid solution.\n\nThe iTunes library is the gold standard, and one we’d welcome on Android — unless it was in the form of radio. If we’re getting an iTunes radio station, it’s not nearly as appealing a subscription model as an all-access offering. While there are no difinitive plans for iTunes on Android, it’s said to be an attractive model for executives at various labels. More exposure means more revenue — for both Apple and music labels.\n\nThe Play Store is available on iOS devices, with the lone caveat being that you can’t purchase music on the Apple devices. You have to go a website or use an Android device to buy a track or album, but that’s a small concession. It also doesn’t matter much for All Access subscribers, which is the play we’d like to see Apple make on Android.\n\n', 'Apple may be looking to bring iTunes to Android.\nApple is also reportedly considering spinning iTunes radio away from iTunes, and into its own app.\nIf we’re getting an iTunes radio station, it’s not nearly as appealing a subscription model as an all-access offering.\nWhile there are no difinitive plans for iTunes on Android, it’s said to be an attractive model for executives at various labels.\nIt also doesn’t matter much for All Access subscribers, which is the play we’d like to see Apple make on Android.']"

Apple is also thinking about adding an iTunes App for Android phones, the Google rival that has been growing faster than the iPhone, these sources said. The surprising discussions are part of a multi-pronged strategy to deal with the double-digit decline in U.S. download sales at Apple’s iTunes Music Store, the largest music retailer.\n\nApple is considering a range of efforts to support the iTunes Store. iTunes executives like Robert Kondrk, for example, have suggested creating exclusive album-release windows in which digital versions of the albums would go on sale ahead of the CD release. Individual tracks would not be available for sale until the CD versions hit shelves.\n\nBut it\'s the talks around on-demand subscription and the iTunes App for Android that will most intrigue label heads and the wider market. Apple founder Steve Jobs was widely known to have argued that fans would never subscribe for music. Moreover, up until now, iTunes has been committed to keeping the iTunes ecosystem closed off.\n\nBut now, nearly three years after Job\'s death, iTunes has to consider the option because so far this year, U.S. digital album sales are down 13 percent for the week ended March 9, and digital track sales are down 11 percent from last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nApple Presses Labels For More \'Beyonce\'-Type Exclusives In Wake of Downloads\' Slide\n\nEven as download sales have deteriorated, revenue from streaming services have grown, according to two reports released on March 18. The first, from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), showed that streaming services such as Spotify, Pandora and YouTube generated $1.4 billion in subscription, advertising and licensing revenues in the U.S. last year, up 39 percent from 2012, while downloads revenue were down 3.2 percent to $2.9 billion. The second report, from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), painted a similar picture, albeit on a global scale. Streaming music revenue grew 51 percent worldwide, while downloads slipped 2.1 percent.\n\nThese figures provide fresh ammunition to those in the music industry who believe streaming services’ all-you-can-listen model has drawn consumers away from download sales, where Apple dominates. But industry executives also believe that the growth of Android is also impacting iTunes sales. While the Google Play App store offers iTunes apps, they are all from third-party developers. Meanwhile, the iTunes App stores has official Google apps for Google Play Music, Google Books, and Google Play Movies & TV.\n\nWith iTunes accounting for more than 40% of U.S. recorded music revenue any decision it makes about its business model will have a significant impact on the labels\' business models.\n\n""They are feeling out some people at labels on thoughts about transitioning its customers from iTunes proper to a streaming service,"" says one major label source. ""So when you buy a song for $1.29, and you put it in your library, iTunes might send an e-mail pointing out that for a total of, say, $8 a month you can access that song plus all the music in the iTunes store. It\'s all in the \'what if\' stage.""\n\nAn iTunes spokesman declined to comment on the discussions, which are still at a very early stage, according to sources.\n\nApple already has a streaming service with iTunes Radio, which launched last September. But the free ad-supported service, similar to Pandora, has limited control over the songs they can hear.\n\nAccording to several reports. Apple is looking at the possibility of spinning out the service from the iTunes suite as a standalone app. While initially excited by the iTunes Radio, label executives say the service needs more work. Indeed, it appears that the launch of the Apple service ""had a measurable (albeit relatively small) impact on Pandora, after a short period of time that impact appeared to decline,"" according to court documents from the Pandora/ASCAP rate court hearing. ""Pandora has continued to grow despite the presence of iTunes Radio.""\n\nMeanwhile, iTunes began an initiative to make its store easier to shop and is trying to promote catalog titles more, in hopes of stimulating download sales.\n\nLast November, sources say iTunes executives reached out to the major labels and asked each of them to clean up the catalogs of their top 100 selling artists. They don\'t want multiple versions of the album showing up; nor do they want to have a dozen greatest hits/best of albums for each artist.\n\n""This is an incredibly complex task, just to figure out what we needed to do,"" said one executive involved in the process. ""When you start going into smaller countries and trying to get it fixed, you can find 14 versions of a single in, say, Belgium, and many of the versions might be the wrong one for that market.""\n\nIf a legacy artist, for example, has a dozen greatest hits albums in the iTunes store, some because different versions of albums have been issued in different markets, iTunes expects the major to have maybe two greatest hits albums for each market, one at regular price and one at deluxe pricing, and then perhaps allow for one more theme compilation.\n\nIn return, iTunes is paying attention to public domain and gray product offerings to make sure such sales don\'t detract from the legitimate copyright owners in each market. This is an issue near and dear to the heart of the majors because often, something that might be public domain in Europe could wind-up appearing in the U.S. stores where the copyright is still in effect, and thus could cannibalize sales from the legitimate copyright holder.\n\nAdditional reporting \xad Alex Pham', 'Apple is also thinking about adding an iTunes App for Android phones, the Google rival that has been growing faster than the iPhone, these sources said.\nThe surprising discussions are part of a multi-pronged strategy to deal with the double-digit decline in U.S. download sales at Apple’s iTunes Music Store, the largest music retailer.\nApple is considering a range of efforts to support the iTunes Store.\nStreaming music revenue grew 51 percent worldwide, while downloads slipped 2.1 percent.\nMeanwhile, the iTunes App stores has official Google apps for Google Play Music, Google Books, and Google Play Movies & TV.']"

Following a pretty legit looking leak earlier on in the week, Ubisoft decided to come clean and announce their work on Assassin’s Creed: Unity, which is said to be released later on this year on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. They also threw up a quick trailer of the game in an early alpha state, which reveals that Unity will be set against the backdrop of 18-century Paris during the French Revolution.\n\nDoesn’t it seem like the next Assassin’s Creed title always gets leaked this time of year? Not that I’m complaining! It’s unclear right now if Unity will technically be considered “Assassin’s Creed V,” especially since Ubisoft’s official confirmation does not include any roman numerals. But then again, there was also the leaked mention of something called Assassin’s Creed: Comet, which Ubisoft has yet to comment on. Judging on the spot-on Unity information in the initial leak, my guess would be that Comet is going to be some kind of companion game for PS3 and Xbox 360 owners, or at the very least, a spin-off game for PS Vita in the same vein as Assassin’s Creed: Liberation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut either way, as long as these new games are more in line with Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and nothing like Assassin’s Creed III, then I’m well on board with the sequels!\n\nNew Far Cry 4 details emerge\n\nI don’t know what’s going on at Ubisoft lately, but the studio seems to be having a tough time keeping a tight lid on all of their upcoming projects. Not only did they have to make a rushed announcement of Assassin’s Creed: Unity due to a leak, but just a few days later the internet also got a hold of some tantalizing details about Far Cry 4. According to the reports, the upcoming FPS sequel will allegedly take place in the snowy mountain range of the Himalayas, where mounting and riding elephants is said to become a central gameplay mechanic. We’ll almost certainly get to see our first glimpse of the game at this year’s Ubisoft E3 presentation in June, but expect an early 2015 release on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.\n\nTitanfall delayed on Xbox 360, sequel could be multiplatform\n\nThere’s no denying what a colossal hit that Titanfall has been for Microsoft this month, even only one week and change after its Xbox One and PC release. Xbox 360 owners, however, learned that they’ll have to wait an extra two weeks now to experience all of the high-octane multiplayer mech fighting, as the past-gen version of the game has been delayed until early April in order to polish off a few rough edges.\n\nBut the really interesting Titanfall news this week is actually centered on the game’s prospective sequel: namely, it has been confirmed that Electronic Arts will take publishing duties on Titanfall 2 over Microsoft, which strongly implies that the inevitable sequel will no longer remain a Microsoft exclusive.\n\nIt would even seem like this was EA’s plan all along for the franchise, as the publisher has often been known to bring their games to as many lucrative platforms as possible. And if you needed any more convincing as to that point, EA CFO Blake Jorgensen was even quoted on his certainty of a multi-platform Titanfall 2 last year.\n\nBut will this news not bode well for Microsoft, whose exclusivity deal for the original Titanfall managed to sell a whole boatload of Xbox One consoles recently?\n\nEpic confirms work on brand new IP\n\nEpic Games has been working on something: that much is sure. But after it was announced earlier this year that the game studio had sold their Gears of War rights to Microsoft, speculation grew as to what exactly Epic was moving to next. Well this week we got the unexpected confirmation from a Game Developers Conference panel that Epic is currently plugging away at a brand new IP. We don’t know anything else about the new title, other than a pretty blurry picture of some early character concept art, but it’s still nice to know that we’re going to be seeing some fresh and most certainly explosive new ideas coming from the Epic camp in the near future.\n\nGauntlet is getting a reboot this summer\n\nAnd last but not least this week, Warner Bros. and Arrowhead Game Studio have officially announced that a GAUNTLET REBOOT IS COMING THIS SUMMER! I could hardly believe it, but then the developer unleashed a brand spanking new announcement trailer showing off the game’s redesigned visuals, and boy is this one going to be something. The original Gauntlet and its handful of sequels were some of the greatest co-op dungeon crawlers in the early days of gaming, and this upcoming reboot looks to pay respect to the gameplay and mechanics of the original, while adding its own sense of flavor into the mix.\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for all news updates related to the world of geek.

By diversifying your investment portfolio into multiple asset classes you can reduce the overall risk level of your investments because they are spread out across multiple sectors.\n\nThere are generally four broad classes of assets, but some financial experts claim there are only three or as many as five. This has become especially complicated because of the rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and many people have begun to debate whether or not it is its own asset class or not.\n\nHere we will go over what is considered to be five of the major asset classes.\n\nCommodities\n\nA commodity is something with exchange value like precious metals, oil and gasoline, industrial metals, as well as food like wheat and rice. Their value is determined by supply and demand, so sometimes it can be a little tricky to find out whether or not they are worth investing in unless you are a professional.\n\nIf you buy and sell Bitcoin in Canada then you might already know that it is considered a commodity for tax purposes there. While buying Bitcoin is not taxable, selling, trading, or using it to buy something else is a taxable event. When earning a profit from buying and selling Bitcoin, you will need to pay capital gains, but you can also generate short or long term capital losses if money is lost instead.\n\nStocks or Equities\n\nStocks or equities represent interest in an entity and they are represented by the value left over after subtracting all of an entity’s debts associated with that asset. By purchasing equity interest in the form of stock shares in stock exchanges or over-the-counter markets, an investor can share in a company’s profits.\n\nFixed Income or Bonds\n\nAn entity can also sell bonds or fixed investments which guarantee a return on the principal amount paid as well as interest over the course of the loan. While bonds tend to not offer high returns and can run the risk of losing you money, they are generally considered to be less risky than investing in stocks or other asset classes because of the guaranteed returns.\n\nCash or Cash Equivalents\n\nCash or cash equivalents refer to the value of a company’s assets that are cash or can be easily converted into cash. Examples of cash equivalents include short-term government bonds or treasury bills.\n\nThese kinds of asset classes are valued because of their liquidity, meaning that the price will remain mostly consistent regardless of whether they are purchased or sold.\n\nReal Estate or Other Physical Assets\n\nReal estate is often considered a great investment because its value usually consistently rises. Real estate and other physical assets are considered a secure asset class because their value is tied to the cost of materials as inflation rises over time.\n\nWhere to invest your money often depends on what kind of returns you are looking for. If you want high rewards, you may have to take high risks. If you’re looking for something safer, then consider diversifying your portfolio among multiple asset classes – it might just save you from the next big tanking event in the market.', 'By diversifying your investment portfolio into multiple asset classes you can reduce the overall risk level of your investments because they are spread out across multiple sectors.\nHere we will go over what is considered to be five of the major asset classes.\nWhile bonds tend to not offer high returns and can run the risk of losing you money, they are generally considered to be less risky than investing in stocks or other asset classes because of the guaranteed returns.\nThese kinds of asset classes are valued because of their liquidity, meaning that the price will remain mostly consistent regardless of whether they are purchased or sold.\nIf you’re looking for something safer, then consider diversifying your portfolio among multiple asset classes – it might just save you from the next big tanking event in the market.']"

The new title will follow the exploits of Arno as he fights against the Templars in the streets of Paris during the late 1700s. The French Revolution is one of the most turbulent periods in European history. With a heavy hitting combination of violence and chaos, the French Revolution seems like the perfect setting for an Assassin\'s Creed game and Ubisoft has delivered. While Assassin\'s Creed: Unity is slated for an end of the year release, the company has finally confirmed the existence of the game last March 21.\n\nUbisoft has been working on its new title for the last three years. Gamers were first given a small glimpse of the game when Assassin\'s Creed: Unity images were leaked last March 12. The company also released a teaser trailer containing Alpha game footage of the upcoming title. The short teaser showed gamers a taste of the game\'s latest parkour system. The game will be released for the PC, the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 during the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n""Qu\'ils mangent de la brioche [Let them eat cake]!

The trailer also shows gamers the first video footage of the new protagonist Arno as he stands on top of an old Parisian building to watch the infamous guillotine in action.\n\nWith Ubisoft\'s habit of releasing multiple Assassin\'s Creed games in a single year, it is possible that another title from the video game franchise will also hit the stores this year. The first Assassin\'s Creed game was released back in 2007. Since then, Ubisoft has released a total of 15 Assassin\'s Creed titles on multiple platforms including Sony and Microsoft consoles, the PC and the Mac and a number of portable titles.

36183,http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/assassins-creed-unity-confirmed-set-french-revolution/,technology,"[""Just the other day, a series of leaked images seemed to confirm a long-standing rumor that set the next Assassin’s Creed game in Paris (at least partially) during the French Revolution. That is no longer just a rumor; Ubisoft has confirmed that the next game in the AC series, titled Assassin’s Creed: Unity, will take us back to 18th century France later this year, on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.\n\nThe confirmation comes via the trailer below, which offers no sense of characters, gameplay revisions, or how the current day setting that frames the games factors in. The earlier leak also claimed that there will actually be two AC games this year, released for different console generations. We know that Unity will be on the newer hardware and PC, while a rumored separate game, known by the reported codename “Assassin’s Creed: Comet,” could be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (and presumably PC). Oddly, no word on a Wii U port.\n\nThe French Revolution was a bloody and tumultuous period in French history, dominated in our imagination by the ever-looming presence of the guillotine. During the one-year period known as the “Reign of Terror” that took place from 1793-1794, as many as 40,000 people lost their lives in France, many of them under the guillotine’s blade. It was a brutal and horrific era, and it’s a perfect fit for the philosophical themes the Assassin’s Creed series wraps itself in as freedom and order mixed with bloody results.\n\nThe time period also allows Ubisoft to potentially continue the story of the Kenway family, which began in Assassin’s Creed III with Connor Kenway assassinating his way through the American Revolution. That story then continued in Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag that focused on Connor’s grandfather Edward Kenway, who sailed the Caribbean as a pirate. There is no confirmation that the series will continue to focus on that bloodline, but the timeframe would fit, and the Kenway family could easily still be active. If not a direct familial relationship with the new lead assassin, don’t be surprised to see cameos from characters in the Kenway lineage and possibly other assassins – as well as Templars – with familiar surnames.\n\nSo far the trailer is the only confirmation Ubisoft has offered. With the release date of Holiday 2014, expect to hear more very soon.\n\nEditors' Recommendations"", 'Just the other day, a series of leaked images seemed to confirm a long-standing rumor that set the next Assassin’s Creed game in Paris (at least partially) during the French Revolution.\nThe French Revolution was a bloody and tumultuous period in French history, dominated in our imagination by the ever-looming presence of the guillotine.\nIt was a brutal and horrific era, and it’s a perfect fit for the philosophical themes the Assassin’s Creed series wraps itself in as freedom and order mixed with bloody results.\nThe time period also allows Ubisoft to potentially continue the story of the Kenway family, which began in Assassin’s Creed III with Connor Kenway assassinating his way through the American Revolution.\nThat story then continued in Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag that focused on Connor’s grandfather Edward Kenway, who sailed the Caribbean as a pirate.']"

This week at GDC, the virtual took another giant leap towards reality as the Japanese company pledged its support to gaming\'s next big development.\n\nProject Morpheus is the name that Sony\'s headset currently going by (we expect it\'ll just be the \'Sony Morpheus\' come release time) and it\'s looking pretty damn special - and slightly less \'homemade\' than Oculus.\n\nShuhei Yoshida said that it\'s still far from the finished product, but we took it for a test run anyway and the fact our initial impressions drew so many comparisons with Oculus Rift was a good sign. Especially as Sony\'s headset will be localised to the PS4, while the Rift caters for PC gamers.\n\nIt\'s been a three-year endeavour for Sony so far and unfortunately we\'re yet to hear anything about a release date or price. But that\'s no bad thing; if VR is going to take off this time, it\'s going to take a little patience from everyone.\n\nWhile we had some concerns that Oculus might come out of GDC on the back foot, we couldn\'t have been more wrong. Palmer Luckey and his team announced that Crystal Cove was now available for developers to order, coming in the form of Development Kit 2.\n\nIt looks a bit tidier than the Cove we saw at CES in January, but features sub-millimeter accurate positional tracking and a low-persistence, high-def display. In sum: it\'s by far the best Oculus experience yet. And it ships this July for $350.\n\nProject Morpheus and Oculus Rift 2: Gaming Spotlight puts the headsets in the ring.\n\nThe revolution will be playable\n\nThere was a big, nasty leak at Ubisoft HQ this week as one tipster outed a whole bunch of details and promotional images for the next Assassin\'s Creed installment.\n\nBut rather than trying to cover it up, Ubi instead released the first teaser for Assassin\'s Creed Unity, which seemingly confirmed at least some of the leak.\n\nIn a press statement, Ubisoft said: ""We have been working on the new Assassin\'s Creed for more than three years and although we weren\'t quite ready to show you our full vision for a next-gen only AC it seems Abstergo are trying to force our hand!""\n\nThe game will be set against the French Revolution and will hit Xbox One, PS4 and PC. The leak also claimed that Unity will be joined by a separate PS3 and Xbox 360 AC game too, but Ubisoft is yet to say anything on the matter.\n\nLooking to E3\n\nNow that GDC is done for another year, we\'re starting to look ahead to E3. So is Microsoft, and Studios VP Phil Spencer has promised that this year will be massively focused on the games.\n\n""We are already over our 90 minute time limit and having to move stuff out of show,"" he said on Twitter. Interestingly, he also said, ""I think you\'ll see very few execs.""\n\nAs for other E3 rumours, we\'re hearing that Ubisoft will show off the first look at Far Cry 4, which will be set in the Himalayas and have - get ready for it - ridable elephants.

38349,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/htc/10721025/New-HTC-One-M8-supercharges-camera.html,technology,"['The new HTC One features an all-metal design and an improved camera that the Taiwanese manufacturer hopes will allow it to recapture its glory days of 2010, when its Desire handset helped it capture almost a quarter of the American market.\n\nThe launch comes ahead of the April 11 release of the Samsung Galaxy S5, whose predecessor was largely responsible for the fall in HTC’s popularity. Despite winning more awards than any other Android device, the HTC One struggled to make a major impact on sales figures, competing in an increasingly saturated market dominated by Samsung and Apple.\n\nThe new HTC One includes a 5” screen, an improved processor and updated software that the company claims allows the device to second-guess what function a user will want next, for instance answering a call if a ringing phone is put to a user’s ear. Improvements to the camera allow the refocusing of pictures after they have been taken and improved speakers will encourage the use of the phone for media playback.\n\nA crowded market, however, will make the HTC One’s success challenging, as manufacturers such as Apple seek to present their phones as gateway devices for a growing range of accessories and apps. While Samsung and Sony already have smartwatches and fitness trackers, HTC has yet to release its own products in a burgeoning category.\n\nThe company hopes loyal customers and a focus on excellent camera image quality will prevent it sliding further away from the mainstream. It will bolster its ambitions with improved marketing that emphasise key features such as battery life, enhanced through a new power-saving mode, and general ease of use.\n\nSony’s rival Xperia Z2 features a camera with better specifications on paper, while Nokia also emphasises its devices’ image quality.\n\nHTC’s chief executive Peter Chou has recently adopted a more hands-on product role in a bid to turn the company around, but a growing number of staff have departed amid speculation the company could be bought by a rival. He claimed at the launch that the new device meant “the best just got better”.\n\n“As pioneers in mobile innovation, we continue to design and build devices that will dazzle, inspire and transform the smartphone industry,” he said. “Today I’m proud to launch the most stunning, intuitive and advanced handset that the industry has seen to date, the new HTC One (M8).”\n\nThe HTC One will be available on more than 230 operators around the world. On the UK’s EE network it will cost £29.99 up front on a two-year £37.99 per month contract.\n\n<noframes>Datatable: HTC One M8 vs Samsung Galaxy S5</noframes>\n\nCompare the best HTC One M8 deals with The Telegraph Mobile Comparison.', 'The new HTC One features an all-metal design and an improved camera that the Taiwanese manufacturer hopes will allow it to recapture its glory days of 2010, when its Desire handset helped it capture almost a quarter of the American market.\nWhile Samsung and Sony already have smartwatches and fitness trackers, HTC has yet to release its own products in a burgeoning category.\nThe company hopes loyal customers and a focus on excellent camera image quality will prevent it sliding further away from the mainstream.\nSony’s rival Xperia Z2 features a camera with better specifications on paper, while Nokia also emphasises its devices’ image quality.\n<noframes>Datatable: HTC One M8 vs Samsung Galaxy S5</noframes>Compare the best HTC One M8 deals with The Telegraph Mobile Comparison.']"
38350,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/htc/10720965/New-HTC-One-comeback-phone.html,technology,"['The original HTC One was, according to many critics and owners alike, the best Android phone on the market. Its metal design felt more premium than Samsung’s; its ‘Sense’ software added useful features; its camera was superb and its ‘BoomSound’ speakers were top of the line. It won more awards than any other handset, and yet it failed to sell in the numbers that were required to bring HTC back to the peak it saw when 2010’s Desire handset was, once again, the best on the market.\n\nSo what can HTC do with the new HTC One, clumsily dubbed the M8 to distinguish it from the original, 2013 M7? The answer is to make everything better. It may not be enough.\n\nHTC has taken its brushed aluminium design and made it a slightly shinier gunmetal grey, wrapping the material around the body to form a tiny border around the edge of the front. It means that however you hold this phone, you’re holding that premium material rather than plastic. It’s not a look everyone will necessarily love, even over the premium plastic perfected by Nokia, but it is certainly an impressive and conscious achievement. The 5” screen is superb, and doesn’t feel too big in the hand.\n\nTurn the phone on and HTC’s Sense has been updated so that now it is less invasive, but still distinctive from the stock Android software that is available to anybody. The BlinkFeed news app adds a new layout and offers more sources of news to give users the information they need before they know they need it. It’s excellent and surprisingly intuitive thanks to the ability to subscribe to ‘News bundles’ which group topics from more than 1,000 suppliers. The HTC One retains the TV remote control, improves BoomSound and adds a new feature called Motion Launch that tries to guess what you’re doing, so if the phone rings it knows that putting it to your ear means you want to answer the call. Particularly for the camera, when it works is genuinely useful.\n\nThe most radical improvement over the HTC One, however, comes with the camera: already superb in low light the HTC One is now even better. Even more impressive it will now allow you to refocus any picture taken on to any point in the photo. Where Samsung demand on the new S5 that you choose from one of three options, those on HTC are almost infinite. You can also easily cut people out from their backgrounds and place them elsewhere, and film in slow-motion, like the iPhone 5s but again with even more options. Galleries are now better organised, autofocus is faster and full 1080p video recording is possible too. A 5MP camera on the front is best in class.\n\nAll of this is made possible by a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that is incredibly fast, and seemed in the limited time I’ve had with an HTC One (M8) to suffer no lag whatsoever. The phone adds automatic fitness tracking thanks to the Fitbit app that’s built in, and is compatible with Fitbit’s usual accessories. In addition the popular Zoe picture highlights packages will be cloud-based from later in the year, allowing friends to add their images to the record of your night out and there’s a clever case that shows a dot-matrix style display even when closed. Like the Samsung S5 there’s now also an extreme power-saving mode that turns everything off to make the phone last significantly longer, albeit only as a phone that’s worth a tenth of what you’ll pay for it. I’ve not had anything like long enough with the 2,600mAh battery to say how much longer it lasts.\n\nAll in all the new HTC One is better than the old HTC One, which was already excellent. It improves on it in every way, notwithstanding my subjective feelings about the new shinier design. More than anything else, the camera is superb. Insert a 128GB memory card and its got more storage than you could ever seriously need.\n\nSo what, then, could there possibly be to complain about? It’s this: look at Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s S5 and you see not devices that are primarily the latest smartphones but products that seek to act as a gateway to a world of other gadgets. For Apple that has meant fostering an enormous community of developers eager to build products exclusively for the platform. Although it’s changing there remain a host of brilliant apps that are iOS only and there remain hundreds of products that work best with Apple, from smart scales to blood pressure monitors. For Samsung it means making class-leading devices such as the Fit fitness band and the Gear smartwatch. Even if these are both emerging categories, they show that a smartphone must be more than a mere screen and camera, however great, that access the internet.\n\nHTC is, Google has already confirmed, working on wearable technology too, so the new One will increasingly be a device that acts as that gateway drug too. The company is not too far behind Samsung and Apple, and on same planes it is far ahead. Today if I wanted the best camera on the smartphone market I’d buy an HTC One.

The company unveiled its new HTC One (M8) on Tuesday in New York. Verizon Wireless will carry the smartphone at its retail stores starting today, while other carriers such as AT&T and Sprint are expected to have it in stores by April 11, the same day that Samsung's Galaxy S5 goes on sale. In Canada, the HTC One will be sold through Telus, Bell and Rogers. The new HTC One will also be available for preorder online at 1 p.m. EDT today on HTC's official website as well as from several carriers.\n\nThe all-new HTC One release date has arrived, but one day before the Taiwanese company was set to unveil its 2014 flagship, a couple of retailers jumped the gun by announcing the M8’s specs, features and pricing in promotional literature.\n\nThe smartphone most notably will feature new camera technology called selective focus, allowing photos to be focused after they are taken. While the Galaxy S5 will also feature a selective focus feature, it will rely on software to do the trick, whereas the HTC One features two cameras that create a composite image. The HTC One will be able to focus better on objects in the foreground following the snap, soften backgrounds and create image files with a 3D effect, according to unofficial promotional literature.\n\nWhile HTC chose to go with the “all-new One” moniker, its newest smartphone showcases a lot of twos. The main (rear) camera is lit by dual LEDs, one in white and another in amber, much like the iPhone 5s. The phone will adjust the flash for each shot, with amber tones from the second LED creating more “natural” lighting for skintones, a feature the company calls True Tone.\n\nThe HTC One specs a 1080p, 5-inch screen and options for 16-, 32- and 64GB of onboard storage. Reports say the 16GB model will only have 10GB of storage available, but the 2014 model is equipped with expandable storage through the addition of a microSD card. HTC will ship the phone in gray, silver and gold-colored metal bodies, powered by a 2,600 mAh battery and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset with a quad-core CPU clocked at 2.3GHz.\n\nThe smartphone reportedly has 2GB of RAM and will feature a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, an upgrade from the 2013 One’s 2.1-megapixel secondary shooter. The HTC One is also larger than the previous HTC flagship, by 0.3-inches in screen size. The 2014 model is also a larger phone, 9mm taller and 2.4mm wider. GSMArena lists the overall dimensions as 146.4 x 70.6 x 9.4mm (5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37).\n\nHTC has loaded the phone with an updated version of the Sense UX for 2014 (version 6.0), running together with the underlying Android OS, version 4.4.2 (KitKat). The 2014 HTC One will also include Motion Launch, which answers phone calls as a user places the phone to their ear, a “double-tap to wake” feature like the LG G2, and a timer on the front-facing camera for better “selfies,” or self-portraits.\n\nTell us, has HTC improved its latest smartphone enough to make it a buyer's choice?
