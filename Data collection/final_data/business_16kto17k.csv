GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) said until the fourth quarter, both categories were impacted by “limited” releases of new titles and also falling store traffic.\n\nDiluted net earnings for the full year were $2.99 a share, compared to $2.13 per share in losses in the previous years.\n\nGameStop buys back shares, guides for 2014\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, GameStop Corp.

This ended when inflation increased and interest rates rose.\n\nOn an annual basis, the current account deficit rose to 4.4pc of GDP, or £71bn, in 2013, slightly narrower than the deficit of 4.6pc of GDP recorded in 1989.\n\nJoe Grice, the ONS\'s chief economist, said the recent current account deficits were mainly being driven by a fall in income from investments earned abroad, rather than deteriorating net trade position. Britain\'s income deficit of £10.3bn in the fourth quarter was the largest on record.\n\nOthers said the size of Britain\'s current account deficit was unlikely to cause a crisis in the near term, but was ""storing up big problems for the future"".\n\n""The UK has a good net asset position with the rest of the world and the economy is growing faster than elsewhere. But the Bank of England and the government will need to alter their strategy to avoid trouble in the longer term,"" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\n""That means dialling down the stimulus sooner than the [Bank] is currently planning, removing subsidies from the housing market, and generally aiming for slower domestic growth in order to erode the imbalances that are building up.""\n\nIn a disappointing set of data on Friday, the ONS also revised down its estimate of 2013 growth to 1.7pc, from an initial estimate of 1.9pc.\n\nThe downward revision was mainly due to weaker income receipts, the ONS said. Profits generated outside the corporate sector are now thought to be lower than previously estimated.\n\nThe estimate for fourth quarter growth remained at 0.7pc, with slightly stronger export growth offset by a downward revision to stockbuilding. UK output remains 1.4pc below its pre-recession peak.\n\nThe ONS data also showed Britons continued to raid their savings in order to fund spending. The saving ratio fell to 5pc in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6pc in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, real household disposable income fell by 0.1pc compared with the previous quarter, according to the ONS.\n\n""As we feared, the accounts confirmed that the 0.4pc rise in real household spending (in the fourth quarter) was funded by consumers saving less,"" said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics.', 'Britain\'s yawning current account deficit hit its second widest level on record in the fourth quarter of 2013, official figures showed on Friday, as overall growth for 2013 was also revised down.\nThe current account deficit, which measures trade, was £22.4bn - or 5.4pc - of gross domestic product (GDP) in the final three months of last year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\nBritain\'s income deficit of £10.3bn in the fourth quarter was the largest on record.\nOthers said the size of Britain\'s current account deficit was unlikely to cause a crisis in the near term, but was ""storing up big problems for the future"".\nThe saving ratio fell to 5pc in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6pc in the previous quarter.']"

As a percentage of GDP, the deficit was 5.4%, down from 5.6% in the third quarter.\n\nSeparate data confirmed GDP rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter, as expected, but detail showed the percentage of household savings fell to a five-year low in 2013 while real disposable income slipped 0.1% in the last three months of the year.\n\nThe current account gap underlined fears about imbalances in the UK economy, said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. Describing the currrent account figures as ""very poor"" he said: ""As a proportion of GDP, the current account positions in Q3 and Q4 last year represent the largest two quarterly deficits in the history of the UK (5.6% and 5.4% respectively) and sit uncomfortably with hopes of an external rebalancing in the economy.""\n\nFor 2013 as a whole, the ONS said the UK was a net borrower of £65.7bn, up from £55.4bn in 2012. ""This was mainly a result of increased deficits in income and current transfers, partially offset by a decreased deficit in trade,"" it said, which will be of some comfort to George Osborne as he vows to raise net exports and boost Britain\'s trade performance.\n\nONS chief economist Joe Grice underlined the net trade situation in a statement alongside Friday\'s figures. ""As a percentage of GDP, the current account deficits over recent quarters represent some of the largest on record. However, relatively little of this is due to deteriorating net trade. Most of the decline stems from falling income from UK assets overseas, compared with income from foreign-owned assets in the UK,"" he said.\n\nBut Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg, said: ""This looks like a domestic recovery and it is quacking like one. Hence the UK\'s colossal balance of payments deficit is showing no signs of closing … The UK is storing up big problems for the future.""\n\nSeparate data confirmed economic growth of 0.7% in the fourth quarter. While unchanged from the previous two Office for National Statistics estimates, this release provided more detail on the nature of that growth.\n\nSamuel Tombs, UK economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, said the details painted a mixed picture on rebalancing. ""On a positive note, a bigger proportion of the 0.7% rise in GDP in the fourth quarter is now thought to have come from net exports. Business investment is also still thought to have grown by 2.4% quarter-on-quarter. But as we feared, the 0.4% quarterly rise in real household spending was funded by households saving less.""\n\nProviding more evidence people were having to dip into their savings after years of falling real wages, the ONS said there was a drop in households\' saving ratio, which estimates the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income.\n\nSuggesting that Osborne\'s bid to turn things around with his ""budget for savers"" this month will face big challenges, the savings ratio slumped to 5.1% in 2013 from 7.3% in 2012. For the fourth quarter alone, the savings ratio dropped to 5% from 5.6% in the third quarter.The ONS also revised down its estimate for growth over the whole of 2013 to 1.7% from a previous estimate of 1.8%.\n\nWhile recent growth and the outlook from many forecasters puts the UK ahead of many other advanced economies in terms of the pace of GDP expansion, comparisons with how it has regained ground since the global financial crisis are less favourable.\n\nBritain\'s GDP remains 1.4% below the pre-downturn peak. While the government has pushed for a rebalancing towards more manufacturing and exports and less reliance on consumer spending, the shape of the recovery so far suggests little progress.\n\nThe ONS said on Friday that the dominant service sector had surpassed its pre-crisis peak in the autumn of last year. However, the production industries remain 12.1% below their pre-downturn peak, with manufacturing 8.9% lower. Similarly, construction remains 12.5% below the peak.', 'The current account deficit – made up of the trade deficit, plus losses on overseas ventures – came in at £22.4bn in the fourth quarter last year, far above forecasts from City economists and down only slightly from a record £22.8bn deficit in the third quarter.\nThe current account gap underlined fears about imbalances in the UK economy, said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec.\nONS chief economist Joe Grice underlined the net trade situation in a statement alongside Friday\'s figures.\n""As a percentage of GDP, the current account deficits over recent quarters represent some of the largest on record.\nHowever, relatively little of this is due to deteriorating net trade.']"

This morning it published figures showing growth during the final quarter of 2013 was 1.7%, rather than the 1.9% it had originally thought.\n\n\n\nThat’s understandable – GDP predictions do, after all, require a certain amount of crystal ball gazing and it’s not often the ONS is completely spot on. Although it does suggest recovery isn’t quite as robust as we’d hoped for.

Manufacturing activity also rose by 0.5%, but – despite all the Chancellor’s help (to buy) – construction contracted by 0.2%.\n\n\n\nWhat was worrying, though, was the UK’s current account deficit (how much the value of the goods and services the UK imports exceeds the value of its exports. It differs from the trade deficit in that it also includes interest, dividends, transfers etc). Although it dropped to £22.4bn in the final quarter of 2013, from a record-breaking £22.8bn in the third quarter, it’s still way above the £14bn economists had expected.\n\n\n\nAccording to the ONS, the deficit was driven by a fall in investment from abroad.

The statisticians also recorded the first month of retail goods deflation since the second half of 2009, with prices dropping by 0.2 per cent.

However, John Hawksworh, chief economist at PwC, warned that growth should not be take for granted. “Looking to 2015 and beyond, strong retail and consumer spending can only be sustained if real income growth picks up,” Hawksworth said.

Two methods were put forward for consultation: an online census and a combined method using administrative data supplemented by sample surveys.\n\nIn the 2011 census, households were sent paper forms, with online entry available as an alternative. This resulted in 16% of completed forms being submitted online, according to ONS. The recommended online approach would result in online being the priority mode, with other modes available for the ‘unconnected’ population.\n\nThe alternative administrative data solution would make use of existing sources such as the NHS Patient Register and the DWP/HMRC Customer Information System to produce annual population estimates, which would then be adjusted for biases by supplementing with annual coverage surveys of 1% of the population.\n\nIn an overview of the two methods, chair of the MRS Census & Geodemographics Group Barry Leventhal concluded that the online census appeared the better option for both richness of output and cost of provision. He added that administrative data could improve annual population estimates and could be implemented alongside an online census. Responding to today’s recommendation, Leventhal said: “My immediate reaction is that I’m delighted with the recommended ‘direction of travel’ that’s been announced for collecting census-type data in the future, and I’m sure that it’s the right approach to be putting forward.\n\n“If Government agrees with the recommendation, as I hope they will, and are prepared to support the long-term development of administrative data solutions in parallel with an online census in 2021, then this is a real opportunity for improving our data for the future.”\n\nCEO of the Market Research Society Jane Frost, said: “While the decision to move the Census to a predominantly online format is consistent with technological developments it is not without its risks. One of the benefits of the Census is that it provides solid evidential data to identify ‘hidden groups’ in society, but these groups won’t necessarily have access to technology. The ONS also needs to ensure that the correct data protection and security measures are implemented to prevent data hacking or leaks.”\n\nSIr Andrew Dilnot, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, who wrote to Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude to make the recommendation, said: “I am very grateful to colleagues in ONS for all their hard work over the last three years to complete a thorough and extensive review of the future provision of population statistics in England and Wales and the options for the next census.\n\n“Along with the Board of the Authority, I welcome the National Statistician’s recommendation and commend it to the Government and Parliament.”', 'UK — The National Statistician has recommended a primarily online census for 2021.\nTwo methods were put forward for consultation: an online census and a combined method using administrative data supplemented by sample surveys.\nThe recommended online approach would result in online being the priority mode, with other modes available for the ‘unconnected’ population.\nIn an overview of the two methods, chair of the MRS Census & Geodemographics Group Barry Leventhal concluded that the online census appeared the better option for both richness of output and cost of provision.\nHe added that administrative data could improve annual population estimates and could be implemented alongside an online census.']"

(In 2001 it was 13.4km.)\n\nOf course, much of London commuting is via the tube, or another form of public transport – and for many, that might make it feel quite a bit longer than getting in your own car.\n\nThen there's a study from the ONS earlier this year that shows commuters are more likely to be anxious, unhappy and think their lives lack worth and meaning.\n\nIf you commute for under three hours a day, you feel slightly worse with each minute that passes. Oddly, though, once you’re past that point, the negative effects begin to wane.\n\nWhich brings us onto the next nugget from today's figures: the longest commute in England and Wales burdens those in the East of England – at 17km – taking in much of the capital’s commuter belt.\n\nThe news that more of us are travelling further to get to work, or that more of us are working from home, comes as little surprise. But just how far and how much are those who live in the East of England but work in London (so may well get a double whammy in terms of varieties of transport used, or just length of time spent travelling) willing to go and pay?\n\nWe’ve done a rundown of the latest annual season ticket prices and train journey lengths for some of the main and favourite commuter towns in the East of England:\n\nNorwich to Liverpool Street (just under two hours) – £8,432\n\nCambridge to King’s Cross (roughly an hour) – £4,536\n\nIpswich to Liverpool Street (around one hour 15 minutes) – £6,000\n\nBedford to Zones 1-6 (between one hour 15 and one hour 30 minutes to Waterloo) – £5,256\n\nHitchin to King's Cross (between 30 and 45 minutes) – £3,616\n\nBury St Edmund's to Zones 1-6 (one hour 30 mins to two hours, with one change) – £7,324\n\nA good deal for managers?\n\nWhereas in the rest of the country, professionals and managers travelled further, on average, than everyone else (20km or more), that isn’t the case in London, where those holding those roles have, like other Londoners, a shorter commute.\n\nMoreover, the difference between professional and other occupation groups wasn’t so noticeable in the capital, where skilled trade workers were most likely to commute 20km or more.\n\nThe “other” category\n\nThis is people who had no fixed place of work, were working outside the UK or on offshore installations, and it more than doubled over the ten years, to £2.2m.\n\nThat means those workers accounted for 8.4 per cent of the workforce in 2011 – from 4.7 per cent in 2001.\n\nAlthough the census doesn’t provide conclusive reasons for why this is changing, the rise in remote working, entrepreneurial and small business activity, and increased flexibility of travel could be given as contributing factors.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this group grew by the most in London, rising from 5.6 per cent to 11 per cent in 2011.

IRS Notice 2014-21.\n\nThe IRS apparently relied on the premise that virtual currencies do not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. Signaling that its position on the tax treatment of virtual currencies is not set, however, the IRS included in its guidance a request for public comments “regarding other types or aspects of virtual currency transactions that should be addressed in future guidance.”\n\nThe exchange of property is a reportable event. Transactions using virtual currency, therefore, fall under general tax principles that apply to property transactions. Among other things, this means that:\n\nWages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.\n\nPayments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply. Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.\n\nThe character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.\n\nA payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.\n\nAutomated accounting solutions are in the works to help users of virtual currencies track their transactions to satisfy these recordkeeping requirements. (The Bitcoin Taxman Cometh: Calculating How Much Crypto-Investors Owe IRS Could Be Easy, Forbes, Mar. 25, 2014; New IRS Bitcoin Rules Pose a Problem Only an Army of Startups Can Solve, Wired, Mar. 25, 2014.)\n\nComplying with the IRS guidance may be burdensome for users of bitcoins or other virtual currencies. However, even the security failure of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has not dampened supporters’ enthusiasm for the virtual currency. Bitcoin ATMs are popping up in the United States and abroad and companies are finding innovative ways to accept virtual currencies as payment. (A Better Way to Buy Bitcoin?, The New Yorker, Mar. 25, 2014; How To Use Bitcoin To Shop At Amazon, Home Depot, CVS And More, Forbes, Feb. 17, 2014.) Perhaps the most intriguing development on the horizon is the race to open regulated investment funds and exchanges in the United States. (SecondMarket Seeks to Open Bitcoin Fund to Ordinary Investors, The Wall Street Journal (registration required), Mar. 19, 2014.)

They will now have the same rules and taxes applied to them as stocks. Most importantly, this means that Bitcoin will now be subject to capital gains taxes. For heavy Bitcoin investors, this decision will be easier on their wallets, as the long term capital gains tax of 20 percent is significantly less than the 39.6 percent federal income tax.\n\nHowever some people are worried that this new classification is detracting from the main goal of Bitcoin. As Bloomberg points out, if it is viewed as property, that could deter the volume of people who decide to use Bitcoin as currency.\n\nThere is also the matter of Bitcoin “mining,” a term used to describe the process of unlocking coins online. The IRS has stated that miners must now record the free market value of their mined coins as gross income on the date they receive it. This particular change came about as a disincentive for people to go looking for new coins.\n\nOn the flip side, there appear to not only be a lot of tax advantages to viewing this new currency as property, but a lot of value advantages as well. Bitcoin prices have fluctuated wildly over the years, and this new classification by the IRS may stabilize their value some. Along with this, companies or individuals who lose Bitcoins due to fraud or other reasons, like Mt. Gox in February, can now report that as capital loss on their taxes.\n\nProtection is one of the big reasons that the government turned up the heat on categorizing virtual currencies. About three months before this ruling, NTA advocate Nina Olson argued that governments have to intervene and provide guidelines for consumers when new items enter the playing field. Along with this, regulators of Bitoin have been worried that the industry could be all too easily utilized for drug transactions or other illegal activities. So, as the New York Times states, “All that has put more pressure on governments around the world to figure out some way to regulate the industry.”\n\nWho knows what the future may hold for virtual currency.

Notice 2014-21 declared that bitcoins should be treated as property, not as currency, echoing guidance provided by taxing authorities in most other western countries. Other matters addressed by this notice include the following:\n\n· Mined bitcoins are taxable as ordinary income at the time of receipt, not at the time of conversion to dollars.\n\n· Profits from Bitcoin mining carried on as a trade or business are subject to self-employment tax.\n\n· Bitcoins received as salary income are subject to withholding of federal income, Medicare and Social Security taxes and should be reported on Form W2.\n\nCuriously, Notice 2014-21 mentions the possibility that bitcoins might not be a capital asset for some taxpayers, leaving open the option of inventory treatment for Bitcoin dealers, while ruling out the possibility that a miner could be a dealer. Though some users may see them as a setback, it is important to note that these provisions should not be considered punitive or unusual with respect to Bitcoin. They are comparable to the treatment of similar types of transactions in the Internal Revenue Code in which something of value other than cash is received by a taxpayer. Bitcoin prices remained essentially unchanged in response to the announcement.\n\nThe decision by the IRS comes as a mixed blessing to US Bitcoiners, ensuring that bitcoins will be treated as capital assets in the hands of most taxpayers (and granting access to lower long term capital gain rates under certain circumstances), but imposing burdensome record-keeping requirements that are likely to significantly hinder Bitcoin’s widespread adoption as a means of payment in the United States. To the extent that fungibility has driven Bitcoin’s price appreciation so far, capital asset treatment may prove to be a drag on continued growth.\n\nBitcoin has come a long way from the 10,000 bitcoin pizza, attracting some very welcome positive attention recently for its use in non-illegal sales of luxury cars, a villa in Bali, and tickets to space. However, it is the common and mundane transactions that could push Bitcoin into the mainstream of world economies: groceries, energy, and the proverbial cup of coffee. US taxpayers are now faced with the requirement to maintain records of basis, date purchased and date “spent” for every bitcoin that passes through their hands during the year. Under current law, each of these transactions will be considered a separate, reportable, taxable disposition that must be individually notated, much like securities transactions. That morning cup of coffee? How would you like to key it into TurboTax a couple hundred times for the year (making sure, of course, to note the exchange rate in effect at the time of purchase, along with the amount you paid for the fraction of a coin that you used to pay for the coffee)?

Because they are now treated as property, virtual currencies are considered, like stocks, bonds, and other investment property, as capital assets and will be subject to capital gains tax.\n\nBut why does this hinder bitcoins use a currency? The answer is fungibility: Bitcoins are no longer completely fungible.\n\nFungibility is the property of a good or a commodity whose individual units are capable of mutual substitution. For example, since one ounce of gold is equivalent to any other ounce of gold, gold is fungible. Similarly, a $10 bill is not only interchangeable with another $10 bill, it’s also interchangeable with two $5s, ten $1s, and other combination that adds to 10. Fiat currency is completely fungible.\n\nAnd from the seller’s side of an exchange, so are bitcoins. If you owe me 1 bitcoin for lunch, I don’t care if you give me a bitcoin you acquired last year or one you acquired yesterday. To me, they are completely equal and thus completely fungible. But they would not be completely equal to you.\n\nSay you bought bitcoin A for $10 last year and bitcoin B for $550 yesterday. Today, however, a bitcoin is worth $530. If you trade bitcoin A you had a capital gain of $520. But if you use bitcoin B, you’d have a capital loss of $30. Since you’d have to pay the capital gains tax if you use bitcoin A, you’d be better off using bitcoin B.\n\nWhile such considerations may not be a hassle for those who have few bitcoins, rarely spend them, or refuse to pay taxes, they become onerous for those who have many bitcoins, uses them frequently in exchanges, and fear IRS audits. “If I have to figure out which particular Bitcoin in my wallet I want to spend and what the tax treatment will be, Bitcoin just doesn’t work as a commercial medium of exchange,” says Adam J. Levitin, a Georgetown Law professor and expert on finance and payments.\n\nSeveral weeks ago I wrote that, as a currency, bitcoin was (nearly) dead. With this IRS decision, though, I think it’s safe to say it’s mostly dead (as Miracle Max would say, “There’s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive.”). You’ll still be able to buy a sandwich with bitcoins. But the new IRS rule means the transaction will be more like paying for lunch with a share of Google stock than with a wad of dollar bills.\n\nJoe Carter is a Senior Editor at the Acton Institute.

Bitcoin is currently in the Wild West prospector days of its evolution. The world has agreed that a Bitcoin provides a stored measure of value in the same way that gold and silver have throughout the ages. Like gold and silver, Bitcoin is only worth what the other person is willing to pay you for it. This has led to cheating since trading began. Crooked scales and filled ore all became part of the norm as both the miners and the assayers sought to pad their bottom lines. This led to governmental oversight and the creation of centralized exchanges.\n\nThe Bitcoin dream has been to police its own community and remain beyond the physical scrutiny of any global government. The Utopian dream was shattered a month ago when Mt. Gox,, by far the largest Bitcoin exchange, shut down due to a security breach and theft of approximately $300 million worth of Bitcoin. Customers who had Bitcoin on deposit with Mt. Gox still do not know how much they’ll get back. The issues at Mt. Gox lay bare the cyber security argument. Surprisingly, Bitcoin as a currency has shown remarkable resilience. This resilience could very well be just the boost needed to legitimize the currency and the lean towards governmental involvement that may actually help this fledgling store of value soar to its mainstream potential.\n\nThe timing of the Mt. Gox incident may prove to be a boon for the currency. Tera Group, out of Summit New Jersey, already had proposed a bilateral agreement to the Commodity Trading Futures Commission (CFTC) to begin trading Bitcoins through a swap-execution facility or, centralized exchange. The vast majority of commercial currency trading is done through swaps agreements. A swap agreement is basically an insurance policy that provides a guaranteed value at a specific point in time to protect against currency fluctuations. It’s what the commodity exchanges are founded on. The swap markets are the superhighways of the financial industry. They process massive volumes while collecting a small toll on each transaction. Therefore, the cost on the individual swap is small but the sheer volume of swaps processed makes it a huge revenue source for all of the major banks.\n\nThe CFTC has yet to comment on Tera Group’s proposal. We commented in November that Bitcoin had transcended novelty status and that the revenue pool was becoming too big for global banks to ignore. Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of the Mt. Gox debacle is a testament to the power of a global grassroots movement. Bitcoin should have plunged across the globe as owners of Bitcoins tried to exchange them for hard currency. The market’s response turned out to be very orderly. While prices did fall across the board, the market seemed to understand that it was an individual company’s problem and was therefore confined to Mt. Gox customers’ ability to get their money out. As a result, Bitcoin prices have stabilized around $585. This is well off the December high of $1,200 but very near the average price for the last six months.\n\nThe last coincidentally timed piece of the structural transformation from Bitcoin as an anarchist, alternative store of value that exists outside the institutionalized financial industry to being integrated into that same financial system is its ability to be taxed by the brick and mortar governments it was developed to circumvent. The Internal Revenue Service finally decided enough is enough and it wants its cut. The IRS has declared Bitcoin as property rather than currency and is therefore subject to property laws rather than currency laws. This allows the IRS to get their share while legitimizing the need for a central exchange to ascertain value. It also eliminates arguments with the U.S. Treasury and Congress over legal tender issues. It’s simply valued as a good that can be exchanged for other goods and services, barter.\n\nBitcoin is a global marketplace executing transactions on an electronic network. That sounds an awful lot like the forex markets. Industry regulators and the banking industry are going to quickly find that the failure of Mt. Gox has done more to encourage the individual resolve of global Bitcoin users rather than ending this upstart’s existence. Private users of Bitcoin will clamor for the government to protect its people from crooked exchanges just as farmers were cheated in the grain trade of ancient Egypt or gold and cattle by assayers and stockyards in the Wild West. Tera Group may be in the right place at the right time with the right idea as Bitcoin may have proven itself to be self-sustaining at the retail level. Institutional and legal structures are being put in place to continue its evolution as the financial industry is left to figure out how to monetize it.', 'The next phase in the Bitcoin revolution will be the standardization of the exchanges where the coins are traded.\nThe Bitcoin dream has been to police its own community and remain beyond the physical scrutiny of any global government.\nGox,, by far the largest Bitcoin exchange, shut down due to a security breach and theft of approximately $300 million worth of Bitcoin.\nThe IRS has declared Bitcoin as property rather than currency and is therefore subject to property laws rather than currency laws.\nGox has done more to encourage the individual resolve of global Bitcoin users rather than ending this upstart’s existence.']"

It has decided that cryptocurrencies should be treated as property, not currency, for US federal tax purposes.\n\nAs was noted by National Taxpayer Advocate Nina E. Olson in her 2013 annual report to Congress in January this year, Bitcoin usage increased by over 75 percent in the four months between July and December 2013 – from about 1,700 transactions per hour to over 3,000 – and, over the same period, the market value of Bitcoins in circulation rose more than ten-fold from about USD1.1bn to USD12.6bn.\n\nWith taxpayers being unsure previously of the tax rules to which they should comply, it is now hoped the provision of IRS guidance will promote tax compliance, particularly among those who want to report digital currency transactions properly, and provide tax certainty.\n\nThe IRS guidance has been issued in the form of answers to frequently asked questions, so as to provide clear and basic information on the US federal tax implications of transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency.\n\nWhile, in some environments, virtual currencies operates like fiat currency, the IRS points out that they do not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction, and that, consequently, it should be treated as property for US federal tax purposes.\n\nIt is therefore confirmed that the general tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. This means, for example, that wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) , and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.\n\nIn addition, payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable, and self-employment tax rules generally apply, with payers normally required to complete Form 1099-MISC (Miscellaneous Income).\n\nMeanwhile, the treatment of the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.\n\nNext, the IRS has clarified that a payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.\n\nAlthough the fact that virtual currency will not be treated as currency by the IRS will mean that no foreign currency gain or loss is generated for US federal tax purposes, payments made using virtual currency are subject to backup withholding to the same extent as other payments made in property. Therefore, payers making reportable payments using virtual currency may need to solicit a taxpayer identification number from the payee, the IRS said.\n\nGiven that Bitcoin investors may be subject to an income tax liability that has not been previously specified, they may also be subject to penalties for failure to comply with tax laws, even for transactions or investments concluded before March 25, the IRS guidance says. In addition, failure to report virtual currency transactions when required to do so may be subject to information reporting penalties. However, it is stressed that penalty relief may be available to taxpayers who are able to establish that the underpayment or failure to file information returns is due to reasonable cause.', 'IRS Issues Virtual Currency Tax Guidanceby Mike Godfrey, Tax-News.com, Washington28 March 2014The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued much-needed tax guidance on March 25 to provide clarification for users of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.\nIt is therefore confirmed that the general tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.\nMeanwhile, the treatment of the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.\nTherefore, payers making reportable payments using virtual currency may need to solicit a taxpayer identification number from the payee, the IRS said.\nIn addition, failure to report virtual currency transactions when required to do so may be subject to information reporting penalties.']"

Bitcoin owners and prospective bitcoin owners should take five minutes to read the six-page notice.\n\nFor the most part, Bitcoin owners were pleasantly surprised by the news. Anyone who researched the topic or spoke with a knowledgable accountant understood bitcoin gains would need to be reported at tax time. It was expected they would be treated as property, which is how the IRS guidance ended up dealing with bitcoins.\n\nBitcoiners expected clarification at some point, but not before this year's tax filing deadline.\n\nThis clarification is good news for three reasons.\n\nFirst, it clears up the tax environment. Prior to this announcement, some potential bitcoin investors were concerned it might be illegal. Others thought it was legal, but didn't want to risk getting in trouble with the IRS by making a mistake on their taxes.\n\nThis announcement, however, demonstrates that bitcoin is a legal financial investment, and provides certainty as to the way transactions should be reported. Before this announcement there was mostly guesswork as to how the IRS would classify bitcoin transactions. No one likes guessing when it comes to tax penalties, and this guidance removes that guesswork.\n\nThe second reason this is good news: this is one of the best possible outcomes. If bitcoin had been classified as a currency instead of property, that would have resulted in a higher tax liability for many bitcoiners -- since those gains or losses are classified as ordinary income or loss. With Tuesday's IRS ruling, bitcoin investors can further benefit from the U.S. long-term capital gain rate, in addition to their investment's massive appreciation.\n\nLastly, this is good news is because, with this announcement, the IRS at least recognizes the legality of bitcoin -- if not tacitly endorsing bitcoin by stating “Virtual currency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of value.” For some that is a big deal.\n\nNot many people love the IRS. However most people respect the agency, and its recognition that bitcoin has utility is a win in the battle to eliminate the myth that “bitcoin is a mirage.”\n\nDisclosure: At the time of this writing David Smith has a long bitcoin position.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."", ""Shutterstock photoDavid Smith for BenzingaOn Tuesday, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a notice, informing Americans of the U.S. Federal tax implications of bitcoin transactions.\nBitcoin owners and prospective bitcoin owners should take five minutes to read the six-page notice.\nFor the most part, Bitcoin owners were pleasantly surprised by the news.\nBefore this announcement there was mostly guesswork as to how the IRS would classify bitcoin transactions.\nWith Tuesday's IRS ruling, bitcoin investors can further benefit from the U.S. long-term capital gain rate, in addition to their investment's massive appreciation.""]"

However, its position may change depending on future statements from the European Commission.\n\nAccording to the IRS notice, those who sell or exchange virtual currency will have to account for gains and losses from that sale or exchange depending on whether the virtual currency is a \'capital asset\' or an \'ordinary asset\'. Payments in bitcoin will be valued at the ""fair market value in US dollars"" on the date that the payment is received.\n\nBitcoin is a digital asset with monetary value, but it is not currently recognised as an official currency anywhere in the world. Some retailers accept payment by bitcoin for goods and services but most traders, especially in the EU, have not yet put systems in place to accept them in transactions.\n\nIn its guidance, the IRS said that it was ""aware"" that \'convertible\' virtual currencies, such as bitcoin, were being used in the US to pay for goods and services, or were being held for investment purposes. Convertible virtual currencies are those that have an equivalent value in real currency or that act as a substitute for real currency. Convertible virtual currencies used to pay for goods or services should be valued at the fair market value in US dollars on the date of receipt, which should be determined with reference to an exchange on which the exchange rate is ""established by market supply and demand"".\n\nAccording to the note, the usual rules relating to capital gains and losses will be applied on exchange of virtual currency for other property. This means that if the fair market value of the property received is worth more than the adjusted value of the virtual currency, the person making the trade has a taxable gain. Similarly, the person making the trade would have a loss if the fair market value of the property received in exchange was less than the adjusted value of the virtual currency. The person trading the bitcoin would also have to calculate the change in value of the bitcoin between the date it was acquired and the date that it was spent. Capital losses over the course of a tax year can be subtracted from capital gains in the same tax year in the usual way.\n\nEmployers that pay staff with bitcoin will have to report those wages in the same way as any other payment made with property, and bitcoin income will be subject to the normal federal income withholding and payroll taxes, according to the note. Reporting requirements apply to transactions in which property valued at $600 or more is exchanged, and the same reporting requirements will apply to bitcoin transactions.\n\nWhen bitcoins are successfully \'mined\', or created, the person mining the bitcoin will obtain the fair market value as income, according to the note. Those who mine virtual currencies as a trade or business will also be subject to self-employment tax, the IRS said.\n\nThe guidance set out in the note applies both immediately and to past transactions, according to the IRS. This means that taxpayers could potentially be penalised for having treated a virtual currency transaction in a way inconsistent with the contents of the note before it was published. However, the IRS said that relief from penalties may be available to taxpayers who underpaid tax or did not file tax returns if they could show ""reasonable cause"" for their actions.', 'Among the implications of its position considered by the treasury department in new guidance (6-page / 42KB PDF) are the tax treatment of wages paid to employees in virtual currency, and information reporting requirements for virtual currency payments.\nAccording to the IRS notice, those who sell or exchange virtual currency will have to account for gains and losses from that sale or exchange depending on whether the virtual currency is a \'capital asset\' or an \'ordinary asset\'.\nPayments in bitcoin will be valued at the ""fair market value in US dollars"" on the date that the payment is received.\nConvertible virtual currencies are those that have an equivalent value in real currency or that act as a substitute for real currency.\nAccording to the note, the usual rules relating to capital gains and losses will be applied on exchange of virtual currency for other property.']"

The most important reason, he adds, is what it says to the larger financial community.\n\n“This decision legitimizes Bitcoin both as a transaction medium and as an asset,” Mr. Watson says. Bitcoin has been seen as a tool for illegal activity, he says. But this statement from a federal agency says that the government recognizes the currency and is working on strategies for how to treat it.\n\n“Now that the IRS has made a public statement about the currency, this takes the uncertainty out of the marketplace,” he says.\n\nBut analysts say that Bitcoin\'s new legitimacy has a formidable downside, as users face new IRS reporting requirements.\n\nThis may be a step forward for legitimacy, but “it’s a giant leap backward for practicality,” says Gemma Godfrey, head of Investment Strategy at Brooks Macdonald in London, via e-mail.\n\nWhile the IRS opinion may be a boon to investors, it just added a boggling new burden on anyone who might want to use the virtual tender to actually buy something, she adds. “Working out tax implications every time it’s used would prove highly impractical.""\n\nOne of the attractions of using Bitcoin in everyday life is its convenience and ease of use, says Arnav Sheth, assistant professor of finance at the graduate business school of Saint Mary\'s College of California in Moraga.\n\nMuch like cash, Bitcoin can be transferred from one party to another quite easily and without much hassle. After the new IRS ruling, the accounting for it is going to become much more difficult, he adds.\n\nMoreover, taxing Bitcoin as property can amount to double taxation. ""Say you buy a sushi dinner for your family at an expensive restaurant for $600,” which at today’s prices is roughly one Bitcoin, says Professor Sheth. “If you paid $10 to buy that 1 BTC, you are now liable for taxes on the excess $590,” in addition to the taxes you pay to the restauranteur.\n\n“There\'s the troubling double-taxation aspect,” he adds. ""You\'re paying Uncle Sam twice: once for your Bitcoin and again for your dinner. In addition to that, it is now much harder for you to keep track of how much you will spend and how much you owe in taxes.”\n\nTry to minimize your tax, and the accounting burden gets heavier still. “Suppose I own 2 BTC,” he says. “Now I have to figure out which one I should use to minimize my taxes. How much did I pay for each? How much was that dinner again? You can see that it gets pretty complicated pretty fast,” he adds.\n\nBitcoin backers say that these obstacles are not insurmountable, especially if Congress steps in to delay implementation of the ruling until the tech community can catch up.\n\nThe barter economy, or trading property for a product, is certainly not a new idea, says CPA Steve Brecher, senior adviser at WeiserMazars in New York. “There are more and more exchanges for different kinds of property,” he says, noting that the marketplace has worked out methods for determining quotations of value and doing the necessary calculations for reporting.\n\nMoreover, with the high level of involvement from the tech community in the evolution of Bitcoin, the challenges of every day usage can be met, most likely with a new application or something similar, says Watson. “This is a tractable problem,” he adds.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nHowever, given the lack of such software at the moment, the new ruling leaves the average user in a grey zone, says Steve Kirsch, CEO of Cointrust, a company that is developing technology to address the compliance and safety issues associated with virtual currencies.\n\n“It would be best for Congress to get involved at this point and either suspend the implementation of this ruling to allow the applications people use to catch up to the ruling or treat Bitcoin as a currency for tax purposes,” he adds via e-mail.', ""“We are very excited about this opinion,” says Erick Watson, chief operating officer of New Path Mining, a Bitcoin mining firm in Seattle, Wash.\n“This decision legitimizes Bitcoin both as a transaction medium and as an asset,” Mr. Watson says.\n“Now that the IRS has made a public statement about the currency, this takes the uncertainty out of the marketplace,” he says.\nBut analysts say that Bitcoin's new legitimacy has a formidable downside, as users face new IRS reporting requirements.\nAfter the new IRS ruling, the accounting for it is going to become much more difficult, he adds.""]"

Gox after hacker attacks were blamed for the disappearance of $460 million from their coffers (see IRS Says Bitcoin Counts as Property for Tax Purposes).\n\nThe shutdown of the site Silk Road, along with later successors, and the arrest of its founder on money laundering and murder conspiracy charges, also have not helped the digital currency’s reputation.\n\nThe FAQs issued Tuesday by the IRS show the agency intends to treat the virtual currency as taxable property. The guidance provides basic information on the U.S. federal tax implications of transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency.\n\nIn some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency, the IRS noted, such as the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance. However, the IRS pointed out, virtual currencies like Bitcoin do not enjoy the status of being legal tender in any jurisdiction. Indeed, Bitcoin has often been accused of facilitating international criminal enterprises such as money laundering, drug dealing and prostitution by skirting the traditional banking channels. Even the technology’s supposed creator has disavowed his involvement with it.\n\nThe IRS notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes as opposed to regular currency. Thus the general tax principles that apply to property transactions also apply to transactions using virtual currency like Bitcoin. That means that wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee and must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and they are also subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.\n\nPayments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are also going to be taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply, according to the IRS. In addition Bitcoin payers may need to issue a Form 1099, as business payers often do. The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency will depend on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property, according to the IRS.\n\nI talked with a tax expert who has been closely following Bitcoin’s rise and he sees some advantages of the IRS weighing in on the technology. “A lot of people dealing in Bitcoin didn’t know what the consequences were, so at least people now know what the consequences are of using it,” said Steve Brecher, a senior adviser at the accounting firm WeiserMazars. “Knowing the consequences is useful. Some people have been making assumptions about it and proceeding, and they may have guessed right. There were some people who were probably hopeful it might get a different treatment. But at least they know what the treatment is.”\n\nSome investment experts, such as the Winklevoss twins who were involved in the founding of Facebook, were already anticipating this type of treatment when they formed their Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust.\n\nEven though IRS guidance may reduce some of the coolness factor in Bitcoin, it may also make it a somewhat safer bet as regulators try to get a handle on the technology. Incidents like the Mt. Gox meltdown and the Silk Road shutdown have shaken investor confidence in the technology and led to wild volatility on the Bitcoin markets that remain open.\n\nWith the IRS weighing in, and the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also coming out with rules last year on virtual currencies, the exchanges may become less subject to criminal manipulation. New York State is also looking at issuing regulatory rules, Brecher pointed out. “Even though Bitcoin originally started outside of any regulatory scheme, I think it probably presents more confidence, so I think how it’s used may depend on the implications. Are you really going to go into Pizza Hut and buy a pizza with your Bitcoin if you have to worry about the tax consequences? I’m not sure you are.”\n\nAnd with regular IRS forms like the W-2 and 1099 now being required, the money will be more traceable.\n\nThat could be a bad thing for the criminals, but a good thing for the average investor concerned about losing their life savings on the latest market bubble.\n\nDo you think Bitcoin transactions should be taxable?\n\nMichael Cohn is editor-in-chief of AccountingToday.com.\n\nImage: Thinkstock', 'The FAQs issued Tuesday by the IRS show the agency intends to treat the virtual currency as taxable property.\nThe guidance provides basic information on the U.S. federal tax implications of transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency.\nThe IRS notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes as opposed to regular currency.\nThus the general tax principles that apply to property transactions also apply to transactions using virtual currency like Bitcoin.\nThe character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency will depend on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.']"

On Tuesday, the Internal Revenue Service announced that, “for federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property.”\n\nThat means that the tax principles that apply to property transactions also apply to virtual currency exchanges. “A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must, in computing gross income, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received,” the IRS announced.\n\nSo when a company accepts Bitcoin or other virtual currency, or a $500,000 Balinese villa is purchased with Bitcoin, it is now the taxpayer’s responsibility to determine the value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars at the time of the transaction and the recipient of the virtual currency would be responsible to pay taxes on the virtual currency as a capital gain.\n\nBitcoin is currently being exchanged at a rate of $589.05 for each bitcoin.\n\nThis decision brings Bitcoin a little more into the light of public view.

Bitcoin miners create more bitcoins by working out increasingly difficult algorithms that grow more complex with every solution.\n\n“When a taxpayer successfully ‘mines’ virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income,” the IRS stated.\n\nIn late 2013, Bond New York made headlines when it became the first real estate firm to accept bitcoins for real estate fees.\n\n“We are the first out there,” Kelly Kreth, head of public relations for Bond New York, and principal for Kreth Communications said in HousingWire’s March issue. “We accept Bitcoin for real estate transaction fees. We aren’t talking about accepting Bitcoin for the actual purchase – that would be between the buyer and seller.”\n\nTransactions involving Bitcoin and other virtual currency, including real estate transactions, must now be reported to the IRS and taxes must be paid on any money earned in a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe impact of this decision on virtual currency users is yet to be determined. In some ways, the IRS decision legitimizes virtual currency. Now it’s just like every other form of property in the country. But maybe that takes some of the shine off of the “next big thing.”', '“A taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services must, in computing gross income, include the fair market value of the virtual currency, measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received,” the IRS announced.\nSo when a company accepts Bitcoin or other virtual currency, or a $500,000 Balinese villa is purchased with Bitcoin, it is now the taxpayer’s responsibility to determine the value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars at the time of the transaction and the recipient of the virtual currency would be responsible to pay taxes on the virtual currency as a capital gain.\nOne of the purposes of Bitcoin is to allow anonymous transactions, but now Bitcoin transactions will have to be recorded and reported to the IRS.\n“When a taxpayer successfully ‘mines’ virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income,” the IRS stated.\nIn late 2013, Bond New York made headlines when it became the first real estate firm to accept bitcoins for real estate fees.']"
56230,http://www.inc.com/jeremy-quittner/irs-will-tax-bitcoin-like-property.html,business,"['When it comes to virtual currency Bitcoin, there\'s a lot of confusion about what it really is. Some say it\'s a commodity. Others think it’s a currency. Now the Internal Revenue Service has weighed in.\n\nPrompted by concerns over how to tax the fledgling virtual currency, on Tuesday the IRS indicated that that Bitcoin isn\'t currency--at least for tax purposes. Instead, the federal agency declared it property. So if your business accepts payment in Bitcoin, trades it, or sells it, there\'s a new set of regulations you need to follow.\n\nThe IRS is adding its voice to states and municipalities struggling with how to regulate the currency for businesses and consumers, and the ruling may help to legitimize the cryptocurrency for the many businesses rushing to embrace it.\n\n""There are no free rides, and this is similar to how the IRS taxes people on the barter system,"" says Scott Cheslowitz, a partner at accounting firm Rothenberg & Peters in Great Neck, New York.\n\nHow the IRS Sees It\n\nHere are the main points: The IRS has decided that, for tax purposes, it will not treat Bitcoin like currency, which similarly depreciates or increases in value. Instead, the IRS will tax Bitcoin as either a capital asset or tangible asset. Capital assets are things like stocks, bonds, or investment properties. Tangible assets are things like inventory, machinery, or your company\'s buildings.\n\nWhile the value of both types of assets can rise and fall, the tax rates are pretty different. Generally speaking, you\'d pay the ordinary tax rate on the sale or exchange of Bitcoin held as a tangible asset--say you were paid in it. By contrast, you\'d pay the lower capital gains rate of about 15 percent to 20 percent on transactions for Bitcoin held as an investment, for example if you obtained it on an exchange.\n\nThe same treatment goes for losses. If your Bitcoin has depreciated since you\'ve held it, you\'d get a tax write off.\n\nThat\'s pretty important for owners of Bitcoin, whose value is currently around $600, but which has traded over $1,000 within the past few months.\n\nThe Business Perspective\n\nRemember, if your business pays people in Bitcoin, you\'ll also have to issue a 1099 for any contract work you pay for worth $600 or more.\n\nSimilarly, if your business, or part of your business, mines and trades Bitcoin, you\'ll be liable for self-employment taxes on earnings. And if you\'re paying your employees in Bitcoin, the IRS says that pay is now subject to withholding taxes based on the virtual currency\'s fair market value.\n\nThe IRS also says its rules are backward looking, so you could be subject to penalties for improper tax treatment of Bitcoin income in prior years.\n\n""The IRS is interested in collecting revenue and regulating and creating rules and laws for people who want to avoid taxes with Bitcoin,"" says Ed Mendlowitz, a partner at WithumSmith+Brown, an accounting firm in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nNobody likes the taxman, but for entrepreneurs and consumers eager to validate Bitcoin and bring it into the mainstream, the IRS notice goes a long way toward achieving those goals.', ""When it comes to virtual currency Bitcoin, there's a lot of confusion about what it really is.\nPrompted by concerns over how to tax the fledgling virtual currency, on Tuesday the IRS indicated that that Bitcoin isn't currency--at least for tax purposes.\nInstead, the IRS will tax Bitcoin as either a capital asset or tangible asset.\nGenerally speaking, you'd pay the ordinary tax rate on the sale or exchange of Bitcoin held as a tangible asset--say you were paid in it.\nSimilarly, if your business, or part of your business, mines and trades Bitcoin, you'll be liable for self-employment taxes on earnings.""]"
56231,http://www.equities.com/editors-desk/currencies-forex/irs-declares-bitcoin-property-likely-ending-currency-bid,business,"['In the thick of tax season, on Mar 25 the Internal Revenue Service finally weighed in on the du jour speculative investment bitcoin, declaring the digital “currency” is not a currency at all, but rather a property, and is thus subject to capital gains taxes.\n\nThis classification is fairly close to the other major economic power’s definition of bitcoin. China famously outlawed bitcoin for financial transactions, saying it was not a real currency, calling it instead a “special virtual commodity” that its citizens could invest in at their own risk. Russia similarly dismissed bitcoin as currency, saying the ruble is the only currency of Russia and bitcoin is a speculative commodity, or “money substitute.” Sweden took the most unusual approach, classifying bitcoin as “electronic art,” and thus putting it into the same class as a painting, while reinforcing the idea that virtual money is not money at all, but property.\n\nIn the US, even bitcoin’s most ardent proponents realize that getting it classified as a currency is a fantasy. When filing with the SEC to set up the first bitcoin ETF, the Winklevoss Twins called bitcoin a “digital commodity,” to be treated like gold made of ones and zeroes.\n\nAll this adds up to an unfortunate trade-off. Despite its decentralized nature, Bitcoin is increasingly being rigidly defined by the major governments of the world. And that rigid definition puts it squarely in the realm of assets. Assets that, like a stock or a commodity or even a cellar full of fine wines, are subject to federal taxes.\n\nIn short, this means that every time a person buys or sells bitcoins, they’re subject to the same taxes a person would who sold stock, or houses, or any other asset wherein they made a profit. It also means that exchanges based in the US that deal in bitcoin will be subject to the same restrictions as any other asset market.\n\nThe bitcoin evangelist-vaunted “zero transaction fees” on goods and services will become a moot point, as income generated via bitcoin will be subject to the same type of fees as if a real estate broker took in a house on trade. That is, the difference in value will be subject to capital gains taxes, which can amount to up to 20 percent.\n\nThis is especially problematic for an asset with a built-in deflationary bias. A person who attempts to spend a bitcoin that has appreciated in value will now be expected to calculate the profit they incurred sitting on that bitcoin (between purchase and spending) and report it to the IRS. It’s not hard to see this means bitcoins will be hoarded more than they already are, feeding further into itsstatus as a purely speculative ploy with no real world transaction feasibility.\n\nWhat this doesn’t mean is that bitcoin will be going the way of the dodo anytime soon. Like any hyped investment - be it gold, real estate in Florida, or shares of Tesla Motors (TSLA) - as long as the die-hards believe enough, the asset will have value. No value as a currency, to be sure, but value nonetheless.\n\nDISCLOSURE: The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors, and do not represent the views of equities.com.

But the announcement also served as a reminder that new technologies often can’t avoid being subject to the old rules for long. “In a notice, the IRS said that it generally would treat bitcoin held by investors much like stock or other intangible property. If the virtual currency is held for investment, any gains would be treated as capital gains, meaning they could be subject to lower tax rates. “The top long-term capital-gains tax rate is 20%, while the top ordinary income-tax rate is 39.6%, although add-on taxes often make both rates somewhat higher. But as capital investments, loss deductions from bitcoin often would be limited, whereas currency losses can be easier to deduct up front.”\n\nBloomberg explains that this brings clarity to investors who have been buying bitcoins for years. The IRS, one tax law expert said, is trying to avoid the “creation of an electronic black market.”\n\nThe news service explains the rule like this: “Under the ruling, purchasing a $2 cup of coffee with bitcoins bought for $1 would trigger $1 in capital gains for the coffee drinker and $2 of income for the coffee shop.”\n\nAs NPR’s Emily Siner reported, bitcoin has a checkered history since its inception in 2008.

Obama urged Russia to ""move back"" its troops from the Ukrainian border, and to ""begin negotiations directly with the Ukrainian government, as well as the international community."" According to Pelley\'s summary of the interview on Friday, Obama wasn\'t specific about America\'s next steps if Putin doesn\'t pull back, except for that the U.S. and the international community would impose more sanctions.\n\nThe network aired Obama\'s responses to two questions about the situation in Ukraine. First, Pelley asked the president to outline ""what are you seeing on the Ukrainian border that worries you?"" based on his most recent intelligence briefing. Obama replied that ""this is not something that would be just in my briefing,"" adding that ""you\'ve seen a range of — troops massing along that border — under the guise of military exercises. But these are not what Russia would normally be doing."" He added that the exercises could either be intended to ""intimidate Ukraine,"" or a sign that the country has ""additional plans.""\n\nThen, the pair launched into a discussion of Putin himself. Here\'s an excerpt of the transcript provided by CBS:\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: What is Vladimir Putin after? PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, (SIGHING) you know, it-- if you take him at his word, then-- SCOTT PELLEY: Can you? PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, on this-- I think he\'s been-- willing to show-- a deeply-- held grievance about what he considers to be the loss of the Soviet Union. You would have thought that-- after-- a coupla decades that there\'d be an awareness on the part of any Russian leader that-- the path forward is not-- to revert back to the kinds of-- practices that-- you know, were so prevalent during the Cold War, but in fact-- to move forward-- with-- further integration with the world-- economy and-- and to be a responsible international citizen.\n\nObama added that Putin has ""said that he considers the breakup of the Soviet Union to be tragic,"" adding:\n\n""I think there\'s a strong sense of Russian nationalism-- and-- a sense-- that-- somehow the West has-- taken advantage of-- Russia in the past. You know, he\'s A bit-- and that he wants to in some fashion-- you know-- reverse that or make up for that.\n\nObama added that he believes Putin may be ""misreading"" the West, and that ""he\'s certainly misreading American foreign policy."" The U.S. has ""no interest"" in ""Ukraine beyond letting the Ukrainian people make their own decisions about their own lives,"" he added, with the implication that Russia is acting under a different assumption. He said:\n\nAnd it is true that we reject the notion that there is-- a sphere-- of influence-- along the Russian border that then justifies Russia-- invading other countries. Certainly they\'re gonna have influence because of trade and tradition and language and heritage-- with Ukraine. Everybody acknowledges that. But there\'s a difference between that and sending in troops-- and-- because you\'re bigger and stronger-- taking a piece of the country. That is not how-- international-- law and international norms are observed in the 21st century.\n\nObama and Pelley, speaking in the Vatican City at about 3 a.m. ET, also discussed the president\'s visit with the Pope. Obama and Pope Francis had a nearly 50-minute conversation on Thursday, during which the pair discussed immigration and a handful of other issues:\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, he-- he-- you know, he is-- he is a wonderful man. Obviously you get a very brief impression. We had a conversation of 45 minutes, although I\'ve-- I\'ve admired him-- from afar since-- since he became pope. I think-- he-- projects the kind of humility-- and kindness that is consistent with-- my understanding at least of-- of Jesus\' teachings. He seems to have-- a good sense of humor.\n\n\n\nI think that his-- his-- simplicity and his-- belief-- in-- in the power of-- the spiritual over the material-- reflects itself in-- in-- everything that-- he-- he says and does. And-- I suspect-- my sense is, is that he\'s-- a little bit uncomfortable with all the trappings-- of-- of-- of being pope.\n\n\n\nSCOTT PELLEY: Embarrassed by them?\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, he-- you know, that-- that-- that-- that\'s not his style.

56252,http://hotair.com/archives/2014/03/28/obama-to-putin-pull-back-from-ukraine-border/,business,"['Somewhat belatedly, President Obama has called on Vladimir Putin to pull back his troops from the Russian-Ukraine border, where 80,000 have massed for several weeks in apparent preparation to enter eastern Ukraine. Also somewhat belatedly, Obama has begun taking Putin at his word on the loss of the Soviet Union:\n\nPresident Obama, in an interview in Rome with “CBS Evening News” anchor and managing editor Scott Pelley, said Russia must take steps now to reduce tensions over Ukraine. Asked what he’s seeing on the Ukrainian border that worries him, Mr. Obama replied, “It’s well known and well acknowledged that you’ve seen a range of troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises. But these are not what Russia would normally be doing. And, you know, it may simply be an effort to intimidate Ukraine or it may be that they’ve got additional plans.” To resolve and de-escalate the situation right now, Mr. Obama said Russia needs “to move back those troops and to begin negotiations directly with the Ukrainian government, as well as the international community.”\n\nObama also tacitly admitted that reset buttons don’t change the nature of national leaders and their ambitions in the world:\n\nTurning to Vladimir Putin and what he wants, Mr. Obama said the Russian president has been “willing to show a deeply held grievance about what he considers to be the loss of the Soviet Union.” “You would have thought that after a couple of decades that there’d be an awareness on the part of any Russian leader that the path forward is not to revert back to the kinds of practices that, you know, were so prevalent during the Cold War but, in fact, to move forward with further integration with the world economy and to be a responsible international citizen.”\n\nYes — and you’d think that Obama would already know this, since Putin has been publicly airing that “deeply held grievance” for almost a decade. The Bush administration belatedly came to the conclusion that Putin was an imperialist after he started talking about the Soviet collapse as history’s greatest tragedy in 2005 and began recalculating the US relationship with Russia, especially in the area of missile defense in regard to Iran, whom Russia insisted on protecting (along with China). Obama insisted that the problems with Russia were just George W. Bush being a cowboy, which is how we ended up with the “reset button” and the retreat on missile defense, along with Obama’s promise to Dmitri Medvedev for more “flexibility” after the election.\n\nBy the way, remember when the cognoscenti said that the giant hammer and sickle floats at the Sochi Olympics opening ceremony were just a nod to “one of history’s pivotal experiments“? Welcome to another.\n\nEven after all that, Obama insisted that Putin is misreading the West:\n\n“What I have repeatedly said is that he may be entirely misreading the West,” Mr. Obama continued. “He’s certainly misreading American foreign policy. We have no interest in encircling Russia and we have no interest in Ukraine beyond letting the Ukrainian people make their own decisions about their own lives.”\n\nPutin seems to be reading the West just fine at the moment. Obama, on the other hand, still doesn’t appear to grasp Putin. The seizure of Crimea wasn’t to parry the West, nor will be the seizure of eastern Ukraine when it happens. It will be to reabsorb as many Russian enclaves back into a “Greater Russia” as Putin thinks he can without prompting a military response from the West.\n\nWhen might a military operation cross the border into eastern Ukraine? It may not happen today, but look for a Friday night/Saturday morning move that takes Western leaders off guard. That was the strategy in Crimea.', 'Somewhat belatedly, President Obama has called on Vladimir Putin to pull back his troops from the Russian-Ukraine border, where 80,000 have massed for several weeks in apparent preparation to enter eastern Ukraine.\nAsked what he’s seeing on the Ukrainian border that worries him, Mr. Obama replied, “It’s well known and well acknowledged that you’ve seen a range of troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises.\nEven after all that, Obama insisted that Putin is misreading the West:“What I have repeatedly said is that he may be entirely misreading the West,” Mr. Obama continued.\nThe seizure of Crimea wasn’t to parry the West, nor will be the seizure of eastern Ukraine when it happens.\nWhen might a military operation cross the border into eastern Ukraine?']"

Nobody wants to spell out the details of Russian military deployments on the eastern frontier of Ukraine.\n\nBut on one thing they are all clear. According to unattributed US sources, Russia has massed up to 30,000 troops on Ukraine\'s eastern frontier - and the key thing is they are arrayed and equipped to go on to the offensive at very short notice.\n\nMoscow is ready to implement a further military option in Ukraine, if and when President Vladimir Putin gives the green light.\n\nWestern military planners deal with capabilities, not so much intentions. The message from Nato then is that the Russian capability is there and ready. What is in Mr Putin\'s mind is impossible to determine.\n\nMany believe that the move into the Crimea was taken at short notice in response to circumstances, rather than it being part of a long-term plan.\n\nEvents on the ground, signals from the West, the extent of economic pressure (or lack of it), as well as Russia\'s basic assessment of its own strategic interests will all determine Moscow\'s next move.\n\nUS President Barack Obama has warned Russia to stop ""intimidating"" Ukraine and reduce troop numbers.\n\nIf this degenerated into serious fighting Russia should quickly be able to seize control of the air\n\nFor all the determination of the new Ukrainian government to resist any Russian military pressure the odds - at least in terms of any large-scale Russian movement - are stacked heavily against Kiev.\n\nRussian forces are reportedly concentrating to face south-eastern Ukraine and Nato clearly fears a major punch westwards towards the city of Donetsk that potentially could seek to sever the southern quarter of the country.\n\nNato\'s Supreme Allied Commander, Gen Philip Breedlove, has warned that Russian troops could advance all the way across Ukraine to link up with Russia\'s forces in the breakaway Moldovan enclave of Trans-Dniester.\n\nWestern assessments are that the military units that Russia has in the field are capable of mounting this kind of operation.\n\nDetails of Russian deployments may be sketchy, but Nato planners will clearly be looking at the nature of the units deployed, their dispositions in the field, the extent to which logistical support equipment is in place to move forward supplies, and so on.\n\nSocial media sites have shown Russian tank units moving up on trains and assault helicopter units being deployed in the field. However, as so often with this type of material, one must be cautious when confirming that it is actually taken at the time and locations shown.\n\nWhile the invasion of Georgia in 2008 showed up some significant shortcomings in Russia\'s land forces, they are more than a match for Ukraine\'s cash-starved military.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Putin congratulated Russian troops on their takeover of Crimea\n\nIf this degenerated into serious fighting Russia should quickly be able to seize control of the air. It can dominate the Black Sea and potentially could mount amphibious operations on the Ukrainian coast.\n\nThat is the potential military playbook. But what is Mr Putin really up to? Clearly a largely bloodless advance into Ukraine may have its attractions.\n\nBut the other possibility - of Ukrainians and Russians shedding each others\' blood - is much less palatable to the Kremlin.\n\nA major incursion could also prompt some kind of counter-Russian insurgency with the possibility of hardening linguistic and national divisions.\n\nThe real strategic question for Russia is the fate of Ukraine. Will it be a buffer between Russia and the West in both physical and political terms or will it drift into the European Union and Nato camp?\n\nThe latter is unacceptable for Mr Putin. Presidential elections are due in Ukraine in May with all sorts of uncertainties about the country\'s future constitutional arrangements.\n\nRussia has two ways in which to influence the political process. It can seek to subvert and undermine from within.\n\nWestern diplomats believe that Russia has sent significant numbers of people over the border into eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian demonstrations have been ""turned on and off"" seemingly at will.\n\nIt also has the looming threat of military intervention. Indeed because its troops are close to their regular training grounds they can probably be kept at a high-level of alert for a significant time.\n\nAll of this, in Mr Putin\'s view, should concentrate minds in Kiev nicely.', 'Image copyright AP Image caption Russia\'s military has a 25,000-strong force in Crimea, annexed by Moscow earlier this monthNato military spokesmen are tight-lipped.\nNobody wants to spell out the details of Russian military deployments on the eastern frontier of Ukraine.\nMoscow is ready to implement a further military option in Ukraine, if and when President Vladimir Putin gives the green light.\nWestern assessments are that the military units that Russia has in the field are capable of mounting this kind of operation.\nWestern diplomats believe that Russia has sent significant numbers of people over the border into eastern Ukraine where pro-Russian demonstrations have been ""turned on and off"" seemingly at will.']"

Its Russia versus the US again, the west versus the east, at least that’s how the instant pundits of global affairs would have us believe.On Thursday, Ukraine became the touchstone for 193 countries to declare where their hearts lie. A resolution in the UN general assembly declaring Russia’s annexation of Crimea to be illegal was put to vote — more countries ended up on the western side.But even more significant, a massive 58 countries abstained — that’s the new UN equivalent of staying “non-aligned”.In this club fall three big guys — India, China and Brazil. As part of BRICS these countries last week declared in a joint statement that they did not want sanctions and counter-sanctions and a political dialogue was the best answer. But all three countries have strong political and economic ties with the US, unlike Russia. Therefore, walking a thin line, all three countries stayed out of the race.Interestingly, on the abstention sheet is Israel, US’ closest ally. Israel has been livid with Obama on the nuclear deal with Iran. Iran, which considers the US a “great Satan” also abstained — Russia is Iran’s greatest ally. Maldives, where the US has been trying to set up a military base, voted on the side of the US, something India should think about.The general assembly resolution is not binding, but it’s a strong statement from the international community. The resolution says under the UN charter all states must refrain ""from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, and to settle their international disputes by peaceful means."" It reaffirmed the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which is a slap on Russia’s recent actions.India and China have deep reservations on sovereignty and territorial integrity and in the past have not hesitated to slam US for Libya, Syria etc. With Russia doing exactly the same thing, the dilemma in the developing world is acute.A similarly worded resolution died in the UN Security Council because Russia has a veto there.

introduce new punitive measures should Moscow stay “on its current course.”Instead, he set out to simultaneously reassure Europe of Washington’s partnership and “unwavering commitment to the NATO alliance and to defending the territorial integrity of alliance members” while also maintaining pressure on the Moscow, said William Tobey, a defense policy and arms-control expert.""I think the

Putin has reserved the right to send troops into Ukraine, which is home to a large population of Russian-speakers in the east.\n\nPutin praised Russian troops for “avoiding bloodshed” in Crimea, whose largely ethnic Russian citizens overwhelmingly voted to join Russia in a March 16 referendum dismissed in the West as illegal.\n\nSpeaking to Ukrainian servicemen who chose to swap sides and swear allegiance to Russia, Putin hinted they would be well rewarded by pointing out that Russian servicemen earned some four times more than their Ukrainian counterparts.\n\nUkraine’s former navy chief, Rear Admiral Denys Berezovsky, has been handed the deputy command of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet after his defection.\n\n“The change in state symbols on all ships and in all divisions that have sided with the Russian army has been completed,” Shoigu told Putin.\n\nHe said warships, war planes and other hardware seized from troops loyal to Kiev will be returned to Ukraine, which could help Russia avoid a potentially costly legal battle in international arbitration courts.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry also said Moscow would move to annul its lease agreement with Kiev that allowed it to base its Black Sea Fleet on the peninsula.\n\nTHREATS FROM THE WEST\n\nDespite signs that tensions with the West may be cooling as a status quo takes shape in Crimea, Malevany warned Putin at Friday’s meeting that Moscow faces growing threats from the United States and its allies, who are trying to weaken Russia’s influence on Ukraine.\n\n“There has been a sharp increase in external threats to the state,” he said. “The lawful desire of the peoples of Crimea and eastern Ukrainian regions is causing hysteria in the United States and its allies.”\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that Russia’s troop buildup near Ukraine’s eastern border may be more than just an effort to intimidate Ukraine and urged Moscow to pull forces back to ease tension.\n\nPutin has received permission from parliament to send the armed forces into Ukraine if necessary, raising concerns he could cite alleged threats to Russian-speakers in eastern regions as grounds for intervention there.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry has fuelled such concerns with near daily reports that ethnic Russians were being targeted.\n\n“Total ignorance of the interests of Russian-speaking residents of Ukraine is now nothing new but rather a permanent reality,” it said on Friday.\n\nIt called on international organisations to pay attention to what it called severe violations of the rights of minorities by Ukraine’s pro-Western interim government.

President Barack Obama speaks during a joint press conference with Italian Premier Matteo Renzi at Villa Madama on March 27, 2014 in Rome, Italy. (credit: Elisabetta Villa/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — President Barack Obama is calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to move his troops back from Ukraine’s eastern border.\n\nSpeaking to CBS News, Obama warned that Russia could have “additional plans” amassing troops along the Ukraine-Russia border.\n\n“It’s well known and well acknowledged that you’ve seen a range of troops massing along that border under the guise of military exercises,” Obama told CBS News. “But these are not what Russia would normally be doing. And, you know, it may simply be an effort to intimidate Ukraine or it may be that they’ve got additional plans.”\n\nUkrainian officials claim that 100,000 Russian troops have amassed along the border, according to AFP.\n\nObama called on Putin to start talks with the new Ukrainian government.\n\nRussia needs “to move back those troops and to begin negotiations directly with the Ukrainian government, as well as the international community.”\n\nObama hinted that Putin might be holding grievances “about what he considers to be the loss of the Soviet Union.”\n\n“There’s a strong sense of Russian nationalism and a sense that somehow the West has taken advantage of Russia in the past and that he wants to, in some fashion, reverse that or make up for that,” Obama said, adding that Putin’s path forward is not to revert back to Cold War tactics.\n\nObama stated that Putin “may be entirely misreading the West.”\n\n“He’s certainly misreading American foreign policy,” Obama told CBS News. “We have no interest in encircling Russia and we have no interest in Ukraine beyond letting the Ukrainian people make their own decisions about their own lives.”\n\nObama added: “It is true that we reject the notion that there is a sphere of influence along the Russian border that then justifies Russia invading other countries. Certainly they’re going to have influence because of trade and tradition and language and heritage with Ukraine. Everybody acknowledges that.”\n\nObama did not tell CBS News what the U.S. would specifically do if Russia did push further into Ukraine, but did say that they would face more economic sanctions.\n\nObama is getting low marks among Americans for his handling of the crisis, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll.\n\nMajorities say they dislike Obama’s handling of the Ukraine situation (57 percent) and his interactions with Russia (54 percent).\n\nAlmost half of those polled say they support imposing tougher sanctions if Russia pushes into new regions or other countries; only 14 percent are opposed. That backs up threats from Obama and Western allies to target Russia’s economy with damaging sanctions if Putin goes further.\n\nAbout a third of those surveyed said they oppose giving monetary aid to nations targeted by Russia. Only about 20 percent approve of financial support, while the biggest share is neutral. This week Congress is considering $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine sought by Obama.\n\nThe idea of lending any type of military support to Ukraine is unpopular, the poll says. Obama has said there are no plans to use military force to dislodge Russia from the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n(TM and © Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

We have no interest in circling Russia and we have no interest in Ukraine beyond letting Ukrainian people make their own decisions about their own lives.”\n\nObama acknowledged that Moscow has interests in Ukraine and those interests should be maintained. “There’s a difference between that and sending in troops, and because you’re bigger and stronger, taking a piece of the country,” Obama concluded.\n\nPelley concluded by noting that there is some concern that NATO is a “hollowed out force” and that Europe has a fraction of the defenses available to it that it did in before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nWatch teh clip below via CBS News:\n\n[Photo via screen grab ]\n\n— —\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter\n\nHave a tip we should know?

That’s the kind of thinking that should have ended with the Cold War.”\n\n— Barack Obama, March 24\n\nWASHINGTON — Should. Lovely sentiment. As lovely as what Obama said five years ago to the United Nations: “No one nation can or should try to dominate another nation.”\n\nThat’s the kind of sentiment you expect from a Miss America contestant asked to name her fondest wish, not from the leader of the free world explaining his foreign policy.\n\nThe East Europeans know they inhabit the battleground between the West and a Russia that wants to return them to its sphere of influence. Ukrainians see tens of thousands of Russian troops across their border and know they are looking down the barrel of quite a zero-sum game.\n\nObama thinks otherwise. He says that Vladimir Putin’s kind of neo-imperialist thinking is a relic of the past — and advises Putin to transcend the Cold War.\n\nGood God. Putin hasn’t transcended the Russian revolution. Did no one give Obama a copy of Putin’s speech last week upon the annexation of Crimea? Putin railed not only at Russia’s loss of empire in the 1990s. He went back to the 1920s: “After the revolution, the Bolsheviks … may God judge them, added large sections of the historical South of Russia to the Republic of Ukraine.” Putin was referring not to Crimea but to his next potential target: Kharkiv and Donetsk and the rest of southeastern Ukraine.\n\nPutin’s irredentist grievances go very deep. Obama seems unable to fathom them. Asked whether he’d misjudged Russia, whether it really is our greatest geopolitical foe, he disdainfully replied that Russia is nothing but “a regional power” acting “out of weakness.”\n\nWhere does one begin? Hitler’s Germany and Tojo’s Japan were also regional powers, yet managed to leave behind at least 50 million dead. And yes, Russia should be no match for the American superpower. Yet under this president, Russia has run rings around America, from the attempted ingratiation of the “reset” to America’s empty threats of “consequences” were Russia to annex Crimea.\n\nAnnex Crimea it did. For which the “consequences” have been risible. Numberless 19th- and 20th-century European soldiers died for Crimea. Putin conquered it in a swift and stealthy campaign that took three weeks and cost his forces not a sprained ankle. That’s “weakness”?\n\nIndeed, Obama’s dismissal of Russia as a regional power makes his own leadership of the one superpower all the more embarrassing. For seven decades since the Japanese surrender, our role under 11 presidents had been as offshore balancer protecting smaller allies from potential regional hegemons.\n\nWhat are the allies thinking now? Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and other Pacific Rim friends are wondering where this America will be as China expands its reach and claims. The Gulf states are near panic as they see America playacting nuclear negotiations with Iran that, at best, will leave their mortal Shiite enemy just weeks away from the bomb.\n\nAmerica never sought the role that history gave it after World War II to bear unbidden burdens “to assure the survival and the success of liberty,” as described by John Kennedy. We have an appropriate aversion to the stark fact that the alternative to U.S. leadership is either global chaos or dominance by the likes of China, Russia and Iran.\n\nBut Obama doesn’t even seem to recognize this truth. In his major Brussels address Wednesday, the very day Russia seized the last Ukrainian naval vessel in Crimea, Obama made vague references to further measures should Russia march deeper into Ukraine, while still emphasizing the centrality of international law, international norms and international institutions like the United Nations.\n\nSuch fanciful thinking will leave our allies with two choices: bend a knee — or arm to the teeth. Either acquiesce to the regional bully or gird your loins, i.e., go nuclear. As surely will the Gulf states. As will, in time, Japan and South Korea.\n\nEven Ukrainians express regret at having given up their nukes in return for paper guarantees of territorial integrity. The 1994 Budapest Memorandum was ahead of its time — the perfect example of the kind of advanced 21st-century thinking so cherished by our president. Perhaps the captain of that last Ukrainian vessel should have waved the document at the Russian fleet that took his ship.\n\nCharles Krauthammer is a Washington Post columnist.

The bad pro-Russian residents of Crimea are not allowed to, right?\n\n“Together, we’ve condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and rejected the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum.”\n\nThat's right. Referendum = bad. Firebombs = good.\n\nWell, Obama says Russia invaded Ukraine while the US and the EU stayed at arm's length and allowed things to settle down.\n\n“Make no mistake, neither the United States nor Europe has any interest in controlling Ukraine.”\n\nAnd they absolutely didn't send troves of officials to Kiev to cheer up anti-government protesters. And when Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland discussed with Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt who should and who shouldn’t be in the next Ukrainian government, that was merely small talk between two observing diplomats.\n\nWhen it comes to invasions, President Obama has a lesson or two to teach Russians.\n\n“We did not claim or annex Iraq’s territory. We did not grab its resources for our own gain. Instead, we ended our war and left Iraq to its people in a fully sovereign Iraqi state that can make decisions about its own future.“\n\nThis sovereign nation has only token sovereignty over Kurd territories in the north. Terrorists roam free in some rural areas and want to carve an Islamist state of it. And deaths from car bombs are more frequent then deaths from car accidents. A decade of statecraft later, at least 7,800 civilians and 1,000 troops killed in 2013 alone. Mission accomplished.\n\nObama mentioned another interventionist success story in his speech, that of Kosovo.\n\n“NATO only intervened after the people of Kosovo were systematically brutalized and killed for years.”\n\nGood point. Of course the alliance didn't bother to get a UN Security Council mandate and bombed the Serbian capital, killing hundreds of civilians in the process, in violation of international law. The same law which Obama accuses Russia of violating with Crimea. But that was even before Bush Jr., so who cares?\n\n“Kosovo only left Serbia after a referendum was organized – not outside the boundaries of international law but in careful cooperation with the United Nations, and with Kosovo’s neighbors.”\n\nThat’s Mr. Obama’s version. What really happened was that Kosovo’s parliament unilaterally declared independence from Serbia and later adopted a constitution on Feb. 15, 2008. On the same day, the US and four European states recognized Kosovo as an independent country.\n\n\n\nAh, right, the referendum. Maybe President Obama meant that 1991 referendum (deemed 'illegal' by Serbia), whose results were recognized by only one country, Albania?\n\n“We are confronted with the belief among some that bigger nations can bully smaller ones to get their way — that recycled maxim that might somehow makes right.”\n\nWorld's biggest bully preaching peace and love. And its flying killing robots are the messengers. And guards in secret CIA prisons are the keepers.

The beluga was wearing a harness that looked like it could carry a camera, the Guardian reports, and “Equipment of St. Petersburg"" was stamped on the inside.\n\n\n\nMarine experts have suggested that the whale was part of a Russian military program that trains cetaceans for operations. It may sound strange, but it\'s not unheard of.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Russian state television reported that the country was experimenting with using beluga whales, bottlenose dolphins, and several species of seals to guard entrances to naval bases, assist divers, and possibly kill strangers who entered their territory. Belugas were dropped from the program, however, when it became clear that swimming for long periods in cold, polar waters made the whales sick.\n\n\n\nAnd when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, it took over a Ukrainian military unit that included bottlenose dolphins, according to news reports. The Ukranian ""combat dolphins,"" based in Sevastopol, were trained to search for and tag underwater mines or unwanted swimmers attempting to access restricted waterways, says RIA Novosti.\n\n\n\nUsing marine mammals for military purposes isn\'t restricted to Russia—the U.S. Navy has had a similar program since the 1960s. The ability of these animals to detect and find targets at depth or in murky water is something technology can\'t duplicate yet but which militaries find very valuable.\n\nThe U.S. Navy trains its marine mammals—including California sea lions and bottlenose dolphins—to find and retrieve equipment lost at sea and to identify intruders swimming into restricted areas. The dolphins are also used to detect mines that are either buried in the seafloor or floating in the water, tethered to an anchor.\n\nNothing like the real thing\n\nView Images A beluga whale with the U.S. Navy marks a training target. PHOTOGRAPH BY U.S. NAVY\n\n""[Bottlenose dolphins] are better than any machine as far as detecting mines,"" says Paul Nachtigall, head of the marine mammal research program at the University of Hawaii in Kane\'ohe Bay. They can also do it much faster than a machine can.\n\nDolphins can be especially effective close to shore, where crashing surf and ship traffic generate a lot of noise, Nachtigall says. Mechanical systems can be overwhelmed by all the competing signals, but not dolphins.\n\nIt\'s because their sonar is so finely tuned, he explains. Dolphins, and relatives like killer whales, send out a series of sounds that bounce off of objects in the surrounding environment. The mammals pick up the return echoes and form an acoustic picture of their environment, an ability known as echolocation.\n\nExperiments Nachtigall conducted in the mid-1990s with a resident bottlenose dolphin named BJ demonstrated this sensitive ability. Nachtigall asked BJ to distinguish between metal cylinders made of either stainless steel, brass, or aluminum. Even though he buried the four inch-long objects under two feet of mud, BJ passed with flying colors.\n\nResearchers still don\'t know how dolphins do this, Nachtigall says. But it\'s a topic that has captured the attention of military and civilian scientists for decades.\n\nOut of place\n\nCalifornia sea lions, while they don\'t possess sonar capabilities, have excellent eyesight. ""They\'re really good at finding things that are out of place,"" such as lost equipment, says Nachtigall.\n\nThe U.S. Navy uses them to find and retrieve unarmed test ordnance like practice mines. Handlers give a sea lion an attachment system it can hold in its mouth and send the mammal overboard. Once the animal finds its target, it clamps the device to it and handlers in a boat at the surface can bring the object in.\n\nA 2011 media demonstration in San Diego Bay, California, featured a former U.S. Navy SEAL attempting to infiltrate the harbor with an unarmed mine. The Navy deployed dolphins and sea lions to patrol the area, and both caught the diver on every one of his five attempts. The sea lion even managed to attach a clamp to the diver\'s leg, and handlers on the surface reeled him in like a fish.\n\nBoth California sea lions and bottlenose dolphins are fairly hardy, smart, and very trainable, says Nachtigall. Sea lions also have the advantage of being amphibious. That\'s why the U.S. Navy ended up using them instead of other marine mammals like false killer whales or belugas, which they also initially looked at.

Yet, the document barely scored the required number of votes for approval. The U.S., Europe and their allies predictably voted ""for"", whereas eleven countries, including Russia, Armenia, Belarus and South American countries voted ""against"".\n\nAP photo\n\nIn fact, the UN General Assembly resolution is only a recommendation. Each country decides for itself whether it should execute the resolution or not. However, the Ukrainian Acting Minister, who represented the document, was eager to do this for everyone. He finished his speech with an ultimatum: those who did not vote for the resolution, jeopardized the UN Charter.\n\nRussia\'s permanent representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, who was next to take the podium, explained to representatives of 193 countries, why Russia was opposed to the explicitly politicized document:\n\n""In Kiev, legitimate power ceased to exist. Violence has become a norm of political life. In the Verkhovna Rada, violence targets the parties that make the parliamentary majority that supported Yanukovych. As a result, the Rada was redrawn, and instead of the government of national unity, the so-called ""government of the winners"" appeared. Those who committed the armed coup in Ukraine, call the shots in that government - radical nationalists, who profess, by definition of the European Parliament, racist, anti-Semitic, xenophobic views, who despise all Russian, who do not conceal that their ideological forefathers are Ukrainian Nazi collaborators.""\n\nThe list of official co-authors of the resolution, which does not recognize the results of the Crimean referendum, are, in addition to Ukraine, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Costa Rica. The U.S. is not on the list, and this is clearly a political move. Many in the room were fed up with constant attempts of the United States to take direct participation in global and regional processes.\n\nU.S. ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, said: ""This resolution affirms only one issue - our commitment to the sovereignty and political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Adopting the document, we expressed a clear fundamental support to the preservation of the borders of this country.""\n\nSamantha Power did not say anything on the Kosovo precedent, for which Washington receives criticism, but she had to listen to representatives of Latin America, where the US does not feel shy to violate principles of sovereignty and political independence.\n\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bvoting for the anti-Russian resolution did not find support with many countries. Among them, there are powerful regional leaders, including India, Brazil, Egypt, Argentina and China. All of them did not sign the document.\n\nAs a result, the voting was as follows : 100 - ""for"", 11 - ""against"", 58 abstained and 24 countries did not participate in the voting. Such a result does not account for qualified majority.\n\nAll EU member states and candidate countries, except Serbia, supported the resolution, like good disciples. Together with Bosnia, Serbia did not participate in the vote, along with representatives of 22 other countries, including, for example, Israel, Iran, United Arab Emirates, and several CIS countries. ""Against"" were Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, North Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.\n\nAs for abstainers, there were many representatives of Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa. The latter usually vote the way Russia does, but this case was a special one. Russian Permanent Representative Vitaly Churkin explained that there was pressure put on those who disagreed.\n\n""When preparing for this meeting, I visited several regional groups in the UN. Many countries complained that they were subjected to enormous pressure from Western powers to ensure that they vote to support the resolution. Probably, this pressure tactic, which our Western colleagues use, has produced a result, and some countries voted reluctantly. They told us about it, complaining of the pressure that they experienced. Nevertheless, I think the result is quite good for us. We have won certain moral and political victory,"" said the Russian envoy to the UN.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian crisis will be the main topic for discussion at the next meeting of the UN Security Council. The ninth session will be held on Friday. As expected, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon will take part in the meeting.

That\'s the kind of thinking that should have ended with the Cold War.""\n\n- Barack Obama, March 24\n\nShould. Lovely sentiment. As lovely as what Obama said five years ago to the United Nations: ""No one nation can or should try to dominate another nation.""\n\nThat\'s the kind of sentiment you expect from a Miss America contestant asked to name her fondest wish, not from the leader of the free world explaining his foreign policy.\n\nThe East Europeans know they inhabit the battleground between the West and a Russia that wants to return them to its sphere of influence. Ukrainians see tens of thousands of Russian troops across their border and know they are looking down the barrel of quite a zero-sum game.\n\nObama thinks otherwise. He says that Vladimir Putin\'s kind of neo-imperialist thinking is a relic of the past - and advises Putin to transcend the Cold War.\n\nGood God. Putin hasn\'t transcended the Russian revolution. Did no one give Obama a copy of Putin\'s speech last week upon the annexation of Crimea? Putin railed not only at Russia\'s loss of empire in the 1990s. He went back to the 1920s: ""After the revolution, the Bolsheviks … may God judge them, added large sections of the historical South of Russia to the Republic of Ukraine."" Putin was referring not to Crimea (which came two sentences later) but to his next potential target: Kharkiv and Donetsk and the rest of southeastern Ukraine.\n\nPutin\'s irredentist grievances go very deep. Obama seems unable to fathom them. Asked whether he\'d misjudged Russia, whether it really is our greatest geopolitical foe, he disdainfully replied that Russia is nothing but ""a regional power"" acting ""out of weakness.""\n\nWhere does one begin? Hitler\'s Germany and Tojo\'s Japan were also regional powers, yet managed to leave behind at least 50 million dead. And yes, Russia should be no match for the American superpower. Yet under this president, Russia has run rings around America, from the attempted ingratiation of the ""reset"" to America\'s empty threats of ""consequences"" were Russia to annex Crimea.\n\nAnnex Crimea it did. For which the ""consequences"" have been risible. Numberless 19th- and 20th-century European soldiers died for Crimea. Putin conquered it in a swift and stealthy campaign that took three weeks and cost his forces not a sprained ankle. That\'s ""weakness""?\n\nIndeed, Obama\'s dismissal of Russia as a regional power makes his own leadership of the one superpower all the more embarrassing. For seven decades since the Japanese surrender, our role under 11 presidents had been as offshore balancer protecting smaller allies from potential regional hegemons.\n\nWhat are the allies thinking now? Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and other Pacific Rim friends are wondering where this America will be as China expands its reach and claims. The Gulf states are near panic as they see America playacting nuclear negotiations with Iran that, at best, will leave their mortal Shiite enemy just weeks away from the bomb.\n\nAmerica never sought the role that history gave it after World War II to bear unbidden burdens ""to assure the survival and the success of liberty,"" as movingly described by John Kennedy. We have an appropriate aversion to the stark fact that the alternative to U.S. leadership is either global chaos or dominance by the likes of China, Russia and Iran.\n\nBut Obama doesn\'t even seem to recognize this truth. In his major Brussels address Wednesday, the very day Russia seized the last Ukrainian naval vessel in Crimea, Obama made vague references to further measures should Russia march deeper into Ukraine, while still emphasizing the centrality of international law, international norms and international institutions like the United Nations.\n\nSuch fanciful thinking will leave our allies with two choices: Bend a knee, or arm to the teeth. Either acquiesce to the regional bully or gird your loins - i.e., go nuclear. As surely will the Gulf states. As will, in time, Japan and South Korea.\n\nEven Ukrainians are expressing regret at having given up their nukes in return for paper guarantees of territorial integrity. The 1994 Budapest Memorandum was ahead of its time - the perfect example of the kind of advanced 21st-century thinking so cherished by our president. Perhaps the captain of that last Ukrainian vessel should have waved the document at the Russian fleet that took his ship.\n\nCharles Krauthammer’s email address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com.', 'OpinionKrauthammer: Obama\'s misjudgment of Putin carries big risks Charles Krauthammer says the role America plays in freedom\'s success may not be relished by our president, but the alternative is global disorder.\nThat\'s the kind of thinking that should have ended with the Cold War.""\nHe says that Vladimir Putin\'s kind of neo-imperialist thinking is a relic of the past - and advises Putin to transcend the Cold War.\nPutin conquered it in a swift and stealthy campaign that took three weeks and cost his forces not a sprained ankle.\nIndeed, Obama\'s dismissal of Russia as a regional power makes his own leadership of the one superpower all the more embarrassing.']"

But when looking more closely at the public\'s views on the Crimean situation, the negative attitude toward the president handling of the situation raises questions.\n\nCBS News poll: Most Americans say U.S. should not intervene in Ukraine crisis\n\nObama: Russian ""propaganda"" about Ukraine crisis is ""absurd""\n\nFifty-six percent of Americans approve of the sanctions enacted against Russia by the U.S. and other European countries, the first concrete action the Obama administration has taken in response the annexation. Nor does it seem most Americans think the Obama administration should take some other more aggressive steps - 65 percent of Americans do not think the U.S. should provide military aid and weapons to Ukraine. What\'s more, majorities of Americans think the situation in Crimea is both beyond the control of the U.S. (57 percent) and that the U.S. does not have responsibility to do something about it (61 percent). What, then, do Americans disapprove of, and why?\n\nAlthough Americans tend to pay less attention and have less knowledge of events overseas than domestic concerns, lack of knowledge does not seem to be the main factor. Sixty-nine percent of Americans have heard or read at least something about the situation between Russia and the Ukraine, including more than a third who say they have heard or read a lot (36 percent). More importantly, those who have heard or read a lot about the situation are more likely (56 percent) to disapprove of the president\'s handling of the situation than Americans overall (46 percent).\n\nNot surprisingly, partisanship probably plays a role. There is a clear break along party lines when it comes to how the president is handling the situation between Russia and Ukraine: 59 percent of Democrats approve of Mr. Obama\'s handling of the situation, while 69 percent of Republicans disapprove. But more independents also disapprove (48 percent) than approve (35 percent) of the president\'s handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine, so party identification is not the only factor.\n\nDisapproval of the president\'s handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine may also be a reflection of disapproval of his overall job performance. In the same poll, 50 percent of Americans said they disapprove of the job Barack Obama is doing as president, while just 43 percent approve. Americans have held a net negative rating of Mr. Obama\'s job performance since September of last year, and they similarly express a net negative view of his handling of the economy, health care, immigration, Afghanistan, and foreign policy in general.\n\nIn fact, the only measure in the most recent CBS News Poll that Americans approve of is his handling of terrorism (53 percent approve). Reaction to the president\'s handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine is likely part of this overall trend.\n\nBut there may be another factor as well: American pessimism about the scope of U.S. power and its standing in the world. Fifty-nine percent of Americans think the U.S. is less powerful as a world leader than it was 10 years ago, and the percentage that thinks that the United States\' image in the world has gotten better since Mr. Obama became president has been declining steadily - from 59 percent in April 2009 to just 32 percent today. This pessimism can perhaps be seen in Americans\' views of sanctions against Russia: while 56 percent approve of sanctions, 58 percent don\'t think those sanctions will be very effective.\n\nHow Americans view America\'s power as a world leader is directly related to how they feel about Russia and Ukraine: Most Americans who think that U.S. power has increased in the past year both approve of Mr. Obama\'s handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine (58 percent) and think the U.S. can do something about it (53 percent). In contrast, most Americans who think U.S. power has declined both highly disapprove of Mr. Obama\'s handling of the situation (63 percent) and think the situation is beyond the control of the U.S. (61 percent).\n\nFor many Americans, their disapproval of the president\'s handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine may not stem from a belief that he is unwilling to do more, but because they don\'t think that he is able to.', ""Nor does it seem most Americans think the Obama administration should take some other more aggressive steps - 65 percent of Americans do not think the U.S. should provide military aid and weapons to Ukraine.\nWhat, then, do Americans disapprove of, and why?\nDisapproval of the president's handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine may also be a reflection of disapproval of his overall job performance.\nIn fact, the only measure in the most recent CBS News Poll that Americans approve of is his handling of terrorism (53 percent approve).\nReaction to the president's handling of the situation between Russia and Ukraine is likely part of this overall trend.""]"

56337,http://blogs.reuters.com/ian-bremmer/2014/03/27/the-g7-and-the-limits-of-russias-political-isolation/,business,"['On Wednesday, President Barack Obama delivered the major address of his weeklong trip to Europe, focusing on the Russian incursions into Ukraine and the coordinated Western retaliation. “Together, we have isolated Russia politically, suspending it from the G8 nations,” Obama said. For annexing Crimea, Russia was punished with temporary exile from this coalition of advanced industrial democracies, a group of Western countries that collectively act on their shared values.\n\nThere is just one problem: Russia never shared these values, and the G7 has neither represented global interests nor driven the international agenda for quite some time.\n\nThere are a few reasons why that’s the case. Even among countries with similar values and political systems, it can be difficult to align interests, as we’ve seen with the varied Western response to Crimea. Second, as new players have emerged in recent decades, the global power balance has shifted, leaving the G7 representative of a smaller piece of the pie. Any organization that does not include China, for example, is not truly global.\n\nWhere we see global political coordination, it is largely ineffectual. Take the March 27 United Nations General Assembly resolution, a vote on the legitimacy of the Crimean referendum. At first glance, the result looks like an international rebuke of Russia’s behavior. One hundred countries voted in favor of Ukraine’s denouncement of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Only 11 countries voted against the resolution, including Russia, with its only support coming from neighbors it can bully (Armenia, Belarus) and rogue states with grudges against the established order (Cuba, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela).\n\nBut this rare example of global coordination comes with many asterisks. Powerful emerging players like China, Brazil and India were among the 58 countries that abstained from the vote, and many more of the 193-country assembly did not participate at all. Russia was not mentioned by name in the resolution. And the vote comes with no enforcement power or actionable outcome. It is purely symbolic, and not even legally binding like United Nations Security Council resolutions — where Russia enjoys veto power.\n\nIn order to get practical outcomes, the group of players must be more limited, and aligned. Even in Europe, many nations have been skittish about the recent sanctions. That’s because member states’ interests in Russia vary too widely. For example, with massive exposure to the Russian banking sector, Cyprus cannot afford the sting that sweeping sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy would have. Greece and Austria are reluctant to implement sanctions, since they receive a disproportionately high volume of Russian natural gas, compared to their European neighbors.\n\nThat is why, after Russia annexed Crimea, Europe’s sanctions were more muted than America’s. The Obama administration included a Russian bank and several oligarchs who are close with Putin; the Europeans stopped short of these steps. The Kremlin was aware of the distinction, instantly responding with reciprocal countermoves to American sanctions, but not to the Europeans.\n\nIt is no surprise that the joint statement threatening further sanctions came at a G7 level — it was limited enough to allow for aligned policy. It is clear that the G7 is sufficiently like-minded to exhibit true leadership and project its core values like human rights, democracy and rule of law. In Obama’s speech on Wednesday, he explained his view that “these ideals that we affirm are true. These ideals are universal.”\n\nBut while they may be universal for the United States, they are not for China, Russia or Saudi Arabia. These nations have conflicting ideals of their own that they won’t water down — and in today’s world, they are sufficiently powerful that the West cannot convince or force them to do so.\n\nIn this context, Western powers can either cling to their values within a global framework — with little success. Or they can cling to their values in a narrower coalition of the like-minded, although it’s much harder to bring about a global result.\n\nBut when it comes down to the choice of doing “global and ineffectual,” or “limited with coherent leadership,” the latter is the lesser of two evils. We need to learn that lesson, both in terms of how we organize coalitions of countries with aligned interests and ideals, and in terms of how we brace for global shocks.\n\nIt was aspirational to ever invite Russia into the G7. It is aspirational to expect global climate summits to achieve breakthroughs, or the G20 to operate cohesively. The consequences for continuing to try (and fail) to solve problems primarily through global political frameworks are growing larger. The sooner we acknowledge this and focus on more exclusive partnerships, the more effective we will be.\n\nPHOTOS: U.S. President Barack Obama (L) meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during the G8 Summit at Lough Erne in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland June 17, 2013.

He said the rushed referendum on Crimea\'s secession, watched over by Russian soldiers and in violation of Ukraine\'s Constitution, will never be recognized by the West.\n\nHis words echo a similar American challenge to China for recent violations of maritime law in claiming islands long owned by other countries. And on Monday, the United States condemned Egypt for a bizarre death sentence handed down hastily to 529 people for the murder of one policeman.\n\nThe theme of Obama\'s speech is apt for the times. Too often authoritarian regimes act outside international rules and even outside their own rules. When rules are written by the consent of a free people through democratic means, they cannot be lightly trampled. The same goes for international law set in place by a majority of nations.\n\nObama\'s speech included a rebuttal to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had cited U.S. military actions in Kosovo and Iraq as justifications for his annexation of Crimea.

Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi to move toward democratic rule of law while at the same time condemning the trials of protesters that are conducted in violation of international human rights law.\n\nWhile sanctions against Russia for its grab of Crimea may help, the West must also decide whether to now retreat in defending the global order.

That’s the kind of thinking that should have ended with the Cold War.” Barack Obama, March 24\n\nShould. Lovely sentiment. As lovely as what Obama said five years ago to the United Nations: “No one nation can or should try to dominate another nation.”\n\nThat’s the kind of sentiment you expect from a Miss America contestant asked to name her fondest wish, not from the leader of the free world explaining his foreign policy.\n\nThe East Europeans know they inhabit the battleground between the West and a Russia that wants to return them to its sphere of influence. Ukrainians see tens of thousands of Russian troops across their border and know they are looking down the barrel of quite a zero-sum game.\n\nObama thinks otherwise. He says that Vladimir Putin’s kind of neo-imperialist thinking is a relic of the past — and advises Putin to transcend the Cold War.\n\nGood God. Putin hasn’t transcended the Russian revolution. Did no one give Obama a copy of Putin’s speech last week upon the annexation of Crimea? Putin railed not only at Russia’s loss of empire in the 1990s. He went back to the 1920s: “After the revolution, the Bolsheviks ... may God judge them, added large sections of the historical South of Russia to the Republic of Ukraine.” Putin was referring not to Crimea (which came two sentences later) but to his next potential target: Kharkiv and Donetsk and the rest of southeastern Ukraine.\n\nPutin’s irredentist grievances go very deep. Obama seems unable to fathom them. Asked whether he’d misjudged Russia, whether it really is our greatest geopolitical foe, he disdainfully replied that Russia is nothing but “a regional power” acting “out of weakness.”\n\nWhere does one begin? Hitler’s Germany and Tojo’s Japan were also regional powers, yet managed to leave behind at least 50 million dead. And yes, Russia should be no match for the American superpower. Yet under this president, Russia has run rings around America, from the attempted ingratiation of the “reset” to America’s empty threats of “consequences” were Russia to annex Crimea.\n\nAnnex Crimea it did. For which the “consequences” have been risible. Numberless 19th- and 20th-century European soldiers died for Crimea. Putin conquered it in a swift and stealthy campaign that took three weeks and cost his forces not a sprained ankle. That’s “weakness?”\n\nIndeed, Obama’s dismissal of Russia as a regional power makes his own leadership of the one superpower all the more embarrassing. For seven decades since the Japanese surrender, our role under 11 presidents had been as offshore balancer protecting smaller allies from potential regional hegemons.\n\nWhat are the allies thinking now? Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and other Pacific Rim friends are wondering where this America will be as China expands its reach and claims. The Gulf states are near panic as they see America playacting nuclear negotiations with Iran that, at best, will leave their mortal Shi’ite enemy just weeks away from the bomb.\n\nAmerica never sought the role that history gave it after World War II to bear unbidden burdens “to assure the survival and the success of liberty,” as movingly described by John Kennedy. We have an appropriate aversion to the stark fact that the alternative to U.S. leadership is either global chaos or dominance by the likes of China, Russia and Iran.\n\nBut Obama doesn’t even seem to recognize this truth. In his major Brussels address Wednesday, the very day Russia seized the last Ukrainian naval vessel in Crimea, Obama made vague references to further measures should Russia march deeper into Ukraine, while still emphasizing the centrality of international law, international norms and international institutions like the United Nations.\n\nSuch fanciful thinking will leave our allies with two choices: bend a knee — or arm to the teeth. Either acquiesce to the regional bully or gird your loins, i.e., go nuclear. As surely will the Gulf states. As will, in time, Japan and South Korea.\n\nEven Ukrainians are expressing regret at having given up their nukes in return for paper guarantees of territorial integrity. The 1994 Budapest Memorandum was ahead of its time — the perfect example of the kind of advanced 21st-century thinking so cherished by our president. Perhaps the captain of that last Ukrainian vessel should have waved the document at the Russian fleet that took his ship.', 'That’s the kind of thinking that should have ended with the Cold War.” Barack Obama, March 24Should.\nHe says that Vladimir Putin’s kind of neo-imperialist thinking is a relic of the past — and advises Putin to transcend the Cold War.\nDid no one give Obama a copy of Putin’s speech last week upon the annexation of Crimea?\nPutin conquered it in a swift and stealthy campaign that took three weeks and cost his forces not a sprained ankle.\nThat’s “weakness?”Indeed, Obama’s dismissal of Russia as a regional power makes his own leadership of the one superpower all the more embarrassing.']"
56342,http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/\?fa=55120,business,"['When leaders from the G7 group of industrialized countries were sitting around the table at a summit in The Hague on March 24, it was just like the good old days. Everything seemed jovial and intimate, just as it was before Russia joined the club in 1998. But appearances can be deceiving, and any suggestions of a transatlantic reset are an illusion.\n\nIn the early 1990s, memories were still fresh of the Cold War, which had welded the Western world together. The United States was still in control of Europe’s security agenda, with its focus on NATO and how Europe could continue to serve America’s interests.\n\nBack then, neither the Iraq War nor the War on Terror had happened yet—two events that would deeply divide Americans and Europeans at the beginning of the new millennium. Nor did anybody foresee that within a few years, a U.S. president would announce that his country was shifting its attention to Asia.\n\nSo it really did seem like a throwback to earlier (though perhaps not better) times when U.S. President Barack Obama spoke in Brussels on March 26. He sought to reassure America’s allies of its security commitment to Europe and to stiffen the backbone of European leaders on the issue of sanctions against Russia.\n\nJudy Dempsey Dempsey is a nonresident senior fellow at Carnegie Europe and editor in chief of Strategic Europe. More > @Judy_Dempsey\n\nBut Russia’s recent annexation of Crimea will not bring back the old transatlantic alliance. If Americans believe for one moment that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will make the EU pull together in the long term, they are naive. And if Europeans believe that Americans will now return to Europe, they are mistaken.\n\nThe United States is now led by a post-1945 generation that has steadily lost interest in Europe. Younger Americans do not want to be bothered with the EU’s inability to think and act strategically. Above all, the Obama administration is marked by a deep sense of annoyance over the EU’s unwillingness to share the security burden or at least take care of its own security. It was a shame that Obama did not speak out forcefully in his Brussels speech about this deficit of the transatlantic relationship.\n\nSo far, it has been the White House, not the EU, that has taken the lead on imposing tough sanctions against Russia. Several European leaders are still highly uneasy about taking further measures against the Kremlin and Russia’s oligarchs.\n\nEuropeans’ reluctance about extra sanctions is due not only to their energy dependence on Russia, which is decreasing over time, or to the close economic and trade ties that many EU countries have with Moscow. It is also due to European leaders’ lack of a common threat perception of Russia. How Poland, Sweden, Finland, and the Baltic states see Putin’s aggression is entirely different from the view in Spain, Portugal, Greece, or Italy.\n\nAbove all, Europeans do not have the political or economic strength of will that would be needed for an open-ended struggle with Russia. That would require the EU and NATO to define how far they want their sphere of influence to reach. It is difficult to see European leaders agreeing on any such definition.\n\nObama’s remarks during his visit to Europe did not touch those issues, let alone resolve the differences. Issuing stern warnings to Russia from a lectern in front of Rembrandt’s magnificent The Night Watch in Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum was beautifully symbolic. Addressing 2,000 young people in an art deco museum in downtown Brussels was the president’s attempt to bridge the generations. Obama warned his audience against forgetting “that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom.”\n\nBut symbolism and Cold War nostalgia won’t create any lasting new bonds.\n\nPutin’s Russia is not Stalin’s Soviet Union. Today, the United States and the EU are dealing with a Russia that has yet to find its place in the globalized and fragile world of the twenty-first century. That world is based on a fierce competition of ideas, economic models, and values. This is the context in which Americans and Europeans have to decide together why they need each other.\n\nIf the United States and Europe are serious about establishing a new pact, they should focus on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently under discussion.\n\nSo far, the U.S. administration has done most of the legwork of negotiating and promoting the TTIP—unlike European leaders who, for the most part, are reluctant to even debate the partnership. In the twenty-first century, the successful conclusion of the TTIP could be much more important for cementing a new and durable Western bond than a fleeting bit of nostalgia for the Cold War.', 'In the early 1990s, memories were still fresh of the Cold War, which had welded the Western world together.\nSeveral European leaders are still highly uneasy about taking further measures against the Kremlin and Russia’s oligarchs.\nIt is difficult to see European leaders agreeing on any such definition.\nObama warned his audience against forgetting “that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom.”But symbolism and Cold War nostalgia won’t create any lasting new bonds.\nIf the United States and Europe are serious about establishing a new pact, they should focus on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) currently under discussion.']"

The document recognizes the referendum in Crimea as having no legal basis. The General Assembly urged all countries to refrain from recognition of Crimea's status. 100 countries voted for the resolution, only 11 voted against it (Armenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, North Korea, Nicaragua, Russia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe). 58 countries of Latin America and Africa abstained.\n\nRussia considers the annexation of Crimea an irreversible situation. Ruslan Grinberg, Director of the RAS Institute for Economics, has described the potential economic effect that annexation of the peninsula may cause and sanctions against Russia and post-Soviet integration in an interview with Vestnik Kavkaza.\n\n- What economic effect could the annexation of Crimea have on Russia?\n\n- Initially, the annexation of Crimea by Russia will require big expenditures. In the long run, everything will certainly be fine. There are problems with electricity, problems with water. Infrastructure ties between Ukraine and Crimea are hard to replace. These are all solvable problems, but they will certainly need money. And certainly we need to judge by the fact that living standards in Ukraine was three times below that of Russia. And they are happy to get the standards Russians have. But it will require additional funds from the budget, maybe billions of dollars. And they need state investments, because private investors will probably be inactive. Maybe the PPP form would be suitable.\n\nIn the long run, should a free economic zone be formed in Crimea, should investments be safe from thefts, should modern tourism facilities be built, everything would be great. It is possible to increase the living standards, pensions and salaries of state workers.\n\n- How can economic sanctions adopted against Russia affect its relations with the South Caucasus states?\n\n- Sanctions work in two directions. We live in an interdependent world. This is where our president is right and we always need to choose here, search for balance between punishing and punishing oneself. I think that these republics are de facto recognizing our act [the annexation of Crimea], but I am not so sure about it de jure.\n\nGeorgia will consolidate with NATO even more, Azerbaijan will probably take a neutral position, Armenia will back us up de jure because we are its security guarantor.\n\n***\n\nSpeaking of post-Soviet integration, Grinberg noted that the “syndrome of the older brother is hard for us to overcome. I have always sided with experts, political analysts and economists in Russia saying that integration should be paid for. We often say, even in the context of the situation in Ukraine, that Americans and Europeans form certain funds, give grants. But this is common practice. Russia is way behind in this aspect, because it happens that the finances the country spends bring no efficient integration, some country asks for this form of aid but nothing happens. If we want to consolidate the post-Soviet space around Russia, Russia needs to be generous. A different story is that situations may differ. Now, for instance, it may be different over the Ukraine story. We should raise Crimea.”"", 'Infrastructure ties between Ukraine and Crimea are hard to replace.\nAnd certainly we need to judge by the fact that living standards in Ukraine was three times below that of Russia.\n- How can economic sanctions adopted against Russia affect its relations with the South Caucasus states?\n***Speaking of post-Soviet integration, Grinberg noted that the “syndrome of the older brother is hard for us to overcome.\nIf we want to consolidate the post-Soviet space around Russia, Russia needs to be generous.']"

General Assembly on Thursday passed a non-binding resolution declaring invalid Crimea’s Moscow-backed referendum earlier this month on seceding from Ukraine, in a vote that Western nations said highlighted Russia’s isolation.\n\nThere were 100 votes in favour, 11 against and 58 abstentions in the 193-nation assembly. Two dozen countries did not participate in the vote, either because they did not show up or because they have not paid their dues, U.N. diplomats said.\n\nWestern diplomats said the number of yes votes was higher than expected despite what they called Moscow’s aggressive lobbying efforts against the resolution.\n\nBefore the vote, one senior Western diplomat had described a result with 80-90 yes votes as successful for Ukraine. Other Western diplomats agreed, saying the result showed how few active supporters Moscow has around the world.\n\nThe General Assembly resolution echoes a text Moscow vetoed earlier this month in the Security Council. The approved declaration dismisses Crimea’s vote as “having no validity, (and) cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the City of Sevastopol.”\n\nThe resolution, which does not mention Russia by name, says the General Assembly “calls upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status” of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\nAlthough the resolution is non-binding, Western diplomats said it sends a strong political message about Russia’s lack of broad support on the Crimean issue. They said the fact that Russia lobbied so hard to persuade U.N. member states not to vote for it was proof that Moscow took it seriously.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia, who introduced the text to the assembly, said after the vote that an “overwhelming majority of nations in the world supported this resolution.”\n\n“The purpose of this document is to reinforce core United Nations principles at a moment when they are experiencing a major challenge,” he said before the vote.\n\n“This text is also about respect of territorial integrity and non use of force to settle disputes,” he added. “It sends an essential message that the international community will not allow what has happened in Crimea to set a precedent for further challenges to our rules based international framework.”\n\n‘DIRTY DOZEN’\n\nSpeaking before the vote, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin urged countries to support what he said was Crimea’s right of self-determination and to respect the Crimeans’ choice to place themselves under the authority of Moscow.\n\n“Russia could not refuse the Crimeans to support their right to self-determination in fulfilling their long-standing aspiration,” he said. “Historical justice has been vindicated.”\n\nChurkin described the voting result as “a moral victory for the Russian diplomacy.”\n\n“The fact that almost half of the members of the United Nations refused to support this resolution, I think, is very encouraging,” he said.\n\nSeveral Western diplomats, however, said Churkin led an aggressive lobbying campaign against the resolution, adding that many states which sympathize with Ukraine abstained or chose not to be present for fear of angering Russia.\n\nIsrael, Iran, Serbia and several former Soviet republics in Central Asia like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan were among those that did not take part in the vote.\n\nUkraine’s former Russian-backed president, Viktor Yanukovich, was ousted last month after a crackdown on demonstrations in Kiev that left dozens dead. That prompted Moscow to seize the Black Sea peninsula.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said all countries supported the idea of self-determination but that Russia had used its military to forcibly annex Crimea.\n\n“Coercion cannot be the means by which a self determines,” she said. “The chaos that would ensue is not a world that any of us can afford. It is a dangerous world.”\n\nPower added that the resolution showed “that borders are not mere suggestions.”\n\nKaha Imnadze, the ambassador of Georgia, said Moscow was repeating what it had done in his own country’s 2008 war with Russia over the Georgian breakaway enclave of South Ossetia.\n\n“What happened in Ukraine reminds us of what we saw in Georgia in 2008, when Russia seized Georgia’s Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions,” he said. “Six years after the war, 20 percent of my country remains under illegal Russian occupation.”\n\nOnly 10 other countries stood with Russia in voting against the resolution. The group of 11 states, which the senior Western diplomat described as the “dirty dozen”, included critics of Western nations like Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, North Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.\n\nBoth Nicaragua and Bolivia railed against what they described as Western attempts at “regime change”, which they said was meant to undermine democratically elected governments.\n\nChina, which since 2011 joined Russia in vetoing three Security Council resolutions that condemned Syria and threatened it with sanctions, abstained, as it did in the Security Council vote on Ukraine earlier this month.', 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N.

Today their main tasks are destabilization and making impossible the presidential elections on 25 May. Their plans are centered on that”, - Parubiy pointed out during a joint press-conference with the head of the USA Atlantic Council Damon MacWilson. The information comes from a statement on the Ukraine NSDC’s web-site.\n\nParubiy emphasized that, according to the present data, one may assert that Crimea was supposed to be only the first state of the intervention in Ukraine.\n\n“The next step was supposed to include 8 regions in the South and East of Ukraine, where an scenario was supposed to unfold identical to the one in Crimea with the seizure of regional state administration buildings, the proclamation of so-called people’s governors, and then an appeal to Russia with a plea for help. This plan of Russia’s bears the name “Russian spring”, - Parubiy claims.\n\nAccording to him, Russian troops are not only located in Crimea but also at Northern and Eastern borders of Ukraine, while their totals numbers at the moment reach 100 thousand soldiers.\n\n“Almost 100 thousand troops are at Ukraine’s borders in various divisions in the directions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk. These troops are at alert posture and have been for several weeks already”, - the NSDC’s secretary pointed out.\n\nParubiy also noted that Russian strategy hoped that Russia’s troops would be gladly received in the East and South of Ukraine, however the well-prepared protest actions found little support in Eastern and Southern regions.\n\n“According to the information we have, they will bring into play the next plan, which has a more political and long-term strategy aimed at wrecking Ukrainian elections. We realize that every night, every hour an attack may take place on the territory of continental Ukraine. We are preparing for this. Our general strategy now is to establish order in Ukraine’s continental part, not allow provocations to happen and prepare the elections of 25 May”, - Parubiy stated.\n\nWe would remind that yesterday American intelligence reported of the threat of the invasion of Russian troops not only in Ukraine, but also the Baltic States and Moldova.', 'Andriy Parubiy: 100 thousand Russian troops are ready to invade Ukraine 49 28.03.2014, 7:5726,856Ukrainian authorities are expecting an attack from several directions, including from Belarus.\nThe risk of Russian troops invading continental Ukraine is fairly high today.\nThis comes from a statement by the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Andriy Parubiy.\n“Almost 100 thousand troops are at Ukraine’s borders in various divisions in the directions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk.\nWe realize that every night, every hour an attack may take place on the territory of continental Ukraine.']"

But the crisis in Crimea shows a different kind of weakness. There is no doubt which is the strong side in the conflict between the government in Kiev and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but it seems like Obama is also a little intimidated by Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and his men.\n\nPutin didn’t have a master plan to annex Crimea from November, and probably not even when he sent the soldiers without insignia to decorate the streets of Sevastopol and Simferopol. He didn’t send his Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for such long talks with his colleagues John Kerry and Lady Catherine Ashton only to waste time. His hours of talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Obama weren’t spent solely on repeating Russia’s ancient claims to Crimea.\n\nAs The Guardian’s Shaun Walker describes, in all those talks, Putin did offer a compromise - a compromise Ukrainian government might have not liked, but not an unreasonable one. The conditions included ensuring that Ukraine’s interim government involved a coalition of all political forces, including Yanukovych’s Party of Regions (but not Viktor Yanukovych himself, which even Putin gave up on), disbanding all armed revolutionary factions and making Russian an official state language.\n\nBut this offer wasn’t even discussed publicly. Instead of pressuring Kiev to compromise and averting the escalation of the crisis, the West rejected the Russia’s suggestion on grounds that it is interference in Ukraine's internal matters. This justification didn’t take into account that Kiev is in control of an interim and even revolutionary government, not one elected in free and fair elections, and that there is room for reshuffling the ministries so that all sections of Ukrainian society will be recognized.\n\nWhy was the Russian compromise truly rejected? The Ukrainian sovereignty was an excuse. Obama isn’t personally afraid of the Ukrainian Prime Minister, or from repercussions for the US. But after years of criticism about his weakness in front of other world or regional powers, he has developed a vulnerability to the demands of adversaries of those powers.\n\nThis is not the first time Obama has succumbed to pressure of the weaker party in a way that hinders a possible solution. Before the Geneva conference on the war in Syria, the Americans gave in to the Syrian opposition's threats and stopped Iran’s participation in the negotiations. Washington acknowledged the mistake by organizing a parallel event with an Iranian delegation, but the result was a peace conference without one of the main forces involved in the war, and probably the only force that might be able to pressure Assad to compromise.\n\nOne might argue that the Syrian peace conference was doomed from the beginning, and the Iranian absence didn’t change much. But now, when American officials are starting to recognize publicly that Crimea is lost to Ukraine, and before we see another round of accusations about Obama’s weakness in the face of Putin, it is important to remember the principal weakness that led to this result.\n\nPresident Obama during a press conference in Brussels on March 26, 2014. AFP"", 'Over and over again U.S. President Barack Obama has been attacked for his weak stand against Russia, Iran or Bashar al-Assad.\nPutin didn’t have a master plan to annex Crimea from November, and probably not even when he sent the soldiers without insignia to decorate the streets of Sevastopol and Simferopol.\nHis hours of talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Obama weren’t spent solely on repeating Russia’s ancient claims to Crimea.\nAs The Guardian’s Shaun Walker describes, in all those talks, Putin did offer a compromise - a compromise Ukrainian government might have not liked, but not an unreasonable one.\nWhy was the Russian compromise truly rejected?']"

Now, he finds that the engagement may limit how hard he can hit back at Russia without toppling everything else.\n\nWhite House officials insist that the U.S. can\'t go back to a business-as-usual relationship with Russia as long as Putin still has control of Crimea, the strategically important peninsula he annexed from Ukraine.\n\nExactly what might be changed still is being debated inside the West Wing. Susan Rice, Obama\'s national security adviser, said Russia\'s incursion in Crimea ""is causing the countries and people of Europe and the international community and, of course, the United States to reassess what does this mean and what are the implications.""\n\nBut even as officials warn of curtailed ties with Russia, they\'re seeking to insulate Obama\'s most pressing foreign policy priorities from any major harm that might result.\n\nExamples are plentiful and worrisome:\n\nn Russia is part of the international negotiating team working with the U.S. to strike a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nn The Kremlin\'s participation is crucial to keeping Syria on track with a plan to rid Damascus of its chemical weapons stockpiles.\n\nn Russia also allows the U.S. to use an alternative to a supply route through Pakistan to bring military personnel and equipment out of Afghanistan as the war there comes to an end.\n\nThen there\'s the International Space Station and Russia\'s agreement to ferry American astronauts to and from it. And the concern, more pointed in Europe but well-noted in the U.S., that a deeper rift with Russia could interrupt crucial energy supplies now flowing to European nations.\n\nU.S. officials say they\'re skeptical Russia would upend any of these partnerships given that its own strategic interests also are at stake. Russia wants access to Iran\'s economy, which now is cut off from much of the world by U.S. sanctions. In Syria, Putin sees the chemical weapons deal as a way to stave off a possible American military strike and the ouster of his allies in the Syrian government.\n\nAmerican officials say they instead want to cut off cooperation in areas where Russia will suffer more than the U.S. That means stopping joint military operations and canceling trade talks that were eagerly sought by Moscow.\n\n""We must meet the challenge to our ideals, to our very international order with strength and conviction,"" Obama said Wednesday in Brussels. He closed three days of talks on the Russia dispute with European leaders in the Netherlands and Brussels.\n\nThe leaders indefinitely cut Russia out of the Group of Eight assemblage of major nations, a step announced by Obama and Western allies during the president\'s trip. Western allies also agreed to impose broad economic sanctions on Russia if it advances further into Ukraine.\n\nBut so far, U.S. efforts to isolate Russia don\'t appear to have changed Putin\'s calculus. After defying warnings from the West and moving troops into Crimea, he formally annexed the peninsula from Ukraine. He\'s also staged thousands of troops on Russia\'s border with eastern Ukraine, sparking fears in the U.S. and Europe that he may make a play for more territory.\n\nAt home, Obama is getting some low marks for his overall handling of the situation: 57 percent disapprove of his dealings in regard to Ukraine and 54 percent his interactions with Russia, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. On the other hand, nearly 9 in 10 support sanctions as a response.\n\nThe developments with Russia are hardly what Obama envisioned when he launched his ""reset."" The policy was aimed at soothing tensions sparked under the George W. Bush administration and paving the way for cooperation on issues like Iran and Afghanistan. But no one expected totally smooth sailing.\n\n""There was never a belief anywhere that Russia was going to evolve into a NATO-like partner or a democracy,"" said Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official and current fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""It was always a belief, in fact, that particularly on issues that related to Russia\'s neighborhood, that Russia was always going to be difficult.""\n\nThe U.S. and its allies had faced a similar quandary about their relationship with Russia in 2008, when Moscow sent troops into Georgia and recognized the independence of two breakaway Georgian territories, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The West condemned both steps, but largely resumed normal relations with Russia, even as it violated a cease-fire agreement by keeping its troops in areas it was supposed to evacuate.\n\nU.S. officials suggest it will be harder to resume normal dealings with Russia after this latest flare-up. Russia stopped short of annexing the Georgian territories, but in the case of Ukraine, it formally pulled Crimea within its borders, an action the White House sees as a more flagrant violation of international law. Officials also see Ukraine as a more strategically important country than Georgia.', 'Now, he finds that the engagement may limit how hard he can hit back at Russia without toppling everything else.\nBut even as officials warn of curtailed ties with Russia, they\'re seeking to insulate Obama\'s most pressing foreign policy priorities from any major harm that might result.\nRussia wants access to Iran\'s economy, which now is cut off from much of the world by U.S. sanctions.\nWestern allies also agreed to impose broad economic sanctions on Russia if it advances further into Ukraine.\nThe developments with Russia are hardly what Obama envisioned when he launched his ""reset.""']"

56397,http://www.abqjournal.com/375248/opinion/the-right-side-doesnt-always-win.html,business,"['.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........\n\nBRUSSELS – President Obama has spoken once again during the Ukraine crisis about being on the right “side of history.” It’s one of his signature lines, but he should stop: The phrase implies there’s an inevitability to the advance of progress and justice. Would that it were so.\n\nWhat’s happening now in Vladimir Putin’s Russia is a reminder that history has ebbs and flows, advances and retreats, and that its interpretation is subjective. Even more, recent events are a warning that decisive turns in history can result from ruthless political leaders, from weak or confused adversaries, or sometimes just from historical accident. Might doesn’t make right, but it does create “facts on the ground” that are hard to reverse.\n\nPutin’s real problem is that he’s on the wrong side of NATO. This stance was a loser for his Soviet predecessors and it’s likely to be so for Putin – as long as the West keeps its head and doesn’t take impulsive actions that would play into Putin’s hands. A cautious NATO didn’t send troops into Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968 to counter Soviet aggression, to catcalls from conservatives, but it decisively won the Cold War.\n\nPutin’s putsch in Crimea has had one profoundly positive effect on Obama and the West. It has produced what NATO Commander Gen. Philip Breedlove last weekend called a “paradigm shift” in perceptions of the Russian leader.\n\nADVERTISEMENTSkip\n\n................................................................\n\n“What … has changed in this paradigm,” Breedlove explained, is that a Russia that “used to be a partner [is] now acting more like an adversary [which] puts force at-ready on our borders. And we have to be positioned differently and be more ready.”\n\nBy annexing Crimea, Putin has indeed altered the framework in which the U.S. and other countries evaluate Moscow’s actions. Presumably, this repositioning of Russia was part of what he intended, but it’s a risky strategy that has produced diplomatic, economic and military responses from a united West.\n\nPutin leads what by most political and economic indicators is a weak nation – a declining power, not a rising one. Russia has a pugnacious, revanchist leader who is willing to use force, but that’s a recipe for victory only if the West capitulates.\n\nBreedlove was careful in discussing NATO military options. “Moving forces is not a trivial matter,” he said, noting that it would be hard to counter a Russian army at the Ukrainian border that is “very, very sizable and very, very ready.” But given the destabilizing effects of a Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine, NATO should prepare some deterrent to further aggression other than jawboning.\n\nListening to the conversation among Americans and Europeans at a recent conference here, I came away with a sense that Putin’s gambit will fail over time if Europe and America remain resolute and patient. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia told me his country is determined now to join the European Union – remaining at peace with its neighbor to the east, if possible, but “absolutely” prepared to fight Russian troops if they invade eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe real challenge, said Deshchytsia, is to make a success of Ukraine’s “Euro-revolution,” as he called it. “We need to start reforms today,” he explained, from the country’s corrupt financial system to its weak military. He made his comments in a session I moderated at the Brussels Forum, sponsored by the German Marshall Fund (of which I’m a trustee).\n\nObama gets pounded daily by conservatives, who imply that he invited Putin’s attack on Crimea. But since the crisis began, Obama has actually been quite firm. The U.S. pushed Europe to adopt sanctions by announcing its own first, and NATO made some prompt military moves to reassure Poland and the Baltic states. The U.S. has also moved quietly to help Ukraine cut nearly a third of its Russian gas imports by yearend and dispense with them entirely by 2020.\n\nThe key for Obama is to stay the course he has begun and to work closely with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Hopefully, she will be an “iron lady” in this crisis, as she was in dealing with Europe’s economic meltdown.

I am disappointed to see that he has now become a cold warrior (The Yorkshire Post, March 20).\n\nI am no supporter of President Putin and his militaristic Russian regime, nor indeed of nationalism generally, but your readers need to look at the background to the current serious difficulties in Crimea and in Ukraine generally. The need to view international disputes as the other “side” sees them is crucial and rarely realised. My 50-odd missions to emerging democracies around the world since the implosion of the Soviet Union in 1989 have been an extremely steep learning curve in how the West is seen from overseas.\n\nWe need a much broader perception of sovereignty and of borders, with a view to resolving problems by assisting acceptable constitutional solutions. Sanctions have little value, particularly when one realises that around one third of our gas comes from Russia.\n\nFrom: Coun Frank McManus, Labour, Todmorden Town Council, Longfield Road, Todmorden.\n\nI HOLD no brief for Vladimir Putin, but the same applies to Messrs Cameron and Obama and to the ‘EU leaders’ as they meet to consider responding to the aftermath of the illegal referendum in Crimea.\n\nSimilar ones were held two decades ago to “justify” the break-up of Yugoslavia into smaller states. As for the targeting of Putin’s individual supporters by asset freezing, why have no culpable bankers been brought to book for the 2008 crisis? The rioters got short shrift, as did Mr Biggs!\n\nSurely it is for the United Nations to deal with deviant states?\n\nFrom: Paul Iwanyckyj, Doncaster, South Yorkshire.\n\nI WAS born in Yorkshire, to a Ukrainian father, and have visited Ukraine many times. I have always been struck by the over-riding sense of commonality I feel with a well-educated, hard-working and good humoured nation. It is one that places high values on the family and morality, and that has had to develop practicality and pragmatism to a high degree in order to overcome the various challenges presented by decades, if not centuries, of occupation.\n\nThis is the overwhelming, everyday majority one finds at the heart of most civilised populations, and Ukraine is no exception.\n\nAs a result, it breaks my heart to see Russia treating Ukraine, and effectively Europe, as its playground in which to do as it wishes. My only hope is that the US and EU stop these woolly threats that are water off a bear’s back, and come up with some tangible actions, that will really mean something for the people of Ukraine.\n\nFrom: Mr D Birch, Smithy Lane, Cookridge, Leeds.\n\nI SEE that Crimea has voted over 90 per cent to opt out of the Ukraine in favour of Russia. According to Foreign Secretary William Hague, the EU and the rest of the democracies all over the world wouldn’t tolerate the view of the people of Crimea and that the vote must have been rigged or the Russians had forced them to vote.\n\nHe went on to say that steps would now be taken to veto certain things. That is very unlikely to happen. Why? Ukraine is not a member of the EU, not now and by the look of things will never be, as Mr Hague and the rest of these brilliant politicians know just what is in Mr Putin’s mind.\n\nIt strikes me they have all been led up the garden path in the main by the USA, who were in a Cold War status with Russia long before the Ukrainian government was overturned by Ukrainians because of their government’s corruption.\n\nFrom: Gordon Lawrence, Stumperlowe View, Sheffield.\n\nMANY observers, including your letter writer John Fortune, (The Yorkshire Post, March 22), are attempting to excuse or even justify Vladimir Putin’s land-grab of the Crimea by charging Britain and the West of employing double standards in supporting democracy in their own backyards but denigrating Putin for applying it in the Ukraine.\n\nUnfortunately, for their contention, logic does not support their claim. In Gibraltar and the Falklands, the examples that constitute their main source of argument, the populace has voted in valid polls with a more than 90 per cent majority to stay with the status quo under British rule.\n\nWe are both implementing democracy and observing international law. Putin is brazenly violating international law and on the basis of a very questionable, and quite illicit poll has exploited the ideology of democracy and the bogus protection of his own kinsfolk to achieve his annexation of the Crimea.\n\nIf Argentina invaded the Falklands, both those salient issues, international law and democracy would be violated; only a debatable geo-political argument would remain. Or if the Falklanders had voted for Argentine citizenship, Britain would indisputably have acted upon the decision. Where are the double standards?\n\nA widespread adoption of the Russian leader’s policy, ignoring extant national boundaries, would create international havoc.\n\nWith a weak and incohesive Western response, Putin’s aggression could be re-enacted in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine where a large majority of the population is of Russian ethnicity; the noises coming from that area are already beginning to resemble the cataclysmic sounds of the Sudetenland in 1938.', 'The need to view international disputes as the other “side” sees them is crucial and rarely realised.\nWe need a much broader perception of sovereignty and of borders, with a view to resolving problems by assisting acceptable constitutional solutions.\nI WAS born in Yorkshire, to a Ukrainian father, and have visited Ukraine many times.\nThis is the overwhelming, everyday majority one finds at the heart of most civilised populations, and Ukraine is no exception.\nI SEE that Crimea has voted over 90 per cent to opt out of the Ukraine in favour of Russia.']"

Then, three years after Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush Sr. shook on that,\n\nNATO welcomed former Warsaw Pact brethren the Poles, the Czechs and the Hungarians. Ten years ago, the alliance lapped at Russia’s doorstep in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and also made members of Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia. In 2009, in came Albania and Croatia. Ukraine was not considered, but a close eye is being kept on other Russian-speaking regions.\n\nUS Air Force General Philip Breedlove, NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, said: “To the point of Odessa and Transdniestria, let me just say: we are very concerned about that. We know the capability absolutely exists to do that and cause that problem. We don’t know about the intent. What we do see is some of the same rhetoric that was used when they went into Crimea.”\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin points to Kosovo’s independence claim, telling the West that, if it condoned that, it should accept his absorption of Crimea — ignoring the ethnic violence involving Serb and opposing forces, controversial NATO bombing, UN administration and years of talks between Pristina and Belgrade.\n\nNATO is adamant now that it won’t intervene unless one of its member states is threatened.

Two dozen countries did not participate in the vote, either because they did not show up or because they have not paid their dues, U.N. diplomats said.\n\nArmenia, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe supported Russia\'s position.\n\nIt should be stressed that Azerbaijan voted for the resolution. The Azerbaijani embassy in Ukraine has recently voiced Baku\'s position.\n\nIn its statement, it stressed that Azerbaijan\'s position is to support the territorial integrity, sovereignty and inviolability of Ukraine\'s borders.\n\nAlong with Azerbaijan, such countries as the US, Turkey, Georgia, as well as Canada, France, Germany, Japan and other countries voted for the resolution. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Brazil, China, India and others are among those abstained from voting.\n\nWestern diplomats said the number of yes votes was higher than expected despite what they called Moscow\'s aggressive lobbying efforts against the resolution.\n\nBefore the vote, one senior Western diplomat had described a result with 80-90 yes votes as successful for Ukraine. Other Western diplomats agreed, saying the result showed how few active supporters Moscow has around the world.\n\nThe General Assembly resolution echoes a text Moscow vetoed earlier this month in the Security Council. The approved declaration dismisses Crimea\'s vote as ""having no validity, (and) cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the City of Sevastopol.""\n\nThe resolution, which does not mention Russia by name, says the General Assembly ""calls upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status"" of Crimea and Sevastopol.\n\nAlthough the resolution is non-binding, Western diplomats said it sends a strong political message about Russia\'s lack of broad support on the Crimean issue. They said the fact that Russia lobbied so hard to persuade U.N. member states not to vote for it was proof that Moscow took it seriously.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia, who introduced the text to the assembly, said after the vote that an ""overwhelming majority of nations in the world supported this resolution.""\n\n""The purpose of this document is to reinforce core United Nations principles at a moment when they are experiencing a major challenge,"" he said before the vote.\n\n""This text is also about respect of territorial integrity and non use of force to settle disputes,"" he added. ""It sends an essential message that the international community will not allow what has happened in Crimea to set a precedent for further challenges to our rules based international framework.""\n\nSpeaking before the vote, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin urged countries to support what he said was Crimea\'s right of self-determination and to respect the Crimeans\' choice to place themselves under the authority of Moscow.\n\n""Russia could not refuse the Crimeans to support their right to self-determination in fulfilling their long-standing aspiration,"" he said. ""Historical justice has been vindicated.""\n\nChurkin described the voting result as ""a moral victory for the Russian diplomacy.""\n\n""The fact that almost half of the members of the United Nations refused to support this resolution, I think, is very encouraging,"" he said.\n\nSeveral Western diplomats, however, said Churkin led an aggressive lobbying campaign against the resolution, adding that many states which sympathize with Ukraine abstained or chose not to be present for fear of angering Russia.\n\nIsrael, Iran, Serbia and several former Soviet republics in Central Asia like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan were among those that did not take part in the vote.\n\nUkraine\'s former Russian-backed president, Viktor Yanukovich, was ousted last month after a crackdown on demonstrations in Kiev that left dozens dead. That prompted Moscow to seize the Black Sea peninsula.\n\nU.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said all countries supported the idea of self-determination but that Russia had used its military to forcibly annex Crimea.\n\n""Coercion cannot be the means by which a self determines,"" she said. ""The chaos that would ensue is not a world that any of us can afford. It is a dangerous world.""\n\nPower added that the resolution showed ""that borders are not mere suggestions.""\n\nKaha Imnadze, the ambassador of Georgia, said Moscow was repeating what it had done in his own country\'s 2008 war with Russia over the Georgian breakaway enclave of South Ossetia.\n\n""What happened in Ukraine reminds us of what we saw in Georgia in 2008, when Russia seized Georgia\'s Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions,"" he said. ""Six years after the war, 20 percent of my country remains under illegal Russian occupation.""\n\nOnly 10 other countries stood with Russia in voting against the resolution. The group of 11 states, which the senior Western diplomat described as the ""dirty dozen"", included critics of Western nations like Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, North Korea, Nicaragua, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe.\n\nBoth Nicaragua and Bolivia railed against what they described as Western attempts at ""regime change"", which they said was meant to undermine democratically elected governments.\n\nChina, which since 2011 joined Russia in vetoing three Security Council resolutions that condemned Syria and threatened it with sanctions, abstained, as it did in the Security Council vote on Ukraine earlier this month.\n\nFollow Trend on Telegram.

The U.S. government finds itself in a position in which it is unable to use the power of its influence and military force to dominate and prevail. I speak, of course, of the very tenuous situation in Ukraine and Crimea where Russia and its President Putin are in control and have no intention of backing off.\n\nRussia made a swift and bold move into Ukraine and Crimea, taking control of that region, and catching the U.S. government completely by surprise. It would seem that the NSA world monitoring and spying system completely failed to pick up what Russia was planning to do. At this point about all America and its Western allies can do is to try to react to this strategic move but their possible counter moves are few if any.\n\nWhat happened there has been a monumental blow to America\'s military hubris. It\'s very difficult for the war hawks that are so thoroughly embedded in the various parts of this government to accept the reality of what has happened. They are so used to applying this country\'s military power at will in any part of this world, anytime they see fit; just as they have done in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan and numerous other countries. But, suddenly, they are stymied.\n\nWhat\'s going on in this very strategic region of the world can be thought of as a geopolitical chess match between two masters. We might refer to President Putin as the modern-day version of Russia\'s former world champion chessmaster Garry Kasparov and President Obama playing the role of the former American champion, Bobby Fischer.\n\nIn the game of chess the winning move is called a checkmate, one in which a player\'s king is ""in check"", that is, in danger of being captured and there is no way to escape. At that point the game is over. So In this geopolitical game of chess in Crimea/Ukraine, to the complete dismay of the U.S. government, it didn\'t take long for Putin of Russia to declare a checkmate.\n\nMr. Obama and his inner circle maintain that this kind of intrusion cannot be tolerated and that Putin and Russia will pay a terrible price for what they have done; that strong sanctions by the U.S. and its Western allies will follow and bring Russia to its knees; Russia and Putin will wish that they had never committed this violation of international law.\n\nNow, let\'s talk about pure hypocrisy. In an attempt to label Russia as an international criminal state it\'s been reported that Mr. Obama made this absolutely astounding statement in which he defended the U.S. invasion of Iraq in an attempt to chastise Russia for recent developments in Crimea and Ukraine.\n\nHe said: ""Russia has pointed to America\'s decision to go into Iraq as an example of Western hypocrisy. Now, it is true that the Iraq war was a subject of vigorous debate, not just around the world but in the United States, as well. I participated in that debate, and I opposed our military intervention there.""\n\n""But even in Iraq, America sought to work within the international system. We did not claim or annex Iraq\'s territory. We did not grab its resources for our own gain. Instead, we ended our war and left Iraq to its people in a fully sovereign Iraqi state that can make decisions about its own future."" What he failed to mention is that Iraq and its people were devastated by the massive power of the U.S. military.\n\nWhat is with this president?

Meanwhile, the company formerly known as RIM finished the final quarter of its fiscal 2014 with a net loss of $423 million, which is better than the $4.4 billion that it lost in Q3 2014 but worse than the $98 million income that it raked in during Q4 2013.\n\nOn the hardware side of things, BlackBerry says that it sold around 3.4 million smartphones to consumers during Q4 2014. Of that total, approximately 2.3 million were BlackBerry 7 devices.\n\nDespite the rough quarter, BlackBerry CEO John Chen says that he\'s happy with the progress that his company has made on its strategy to streamline its operations. Chen reports that BlackBerry has hit its expense reduction target ahead of schedule and that the device maker ""is on sounder financial footing today with a path to returning to growth and profitability.""\n\nOverall it looks like BlackBerry had itself another bumpy quarter to close out its fiscal 2014. Not only did it suffer another loss, but its total smartphone sales dropped, and once again the majority of the units that it did move were powered by its older BlackBerry 7 OS rather than the newer BlackBerry 10 platform. The company is remaining positive, though, and it hopes to continue to streamline its operations and reach a break even cash flow by this time next year. Whether or not it\'ll be able to pull that off remains to be seen, but it\'ll definitely be interesting to see if its entry-level BlackBerry Z3 and keyboard-clad BlackBerry Q20 can help turn things around.\n\nUPDATE: BlackBerry CEO John Chen revealed that his firm plans to launch high-end handsets with physical keyboards in the next 18 months in an effort to win back executive customers that dislike BlackBerry\'s recent touchscreen products. ""The focus is going to be very keyboard centric,"" Chen said.\n\nThe exec went on to say that BlackBerry has three next-gen smartphone designs that are in its labs right now. BlackBerry announced last month that it will release a new Q20 smartphone that features a trackpad and keyboard as well as a set of Menu, Back, Send and End buttons like those found on older BlackBerry 7 devices.\n\nChen also revealed that BlackBerry is considering creating a version of BBM for desktop computers. ""We are certainly going to take a very serious look at putting BBM on the desktop,"" he said, explaining that such an app would allow users to start a chat on their PC and then go mobile without missing any of the conversation.\n\nUPDATE 2: Chen dropped a few more details on BlackBerry\'s future hardware plans during today\'s Q4 2014 call:\n\nThe BlackBerry Z3 will be released in countries outside of Indonesia, including a model with North American LTE support\n\nThe BlackBerry Q20 with trackpad Menu, Back, Send and End keys is expected to launch in Q1 2015\n\nBlackBerry will start up new production runs of the BlackBerry 7-powered BlackBerry Bold\n\nVia BlackBerry, Reuters, TechCrunch', ""On the hardware side of things, BlackBerry says that it sold around 3.4 million smartphones to consumers during Q4 2014.\nOf that total, approximately 2.3 million were BlackBerry 7 devices.\nDespite the rough quarter, BlackBerry CEO John Chen says that he's happy with the progress that his company has made on its strategy to streamline its operations.\nWhether or not it'll be able to pull that off remains to be seen, but it'll definitely be interesting to see if its entry-level BlackBerry Z3 and keyboard-clad BlackBerry Q20 can help turn things around.\nThe exec went on to say that BlackBerry has three next-gen smartphone designs that are in its labs right now.""]"

(NASDAQ: BBRY) reported fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2014 earnings before markets opened Friday morning. The smartphone maker reported an adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) loss of $0.08 on revenues of $976 million. In the same period a year ago, BlackBerry reported EPS of $0.22 on revenue of $2.7 billion. Fourth-quarter results also compare to consensus estimates for an EPS loss of $0.55 and $1.11 billion in revenue.\n\nFor the full fiscal year, Blackberry posted an EPS loss of $1.35 on revenues of $6.8 billion compared with an EPS loss of $0.60 on revenues of $11.07 billion in the previous year. The consensus estimates called for an EPS loss of $1.80 on revenues of $6.95 billion.\n\nOn a GAAP basis, the quarterly EPS loss totaled $0.80 and the full-year EPS loss totaled $11.18.\n\nShares are getting a boost from the lower-than-expected losses, and investors seem to be paying to attention to the top-line miss. Quarterly revenues are down 64% year over year and down 18% sequentially. Of that revenue, 37% came from hardware sales, 56% from sales of services and the rest from software and other sales.\n\nBlackBerry said it sold 3.4 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, of which 2.3 million were BlackBerry 7 devices. The company’s new BB 10 operating system and hardware have not taken the company’s customers by storm. This could indicate that sales of the older model phones are a function of very low pricing in developed markets and even lower pricing in emerging markets. That would also account for the sharp drop in revenues.\n\nFor the company’s 2015 fiscal year, the company only said that it anticipates maintaining its strong cash position and continuing to look for opportunities to streamline operations. BlackBerry expects to break even on cash flow results by the end of the new fiscal year.\n\nThe company’s CEO, turnaround star John Chen, said:\n\nI am very pleased with our progress and execution in fiscal Q4 against the strategy we laid out three months ago. We have significantly streamlined operations, allowing us to reach our expense reduction target one quarter ahead of schedule. BlackBerry is on sounder financial footing today with a path to returning to growth and profitability.\n\nAdjusted gross margins in the fourth quarter were 43%, and the adjusted pretax loss from continuing operations totaled $557 million. On an adjusted basis, gross margins rose from 34% in the first quarter to 36%. That is the only good news.\n\nThe consensus estimates for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 call for an EPS loss of $0.38 on revenues of $1.11 billion. For the full year, analysts expect an EPS loss of $1.29 on revenues of $4.16 billion.\n\nShares were up about 7.4% in premarket trading, at $9.74 in a 52-week range of $5.44 to $16.59.

Operating losses were $537m, and net losses $423m.\n\nThe company\'s shares moved up 4% in pre-market trading as the losses were smaller than had been expected, and revenue in the US slightly higher than analysts forecast.\n\nJohn Chen, recruited in November as chief executive to try to turn the company around, said he was ""very pleased"" with progress and that ""we have significantly streamlined operations, allowing us to reach our expense reduction target one quarter ahead of schedule.""\n\nHe also told Reuters that the company was working on high-end keyboard-based smartphones to appeal to ""keyboard aficionados"" in the next 18 months.\n\nHe is also considering ways to generate more value from the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) software, presently available for free on BlackBerry, Apple and Android devices. The purchase by Facebook of messaging app WhatsApp for $19bn has piqued interest in the potential of BBM – though the chief of that division left BlackBerry recently, and its software chief is heading to Apple.\n\nDespite a cash outflow of $553m during the quarter, Chen said that the company was on a ""sound financial footing"", with $2.7bn of cash and equivalents.\n\nChen has laid off staff, sold offices and land, and outsourced the manufacture of handset as part of a retrenchment from the consumer market to focus on its strongest markets among government and business users. Operating expenses were halved from the start of the fiscal year, and the number of phones sitting unsold with retailers – known as ""channel inventory"" – reduced by a third.\n\nBlackBerry has fallen far from its peak at the end of 2010, when its revenues hit $5.5bn in a single quarter and it claimed 80m users for its platform. Its total revenue for the past four quarters were just $6.8bn. Though it was one of the first companies to offer a smartphone, and leant on its powerful email encryption as a selling point, the rise of Apple\'s iPhone and phones running Google\'s Android software has seen its unique selling points eroded.\n\nThe company now faces a problem in interesting buyers in its BB10 platform, launched in January 2013 by former chief executive Thorsten Heins but given a frosty reception by mobile networks and customers. Many have preferred to stick with the older BB7, which has outsold the BB10 models in every quarter since its release. Most of BlackBerry\'s losses for 2014 are due to massive writedowns on unsold BB10 handsets.\n\nDespite a $1bn debt financing ahead of Chen\'s appointment, the company is still losing key customers among corporations. However BlackBerry was able to tout the US Department of Defence having cleared BB10 for use on the Pentagon\'s networks.\n\nBlackBerry\'s headline revenues are still highly dependent on its handset sales, but those have now fallen to a level not seen since summer 2006, while the quarterly revenues were the same as in the three-month period before the launch of Apple\'s iPhone. For the past two quarters the majority of its revenues have come from services, where it provides its BlackBerry Enterprise Server software to corporate customers to handle BlackBerry handsets.\n\nMeanwhile the company\'s former consumer strongholds in the US, UK and Asia all showed signs of erosion.\n\n• Blackberry sues own software chief to stop him leaving for Apple', ""He is also considering ways to generate more value from the BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) software, presently available for free on BlackBerry, Apple and Android devices.\nDespite a $1bn debt financing ahead of Chen's appointment, the company is still losing key customers among corporations.\nHowever BlackBerry was able to tout the US Department of Defence having cleared BB10 for use on the Pentagon's networks.\nFor the past two quarters the majority of its revenues have come from services, where it provides its BlackBerry Enterprise Server software to corporate customers to handle BlackBerry handsets.\n• Blackberry sues own software chief to stop him leaving for Apple""]"

That plan includes the elimination of about 40 per cent of the company\'s workforce before the end of May.\n\nWhen he took the leadership role last November, Chen had to immediately get a tighter control on expenses, he said, because surveying the problems at the troubled company sequentially would have taken too long.\n\n""You cannot ever cut yourself to glory,"" he said.\n\n""That transition was one of the most difficult things in the beginning.""\n\nIn its outlook, BlackBerry says it aims to break even by the end of its 2015 financial year, which wraps up next March.', ""Chen treads carefully when talking about BlackBerry's past after being hired last November to turn the faltering company around.\nExcluding several one-time items, BlackBerry reported an adjusted loss from continuing operations of $42 million or eight cents per share.\nThe average analyst estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters had been for a deeper loss of 55 cents per share.\nChen hopes the company will be able to market to them through new sales teams that cater to major sectors like government, financial services and health-care clients.\nOver the coming quarters Chen hopes that new BlackBerry enterprise management software, dubbed BES12 and rolling out in November, will help transition more business customers to its new operating system.""]"

""We still have a lot of work to do, but I\'m very hopeful.""\n\nBlackBerry\'s business continues to decline steadily, five months after shareholder Fairfax Financial Holdings pulled its takeover offer and instead led a refinancing of the Waterloo, Ont.-based company. It posted revenues of $976-million (U.S.) in the fourth quarter, ended March 1 – its first sub-$1-billion quarter in seven years, down 64 per cent year-over-year and below expectations.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Chen maintained the company will turn cash-flow positive by early next year. But its cash resources still dipped by $530-million over the quarter to $2.7-billion, notwithstanding a $250-million injection from the refinancing. The company recognized revenue on 1.3 million handsets, down from 1.9 million the previous quarter. ""They\'re in danger of falling below one million [device sales] a quarter,"" Citi Research analyst Ehud Gelblum said. ""You\'ve never seen a handset company sustain itself with numbers like that.""\n\nShares of the company fell 7 per cent on Friday, falling 65 cents to close at $9.31.\n\nMr. Chen inherited a company whose decline was exacerbated by the disastrous launch last year of the BlackBerry 10 platform, its much-delayed response to iPhone and Android. Consumers ignored its all-touchscreen Z10 model, while its keyboard-enabled Q10 flopped with long-time users. It was missing many familiar features of past BlackBerrys and was not compatible with older BlackBerry servers installed with corporate and government (""enterprise"") customers, forcing them to upgrade. Few did.\n\nInstead, loyal customers have largely stuck with BlackBerry\'s older phones, particularly the Bold, which continues to far outsell BlackBerry 10 devices, prompting the company to put it back into production.\n\nAnother critical concern is BlackBerry\'s high-margin services business. For years, the company fought to protect the ""service access fees"" it charged carriers to access its proprietary network. However, Mr. Chen\'s short-lived predecessor Thorsten Heins bowed to pressure to reduce the fees, a move the new CEO says was a mistake. Service revenues are now declining by more than 10 per cent from quarter to quarter, amounting to just $547-million in the fourth quarter, down by more than $400-million from a year earlier.\n\nMr. Chen is aiming to win back enterprise customers, particularly in regulated areas such as banking and health care, who have chosen other device management service providers. He also expects to drive growth and revenue from the company\'s BBM instant messaging service and QNX software division, which provides machine-to-machine communication capabilities to auto makers and other industries.\n\nThe company this week announced plans to derive revenue from BBM, ranging from selling virtual ""stickers"" like other instant messengers, to enabling users to make payments over the service.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMeeting with journalists at BlackBerry headquarters, Mr. Chen said he sees even greater revenue growth potential for QNX over the next two to three years, from applications for software interfaces such as bank machines, government control systems and mobile military communications. ""The important point is to establish a growing software business, have a good monetization plan for BBM and continue to expand the QNX reach and to make sure that hardware doesn\'t lose money,"" he said.\n\nMr. Chen expects to solve the BlackBerry 10 compatibility problem by introducing new server software by November that will enable enterprises to manage any BlackBerry or rival device.\n\nHe will do that in tandem with the launch of a new smartphone, called the BlackBerry Classic Bold, that restores familiar features such as a five-button utility belt that disappeared from recent devices, in a nod to under-appreciated faithful customers.\n\nMuch of the financial risk of making handsets has been shifted to new manufacturing partner Foxconn Technology Group in exchange for a share of the profits. ""People are now considering pausing before they get off our platform,"" Mr. Chen said.\n\nBGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis said Mr. Chen is trying to turn BlackBerry into ""a software and service company that uses its hardware, which is becoming commoditized, as a way to drive its services. The hardware is just becoming the tool to get you onto the platform. Whether it works or not remains to be seen.""\n\nWith files from Jacquie McNish and Bertrand Marotte\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWith files from Jacquie McNish and Bertrand Marotte.', '""You have to bear with me a little bit,"" Mr. Chen, told analysts on a conference call.\nBlackBerry\'s business continues to decline steadily, five months after shareholder Fairfax Financial Holdings pulled its takeover offer and instead led a refinancing of the Waterloo, Ont.-based company.\nMr. Chen inherited a company whose decline was exacerbated by the disastrous launch last year of the BlackBerry 10 platform, its much-delayed response to iPhone and Android.\nMr. Chen expects to solve the BlackBerry 10 compatibility problem by introducing new server software by November that will enable enterprises to manage any BlackBerry or rival device.\n""People are now considering pausing before they get off our platform,"" Mr. Chen said.']"

The numbers for this quarter may once again be distorted by any remaining write-downs the company’s new management may want to get out of the way as it cleans house and gets ready for the new fiscal year.\n\nBetween the disastrous BB10 launch, the failed sale of the company, huge write-offs of unsold merchandise and another big management shakeup, it seemed that everything that could possibly go wrong from Blackberry did - in spades.\n\nLurching from crisis-to-crisis over the last year weighed heavily on the shares, which dramatically underperformed their peers over the last year.\n\nIn recent months, however, the shares have started to recover. The appointment of John Chen as CEO and the back to basics approach backing away from the consumer business to focus on its core corporate, government and defence markets where ‘nothing but a Blackberry will do’ has been well received by the street.\n\nBlackberry has also benefitted from competitor moves that highlighted the value of the company’s biggest previously hidden asset, the Blackberry Messaging service (BBM) and Facebook paying $19 billion to purchase WhatsApp, a competitive service, reignited interest in Blackberry.\n\nThe company has taken steps to make BBM available on more platforms and one thing traders may be looking for from management will be what plans they have to grow this business and if they are looking to dress it up and spin or sell it off.\n\nThe main themes of this quarter’s results are likely to be transition and cleaning house. Last week, Blackberry announced it has agreed to sell most of its Canadian real estate holdings and finalised a number of previously announced layoffs.\n\nNow that the new management team has been in place for a few months and has had a chance to get the lay of the land, their outlook and plans for the company may also be closely scrutinised.

Leaks are not in fact “distracting, and at their worst downright misleading to our stakeholders,” as Chen claims, but a natural part of the gadget and mobile device ecosystem, and an expression of genuine interest from people who might actually want to purchase your products.\n\nThere’s a reason this open letter of admonition and warning is an exceptional case – other device makers know that ultimately, rumors and early reports at worst generate buzz around products, and at best attract some eyeballs that may otherwise not have been tuned to your company to begin with. Chen, in his post, argues that this latest leak crosses the line into “criminality,” hence the need for legal action.\n\nBut it’s telling that I had to do some Google-fu to figure out leak likely being discussed here, which presumably is this reveal of BlackBerry OS 10.3 from a few days ago.

""The additional capital actions represented a modest level of capital return and still allowed Citi to exceed the required threshold on a quantitative basis.""\n\nTo be clear, the issue here isn\'t so much about the dividends and proposed buybacks per se. Indeed, Citigroup asked only to increase its quarterly distribution to $0.05 per share and repurchase a reasonable $6.4 billion in common stock.\n\nWhile these figures amount to large relative improvements, as the bank currently distributes a mere $0.01 per share each quarter and is operating pursuant to a $1.2 billion repurchase program, they would hardly register on an absolute basis. At $0.20 a share, for instance, its proposed annual dividend yield would remain far south of 1%.\n\nThe issue also isn\'t about Citigroup\'s capital levels. The results of this year\'s stress tests, released last week, showed that Citigroup has more than enough high-quality capital to operate in even the harshest economic scenario. This is why the Fed made a point to note yesterday that Citigroup\'s issues were qualitative, as opposed to quantitative in nature.\n\nSo, what is the issue? The issue, at least in my opinion, is what the denial says about Citigroup\'s operations and the quality of its decision-making at the top. Namely, Corbat and his team were well aware of the reputational damage that would ensue if its capital plan was rejected, but they nevertheless proposed one without being completely certain of the outcome.\n\nTo make matters worse, the bank found itself in an identical situation two years ago. Many analysts and commentators even believe the 2012 denial was a precipitating factor behind former-CEO Vikram Pandit\'s ouster later that same year. It\'s hard to say for sure whether these events were in fact related, but there\'s certainly an air of association, to say the least.\n\nWith this in mind, one has to wonder why Corbat wouldn\'t have acted with greater caution and prudence. Sure, hindsight is 20/20, I get that, but Corbat himself had been urging discretion all along. And it\'s not like he\'s some random guy writing about bank stocks (i.e., me); he\'s the CEO of a multibillion-dollar global banking behemoth with all of the resources and brain power that one could possibly need to make a decision like this.\n\nThe only conclusion I can draw is that his team felt comfortable taking a risk. Like the long line of Corbat\'s predecessors, its current executives chose to gamble with the reputation and prestige of the company as opposed to playing it safe. And this, in turn, is the problem. As Citigroup should know by now, a banker\'s job isn\'t to take risks, it\'s to minimize them.', '""The additional capital actions represented a modest level of capital return and still allowed Citi to exceed the required threshold on a quantitative basis.""\nTo be clear, the issue here isn\'t so much about the dividends and proposed buybacks per se.\nThe issue also isn\'t about Citigroup\'s capital levels.\nThis is why the Fed made a point to note yesterday that Citigroup\'s issues were qualitative, as opposed to quantitative in nature.\nThe issue, at least in my opinion, is what the denial says about Citigroup\'s operations and the quality of its decision-making at the top.']"

In the first case, Bank of America fared considerably poorer in this year\'s Fed-administered stress test than it had forecasted internal. As my colleague Patrick Morris discussed here, the bank greatly underestimated the financial damage the Fed believes it would suffer if the economy took another dive akin to the financial crisis.\n\nAdditionally, there are multiple reasons the bank\'s executives prefer share buybacks over dividends. Among other things, Bank of America\'s stock still trades for a discount to book value, making buybacks a particularly attractive proposition, and Moynihan had previously said he wants to combat the dilutive impact of the financial crisis.\n\nThese issues aside, Bank of America made the right decision. Investors in the bank had been pining for a boosted dividend. Not so much for the increased income, but rather for what it says about the bank\'s fiscal health.\n\nAs I\'ve discussed before, the Fed has set the bar for dividends much higher than for share buybacks. Under the central bank\'s estimation, buybacks are finite in nature, whereas dividends are presumed in the CCAR process to go on indefinitely; the implication being that the latter can consume critical capital in times of need, while the former will not.\n\nThe net result is that Bank of America\'s ability to raise its dividend stands as tangible confirmation of the progress it\'s made since 2009. It means the Fed is satisfied with the bank\'s capital reserves. And it also means regulators are sufficiently convinced of Bank of America\'s future earnings potential.\n\nTo be clear, this by no means implies that Bank of America is now on par with more adroitly managed peers like JPMorgan Chase or Wells Fargo. But it does mean the nation\'s second largest bank by assets is one giant step closer to this objective.', ""Although a handful of lenders had their capital requests denied, Bank of America's was ultimately approved, albeit after the bank submitted an amended request.\nAs I've discussed before, the Fed has set the bar for dividends much higher than for share buybacks.\nThe net result is that Bank of America's ability to raise its dividend stands as tangible confirmation of the progress it's made since 2009.\nIt means the Fed is satisfied with the bank's capital reserves.\nAnd it also means regulators are sufficiently convinced of Bank of America's future earnings potential.""]"

This year 30 banks underwent the tests to determine if they have large enough capital buffers to keep lending through another financial crisis.\n\nFILE - This Tuesday, Oct. 16, 2012, file photo shows the Citibank building in New York. Citigroup cannot raise its dividend or buy back its own stock because it needs better plans to cope with a severe recession, the Federal Reserve ruled Wednesday, March 26, 2014. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)\n\nCiti had asked the Fed\'s permission to buy back $6.4 billion in shares through the first quarter of next year, and to raise its dividend to 5 cents each quarter, up from a penny per quarter now.\n\nNew York-based Citigroup was blocked from raising its dividend in 2012, too, after failing its stress test. Later that year it brought in a new CEO, Mike Corbat, with a mandate to speed up its turnaround. .\n\nCorbat said Wednesday that the company is ""deeply disappointed"" by the Fed decision. The dividend and buyback would have been a ""modest level of capital"" for shareholders, and Citi still would have exceeded requirements for its financial health, he said in a written statement.\n\nThe Fed announcement caused investors to re-assess bank stocks across the board. Citigroup\'s stock was down more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nCLSA analyst Mike Mayo called Citi\'s rejection ""a shocker.""\n\n""Citi needs to make this defeat into victory by improving the pace of restructuring,"" Mayo wrote in a note. That would include selling off businesses and holding managers more accountable, especially after executives had offered reassurances about how the bank is monitoring its finances, Mayo said.\n\nThe Fed said that the capital plans of Citigroup fell short in some areas, including its ability to forecast revenues and losses in parts of its global operations, should they come under economic stress.\n\nAs with Citigroup, the Fed said it found deficiencies in the capital plans of HSBC North America Holdings, RBS Citizens Financial Group, Santander Holdings USA and Zions Bancorp. The central bank, however, approved requests outright from the other 25 tested banks, which included JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, in addition to Bank of America and Goldman Sachs\n\nBefore the financial crisis, Citigroup\'s dividend peaked at $5.40 per quarter in 2007. After eliminating its dividend altogether in 2009, it reinstated a payout in June 2011 at a token penny per quarter, where it remains.\n\nThe dividends and share buybacks that the Fed weighed are important to ordinary investors, and banks. The banks know that their investors suffered big losses in the financial crisis, and they are eager to reward them. Some shareholders, especially retirees, rely on dividends for a portion of their income.\n\nBut raising dividends costs money. The regulators don\'t want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession. Buybacks also are aimed at helping shareholders. By reducing the number of a company\'s outstanding shares, earnings per share can increase.\n\nA handful of banks that won approval from the Fed to raise dividends quickly announced plans to reward investors.\n\nWells Fargo said it would raise its dividend a nickel to 35 cents per share starting in the second quarter. It also boosted its planned share buybacks. Morgan Stanley announced it would double its dividend for the second quarter to 10 cents a share from the current 5 cents. It will also buy back as much as $1 billion of its shares through March 2015. Capital One Financial Corp. expects to buy back $2.5 billion of its shares but maintain its dividend at 30 cents a share.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday follows last week\'s results of the Fed\'s annual ""stress tests."" The central bank determined that the U.S. banking industry is better able to withstand a major economic downturn than at any time since the financial crisis struck in 2008. The Fed said that only one of the 30 biggest banks in the country needed to take more steps to shore up its capital base. That bank was Zions.\n\nThe companies raising dividends and boosting share buybacks should have an advantage in winning investors, said Michael Scanlon, managing director at John Hancock Asset Management.\n\n""From a total return perspective, all this is good,"" he said. ""The Fed is recognizing that there is continuing healing that\'s taking place at the banks,"" he said. ""From a capital standpoint, these institutions are in a far better position than they were a few years ago.""\n\nCitigroup and the other big Wall Street banks, as well as hundreds of others, were bailed out by the government during the crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely. The banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.\n\nThe Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest U.S. banks annually since 2009, the year after the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nUnder the stress tests\' ""severely adverse"" scenario this year, the U.S. would undergo a recession in which unemployment — now at 6.7 percent — would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent.\n\n__', ""Fed blocks Citigroup from raising dividendsWASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve on Wednesday barred Citigroup from raising its dividend or boosting its stock buybacks, saying it's too hard to predict how some parts of the bank's global operation would fare in a sharp economic downturn.\nNew York-based Citigroup was blocked from raising its dividend in 2012, too, after failing its stress test.\nAs with Citigroup, the Fed said it found deficiencies in the capital plans of HSBC North America Holdings, RBS Citizens Financial Group, Santander Holdings USA and Zions Bancorp.\nThe dividends and share buybacks that the Fed weighed are important to ordinary investors, and banks.\nA handful of banks that won approval from the Fed to raise dividends quickly announced plans to reward investors.""]"

It also agreed to repurchase mortgage-backed securities it sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nInvestors welcomed the developments, which underpinned hopes that BofA has moved beyond the 2008 financial crisis and mortgage bust.\n\nShares of BofA rose early Thursday, before giving back gains in the afternoon as the markets went into negative territory. Still, the stock is up more than 9% so far this year, making it the best performer among the ""Big Six"" banks.\n\nRelated: Citi and four other banks stumble in Fed stress tests\n\nBy contrast, there wasn\'t much celebrating at Citigroup\'s headquarters. The Fed rejected the company\'s request to return capital to shareholders, based on certain ""qualitative"" shortfalls. Specifically, the Fed said it was troubled by Citi\'s inability to predict how much it could lose in a severe economic downturn.\n\nCiti CEO Michael Corbat said the bank was ""deeply disappointed"" by the Fed\'s decision, but he argued that the bank is one of the ""best capitalized financial institutions in the world.""\n\nThe rejection took investors by surprise. Citi shares were down more than 5% in trading Thursday. The sell-off added to an already poor start to the year for Citi shares, which are now down 9% since January 1.\n\nThe setback comes weeks after Citi disclosed that federal authorities are investigating the bank\'s Mexican subsidiary, Banamex, for potential money laundering violations.\n\nThe timing of that announcement probably didn\'t help Citi\'s case, especially since it met the ""quantitative"" threshold needed to win Fed approval of its requested $6.4 billion buyback and 5 cent dividend payment hike.\n\nIn fact, BofA and Goldman Sachs (GS) both had to tone down their capital plans after the Fed rejected their initial requests, using the Fed\'s so-called ""mulligan option"" to submit again.\n\nRelated: Taxpayer subsidy for \'Too Big To Fail\' banks? $8.5 billion\n\nBoth would have ""failed"" on a quantitative basis with their original asks, according to Andrew Marquardt, an analyst at Evercore.\n\nThe stress tests suggests that BofA has made significant progress in winding down its financial crisis liabilities and rebuilding its balance sheet. The results also point to continued headwinds for Citi, which has been scaling down its global operations since Corbat took over in 2012.\n\n""BofA has been ahead of Citi in the recovery process for the past few years,"" said Anthony Polini, a banking industry analyst at Raymond James ""Citi is still a few steps behind.""\n\nBut he was quick to add that there is still plenty of ""upside potential"" in Citi shares, which are priced at a sharp discount compared with BofA.\n\nBofA currently trades at about 12 times next year\'s earnings estimates, versus just 9.4 for Citi.\n\nRelated: Fed passes its own stress test\n\nOf course, BofA has far outperformed Citi over the past few years. Shares of BofA have gained more than 130% in since bottoming in 2009. Citi is up just 80%.\n\nPolini expects Citi to begin returning excess capital to shareholders next year. He said 2015 could be a ""banner year"" for share buybacks and dividend hikes in the banking industry.\n\n""This doesn\'t change the long-term story for Citi,"" he said of the Fed\'s decision.

The reality is that Citigroup’s management deserves an F for how it handled the news of the stress test. They may even deserve an F for how they prepared for the stress test.\n\nCitigroup issued a press release on Wednesday confirming that the Fed objected to the capital plan that it submitted. What is sad here, outside of the response, is that Citigroup was only asking for a $6.4 billion common stock repurchase program and an increase of the common stock dividend to $0.05 per share.\n\nThe new dividend yield would have been five times more than it is now, but this was still only going to be a 0.4% yield prior to the reactionary stock drop. Citigroup will be permitted to continue with its current capital actions, which are a mere $1.2 billion for buybacks and a dividend of $0.01 per share per quarter.\n\nCEO Michael Corbat should have led a conference call on Thursday. Instead, he just gave quotes in a press release saying how the bank is deeply disappointed:\n\nWe will continue to work closely with the Fed to better understand their concerns so that we can bring our capital planning process in line with their expectations and meet their standards on a qualitative basis as well. We have not yet made a decision as to when we will resubmit our plan. We clearly are being challenged to meet the highest standards in the CCAR process. Despite whatever shortcomings the Fed saw in our capital planning process, we have made tremendous progress over the past several years in enhancing our capital position and Citi remains one of the best-capitalized financial institutions in the world. We will continue to work incredibly hard to serve our clients and generate the returns our shareholders expect and deserve.\n\nInvestors who had been buying Citi shares prior to the stress tests were expecting that it would get to reinstate a higher dividend. Most banks are back close to pre-recession highs in share price and dividend rates. Not Citigroup. Its $0.01 quarterly common stock dividend is hardly even a fraction of its peak.\n\nCitigroup’s common stock was down 5.8% Thursday, at $47.25 in a 52-week range of $41.60 to $55.28. To show just how bad Thursday’s reaction is: this stock challenged its lows of 2014 on Thursday.\n\nKeefe Bruyette & Woods and Sanford Bernstein both downgraded Citigroup shares on Thursday. Other analysts have expressed serious disappointment, and that $59.90 consensus analyst price target is likely to come down handily in the coming days.\n\nVikram Pandit would have held a conference call to explain what he thought the issues were.

This year, 30 banks underwent the tests to determine if they have large enough capital buffers to keep lending through another financial crisis.\n\nCiti had asked the Fed\'s permission to buy back $6.4 billion in shares through the first quarter of next year and to raise its dividend to 5 cents each quarter, up from a penny per quarter now.\n\nNew York-based Citigroup was blocked from raising its dividend in 2012, too, after failing its stress test. Later that year it brought in a new CEO, Mike Corbat, with a mandate to speed up its turnaround. .\n\nCorbat said yesterday that the company is ""deeply disappointed"" by the Fed decision. The dividend and buyback would have been a ""modest level of capital"" for shareholders, and Citi still would have exceeded requirements for its financial health, he said in a written statement.\n\nThe Fed announcement caused investors to re-assess bank stocks across the board. Citigroup\'s stock was down more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nCLSA analyst Mike Mayo called Citi\'s rejection ""a shocker.""\n\n""Citi needs to make this defeat into victory by improving the pace of restructuring,"" Mayo wrote in a note. That would include selling off businesses and holding managers more accountable, especially after executives had offered reassurances about how the bank is monitoring its finances, Mayo said.\n\nThe Fed said that the capital plans of Citigroup fell short in some areas, including its ability to forecast revenue and losses in parts of its global operations, should they come under economic stress.\n\nAs with Citigroup, the Fed said it found deficiencies in the capital plans of HSBC North America Holdings, RBS Citizens Financial Group, Santander Holdings USA and Zions Bancorp.

Bloomberg reported that shareholders of Bank of America Corp. have pressured Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan to raise the penny-a-share dividend for years.BoA’s quarterly dividend will rise to $0.05 as regulators have approved the North Carolina’s company’s capital plan. In March 2011, Moynihan told investors that the firm could restore part of the dividend, which was slashed to just $0.01 in 2009 to preserve capital.\n\nAlong with increasing the dividend beginning in the second quarter of this year, Bank of America also announced it will repurchase $4 billion in common stock, which increases earnings per share.\n\n“We know that increasing the common dividend is important to our shareholders and we are pleased that we can continue to return excess capital through both repurchases and dividends,” said CEO Brian Moynihan.\n\nBank of America was not alone in this news. Wells Fargo, BB&T and twenty-two other banks also had their capital plans approved by the Fed.\n\nWells Fargo will increase its dividend to 35 cents per quarter, up from 30 cents, and repurchase nearly 350 million common stock shares. BB&T said it will offer a “conservative increase” to its quarterly dividend. JPMorgan Chase will increase its quarterly dividend to 40 cents from 38 cents and buy back $6.5 billion in shares.\n\nFive major banks, among them HSBC and Citigroup, had their plans rejected, which means they cannot institute a buyback program or increase dividends. This is the fourth year in which the banks have been required to seek approval to return capital to shareholders.\n\nThe Fed recently released the results of its stress tests, which test the largest banks in the United States on whether they are able to keep minimum capital ratios. While Bank of America passed the test, its capital levels were lower than many other banks, and it had to resubmit its capital plan after some ratios fell lower than is required.\n\nThis is the first dividend change at Bank of America since 2009. In mid-2008, the quarterly dividend at BoA was 64 cents per share, which fell to just 1 cent as the financial crisis deepened. Bank of America shares closed at $17.18 on Wednesday, a far cry from the $50+ range in 2007.', 'Shortly after approval from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, Bank of America announced plans to return dividends to shareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase will increase its quarterly dividend to 40 cents from 38 cents and buy back $6.5 billion in shares.\nThis is the first dividend change at Bank of America since 2009.\nIn mid-2008, the quarterly dividend at BoA was 64 cents per share, which fell to just 1 cent as the financial crisis deepened.\nBank of America shares closed at $17.18 on Wednesday, a far cry from the $50+ range in 2007.']"

Washington - The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday barred Citigroup from raising its dividend or boosting its stock buybacks, saying it's too hard to predict how some parts of the bank's global operation would fare in a sharp economic downturn. It was a setback for Citigroup, one of America's biggest banks, which has been cutting jobs and trimming some businesses in an effort to improve its finances. Citi was the biggest of five banks whose plans the Fed rejected as part of its so-called “stress tests,” an annual check-up of the nation's biggest financial institutions. This year 30 banks underwent the tests to determine if they have large enough capital buffers to keep lending through another financial crisis. Citi had asked the Fed's permission to buy back $6.4 billion in shares through the first quarter of next year, and to raise its dividend to 5 cents each quarter, up from a penny per quarter now.\n\nNew York-based Citigroup was blocked from raising its dividend in 2012, too, after failing its stress test.\n\nLater that year it brought in a new chief executive, Mike Corbat, with a mandate to speed up its turnaround. .\n\nCorbat said Wednesday that the company is “deeply disappointed” by the Fed decision.\n\nThe dividend and buyback would have been a “modest level of capital” for shareholders, and Citi still would have exceeded requirements for its financial health, he said in a written statement.\n\nThe Fed announcement caused investors to re-assess bank stocks across the board.\n\nCitigroup's stock was down more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nCLSA analyst Mike Mayo called Citi's rejection “a shocker.”\n\n“Citi needs to make this defeat into victory by improving the pace of restructuring,” Mayo wrote in a note.\n\nThat would include selling off businesses and holding managers more accountable, especially after executives had offered reassurances about how the bank is monitoring its finances, Mayo said.\n\nThe Fed said that the capital plans of Citigroup fell short in some areas, including its ability to forecast revenues and losses in parts of its global operations, should they come under economic stress.\n\nAs with Citigroup, the Fed said it found deficiencies in the capital plans of HSBC North America Holdings, RBS Citizens Financial Group, Santander Holdings USA and Zions Bancorp.\n\nThe central bank, however, approved requests outright from the other 25 tested banks, which included JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, in addition to Bank of America and Goldman Sachs\n\nBefore the financial crisis, Citigroup's dividend peaked at $5.40 per quarter in 2007.\n\nAfter eliminating its dividend altogether in 2009, it reinstated a payout in June 2011 at a token penny per quarter, where it remains.\n\nThe dividends and share buybacks that the Fed weighed are important to ordinary investors, and banks.\n\nThe banks know that their investors suffered big losses in the financial crisis, and they are eager to reward them.\n\nSome shareholders, especially retirees, rely on dividends for a portion of their income.\n\nBut raising dividends costs money.\n\nThe regulators don't want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession.\n\nBuybacks also are aimed at helping shareholders.\n\nBy reducing the number of a company's outstanding shares, earnings per share can increase.\n\nA handful of banks that won approval from the Fed to raise dividends quickly announced plans to reward investors.\n\nWells Fargo said it would raise its dividend a nickel to 35 cents per share starting in the second quarter.\n\nIt also boosted its planned share buybacks.\n\nMorgan Stanley announced it would double its dividend for the second quarter to 10 cents a share from the current 5 cents.\n\nIt will also buy back as much as $1 billion of its shares through March 2015.\n\nCapital One Financial expects to buy back $2.5 billion of its shares but maintain its dividend at 30 cents a share.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday follows last week's results of the Fed's annual “stress tests.”\n\nThe central bank determined that the US banking industry is better able to withstand a major economic downturn than at any time since the financial crisis struck in 2008.\n\nThe Fed said that only one of the 30 biggest banks in the country needed to take more steps to shore up its capital base.\n\nThat bank was Zions.\n\nThe companies raising dividends and boosting share buybacks should have an advantage in winning investors, said Michael Scanlon, managing director at John Hancock Asset Management.\n\n“From a total return perspective, all this is good,” he said.\n\n“The Fed is recognising that there is continuing healing that's taking place at the banks,” he said.\n\n“From a capital standpoint, these institutions are in a far better position than they were a few years ago.”\n\nCitigroup and the other big Wall Street banks, as well as hundreds of others, were bailed out by the government during the crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely.\n\nThe banks have mostly repaid the taxpayer bailouts.\n\nThe Fed has conducted stress tests of the largest US banks annually since 2009, the year after the financial crisis plunged the country into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nUnder the stress tests' “severely adverse” scenario this year, the US would undergo a recession in which unemployment - now at 6.7 percent -would reach 11.25 percent, stocks would lose nearly half their value and home prices would plunge 25 percent. - Sapa-AP"", 'Fed blocks CitigroupPeople exit a Citibank branch in New York.\nNew York-based Citigroup was blocked from raising its dividend in 2012, too, after failing its stress test.\nAs with Citigroup, the Fed said it found deficiencies in the capital plans of HSBC North America Holdings, RBS Citizens Financial Group, Santander Holdings USA and Zions Bancorp.\nThe banks know that their investors suffered big losses in the financial crisis, and they are eager to reward them.\nA handful of banks that won approval from the Fed to raise dividends quickly announced plans to reward investors.']"

It was the second time in three years that Citi failed a federal stress test.\n\nCiti’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, said he was “deeply disappointed” by the Fed’s findings, asserting that the nation’s third-largest bank by assets was “one of the best-capitalized financial institutions in the world.”\n\nCorbat complained that, because of past problems, the bank is “being challenged to meet the highest standards.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fed said it has been raising its standards for how banks assess risk and plan to distribute capital.\n\nFed officials also rejected the capital distribution plan of the fifth bank, Zions Bancorporation, but for other reasons. The Fed was worried about Zions’ financial health during an extreme financial downturn. The firm’s subsidiaries include California Bank & Trust of San Diego, with 102 branches, mostly in Southern California.\n\nThe remaining 25 banks, among the nation’s 30 largest banking corporations, received regulatory approval to pay cash dividends and repurchase shares after the tests indicated that the firms could withstand a severe economic shock.\n\nTwo of those companies — Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. — received approval only after scaling back their capital distribution plans in the last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFed officials said this year’s results showed that the nation’s largest banks now were better able to handle a deep recession than they were when the first stress tests were done in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nFed Gov. Daniel K. Tarullo, who oversees the central banks regulatory functions, said banks and regulators have more work to do “to raise expectations for the quality of risk management.”\n\nThe 30 banks have a combined $13.5 trillion in assets, nearly 80% of the U.S. industry. This year, the Fed expanded the number of banks tested to 30 from 18.\n\nZions’ plan was rejected because it would leave the firm at risk of failure in a deep recession. It was the only bank that effectively failed the first round of stress tests released last week. Those tests did not take into account each bank’s dividend and stock-buyback plans for this year.\n\nZions said it would submit a new capital plan for regulatory approval. Last week, the bank said it had divested some high-risk holdings to help it raise a key measurement the Fed uses in its tests.\n\nThe other three banks that, along with Citigroup, had problems in their planning processes were HSBC North America Holdings Inc., RBS Citizens Financial Group Inc. and Santander Holdings USA Inc.\n\nAll three are U.S. subsidiaries of major foreign banks. The Fed tested only the subsidiaries.\n\nExecutives at the three banks said they were well capitalized but would continue to work to meet the Fed’s rising standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The Fed requires us to improve our process, and we will do so,” said Gerard Mattia, chief financial officer of HSBC North America.\n\nThe Fed said Citi and the three foreign-owned subsidiaries showed weaknesses in drawing up their capital distribution plans, such as how they assessed risk and modeled potential losses.\n\nThe banks can’t increase their dividend payments or stock buybacks this year, but are allowed to duplicate last year’s distributions when they resubmit new plans to the Fed for approval.\n\nBank of America and Goldman Sachs reduced their planned capital distributions to shareholders after getting the results from the first round of tests last week. Under their original distribution plans, both firms had ratios of debt to equity that were too high, the stress tests found.\n\nCitigroup will be allowed to keep paying its tiny annual dividend of 4 cents a share through the first quarter of next year and to continue a modest $1.2-billion program to buy back its own common stock.\n\nBut the Fed rejected Citi’s plan to reward shareholders with a $6.4-billion stock buyback over the coming year and to increase the annual dividend to 20 cents a share.\n\njim.puzzanghera@latimes.com\n\nscott.reckard@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPuzzanghera reported from Washington and Reckard from Los Angeles.', 'WASHINGTON — Federal regulators rejected plans by Citigroup Inc. and four other large U.S. banks for dividend payments and stock buybacks after the latest round of stress tests.\nFed officials also rejected the capital distribution plan of the fifth bank, Zions Bancorporation, but for other reasons.\nIt was the only bank that effectively failed the first round of stress tests released last week.\nThose tests did not take into account each bank’s dividend and stock-buyback plans for this year.\nUnder their original distribution plans, both firms had ratios of debt to equity that were too high, the stress tests found.']"

This year 30 banks underwent the tests to determine if they have large enough capital buffers to keep lending through another financial crisis.\n\nCiti had asked the Fed’s permission to buy back $6.4 billion in shares through the first quarter of next year, and to raise its dividend to 5 cents each quarter, up from a penny per quarter now.\n\nNew York-based Citigroup was blocked from raising its dividend in 2012, too, after failing its stress test. Later that year it brought in a new CEO, Mike Corbat, with a mandate to speed up its turnaround. .\n\nCorbat said Wednesday that the company is “deeply disappointed” by the Fed decision. The dividend and buyback would have been a “modest level of capital” for shareholders, and Citi still would have exceeded requirements for its financial health, he said in a written statement.\n\nThe Fed announcement caused investors to re-assess bank stocks across the board. Citigroup’s stock was down more than 5 per cent in after-hours trading.\n\nCLSA analyst Mike Mayo called Citi’s rejection “a shocker.”\n\n“Citi needs to make this defeat into victory by improving the pace of restructuring,” Mayo wrote in a note. That would include selling off businesses and holding managers more accountable, especially after executives had offered reassurances about how the bank is monitoring its finances, Mayo said.\n\nThe Fed said that the capital plans of Citigroup fell short in some areas, including its ability to forecast revenues and losses in parts of its global operations, should they come under economic stress.\n\nAs with Citigroup, the Fed said it found deficiencies in the capital plans of HSBC North America Holdings, RBS Citizens Financial Group, Santander Holdings USA and Zions Bancorp. The central bank, however, approved requests outright from the other 25 tested banks, which included JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, in addition to Bank of America and Goldman Sachs\n\nBefore the financial crisis, Citigroup’s dividend peaked at $5.40 per quarter in 2007. After eliminating its dividend altogether in 2009, it reinstated a payout in June 2011 at a token penny per quarter, where it remains.\n\nThe dividends and share buybacks that the Fed weighed are important to ordinary investors, and banks. The banks know that their investors suffered big losses in the financial crisis, and they are eager to reward them. Some shareholders, especially retirees, rely on dividends for a portion of their income.\n\nBut raising dividends costs money. The regulators don’t want banks to deplete their capital reserves, making them vulnerable in another recession. Buybacks also are aimed at helping shareholders. By reducing the number of a company’s outstanding shares, earnings per share can increase.\n\nA handful of banks that won approval from the Fed to raise dividends quickly announced plans to reward investors.\n\nWells Fargo said it would raise its dividend a nickel to 35 cents per share starting in the second quarter. It also boosted its planned share buybacks. Morgan Stanley announced it would double its dividend for the second quarter to 10 cents a share from the current 5 cents. It will also buy back as much as $1 billion of its shares through March 2015. Capital One Financial Corp. expects to buy back $2.5 billion of its shares but maintain its dividend at 30 cents a share.\n\nThe announcement Wednesday follows last week’s results of the Fed’s annual “stress tests.” The central bank determined that the U.S. banking industry is better able to withstand a major economic downturn than at any time since the financial crisis struck in 2008. The Fed said that only one of the 30 biggest banks in the country needed to take more steps to shore up its capital base. That bank was Zions.\n\nThe companies raising dividends and boosting share buybacks should have an advantage in winning investors, said Michael Scanlon, managing director at John Hancock Asset Management.\n\n“From a total return perspective, all this is good,” he said. “The Fed is recognizing that there is continuing healing that’s taking place at the banks,” he said. “From a capital standpoint, these institutions are in a far better position than they were a few years ago.”\n\nCitigroup and the other big Wall Street banks, as well as hundreds of others, were bailed out by the government during the crisis. The banking industry has been recovering steadily since then, with overall profits rising and banks starting to lend more freely.

On 26 March, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed removing many protections for the amphibians. The species is currently on the endangered species list.\n\nThe agency suggests recovery of the rare animal has come far enough where the species should be moved from the endangered category, and be re-listed as threatened. The decision to reclassify the toad comes after a 12-month study by the agency.\n\n""After review of all available scientific and commercial information, we find that reclassifying the arroyo toad as threatened is warranted, and, therefore, we propose to reclassify the arroyo toad as threatened under the Act,"" the agency wrote [pdf] in the announcement of their decision.\n\nChanging the category of protections offered to the species has raised the fury of some environmental groups. Several organizations feel populations of arroyo toads have not improved enough to be reclassified.\n\n""It\'s clearly premature to lower the arroyo toad\'s status from endangered to threatened. Protections under the Endangered Species Act have led to conservation actions that have prevented the toad\'s extinction, but recovery criteria haven\'t been met and threats remain,"" Collette Adkins Giese, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a press release. That group works to protect rare amphibians and reptiles.\n\nArroyo toads are olive green, light brown or gray. Anaxyrus californicus displays a distinctive light-colored ""V"" that marks their forehead and eyelids. The amphibians are native to central and southern California, as well as the Baja Peninsula. They live in rivers and streams, and breed in shallow pools and on sandbars.\n\nThese amphibians were first listed as an endangered species in 1993. Population declines of the species were triggered by the construction of dams and flood control systems, along with general encroachment of humans on territories where the species lived. This loss of their natural habitats combined with competition from other frogs, competing for resources, helped reduce populations to just 24 percent of their population.\n\nIn 2001, the wildlife service set aside more than 182,000 acres of land to protect the species. This area was reduced in size by more than 90 percent in 2005.\n\nBy 1993, the frogs were known to exist in just 22 river basins within the United States. Today, the animal is found in 25 American basins, as well as 10 in Mexico.\n\nThe decision to reclassify the species was announced on the Federal Register.

The lesser prairie chicken has habitats in five states, including Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. The ruling could restrict oil and natural gas exploration in West Texas.\n\nAll three Republican West Texas Congressmen spoke out against the ruling.\n\nCongressman Randy Neugebauer (R-TX) released the following statement: “I’m incredibly disappointed by the Fish and Wildlife Service’s decision to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as threatened,” Neugebauer said.\n\n“The timing of this decision is being driven by activist lawsuits, instead of what’s best for the species and the communities near its habitat. This listing is a blow to West Texas and every state that has Lesser Prairie Chicken habitat.\n\n“What’s worse is that this listing is unnecessary. The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ Range-Wide Conservation Plan—an unprecedented collaboration between farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and governments across five states—would have successfully conserved habitat and fully recovered the species. But instead of cooperative conservation, we’re getting more Washington-Knows-Best regulations. Decisions like this will discourage innovative conservation efforts in the private sector, and ultimately do more harm than good.”\n\nCongressman Mike Conaway (R- Midland) also weighed in: “I am disappointed in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Director Ashe had the opportunity to build a new model of cooperative conservation and he failed. The purpose of the range wide plan was to preclude a listing. It was to show that a voluntary, stakeholder process could preserved the Lesser Prairie Chicken. Stakeholders deserved the opportunity to see if their efforts would be successful.\n\n""The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the oil and gas industry, and farmers and ranchers did an incredible job of putting together a Range-Wide Conservation Plan, only to have Director Ashe disregard the potential of voluntary efforts to preserve the Lesser Prairie Chicken. As of March 21, 2014, nearly 4 million acres of land had been enrolled in the plan and more than $26 million in non-federal money had been committed. Today’s decision to list the Lesser Prairie Chicken as threatened certainly does not encourage an atmosphere of trust and cooperation.”\n\nAnd finally, Congressman Mac Thornberry (R- Clarendon) had the most pointed comments of the three congressmen:', 'Fish and Wildlife Service ruled that the lesser prairie chicken is a ""threatened"" species and is entitled to protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\nThe lesser prairie chicken has habitats in five states, including Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nThe ruling could restrict oil and natural gas exploration in West Texas.\nThis listing is a blow to West Texas and every state that has Lesser Prairie Chicken habitat.\nIt was to show that a voluntary, stakeholder process could preserved the Lesser Prairie Chicken.']"

The move by the Obama administration is expected to draw criticism from oil companies located in the state.\n\nThe species is now categorized as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

To get the hell out of Texas where a whole lot of people are not thrilled with the fact that the chicken, a Texas native, has been taken under the protective wing of the federal government and placed on the threatened species list by the folks over at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe lesser prairie chicken is a member of the grouse family and distinguished from its relative, the greater prairie chicken, by being a bit smaller. That\'s pretty much the only difference. The lesser prairie chicken is found in five states, including Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle. There\'s been talk of putting the bird on the threatened list for a while now since its natural habitat -- comprised of sandhills and prairies and places like the Llano Estacado -- is vulnerable to destruction. Today U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finally pulled the trigger, so to speak, and put the bird on the list:\n\nIn response to the rapid and severe decline of the lesser prairie-chicken, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today announced the final listing of the species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), as well as a final special rule under section 4(d) of the ESA that will limit regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from this listing. Under the law, a ""threatened"" listing means the species is likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future; it is a step below ""endangered"" under the ESA and allows for more flexibility in how the Act\'s protections are implemented.\n\nNot a big deal, right? A species of bird gets a little federal protection that means a little consideration, right? Well, no, that\'s not all there is to it, according to Sen. John Cornyn.\n\nCornyn issued a statement on Thursday on the lesser prairie chicken situation. (Spoiler alert: He\'s agin\' it.) Cornyn was not thrilled:\n\n""Today\'s decision, which has real-world consequences for Texas families, landowners and businesses, is a missed opportunity to acknowledge Texans\' unprecedented conservation efforts. I will continue to fight to reform this process so job creators and local officials have a say. I\'m disappointed the Obama Administration made this decision based on arbitrary deadlines set in a closed-door meeting, ignoring the ongoing efforts by Texas landowners and businesses.""\n\nBasically, when an animal is placed on the threatened list, this changes how the animal can be handled. Killing it is obviously not cool and if you have, say, a bunch of lesser prairie chickens on your land it can hamper what you do with said land. If a pipeline is being laid to tote oil, as is often happening in Texas these days with all the shale oil booms going, a lesser prairie chicken can severely cramp the pipeline project\'s style. Protected birds and other animals have to be considered and being considered according to federal guidelines can cost money and time. Thus, people have been pushing back on the whole lesser prairie chicken thing for years now.\n\nWhether Cornyn and others like it or not, it\'s finally happened. The bird is on the threatened list and the protections that come with being on that list are due to kick in within 30 days. Cornyn had previously written a strongly worded letter arguing against the bird being put on the endangered species list. The note might have paid off since, despite the fact that the birds have lost more than 80 percent of their habitat and their numbers have dropped to a record-low of about 17,000 birds in 2012, the lesser prairie chicken has been listed as ""threatened"" and not outright ""endangered."" Being on the threatened list allows for more flexibility in how the birds are handled. Luckily for everyone, being on the list has no impact on the lesser prairie chicken jokes we can tell.\n\nHow does a lesser prairie chicken become a greater prairie chicken? Practice and steroids, little one. And maybe a little tap dancing.', 'The lesser prairie chicken is a member of the grouse family and distinguished from its relative, the greater prairie chicken, by being a bit smaller.\nThe lesser prairie chicken is found in five states, including Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle.\nThus, people have been pushing back on the whole lesser prairie chicken thing for years now.\nLuckily for everyone, being on the list has no impact on the lesser prairie chicken jokes we can tell.\nHow does a lesser prairie chicken become a greater prairie chicken?']"

The Obama administration announced Thursday it is placing the lesser prairie chicken on a list of threatened species, a move that could affect oil and gas drilling, wind farms and other activities in Kansas and four other states.\n\nGov. Sam Brownback criticized the move as a federal overreach and said the state is looking for ways to respond. Kansas environmental groups’ reactions were mixed.\n\nKansas legislators, in anticipation of a federal decision, have been advancing a bill that would prohibit federal officials in Kansas from trying to enforce federal laws protecting the lesser prairie chicken. Called the State Sovereignty Over Non-Migratory Wildlife Act, the measure has been approved by the Senate and is pending in the House. Critics of the bill have said the state can’t trump federal wildlife protection laws.\n\nThursday’s decision by the Fish and Wildlife Service is a step below “endangered” status and allows for more flexibility in how protections for the bird will be carried out under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nDan Ashe, the agency’s director, said he knows the decision will be unpopular with governors in the five affected states — Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico — but said the agency was following the best science available.\n\n“The lesser prairie-chicken is in dire straits,” Ashe said in an interview. “The bird is in decline and has been in decline for more than a decade.”\n\nBrownback disagreed. “This is an overreach on the part of the federal government, and I am concerned about the effect this designation will have on Kansans and the Kansas economy,” he said. “We are looking at possible responses on this issue.”\n\nThe prairie chicken, a type of grouse known for its colorful feathers and stout build, has lost more than 80 percent of its traditional habitat, mostly because of human activity such as oil and gas drilling, ranching and construction of power lines and wind turbines, Ashe said. The bird, which weighs from 1-1/2 to 2 pounds, has also been severely impacted by the region’s ongoing drought.\n\nBiologists say a major problem is that prairie chickens fear tall structures, where predators such as hawks can perch and spot them. Wind turbines, electricity transmission towers and drilling rigs are generally the tallest objects on the plains.\n\nLast year, the prairie chicken’s population across the five states declined to fewer than 18,000 birds — nearly 50 percent lower than 2012 population estimates.\n\nA conservation plan adopted by the five states has a goal of increasing the population to 67,000 birds.\n\nThe listing decision, which will take effect around May 1, includes a special rule that Ashe said will allow officials and private landowners in the five affected states to manage conservation efforts. The rule, which Ashe called unprecedented, specifies that activities such as oil and gas drilling and utility line maintenance that are covered under a five-state conservation plan adopted last year will be allowed to continue.\n\nThe plan, developed by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, establishes that conservation practices carried out through usual agricultural and energy development are not subject to further regulation under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nWhile Brownback criticized Thursday’s decision, Ron Klataske, of Audubon of Kansas, said the listing should help improve nesting and brood habitat.\n\n“It is unfortunate that the species is so decimated by many land use activities, including some federal subsidizes that facilitated in recent decades the conversion of grasslands to cultivation, but the good thing is that the focus can now turn to measures that can be implemented to improve habitat conditions,” Klataske said.\n\nBut other environmentalists said the federal action has “unprecedented loopholes” that will endanger the bird.\n\nOil and gas drilling and other destructive activities will be allowed to continue in exchange for voluntary conservation plans, according to Erik Molvar, a biologist with WildEarth Guardians, and Jay Lininger, a scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n“This is an emergency situation that requires the strongest protections possible,” said Lininger. “Instead, the Fish and Wildlife Service turned its back and relied on voluntary conservation plans that only amount to a wink and a nod with no accountability,” he said.\n\nOklahoma’s attorney general filed a lawsuit this month over the Obama administration’s decision to settle a lawsuit with an environmental group over the listing status of the lesser prairie chicken and other species. Attorney General Scott Pruitt claims in the lawsuit that federal agencies are colluding with like-minded special interest groups and using “sue and settle” tactics that encourage lawsuits that can be settled on terms favorable to the groups that filed them.\n\nAshe denied collusion with any group and said the agency hopes to avoid litigation over the listing decision.\n\nOil and gas companies, ranchers and other landowners have pledged to devote more than 3 million acres in the five states toward conserving the bird’s habitat. Most of the acreage was set aside in the aim to prevent the bird from being given federal protection as a threatened species, but Ashe said states and private landowners will play a significant role after the listing decision.\n\n“The key thing is, states will remain in the driver’s seat in management and conservation of this bird,” he said.', 'The Obama administration announced Thursday it is placing the lesser prairie chicken on a list of threatened species, a move that could affect oil and gas drilling, wind farms and other activities in Kansas and four other states.\nKansas legislators, in anticipation of a federal decision, have been advancing a bill that would prohibit federal officials in Kansas from trying to enforce federal laws protecting the lesser prairie chicken.\nCritics of the bill have said the state can’t trump federal wildlife protection laws.\nOklahoma’s attorney general filed a lawsuit this month over the Obama administration’s decision to settle a lawsuit with an environmental group over the listing status of the lesser prairie chicken and other species.\nAshe denied collusion with any group and said the agency hopes to avoid litigation over the listing decision.']"

USFWS wants to downlist the arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus) from Endangered to Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\n\nThough USFWS says that wouldn\'t change the protection the toad enjoys, moving the species onto the Threatened list would open the possibility that the agency could enact special rules that would erode the species protection.\n\nUSFWS says it has no plans to enact any such special rules for the arroyo toad at present. Known as ""4(d) rules"" after the section of the Endangered Species Act that allows them, such special rules are often written to reduce some protections for other Threatened species, such as gray wolves.\n\n""It\'s clearly premature to lower the arroyo toad\'s status from endangered to threatened,"" said biologist Collette Adkins Giese, who works on amphibians and reptiles with the Center for Biological Diversity. ""Protections under the Endangered Species Act have led to conservation actions that have prevented the toad\'s extinction, but recovery criteria haven\'t been met and threats remain.""\n\nUSFWS\' recovery plan for the species sets 20 distinct populations of the toad as a threshold: there are just 17 such populations in California.\n\nThe arroyo toad is a small, warty amphibian that was once found in much of coastal California. When it was first listed as Endangered in 1994, the toad\'s range across California had shrunk considerably due to a wide range of factors from development of its habitat, diversion or alteration of native streams, and introduction of predators such as bullfrogs.\n\nOne of the biggest factors threatening arroyo toads in California is drought: dry spells can eliminate the shallow, still pools the toads prefer for laying eggs. And USFWS says in its proposal to downlist the toad that the current extreme drought gripping the state is threatening toad populations in most of the river basins in which the species still manages to survive.\n\nNonetheless, the agency has determined that downlisting the toad is warranted, prompted in part by legal action from the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation. Depending on the results of a 61-day public comment period starting Thursday, that downlisting could become official in August.\n\nThe arroyo toad is found in river basins from Monterey County\'s San Antonio River to a few drainages in Northern Baja California. For the most part a coastal species, the arroyo toad does make it inland as far as the Santa Ana and San Jacinto river drainages, and a few toads have been reported from desert rivers including the Mojave and the Whitewater.\n\nThe incredibly informative website californiaherps.com offers this video of a male arroyo toad singing in a creek in San Bernardino County. The toads are well-camouflaged against their riverside habitat, and are often so hard to see that they\'re trampled by hikers, equestrians, and livestock. Low-water river crossings are especially perilous for the toads, as the shallow water in those crossings strongly resembles the shallow natural pools the toads prefer to lounge in.\n\nAlong with bullfrogs, introduced fish and crayfish will readily eat the toads and their tadpoles. That\'s despite the toads\' ability to secrete a potent poison, consisting mainly of bufotoxins, from glands on its skin. Bufotoxin\'s effects can range from irritation to seizures and death, even in much larger humans, but bullfrogs, garter snakes, and a few other predators have an apparent immunity to the poison. The toads themselves eat invertebrates, with most of their diet composed of ants found on trees.\n\nOne of the reasons the toad is in trouble is its very specific habitat demands: the toad requires wooded streamside vegetation (with ants) for most of the year, sandy, exposed banks for burrowing, and slow-water, predator-free pools for egg laying. Those pools must have either sandy or gravelly bottoms without silt, and must also be devoid of vegetation that could entangle the frogs\' egg masses.\n\nThat\'s a habitat type that is about as vulnerable to human disturbance as you\'re likely to find in California, vulnerable to suburban development; pollution; siltation from grazing, fires, or off-road vehicles; invasion by competing or predatory species; and drought.\n\nThough USFWS says it has no 4(d) rules planned for the toads, such rules are often used to provide management flexibility when Threatened species come into conflict with humans. The gray wolf 4(d) rule referred to earlier allowed state game officials to shoot wolves in Minnesota if they were known to have attacked livestock; another 4(d) rule enacted after the polar bear was listed as Threatened in 2008 allowed non-lethal control of the bears that would otherwise have been considered a harassment ""take"" of the species.\n\nCloser to home, USFWS developed 4(d) rules for the Threatened California gnatcatcher in 1993 that allowed development of gnatcatcher habitat -- legally considered a ""take"" under the Endangered Species Act -- as long as the development took place as part of a Natural Communities Conservation Plan managed by the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Under the 4(d) rules for the gnatcatcher, dozens of developments have been allowed in gnatcatcher habitat since the controversial listing.\n\nWhether USFWS will propose 4(d) rules for the arroyo toad at some later date remains to be seen. We\'ll be watching.', 'USFWS wants to downlist the arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus) from Endangered to Threatened under the U.S.\nEndangered Species Act.\nThe incredibly informative website californiaherps.com offers this video of a male arroyo toad singing in a creek in San Bernardino County.\nUnder the 4(d) rules for the gnatcatcher, dozens of developments have been allowed in gnatcatcher habitat since the controversial listing.\nWhether USFWS will propose 4(d) rules for the arroyo toad at some later date remains to be seen.']"

Under the law, a “threatened” listing means the species is likely to become in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future; it is a step below “endangered” under the ESA.\n\n“The lesser prairie-chicken is in dire straits,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe. The lesser prairie-chicken population, due largely to habitat loss and ongoing drought in the southern Great Plains, has been reduced in the past 15 years by an estimated 84 percent.\n\n“Our determination that it warrants listing as a threatened species with a special rule acknowledges the unprecedented partnership efforts and leadership of the five range states for management of the species,” Ashe said in the notification.\n\nFWS also included a final special rule under section 4(d) of the ESA that is supposed to limit regulatory impacts on landowners and businesses from the listing. The rule will allow the five range states of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado, to continue to manage conservation efforts for the species and avoid further regulation of activities such as oil and gas development and utility line maintenance that are covered under the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ (WAFWA) range-wide conservation plan.\n\nThe special rule also says conservation practices through the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative and through “ongoing normal agricultural practices on existing cultivated land” are in compliance with the ESA and not subject to further regulation.\n\nThe agency said it placed this rule in recognition of “the significant and ongoing efforts of states and landowners to conserve the lesser prairie-chicken.”\n\nRep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, who is part of an ESA Working Group formed by House Republicans, said he is “incredibly disappointed” with FWS’s decision.\n\n“The timing of this decision is being driven by activist lawsuits, instead of what’s best for the species and the communities near its habitat,” he said.\n\nNeugebauer, who helped introduce a bill that requires FWS to provide states with the data they are using to justify their listing decisions, said the listing of the lesser prairie-chicken is unnecessary because the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ developed the Range-Wide Conservation Plan as a collaboration between farmers, ranchers, energy producers, and governments across five states.\n\n“But instead of cooperative conservation, we’re getting more Washington-Knows-Best regulations,” he said. “Decisions like this will discourage innovative conservation efforts in the private sector, and ultimately do more harm than good.”\n\nThe Natural Resources Committee will consider H.R. 4317, the State, Tribal, and Local Species Transparency and Recovery Act in a full committee hearing on April 8, 2014.\n\n#30\n\nFor more news, go to www.agri-pulse.com', 'Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) today announced its final listing of the lesser prairie-chicken as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\nFWS said it determined that the lesser prairie-chicken is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future and warrants listing as “threatened” under the ESA.\n“The lesser prairie-chicken is in dire straits,” said U.S.\nFish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe.\nThe lesser prairie-chicken population, due largely to habitat loss and ongoing drought in the southern Great Plains, has been reduced in the past 15 years by an estimated 84 percent.']"

But a threatened decision still means oil and gas companies, and other industries such as wind energy and farming, must seek a permit in order to operate in the grouse’s range.\n\nThe listing goes into effect around May 1.\n\nDan Ashe, the agency\'s director, said in an interview with the Associated Press he knows the decision will be unpopular with governors in the five affected states — Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico — but said the agency was following the best science available.\n\n""The lesser prairie-chicken is in dire straits,"" Ashe said in the interview. ""The bird is in decline and has been in decline for more than a decade.""\n\nThe prairie chicken, a type of grouse known for its colorful feathers and stout build, has lost more than 80 percent of its traditional habitat, mostly because of human activity such as oil and gas drilling, ranching and construction of power lines and wind turbines, Ashe told the AP. The bird, which weighs from 1-1/2 to 2 pounds, has also been severely impacted by the region\'s ongoing drought.\n\nThe grouse roams across roughly 40 million acres in the five-states, including a chunk of the Permian Basin.\n\n“While we are extremely disappointed in this decision, we feel like there are a couple of silver linings,” said Ben Shepperd, president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association.\n\nThe ruling also included an exemption that will allow the five states to continue managing efforts to protect the chicken through the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies Range Wide Plan. The Fish and Wildlife ruling establishes that those conservation practices through agricultural and energy development will not face further regulation under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nAhead of the listing, backers of the plan touted enrollment and pushed companies to enroll. Shepperd said there will be a renewed push as Fish and Wildlife granted companies another 30 days to enroll in the Range Wide Plan.\n\n“This listing will have a devastating impact on economic activities for those folks not enrolled in one of the conservation plans,” Shepperd said. Other plans in place include a Bureau of Land Management conservation agreement in New Mexico.\n\nIn the last three weeks, Shepperd said the five-state plan reached 40 companies who spent $21 million on conservation efforts that also enrolled 4 million acres in program. The majority of them are PBPA members, he said.\n\nShepperd also said at a Thursday luncheon that Ashe was informing senators of his decision, but he was unsure of what to expect despite the volunteer conservation efforts.\n\n“This is extremely impressive one way or the other, and we are done with this fight — at least on the level it is being fought,” Shepperd said. “But we may end up in a courtroom.”\n\nShepperd said a listing could mean a lengthier permitting process of up to three years for companies not enrolled in the Range Wide Plan and higher costs that render the drilling uneconomical. It is hard to reverse a listing decision, he said.\n\nGovernors of the five affected states opposed listing the bird under the Endangered Species Act. In a joint statement last year, Govs. Rick Perry of Texas, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Susana Martinez of New Mexico and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, said their states have all worked with a wide variety of affected groups to develop conservation plans to improve the bird\'s habitat while ""taking into account economic development needs.""\n\nTexan legislators voiced disappointment in the listing decision.\n\n“I’m disappointed the Obama Administration made this decision based on arbitrary deadlines set in a closed-door meeting, ignoring the ongoing efforts by Texas landowners and businesses,” said U.S. Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican.\n\nRepresentative Mike Conaway, a Republican representing the Odessa and Midland area, decried in a statement what he said was Ashe’s disregard for the potential of the range-wide plan.\n\n“Stakeholders deserved the opportunity to see if their efforts would be successful,” Conaway said.\n\nBut Ashe in a statement said “the states remain in the driver’s seat for managing the species – more than has ever been done before – and participating landowners and developers are not impacted with additional regulatory requirements.”\n\nAnd environmental groups that pushed for the listing said those exemptions created loopholes that weakened the listing.\n\n""The population of lesser prairie-chickens plunged by half to only 17,000 birds last year"" said Jay Lininger, Senior Scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity. ""This is an emergency situation that requires the strongest protections possible. Instead, the Fish and Wildlife Service turned its back and relied on voluntary conservation plans that only amount to a wink and a nod with no accountability.""\n\nMajor oil and gas companies with energy lobbyists were already preparing a separate plan in case of a listing called the American Habitat Center.\n\nThat plan would let companies pay landowners to conserve habitat on a free-market exchange. But Shepperd opposed it, worried that it would disadvantage the smaller Permian Basin companies by creating a system of winners and losers, and that it would also spend too much money on overhead instead of conservation efforts.\n\nThe lesser prairie-chicken was one of 250 species Fish and Wildlife candidate species list, Shepperd said.\n\n""I shudder to think what that does to the next species affecting the west,"" Shepperd said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.', 'Fish and Wildlife Service will list the lesser prairie-chicken as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, a decision that local oil and gas officials described as a threat to drilling in West Texas and four other states.\n""The lesser prairie-chicken is in dire straits,"" Ashe said in the interview.\nIt is hard to reverse a listing decision, he said.\nTexan legislators voiced disappointment in the listing decision.\nThe lesser prairie-chicken was one of 250 species Fish and Wildlife candidate species list, Shepperd said.']"

Instead of lowering fees, the card industry’s settlement proposes that merchants pass them along to consumers in the form of surcharges. That is absolutely the opposite of what retailers sought, and major retailers have soundly rejected surcharging.\n\nThe NRF wants to overturn the December settlement.

Visa’s monopoly power has enabled it to dictate price and inhibit competition. As a result, Wal-Mart’s retail sales were below what they would have been otherwise,” according to the retail giant in documents submitted to the court.\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT) said the actions of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) caused “enormous damage” to its business from January 2004 until the latter part of November 2012. The company did not name any banks in the lawsuit.\n\nWal-Mart refused swipe fee settlement\n\nIn 2012, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT), Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and some other retailers refused to accept the $7.2 billion swipe fee settlement offered Visa Inc (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) related to the antitrust lawsuit filed against the credit card companies and other major banks. The retail giant opposed the settlement because it does not prohibit the credit card companies from constantly increasing hidden swipe fees in 2005.\n\nFederal Reserve rule on swipe fees\n\nThe Federal Reserve was mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to ensure that swipe fees or interchange fees reflect the actual cost of processing debit cards transactions. In order to comply with the law, the Federal Reserve initially proposed limiting the fees to $0.12 per debit card transaction, but finally set it to $0.21 per swipe with the possibility of a few cents increase to cover some costs such as fraud. Prior the implementation of the Fed ruling, banks were charging $0.44 per debit card transaction.\n\nCourt of Appeals decision\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT) and other retailers filed a court petition and requested the federal judge to nullify the Federal Reserve’s rule on swipe fees. Last year, District Court Judge Richard Leon tossed Fed’s and stated that it was “utterly indefensible” interpretation and “runs completely afoul of the text, design and purpose” of the Dodd-Frank law. Last week, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ruled that the Federal Reserve was reasonable in setting the limit for debit card swipe fees. The appeals court also noted that the Dodd-Frank amendment was written poorly and a clarification is necessary to determine the appropriate cap for debit card transaction fees.', 'Wal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT) said the actions of Visa Inc (NYSE:V) caused “enormous damage” to its business from January 2004 until the latter part of November 2012.\nThe retail giant opposed the settlement because it does not prohibit the credit card companies from constantly increasing hidden swipe fees in 2005.\nPrior the implementation of the Fed ruling, banks were charging $0.44 per debit card transaction.\nCourt of Appeals decisionWal-Mart Stores, Inc (NYSE:WMT) and other retailers filed a court petition and requested the federal judge to nullify the Federal Reserve’s rule on swipe fees.\nLast week, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ruled that the Federal Reserve was reasonable in setting the limit for debit card swipe fees.']"

The company said circuits within the air bag control module can be damaged if they're exposed to interference from other electrical components in the car. The defect also can cause the seat belt pre-tensioners to tighten without warning. Toyota said it knows of one minor injury related to the defect, but no accidents. The company is notifying owners of the recall. Dealers will add an electrical noise filter to the air bag control module for free.\n\nNew DynaVox owners fire CEO, board\n\nDynaVox Systems LLC said on Thursday that new investors acquired its senior debt and replaced its CEO and all members of the board of directors. The new board appointed Derek Harrar as interim CEO, replacing Michelle Heying-Wilver. JEC Capital Partners LLC of Randoplh, Mass., and Fondren Management LP of Houston acquired the debt of the South Side-based company, which makes communication and education products for people with speech and learning disabilities. In August, DynaVox said it was exploring financial and strategic alternatives. The company defaulted on March 29, 2013, on a $15 million senior secured credit agreement and entered into a forbearance agreement with lenders. The credit agreement allowed debt holders to change the company's leadership. For the year ended June 30, DynaVox had an operating loss of $8.7 million on sales of $64.95 million, according to a securities filing. DynaVox stock traded at 12.5 cents on Thursday, unchanged. It went public in 2010 at $15 a share.\n\nAlcoa introduces lighter wheel for trucks\n\nAlcoa Inc. introduced a new aluminum wheel for the trucking industry that it says is 47 percent lighter than steel wheels of the same size and could save up to 1,400 pounds per rig. A new aluminum alloy developed at the Alcoa Technical Center in Upper Burrell is used in the wheels, which were shown at the 2014 Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Ky. Maximum weight savings would be realized with the use of 14-inch wide-based wheels Alcoa introduced on March 10 that can replace dual wheels. Alcoa said its new wheels, which weigh 40 pounds, are the industry's lightest heavy-duty truck wheel. Aluminum wheels increase payload and improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower maintenance costs.\n\nWal-Mart sues Visa over card fees\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. is suing Visa Inc. over fees that it charges the world's largest retailer when customers use a credit or debit card. Wal-Mart said Visa conspired with banks to illegally fix and inflate fees that retailers pay on card transactions, and that the fees cost American retailers and shoppers more than $350 billion between 2004 and November 2012. Wal-Mart's complaint was filed on Tuesday with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. San Francisco-based Visa declined to comment on the suit. Retailers have long complained about the billions of dollars in “swipe” or “interchange” fees they have had to pay, which average to about 2 percent of the price of a purchase. In December, a judge approved a settlement over card fees between 19 merchants and Visa and MasterCard. The settlement originally was valued at $7.25 billion but shrank to about $5.7 billion because some retailers opted out. Wal-Mart was not part of the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Newsletters TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.\n\nNotice: Only variable references should be returned by reference in /var/app/current/wp-content/themes/TribLIVE/assets/functions/fnStory.php on line 47"", 'Toyota recalls 119K Avalons for faulty air bagsToyota is recalling 119,000 Avalon sedans from the 2003 and 2004 model years because their air bags could deploy inadvertently.\nToyota said it knows of one minor injury related to the defect, but no accidents.\nNew DynaVox owners fire CEO, boardDynaVox Systems LLC said on Thursday that new investors acquired its senior debt and replaced its CEO and all members of the board of directors.\nFor the year ended June 30, DynaVox had an operating loss of $8.7 million on sales of $64.95 million, according to a securities filing.\nIn December, a judge approved a settlement over card fees between 19 merchants and Visa and MasterCard.']"

It has been almost a decade since it retired the last of its US-designed F-5 fighters in 2005.\n\nIt\'s a government-to-government contract worth P18.9 billion. It is one of two big-ticket projects, along with the P18-billion frigates project, that will be funded from the P85-billion initial fund provided by the administration of President Benigno Aquino III under the Revised Modernization Program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.\n\nGazmin signed the sales agreement, while Armed Forces chief General Emmanuel Bautista signed the acquisition project. Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the Philippines Lee Hyuk was present during the signing.\n\nAs territorial disputes intensify in the region, the FA-50s, along with other projects in the modernization program, are seen as necessary to achieve the government\'s goal of giving the military enough capability for minimum credible defense.\n\nStrictly speaking, the FA-50 is a lead-in fighter trainer aircraft but there are those who consider it a fighter jet because of its minimum fighter capabilities. The FA-50 design is derived largely from the US\' F-16, meaning it won\'t be a problem if the Philippines in the future gets the money to upgrade to the more expensive designs.\n\nThe KAI website describes the FA-50 as a ""light combat derivative of the T-50 supersonic advanced jet trainer.""\n\nIt can carry 4.5 tons of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, machine guns, and precision guided bombers among others. It is also equipped with Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS), Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), and the Counter Measure Dispenser System (CMDS).\n\nKAI CEO Ha Sung Yong said: It will not only be served as the most powerful Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) and Lead In Fighter Trainer (LIF) but also FA-50, the Fighting Eagle, will serve the Philippine Air Force as multipurpose fighter which is already proven the best performance among the equivalent with affordability at the same time.""\n\nSigh of relief\n\nNegotiations between the Philippines and KAI almost fell through because of disagreements on the contract details including payment terms. At one point, The defense department threatened KAI that it will recommend to Malacañang junking the project.\n\n""We have finally reached this point. It provides a happy sigh of relief to the Armed Forces of the Philippines especially the Philippine Air Force,"" said Gazmin.\n\nDefense Undersecretary for Finance Fernando Manalo said two fighter jets will be delivered 18 months after the opening of the letter of credit. Another two will be delivered after 12 months. Based on the timeline, delivery of the 12 jets will be completed by 2017.\n\nIn the same event, the Philippines also signed the contract for the acquisition of 8 Bell 412 combat utility helicopters from Canadian Commercial Corporation for P4.8 billion.

During the 2000s its focus was primarily on counterinsurgency missions in the southern Philippines, but China’s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea has prompted Manila to rethink its conventional capabilities.\n\nThe FA-50 is a logical choice for Manila because the aircraft, based on the T-50 advanced jet trainer, can serve in both training and light combat roles.\n\nPowered by a single General Electric F404 engine with afterburner, the FA-50 is entering service with the South Korean air force, and in late December Iraq signed a $1.1 billion contract for 24 aircraft. In 2011, Jakarta signed a $400 million deal for 16 T-50s, which is designated the T-50i in Indonesian service.\n\nKAI\n\nThe FA-50 is the most advanced variant of the T-50 family. Seoul's FA-50s will have the Link 16 tactical data link, as well as an Elta Systems EL/M-2032 pulse Doppler radar.\n\nThe FA-50 also has a radar warning receiver and a night vision imaging system. It is capable of carrying 4,500kg (9,920lb) of weapons, including the Boeing Joint Direct Attack Munition and Textron CBU-97 Sensor Fused Weapon. The FA-50 also has a 20mm cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles.\n\nKAI is also eyeing export opportunities for the T-50 in the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, and Peru.\n\nThe greatest opportunity for the type, however, lies in the US T-X competition to replace the venerable T-38 Talon. KAI will team with Lockheed Martin, which assisted the development of the T-50, to compete for the T-X deal.\n\nAside from the original T-50 and FA-50, KAI has also produced the T-50B enhanced manoeuvrability aerobatic variant, and the TA-50, which has a rudimentary air-to-air capability with a 20mm cannon and the ability to carry IR homing missiles."", 'The Philippines has signed a contract for 12 Korea Aerospace Industries FA-50 fighter aircraft.\nThe long-awaited deal was signed between the governments of the Philippines and South Korea, KAI adds.\nThe FA-50 is a logical choice for Manila because the aircraft, based on the T-50 advanced jet trainer, can serve in both training and light combat roles.\nKAIThe FA-50 is the most advanced variant of the T-50 family.\nKAI will team with Lockheed Martin, which assisted the development of the T-50, to compete for the T-X deal.']"

According to CNN Money, there are a couple of bills making their way through the state legislature right now which would allow the automaker to keep selling its cars in the state.\n\nTesla ban moved back\n\nAuto dealers in the state have agreed to give Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) 15 additional days to sell its vehicles directly to consumers. That ban was originally set to begin April 1, but now the state has moved the start date back to April 15. Dealers also said they would support a longer extension as lawmakers in the state develop a compromise.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the New Jersey dealer’s trade group told CNN that they wouldn’t support it forever. He said Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) must comply with franchise laws in some way.\n\nDetails on the legislation\n\nCurrently in the New Jersey senate, Sen. Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat, has suggested that sales of zero-emission vehicles, which would include Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s vehicles, until they are 4% of the total car market. This isn’t projected to happen until 2018. The Electric Drive Transportation Association reported that last year, zero-emission vehicles made up just .6% of car sales in the U.S.\n\nTesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) itself has acknowledged that one constraint keeping it from selling many more cars is the fact that it doesn’t use dealerships. The automaker is projecting sales of 35,000 cars this year but 500,000 cars by 2020.\n\nThe other bill is in the New Jersey Assembly, and it comes from Democrat Timothy Eustace. His bill, however, offers a permanent exemption from franchise laws for makers of electric cars. Lesniak believes Gov. Chris Christie would be open to bills which allow Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to keep selling its cars directly to consumers in the state. The governor initially said that the recently voted-through ban just enforces laws which already exist there. However, he did say previously that the legislature should decide what to do about the issue.', 'After Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) reached compromises with auto dealerships in two other states, it appears that New Jersey could be the next one.\nTesla ban moved backAuto dealers in the state have agreed to give Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) 15 additional days to sell its vehicles directly to consumers.\nHowever, a spokesperson for the New Jersey dealer’s trade group told CNN that they wouldn’t support it forever.\nDetails on the legislationCurrently in the New Jersey senate, Sen.

Here’s the news, courtesy of NJTV:\n\nAn Ohio Senate committee approved a bill formally barring automakers from selling directly to consumers except for a maximum of three outlets for electric-car builder Tesla Motors Inc. The measure was a compromise between the company and the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association, which had sought to block Tesla from selling without a middleman, according to state Sen. Scott Oelslager, the committee chairman. Tesla, based in Palo Alto, Calif., operates Ohio stores in Columbus and Cincinnati and will be permitted to add a third as long as the company isn’t sold or acquired and doesn’t produce anything other than all-electric vehicles, under the legislation worked out yesterday.\n\nWhy are states getting into the strange business of banning a wildly hyped, pretty cool, awfully expensive electric car manufacturer? Tesla’s direct sales model has drawn opposition from car salesmen — middlemen who fear becoming superfluous as Tesla champions a direct-to-consumer auto-marketing model. That opposition has led to sales bans in five states and restrictions in two others.\n\nIn New Jersey, for example, Grist’s Ben Adler explains that Gov. Chris Christie’s administration is forcing the electric automaker to shut down its two sales offices. The promising news there is that a Democratic assemblymember recently introduced a bill that would unshackle Tesla from Christie’s new ban on its sales model.\n\nSee: Tesla may be nearer to a compromise in Ohio,\n\nNJTV', 'Why are states getting into the strange business of banning a wildly hyped, pretty cool, awfully expensive electric car manufacturer?\nTesla’s direct sales model has drawn opposition from car salesmen — middlemen who fear becoming superfluous as Tesla champions a direct-to-consumer auto-marketing model.\nThat opposition has led to sales bans in five states and restrictions in two others.\nChris Christie’s administration is forcing the electric automaker to shut down its two sales offices.\nThe promising news there is that a Democratic assemblymember recently introduced a bill that would unshackle Tesla from Christie’s new ban on its sales model.']"

And now even New Jersey may be warming up to the idea of Tesla bypassing the franchise system in its state. Here are the latest updates from Ohio, Arizona, Texas, and New Jersey.\n\nOhio\n\nTesla was already selling cars directly in Ohio, but the state had proposed to make it illegal. Now, tides have turned. The Ohio Dealers Association caved on Tuesday when they negotiated a deal that will allow Tesla to operate its two existing retail stores and eventually open one more, according to the Associated Press -- but no more than three stores. The Senate panel has already approved the bill.\n\nArizona\n\nAs one of the final contending states for Tesla\'s Gigafactory, Arizona has an incentive to make Tesla happy. Doing so could help land the state 6,500 jobs and a $4 to $5 billion project. Among the final four contenders for the project, Arizona is one of two states that currently ban Tesla from selling vehicles directly in the state. The other contending state that bans Tesla is Texas.\n\nThe Gigafactory incentive seems to be working. The state is evaluating a bill that would enable the company to sell cars directly in the state. Clearly written in Tesla language, the bill proposes to allow manufacturers to sell directly in the state only if the manufacturer solely sells electric cars. Receiving a unanimous vote in the first committee review, the bill still needs to be reviewed by a second committee, and then move to a full Senate vote.\n\nTexas\n\nDealer lobby groups have quite a bit of power in Texas. But so does Texas Governor Rick Perry, who told Fox Business earlier this week that he was moved by the Gigafactory project.\n\n""Tesla is a big project. It\'s a $5 billion project. The cachet of being able to say we put that manufacturing facility in your state is hard to pass up,"" said Perry. He insinuated that this incentive should invoke a conversation in the state about allowing Tesla to sell its vehicles directly there. Texas lawmakers are going to need to decide whether the state will ""lead the country when it comes to manufacturing,"" he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTesla will lose its right to sell vehicles directly in New Jersey as of April 1 after a vote earlier this month from the state\'s Motor Vehicle Commission committee, which includes the members of Gov. Chris Christie\'s cabinet, banned Tesla. But a New Jersey lawmaker submitted a bill for review this week that would reverse this action.\n\nEven the dealers don\'t seem entirely opposed to working with Tesla. Automotive News quotes Jim Appleton, president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers:\n\nWe hold as sacrosanct the franchise system. There is no resolution to this problem that allows Tesla to operate outside the franchise system forever. But we\'re open to accommodations if Tesla can make the case that there\'s a reason why they can\'t.\n\nAs long as Tesla is supply limited, objections from states to sell its cars directly won\'t have a negative effect on sales for the company. But as Tesla boosts production and gets closer to becoming demand limited in the U.S., investors will want to see states warming up to Tesla\'s business model to sell its vehicles directly.\n\nTesla is currently forced to operate as a gallery-only model in Texas, Arizona, Maryland, and Virginia. As a gallery, Tesla can\'t discuss price, take orders, or give Test drives. In Maryland, however, Tesla can give test drives.', ""Among the final four contenders for the project, Arizona is one of two states that currently ban Tesla from selling vehicles directly in the state.\nThe state is evaluating a bill that would enable the company to sell cars directly in the state.\nHe insinuated that this incentive should invoke a conversation in the state about allowing Tesla to sell its vehicles directly there.\nAs long as Tesla is supply limited, objections from states to sell its cars directly won't have a negative effect on sales for the company.\nBut as Tesla boosts production and gets closer to becoming demand limited in the U.S., investors will want to see states warming up to Tesla's business model to sell its vehicles directly.""]"

In a report released Tuesday, Deutsche Bank\'s Rod Lache and team said the dealers were among the ""most serious"" threats to Tesla. They explain why:\n\nThe most serious intermediate term competitive threat that we see at the moment is the fact that the politically powerful U.S. Auto Dealer lobby has begun to successfully introduce friction into Tesla\'s direct sales model in certain states (i.e. Texas, New Jersey), and there may be potential risks to others. This has not been a noticeable constraint on sales as of yet, and it is not an issue in most International markets. In addition, we believe that Tesla has a number of options to mitigate this risk if it becomes an issue over time.

56845,"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2455454,00.asp",business,"['No matter what you think of Tesla, it\'s difficult not to admire what the start-up electric-vehicle maker has accomplished since the Model S was released in June 2012. In that short time, established and competitor car companies have had to take Tesla seriously as it\'s racked up a string of awards and successes and grabbed a surprising amount of market share in the luxury category. And as Tesla prepares to launch a less expensive model, mainstream brands will also feel threatened.\n\nAn automotive analyst recently cited five ways in which Tesla is pushing technological change in the automotive industry. And while I don\'t agree with his list (since only two of the five ways are not exclusive to Tesla), I concur with his premise that Tesla is forcing other automakers to reexamine how in-car tech is being implemented.\n\nBut I\'d take it even further and say that Tesla is also transforming the car driving, ownership, and buying experience. So I came up with my own list (that starts with the two I agree on with the analyst):\n\n1. Large center-dash touch-screen display: Even though the Model S has been out for almost two years, no other automaker offers the extra-large in-dash touch screen that\'s become a Tesla trademark. While it can be debated that the screen is too large, too bright, and too distracting, the appeal of such a large interface is undeniable. And it\'s bound to be copied: We\'ve already seen the idea of a vertical rather than horizontal main in-dash touch screen copied by Volvo for its upcoming infotainment interface.\n\n2. Over-the-air software updates: The analyst\'s list called this ""cloud-based software,"" which several car companies have been using for years (think OnStar). But he also mentioned something that Tesla is doing on a regular basis and traditional automakers have been slow to implement: over-the-air (OTA) software updates. Tesla has pushed out OTA updates for the Model S for everything from adding a ""creep"" feature to raising the Model S when battery fires became an issue last year. With the critical need for infotainment software to keep current with consumer devices that connect to cars, OTA updates should be—and can be—routine across the industry.\n\n3. Charging infrastructure: It\'s the classic chicken-and-egg scenario. Until there\'s a larger demand for EVs, it\'s difficult to justify adding more charging infrastructure. But more people may not consider buying an EV until there are more charging stations that can relieve range anxiety. Tesla\'s answer to the problem? Build its own Supercharger network.\n\n4. Design rules: Styling has always played a huge role in whether people universally like one vehicle (a classic Corvette) and instinctively turn their nose up at another one (the Pontiac Aztek). While there are lots of great-looking cars available, and luxury brands are thick with them, Tesla\'s emphasis on design—both inside and out—has made it a car that not only stands out because it\'s new and different, but because the design is fresh and bold.\n\n5. Car buying sucks: I remember hearing about a survey that ranked car shopping just behind going to the dentist in a list of experiences most people dread. The haggling and hassle required to buy a car—and that you can\'t go direct to a manufacturer—is ripe for an overhaul. By trying to buck the system and bypass the traditional dealer network Tesla is taking the punishment that usually befalls pioneers, but also firing the first salvo in what will likely be a long battle.\n\nKeep in mind that Tesla doesn\'t have to deal with a lot of the headwinds and headaches that are common for more established automakers, such as juggling multiple model lines, managing a huge global labor force, accruing the legacy costs of unionized workers, and spending billions on ads worldwide to stay competitive. And, of course, Tesla is coasting on tax incentives offered for EVs and doesn\'t have to comply with looming CAFE standards.\n\nStill, there\'s a lot that traditional car companies could learn from Tesla—now that they\'ve learned that the maverick automaker is not going away anytime soon.', 'An automotive analyst recently cited five ways in which Tesla is pushing technological change in the automotive industry.\nBut I\'d take it even further and say that Tesla is also transforming the car driving, ownership, and buying experience.\nBut he also mentioned something that Tesla is doing on a regular basis and traditional automakers have been slow to implement: over-the-air (OTA) software updates.\nTesla has pushed out OTA updates for the Model S for everything from adding a ""creep"" feature to raising the Model S when battery fires became an issue last year.\nStill, there\'s a lot that traditional car companies could learn from Tesla—now that they\'ve learned that the maverick automaker is not going away anytime soon.']"

The companies must now use third-party dealers. The ban applies to all car manufacturers, but seemed particularly aimed at Tesla, which had been in negotiations with the administration for months to sell electric cars straight from its own storefronts in the state.\n\nThe move was a win for the state’s surprisingly powerful auto dealer lobby and a loss for one of the country’s biggest electric car makers. But it also cemented New Jersey’s place as a non-contender for the real prize: a $5 billion battery “gigafactory” that Tesla plans to begin construction on later this year. With an estimated 6,500 employees, the factory will likely become a keystone of the United State’s clean energy industry and an economic boon for its host state. Now, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, and Nevada are scrambling to get picked, and last week Republican legislators in Arizona began to try pushing their state to the top of the pile.\n\nTexas Governor Rick Perry called his state’s direct sales ban “antiquated.”\n\nIt’s the latest sign that, at least at the state level, the clean energy industry’s best friend might be the GOP. Newt Gingrich quickly pounced on Christie after the direct sales ban for “artificially” insulating car dealers, just weeks after calling for John Kerry to resign after Kerry named climate change as a principle challenge of the generation. On Tuesday, Texas Governor Rick Perry called his state’s direct sales ban “antiquated” nearly a year after a Democrat-backed bill to change the policy was killed.\n\nNew Jersey and Texas aren’t the only states where you can’t buy a Tesla car directly from the company: Arizona and Maryland also have direct sales bans. But a bill passed out of committee in Arizona’s GOP-controlled Senate last week would reverse the state’s position and allow electric vehicle companies to sell directly out of their showrooms. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Warren Peterson (R-Gilbert) said he was spurred by the New Jersey situation to amend what he sees as a creeping assault on free market principles.\n\n“For me, it’s not about Tesla or electric cars,” he said. “For me, a big concern I have now is we are limiting someone’s choice.”\n\nBut despite backing from some prominent Arizona Republicans (Sen. John McComish told the Arizona Daily Star he didn’t see why the state should “prevent someone else who has a better idea from making an effort to enter that industry”), Warren said he’s faced opposition from others who see the bill as damaging to the state’s traditional car market or a handout to Tesla, arguments that swayed the decision in New Jersey.\n\n“I have a tough time understanding why Republicans are opposed to it, because free markets are such a big part of the platform,” he said. “States that moved away from this have made a big mistake.”\n\nThe Republican-eat-Republican battle over Tesla mirrors another clean energy fight playing out nationwide. Conservatives aligned with large utility companies are squaring off with the solar power industry and libertarian-leaning Republicans over rules to allow homeowners with solar panels to sell excess power back to the grid, a policy known as net metering, which is allowed in more than 40 states. Some utility companies, however, worry the practice will disrupt their business model as more and more homes go solar. That fight has been particularly vicious in Arizona, where the son of conservative icon Barry Goldwater has led the pro-solar charge on free market arguments.\n\n“In a lot of ways, [clean energy] is an existential crisis” for Republicans.\n\n“In a lot of ways, [clean energy] is an existential crisis” for Republicans, said Marita Mirzatuny, a Texas-based energy analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund. Some “are fighting on behalf of old entrenched regulations, which seems counterintuitive,” because at the same time “there’s a lot of money and momentum moving into the clean tech realm.”\n\nWith Tesla’s battery factory on the line, the stakes are now higher than ever, and Arizona is poised to become the first state of the four in line for the factory to clear its regulatory hurdles.\n\n“For Texas to lose out because of regulation like that is the ultimate irony,” Mirzatuny said.\n\nThe proposed factory has implications beyond just electric vehicles. Electricity storage is a central challenge for the renewable energy industry as well. Rooftop solar companies still struggle with how to store excess power, and some are now relying on the car industry to perfect that technology. California’s biggest solar installer, SolarCity, is already using Tesla batteries to store power from homes in that state, and on Tuesday Honda unveiled an experimental carbon-neutral house that relies on car batteries.\n\nAs clean tech of all kinds matures as a growing market, Mirzatuny said, more conservatives might embrace the economic potential in fighting climate change.\n\n“Economics are finally aligned with environmental protection,” she said. “That’s a rare opportunity.”', 'The move was a win for the state’s surprisingly powerful auto dealer lobby and a loss for one of the country’s biggest electric car makers.\nWith an estimated 6,500 employees, the factory will likely become a keystone of the United State’s clean energy industry and an economic boon for its host state.\n“States that moved away from this have made a big mistake.”The Republican-eat-Republican battle over Tesla mirrors another clean energy fight playing out nationwide.\n“In a lot of ways, [clean energy] is an existential crisis” for Republicans.\n“In a lot of ways, [clean energy] is an existential crisis” for Republicans, said Marita Mirzatuny, a Texas-based energy analyst for the Environmental Defense Fund.']"

Good cars check one box, great cars check two and the few excellent cars fill all three. They are pioneering, well-built and beautifully designed.\n\nTesla’s Model S is one of those rare cars. Its long, sleek, full-sized design stands out against bloated competitors, and it can travel up to 300 miles in a charge, a range far beyond any of its rivals. For these reasons, and many more, the Model S has earned Consumer Reports’ Best Overall in 2014 and received a 99/100 on the overall road test.\n\nMost importantly, the Tesla Model S is an American car — as in, designed and built here, not just headquartered.\n\nConsidering that so few companies build in the U.S., and how often we hear both sides of the aisle call for more American manufacturing jobs, the success of Tesla Motors has, surprisingly, repeatedly been met with skepticism and restrictions.\n\nWhy are dealerships so eager to fight against a small boutique automaker?\n\nTesla’s desire to sell its cars directly to customers and cut franchise car dealerships out has drawn most of the blowback from pundits and auto-dealers. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed no radical interest in overhauling the dealership structure, only in providing direct sales to the consumer.\n\nStill, dealership networks are fighting Tesla by lobbying state governments to inhibit its ability to do business. Right now, Teslas are banned for sale in Arizona and face restrictions in six other, mostly Republican-led, states.\n\nDealerships are threatened not by Tesla’s appeal — a brand consumers have expressed interest in — but by a future in which customers flock toward an option that gives them more control in how they buy, and less worry about dealer markups: a revolutionary new system with no room for middlemen.\n\nFurther, Tesla, and electric cars in general, threaten maintenance as a major source of cash flow, as Marcus Wohlsen explains in a piece for Wired.\n\n“Teslas don’t have any of the parts that force you to take your car in for ‘regularly scheduled maintenance’ — services that can cost dearly at the dealer,” he writes. “It’s hard to charge for an oil change when there’s no oil to be changed.” Wohlson adds that Tesla’s use of prepaid warranties would hurt the traditional dealership model, where patrons pay per fix.\n\nHow the Republican Party plays into this isn’t immediately clear, but dealership lobby money has fallen in party members’ pockets. Now it seems that they’ve forgotten their supposedly dear American-job-creation and free-market values.\n\nThe GOP’s Tesla-bashing started when the company accepted a $465 million low-interest federal loan aimed at developing green technology.\n\nThis loan has led many lawmakers on the right to call Tesla a failure because it needed special government assistance to succeed.\n\nNotably, before the 2012 presidential elections, then-presidential candidate Mitt Romney criticized Tesla as a failure and said that the government had no business investing in such companies. He compared Tesla to the failing Fisker Automotive, inferring that both were government investment mistakes.\n\nAnd yet, Tesla succeeded, repaying its loan nine years early and already turning a profit.\n\nThis has led some to embrace Tesla, or at least its free market sales style, and to criticize the dealership oligopoly that it struggles against. Conservative columnist Charles Lane wrote an opinions piece in The Washington Post that was critical of both Tesla and of the push to block it in favor of the dealerships.\n\n“The dealer-based system was obsolescent even before the Internet,” Lane wrote. “As Web-based retail sales of other products began to take off in 1999, a General Motors executive said publicly that 80 percent of new-car sales could be factory-direct orders made online by 2003. He forgot about the dealer lobby, which mobilized to win state bans on Internet sales by anyone except an existing licensed dealer.”\n\nPerhaps Lane’s moderate statements are a sign of what is to come, showing a move away from the hypocrisy of embracing free market economics, except when they apply to this small car company.\n\nHopefully, an innovative firm will no longer be stifled by an antiquated and fearful system, nor despised for irrelevant political bickering. Instead, we can see Tesla, an American firm, create American jobs. It should succeed or fail as a result of its own actions, just as a free market economy should allow.\n\n— Eric Klump is a journalism senior.

Nonetheless, it’s a win in a state where a complete ban could have been voted through.\n\nTesla wins a deal in Ohio\n\nAccording to Fox News, auto dealers in Ohio have agreed to allow Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to sell its cars in their state. It sounds similar in some ways to the agreement Tesla made with dealers in Washington State. A Senate panel approved the deal between Tesla and the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association.\n\nThe new bill allows Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to keep its two current stores in Cincinnati and Columbus and open a third one in Cleveland. However, those are the only three stores the automaker will be allowed to open in the state. In addition, Tesla is the only automaker allowed to sell its vehicles directly to consumers in Ohio.\n\nHow Tesla could impact the presidential election\n\nWired staff writer Marcus Wohlsen suggests that Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s very political battle could spill over into the presidential race. Candidates from both major parties have been jockeying for position in the fight. Republicans initially put up the biggest fight, but many of them seem to be changing their views—for one reason or another.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney famously called Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a “loser” during his campaign. Needless to say, he didn’t win. More recently, Republican Gov. Chris Christie opposed Tesla, signing a bill into law which bans the automaker from selling its vehicles in his state. But then Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, also a Republican, began to defend Tesla and what it represents—more choice for consumers.\n\nBy opposing Christie, who he will likely face in the Republican presidential primary, he can win over Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s fan base—a group which seems to be growing rapidly, based on how popular the automaker’s cars are. Democrats in New Jersey are also jumping on the bandwagon, opposing Gov. Christie by supporting Tesla against the state’s ban.\n\nTesla = innovation\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry, another Republican, seems to have had a change of heart on Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Once again, this one is probably politically motivated, as he seeks to convince the automaker to build its gigafactory in his state, bringing thousands of jobs along with it. Along with the jobs and the massive facility, Tesla brings even more innovation to Texas, where several innovative technology companies, like Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) and VMware, Inc. (NYSE:VMW), have major presences. Tesla would be among good company there, just as it is in Silicon Valley.\n\nAnd if Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could continue linking its brand with an image of innovation, just as it has, then the automaker could see political support rise even further. Politicians in both parties like the word “innovation,” so by expressing their support for Tesla, they show their support for innovation. It really isn’t that different from the praise President Barack Obama has given to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) throughout his career.\n\nAnd if Tesla really is the new Apple, then politicians who want to be president might want to jump on board and stop fighting it.', 'Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) has won the exclusive right to sell its vehicles directly to Ohio consumers, but just in three major cities.\nTesla wins a deal in OhioAccording to Fox News, auto dealers in Ohio have agreed to allow Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to sell its cars in their state.\nThe new bill allows Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to keep its two current stores in Cincinnati and Columbus and open a third one in Cleveland.\nHow Tesla could impact the presidential electionWired staff writer Marcus Wohlsen suggests that Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s very political battle could spill over into the presidential race.\nRepublican presidential candidate Mitt Romney famously called Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) a “loser” during his campaign.']"

It also allows Tesla to open a third location in Cleveland, but prohibits the company from expanding beyond that.\n\nAt issue is Tesla\'s sales model. It sells cars directly to customers and uses its stores as showrooms, allowing customers to learn about the cars before making a decision. They can then purchase the car online.\n\nTesla operates showrooms and galleries in 21 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. It also has showrooms in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.\n\nTesla is still a small automaker, selling just 22,477 vehicles last year.\n\nNo other automaker sells directly to customers. Instead, they sell their cars through independent car dealerships.\n\nThose auto dealers see Tesla as a threat to their business model, and have launched efforts to block the sales model in many U.S. states. Tesla has been banned from selling its cars in five states: Texas, Maryland Arizona, Virginia, and most recently New Jersey, which instituted a ban earlier this month that will go into effect April 1st.\n\nThe ban in New Jersey in particular stung the company, with founder and CEO Elon Musk writing a scathing letter on his blog attacking Governor Chris Christie for what he calls a ""backroom deal""\n\n""The rationale given for the regulation change that requires auto companies to sell through dealers is that it ensures \'consumer protection,\'"" Musk wrote on his blog.\n\n""Unless they are referring to the Mafia version of \'protection\', this is obviously untrue,"" he added, saying that Tesla operates under the direct-sales model because it gives it the best chance for success.\n\nBut even with bans in place in several states, Tesla has a workaround, although not an ideal one.\n\nTesla\'s workaround\n\nIn the five states where Tesla is banned, it operates what it calls \'galleries\', which are similar to its showrooms, except employees are prohibited from discussing prices or make sales. Customers in those states who want to buy a Tesla have to do so through an out-of-state purchase, which can be costly and involves a lot of red tape, depending on the state.\n\nIn the U.S., auto manufacturers are typically not allowed to operate their own dealerships. The regulations were set up just after the Second World War as a protectionist measure to prevent General Motors and Ford, booming from their contributions to the war effort, from buying out independently owned dealers.\n\nTesla has nonetheless been able to secure licences to sell vehicles in much of the U.S., although depending on the state, the dealers have fought back.\n\nIn Washington and New York, proposals are being considered to ban Tesla sales.\n\nBut Tesla returned fire, and has now won the battle to sell its cars in four states: North Carolina, Minnesota, Massachusetts and now Ohio.\n\nOhio in particular is a big victory for the company, as it is a huge market for cars and its dealership association has a lot of power. Ohio has 830 dealerships employing 50,000 employees, and 500,000 vehicles are sold in the state annually.\n\nIn Canada, however, there are no restrictions to automakers selling directly to consumers, so the only limit for Tesla is the demand for its cars.', '']"

After all, the company that found favor with Obama’s Department of Energy and used that favor to raise money from private investors, is now getting shut out of selling direct to consumers in states like New Jersey and Ohio that are protecting their local car dealerships from outside competition. Rather than enjoy the irony, though, politicians, and especially New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo whose legislature is considering a similar anti-Tesla bill, ought to be taking the opportunity to rethink their support for the status quo.\n\nIn 2010, Tesla Motors got a $465 million loan from the federal government. The feds argue that it was worth every penny. “The Department of Energy’s investment in Tesla supports the commercial-scale deployment of advanced technologies that help keep American auto manufacturers competitive in the growing global market for advanced vehicles,” declares the DoE website.\n\nAs Mother Jones’ Josh Harkinson reported last August, Tesla needed the cash infusion because its first product, the Roadster, was failing and the company had burned through millions trying to get that car ready for prime time. “Tesla would have survived without the DOE loan,” Tesla co-founder and former CEO Martin Eberhard explained to Harkinson. But according to Eberhard, “it would have been difficult, and it would probably have required Tesla to raise more capital. This would likely have diluted [Musk’s] share of the company: Loans are nondilutive, whereas selling stock is dilutive. This is perhaps why Elon was so enthusiastic about pushing for the loans.”\n\nIn 2013, Tesla paid back the DoE loan (nine years early) and Musk has since decided that government handouts are a bad idea. He tweeted that a carbon tax would be better, while acknowledging, “Yes, [I] am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.”\n\nNow, however, Musk and Tesla are being kept out of the “market” because politicians in various states have decided to protect incumbent franchise dealerships against the competition. Traditionally, cars are sold through a middle-man, the dealer, rather than direct from the car manufacturer. Modeling itself more like Apple than Ford, Tesla sells direct to the car buyer.\n\nOpting to protect their existing car dealers, Maryland, Arizona, Texas and Virginia allows consumers to view the cars in Tesla “stores” but you can’t discuss price, drive the car or place an order. (Arizona may change the law there to allow direct sales of cars.) New Jersey recently decided that Tesla could not sell direct-to-consumers and Ohio is considering a similar action. Meanwhile Gov. Cuomo of New York has signaled that he’ll sign similar legislation once it passes the legislature, which is likely, but not without some controversy. As A. Barton Hinkle explained at Reason.com, the dealers are just trying to protect their bottom line. “If Tesla succeeds in challenging the franchise model, other car makers might do the same — and then dealerships would be in for a world of hurt. They would still make money, but probably nowhere near as much as they do now,” Hinkle explained.\n\nOn Tesla’s side there are pro-clean energy activists like Mark Ruffalo and politicians like Democrat Assemblyman David Buchwald who argues that “we shouldn’t change the rules midstream just as a company is starting out.” Buchwald told The New York Post, “Tesla’s goal is to sell cars, not upend the rest of the auto industry.”\n\nThe restrictions on Tesla are confusing enough coming from Republican administrations like Chris Christie and John Kasich. But in New York, the fight is Democrat vs Democrat and makes no sense in light of the $140 million in advertising Cuomo has spent in neighboring states to gin up new business for New York. After all the ads say New York is “open for business” and that if you have a new business or want to create jobs “we’re open to it.”\n\nKeeping Tesla out of New York amounts to more of the same old crony-capitalism, protectionism and just the latest business — natural gas drilling anyone? – to which Albany has said “we’re closed.”\n\nAbby W.

Following discussions with Ohio auto dealers about Senate Bill 260, which would have banned Tesla from selling directly, Tesla is now free to do so in its two stores in the state, one based in Easton and the other in Cincinnati. The deal between the association and Tesla was approved by a Senate panel, according to the Associated Press.\n\nDiarmuid O\'Connell, Tesla\'s VP of Corporate & Business Development, said the company was happy to reach an agreement in Ohio. ""We\'re pleased with the compromise reached in the Senate Committee to amend SB 260 to allow Ohio residents to continue to purchase electric vehicles directly from Tesla at our two existing stores and one additional location in Ohio,"" O\'Connell said in an emailed statement. ""Tesla stores are essential to educating customers about electric vehicle technology and building a mass market for EVs. We look forward to continuing to provide our Ohio customers with the full Tesla experience and to further investing in the state by employing Ohioans both directly at our stores and service centers, and through our Ohio-based suppliers of parts and components.""\n\nNot only can Tesla sell directly to consumers in its two existing stores, but it allows for Tesla to open a third store in Cleveland. However the deal prohibits the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company from opening any more stores in the state. As per the agreement, Tesla is the only automaker allowed to operate its own stores in the state.\n\nTesla\'s right to sell directly to consumers has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, following a ban in the state of New Jersey, effective April 1. Tesla said New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had gone back on his word to allow the matter of selling directly to consumers to be open for discussion. Christie fired back, saying he wasn\'t pushing Tesla out, he was only enforcing laws already enacted. ""I\'m not pushing Tesla out; the state Legislature did,"" Christie said last week. ""They passed a law, which is still on the books, which says if you want to sell cars in this state, you must go through an authorized dealer. My job is not to make the laws, it\'s to enforce the laws. And Tesla was operating outside the law.""\n\nNew Jersey State Assemblyman Tim Eustace (D-Bergen) has since introduced a bill that would let electric car companies sell directly to consumers.\n\nPrior to the action in New Jersey, the Elon Musk-led company held a conference call to discuss the pending ban. On the call, Tesla said it\'s sold ""several hundred cars"" in New Jersey, but declined to discuss the exact amount. Tesla\'s Vice President of Corporate and Business Development Diarmuid O\'Connel said the decision would be ""disappointing, if not downright outrageous."" The ban would require Tesla to shut down its operations in New Jersey, O\'Connel noted, calling it a ""pretty black-and-white issue.""\n\nCurrently, similar legislation is currently being discussed in New York.\n\nNews of the ban, as well as a recent downturn in high-flying technology stocks has sent Tesla\'s shares sharply lower, following the company\'s announcement of its planned Gigafactory and capital raise. Shares had reached a high of $265 on Feb. 26, but had fallen, following the concerns about the company\'s long-term viability.\n\nDespite the recent fall in shares, Tesla\'s stock has performed exceptionally well in recent months, having gained 44.5% year-to-date, and 474.2% over the past year, vastly outperforming the broader Nasdaq.\n\nTSLA data by YCharts\n\nThe recent run up in shares, largely prompted by the company\'s initiative in the battery business, has prompted UBS analyst Colin Langan to note shares are fully valued, with significant risks to the downside. He initiated coverage on the stock with a ""neutral"" rating and a $230 price target.\n\n""While Tesla has been extremely successful to date, investors should appreciate that the downside this early in its life is material,"" Langan wrote in the note. ""The failure of a current or future product could quickly unravel all the progress.

I\'ve heard Tesla CEO and Chief Product Architect Elon Musk call it both. But no matter what you call it, it is a beauty, and it is pulling in the reservations.\n\nAside from being pretty, it\'s also supposed to be fast and full of space. The Model X will reportedly be able to go from 0 to 60 MPH in under 5 seconds, similar to the Tesla Model S and faster than ""the fastest SUVs,"" as Tesla notes. That\'s also faster than many sports cars. On the utility side, the Model X will include Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive, and there will be a genuine third row.\n\nOh yeah, and it\'s going to have these wicked falcon-wing doors:\n\nAside from looking cool, the falcon-wing doors also make it much easier to load and unload kiddies and bulky cargo. As Elon\'s crew showed at the unveiling last year, even a tall man can stand upright while getting into the backseats.\n\nOverall, the target is to make something nobody else offers: an SUV/crossover that is super stylish, super efficient, super spacious & useful, and that has super performance. (Of course, that means that it has to be electric, which is the only type of vehicle Tesla builds anyway.)\n\nMany people are sold on the concept and Tesla\'s ability to deliver. Barring China\'s reservations, Black Sheep Planet estimates that 12,133 Tesla Model X reservations have been made. Deposits range from $5,000 to $40,000, depending on which version is reserved. The fully-loaded Signature series that will go into production first requires a $40,000 deposit, while the regular version requires a deposit of ""only"" $5,000.\n\nElon has stated several times that a few Tesla Model X SUVs will roll out to early customers at the end of 2014, but production won\'t really ramp up until sometime in 2015. If you reserve a Model X right now, you have to wait until 2015 to receive your electric beauty.\n\nThere are some caveats to the current reservation total of about 12,000. For one, anyone who has upgraded from a regular Model X to a Signature model is counted twice. Also, cancellations aren\'t registered. However, Chinese reservations very likely offset any of these errors. Tesla\'s flagship store in Hong Kong is reportedly its busiest, and Elon has stated that Chinese and European sales together are expected to be about double US sales by the end of 2014.\n\nBy the way, if you\'re curious what all those reservations amount to, Black Sheep Planet estimates that waiting customers have essentially given Tesla an interest-free loan of $112,920,000 ($53,200,000 for the production model and $59,720,000 for the signature model.) That seems to match up with Tesla\'s recently stated $163,153,000 that it is holding in customer deposits, since some of that reservation money is for the Tesla Model S (Tesla is still catching up to demand for that widely acclaimed electric sedan).\n\nHere\'s a long unveiling of the Tesla Model X if you missed it the first time around:\n\nVia Gas2', 'Depending on how particular you are about automobile taxonomy, the Tesla Model X can be called an SUV or a crossover.\nThe Model X will reportedly be able to go from 0 to 60 MPH in under 5 seconds, similar to the Tesla Model S and faster than ""the fastest SUVs,"" as Tesla notes.\nBarring China\'s reservations, Black Sheep Planet estimates that 12,133 Tesla Model X reservations have been made.\nFor one, anyone who has upgraded from a regular Model X to a Signature model is counted twice.\nHere\'s a long unveiling of the Tesla Model X if you missed it the first time around:Via Gas2']"

Now the company is opening a new storefront at NorthPark Center in Dallas.\n\nBut the storefront doesn’t mean actual car shopping. Currently Texas law forbids automakers from operating their own dealerships – that means no direct auto sales to consumers from manufacturers.\n\nDallas resident Mike Debnar said he couldn’t resist the all-electric Tesla sedan. “Have you seen the front of this car?” he asked, and then explained, “There’s no engine in it — it’s a trunk. There’s no radiator. There’s no antifreeze, no oil, no oil pan, no timing belts…there’s no fan belt, [and] there are no brake lines. There is almost zero maintenance on this car.”\n\nDespite the attributes Debnar described, you won’t find a Tesla vehicle at any dealer in Texas. The closest thing any North Texans can get will be the storefront at NorthPark.\n\nNorth Texas dealers say they’d love to have Tesla cars on their lots. But, instead the California automaker sells direct to customers — online.\n\nThe idea of buying a vehicle directly from the manufacturer isn’t one that sits well with most car dealers. Don Herring Junior, with Herring Mitsubishi, said, ”It’s a huge threat to dealers, and I think it’s bad for the consumers. I think it’s a lose-lose situation.”\n\nGovernor Rick Perry is actively courting a $5 billion Tesla battery manufacturing plant. He says it may be time to revisit those dealer protection laws.\n\nHerring said he wants manufacturers to do one thing. “I want them to play on the same playing field as all the rest of us.”\n\nDebnar meanwhile, a self-professed ‘gadget guy’, said he ordered his Tesla online… sight unseen. He admitted, “Never saw one, touched one or drove one when I hit that ‘submit’ button.”\n\nThe electric car owner thinks the high-end automaker will be a perfect fit for NorthPark when it opens a ‘gallery’ as it’s called, later this summer.\n\n(©2014 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

The Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation was also redirecting satellites there, AMSA said.\n\nA flotilla of Australian and Chinese ships would take longer to shift north, however, with the Australian naval ship the HMAS Success not due to arrive until Saturday morning.\n\nThe new search area is larger, but closer to Perth, allowing aircraft to spend longer on site by shortening travel times. It is also vastly more favourable in terms of the weather as it is out of the deep sea region known as the Roaring 40s for its huge seas and frequent storm-force winds.\n\n""I’m not sure that we’ll get perfect weather out there, but it’s likely to be better more often than what we’ve seen in the past,"" John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told reporters, adding the previous search site was being abandoned.\n\n""We have moved on from those search areas to the newest credible lead,"" he said.\n\nThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said earlier that the shift was based on analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. At that time, the Boeing 777 was making a radical diversion west from its course.\n\nMalaysia’s civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said at Friday’s news conference he was ""not at liberty"" to give the exact path of the aircraft. Officials close to the investigation told Reuters last week that the plane may have passed close to Port Blair, the capital of India’s Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 550 miles (885 km) further northwest from where Malaysia has said its military radar last detected it.\n\nSATELLITE IMAGES\n\nThe shift comes less than a day after the latest reports of sightings of possible wreckage, captured by Thai and Japanese satellites in roughly the same frigid expanse of sea as earlier images reported by France, Australia and China.\n\nImages had shown suspected debris, including pieces as large as 24 metres (70 ft), within the original search area in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nPotential debris has also been seen from search aircraft, but none has been picked up or confirmed as the wreckage of Flight MH370.\n\nHishammuddin said it was still possible that those objects were debris from the plane, as any wreckage could have been swept hundreds of miles from the crash site by now.\n\n""Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,"" he said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy said on Friday it was sending a second P8-Poseidon, its most advanced maritime surveillance aircraft, to help in the search.\n\n""It’s critical to continue searching for debris so we can reverse-forecast the wind, current and sea state since March 8 to recreate the position where MH370 possibly went into the water,"" said Commander Tom Moneymaker, a U.S. 7th Fleet oceanographer.\n\nThe United States has also sent a device that can be towed behind a ship to pick up faint pings from the plane’s black box voice and data recorders, but time is running out.\n\n""We’ve got to get this initial position right prior to deploying the Towed Pinger Locator since the MH370’s black box has a limited battery life and we can’t afford to lose time searching in the wrong area,"" Moneymaker said.', 'Australia said late on Friday that five aircraft had spotted ""multiple objects of various colours"" in the new search area.\nMalaysian officials said the new search area was the result of a painstaking analysis of Malaysian military radar data and satellite readings from British company Inmarsat carried out by U.S., Chinese, British and Malaysian investigators.\nThe new search area is larger, but closer to Perth, allowing aircraft to spend longer on site by shortening travel times.\nImages had shown suspected debris, including pieces as large as 24 metres (70 ft), within the original search area in the southern Indian Ocean.\nPotential debris has also been seen from search aircraft, but none has been picked up or confirmed as the wreckage of Flight MH370.']"

The new search area is about four times bigger than the previous search area in the southern Indian Ocean although in more moderate seas and closer to the search base so aircraft could spend longer over the area.\n\nThe new information is based on continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost.\n\nIt indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled south into the Indian Ocean.\n\nATSB said the potential flight path may undergo further refinement as the international investigative team supporting the search continues their analysis.\n\nIn a statement Malaysia’s acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: “Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,” he said. “This work is on-going, and we can expect further refinements.

Credit:AP It is the closest city to where the plane is believed to have gone into the water, and that this view is being put to authorities in Kuala Lumpur. Under the arrangement, Malaysian investigators would travel to Australia to carry out any work on the wreckage. Malaysia would still lead the investigation but would be assisted by counterparts from Australia, Britain and the US. International conventions covering aviation accidents require the country of origin of the aircraft to launch an investigation and secure the wreckage - in this case Malaysia. But Australia has the facilities in Canberra to download the data from the black box flight recorder. In the region, Singapore, Indonesia and Japan have this capability, but it is understood that Malaysia does not.\n\nIndeed, Australian Transport Safety Bureau Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan stressed on Friday that any wreckage recovered needed initially to be brought to Australia. Mr Dolan told reporters: \'\'Any wreckage that is obtained, we will hold on behalf of the Malaysian investigation team and await their instructions. We\'re in continual discussion with the Malaysians about progress on the search and we will continue to discuss with them the handling of the wreckage as and when it comes to hand.\'\' Mr Dolan said any country that picks up wreckage would have to hand it over to Australian authorities, which are being led by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Australian authorities have expressed willingness to reassemble the wreckage. The new search zone is well away from debris picked up by a variety of satellites.\n\nIt is understood that a diplomatic note has been circulated to all countries involved in the search reminding them that all wreckage recovered should be brought to Australia, a directive apparently aimed at the Chinese. As of Friday, HMAS Success was the only Royal Australian Navy ship in the search area, along with five Chinese naval ships. The new focus of the search - now 1100 kilometres north-east of the previous search zone and 1850 kilometres due west of Perth - was based on Australian analysis of radar and satellite data, cross-checked against information about MH370\'s performance capability. The new search area was mapped out on Friday after data indicated the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, meaning it would have burnt fuel more quickly and crashed earlier. The 10 aircraft and six ships deployed in the search were re-directed to the new search area, and the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation is re-tasking satellites to image the new area, AMSA\'s John Young said. The new search zone is well away from debris picked up by a variety of satellites - US, Chinese, French, Thai and Japanese - that underpinned a fruitless search for more than a week.\n\nIndeed, Mr Young said that the satellite images were almost certainly not debris from the plane, and perhaps not even debris at all. Three weeks into the disappearance of the plane, the markedly different search zone will likely further anger families waiting for news. However, Mr Young said such changes were typical of these operations. \'\'I don\'t count the original work a waste of time,\'\' he said. At 319,000 square kilometres, the new search area is four times larger than Thursday\'s zone. But, being further north, the weather should be a lot calmer than the ""roaring 40s"" of the deep southern Indian Ocean where efforts had been concentrated. The plane\'s flight recorder - which will contain the last two hours of cockpit conversation plus a welter of flight data - is the key to solving the puzzle of its disappearance. A towed pinger locator is expected to be deployed this weekend to find the black box, which is thought to have barely a week left of batteries to power its beacon. The announcement by Malaysian authorities that they would not start the inquiry without the black box prompted angry debate in Malaysia\'s parliament as opposition MPs demanded the formation of a royal commission or setting up of a select parliamentary committee.\n\nA group of about 20 Chinese relatives of passengers who have been staying in Kuala Lumpur have called for the setting up of an inquiry by China. They have handed a petition to China\'s special envoy Zhang Yesui urging the Chinese government to ""investigate the truth"" behind what happened to their loved ones. The petition also demanded that Malaysia apologise to relatives. Shahidan Kassim, a minister in Malaysia\'s prime minister\'s department, said the timing of establishing an inquiry was seriously considered by the government. But he said locating the black box is of the ""upmost importance"" as the government is aware of negative foreign media reports against Malaysia.\n\nLoading Malaysia says analysis of satellite data shows the plane must have crashed into the far reaches of the Indian Ocean on March 8.

56925,http://english.astroawani.com/news/show/mh370-malaysia-wouldnt-have-done-anything-differently-hishammuddin-32711,business,"["": The Malaysian government today stood firm on its stance that it has done its everything in its power in the handling of the vanishing MH370 flight, saying that it 'would not have done anything differently'.This comes amid continued criticisms of Malaysia, especially from China, the country with the most number of passengers on board the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) plane, with some claiming that they were being lied to.Aside from discontent at the way information was being handed out, another controversial point of criticism was the alleged failure of armed forces to intercept the diverted plane when it appeared on military radar.Yesterday, Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri was forced to retract a statement he made saying that the air force assumed that flight MH370 had been ordered to turn-back by the civilian air traffic controllers, saying that his initial assumption was incorrect.Opposition leader DAP advisor Lim Kit Siang today even called for Abdul Rahim to either be sacked or resign over this inconsistency, the latest among others that have drawn flak from international media.Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein insisted today: “I don’t think we would have done anything different than what we had already done.”The Defence Minister said he believed that history will judge the country as a “responsible” one, and the effort so far has been “transparent”.“What have been thrown at us…we made sure no stones unturned. We make sure evidence is corroborated. It has not distracted us from the main mission, which is to find the plane,” he said.Despite initial red herrings in the search for the Boeing 777-200ER including reports about the plane landing in Naning, alleged sightings in the Straits of Malacca, and reported oil slicks, Hishammuddin said that the search effort has been consistent and was never side tracked.“I genuinely believe that the three gentleman here have conducted ourselves fairly,” he said, referring to himself and Department of Civil Aviation chief Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman and MAS CEO Datuk Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, the usual crew in charge of giving the daily press briefing.Hishammuddin today confirmed that the search for MH370 has been “further refined” and is being continually narrowed.Earlier today, Australian authorities confirmed that the search area in the southern Indian Ocean has shifted to a new area, approximately 1,680 kilometres west of Perth.This, the DCA said today, was based on calculations by Boeing, the plane-maker, that indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated. This resulted in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled.However, Hishammuddin admitted that the new search area was “although more focused than before, remains considerable; and that the search conditions, although easier than before, remain challenging.”On March 24, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak announced that based on new data analysis, Inmarsat and the AAIB had concluded that MH370 flew along the southern corridor, and that its last position was in the middle of the Indian Ocean, west of Perth.For the past week, the search has been based off Australia, which is leading the current search after the northern corridor was abandoned.Since then, the Malaysian investigation team has also set up an international working group, comprising agencies with expertise in satellite communications and aircraft performance. The group included representatives from the UK, namely Inmarsat, AAIB, and Rolls Royce; from China, namely the CAAC and AAID; from the US, namely the NTSB, FAA, and Boeing.“The group has been working to refine the Inmarsat data, and to analyse it – together with other information, including radar data and aircraft performance assumptions – to narrow the search area,” said Hishammuddin.Last night, Japanese authorities announced they had satellite images which showed a number of floating objects pproximately 2,500 kilometres southwest of Perth.Early this morning, Malaysia also received separate satellite imagery from the Thai authorities which also showed potential objects.These new satellite images join those released by Australia, China, France, and Malaysia, all of which are with RCC Australia.“The range of potential objects, and the difficulty in re-identifying them shows just how complex this investigation is,” said HishammuddinOn the families of those on board, Hishammuddin said the Cabinet today decided to continue supporting them."", "": The Malaysian government today stood firm on its stance that it has done its everything in its power in the handling of the vanishing MH370 flight, saying that it 'would not have done anything differently'.This comes amid continued criticisms of Malaysia, especially from China, the country with the most number of passengers on board the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) plane, with some claiming that they were being lied to.Aside from discontent at the way information was being handed out, another controversial point of criticism was the alleged failure of armed forces to intercept the diverted plane when it appeared on military radar.Yesterday, Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri was forced to retract a statement he made saying that the air force assumed that flight MH370 had been ordered to turn-back by the civilian air traffic controllers, saying that his initial assumption was incorrect.Opposition leader DAP advisor Lim Kit Siang today even called for Abdul Rahim to either be sacked or resign over this inconsistency, the latest among others that have drawn flak from international media.Acting Transport Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein insisted today: “I don’t think we would have done anything different than what we had already done.”The Defence Minister said he believed that history will judge the country as a “responsible” one, and the effort so far has been “transparent”.“What have been thrown at us…we made sure no stones unturned.\nWe make sure evidence is corroborated.\nIt has not distracted us from the main mission, which is to find the plane,” he said.Despite initial red herrings in the search for the Boeing 777-200ER including reports about the plane landing in Naning, alleged sightings in the Straits of Malacca, and reported oil slicks, Hishammuddin said that the search effort has been consistent and was never side tracked.“I genuinely believe that the three gentleman here have conducted ourselves fairly,” he said, referring to himself and Department of Civil Aviation chief Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman and MAS CEO Datuk Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, the usual crew in charge of giving the daily press briefing.Hishammuddin today confirmed that the search for MH370 has been “further refined” and is being continually narrowed.Earlier today, Australian authorities confirmed that the search area in the southern Indian Ocean has shifted to a new area, approximately 1,680 kilometres west of Perth.This, the DCA said today, was based on calculations by Boeing, the plane-maker, that indicated that the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated.\nThis resulted in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft travelled.However, Hishammuddin admitted that the new search area was “although more focused than before, remains considerable;

The disappearance of the airplane has presented two tales of modern technology. The public has been surprised to learn of the limitations of tracking and communications devices, which contributed to the plane vanishing for more than two weeks. But the advanced capabilities of some technologies, particularly satellites, have provided hope that the mystery won't go unsolved. (AP Photo/Australian Defence Department, Justin Brown, File)\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nAustralia announced Friday that the search area for the Malaysia Airlines jet that disappeared March 8 has shifted to a new Indian Ocean region, 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) to the northeast of where planes and ships had been trying to find it.\n\nWHY THE SHIFT?\n\nMartin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, said an additional analysis of radar data indicated the plane was traveling faster than was previously thought, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance it traveled south.\n\nDolan said the previous analysis had a range of possible assumptions about aircraft speed, and those assumptions have now been refined. He could not say exactly how much faster the plane is believed to have been traveling.\n\nNEW DEBRIS SIGHTING\n\nA New Zealand Orion plane spotted some unidentified objects in the new search zone, and a ship will attempt to confirm the sightings and identify the items by Saturday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.\n\nCONFUSION OVER IMAGERY\n\nSeveral countries have recently announced satellite sightings of debris in the previous search area. In an apparent difference of views, Australian officials have been hesitant to describe the objects as possible plane debris and are focusing instead on the new search area, while Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he believes both the debris sightings and the new search zone should be investigated. Some experts say the objects are most likely sea junk.\n\nNEW SEARCH AREA:\n\nThe new search zone is both closer to western Australia — and therefore easier for search crews to reach — and does not have the same harsh weather conditions as the old search location.\n\nRobin Beaman, a marine geologist and research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, said the new information means any debris that has sunk is likely to be in deeper water than previously thought, perhaps about 4,600 meters (15,100 feet) rather than 3,000 meters (9,842 feet)."", ""Australia Malaysia Plane Technology LimitsFILE - In this March 20, 2014 file photo provided by the Australia Defence Department, Royal Australian Air Force Loadmasters Sgt.\nJohn Mancey, launch a Self Locating Data Marker Buoy from a C-130J Hercules aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean as part of the Australian Defence Force's assistance to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.\nCONFUSION OVER IMAGERYSeveral countries have recently announced satellite sightings of debris in the previous search area.\nIn an apparent difference of views, Australian officials have been hesitant to describe the objects as possible plane debris and are focusing instead on the new search area, while Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he believes both the debris sightings and the new search zone should be investigated.\nNEW SEARCH AREA:The new search zone is both closer to western Australia — and therefore easier for search crews to reach — and does not have the same harsh weather conditions as the old search location.""]"

While one ship that\'s part of the search is reported to be in the area, others won\'t reach the location until Saturday.\n\nOur original post picks up the story and adds background:\n\nThe difficult search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 shifted dramatically Friday.\n\nThere was word that the search has been moved to an area of the southern Indian Ocean about 700 miles northeast of the zone that planes and ships have been crisscrossing for more than a week. They\'ve been looking for any sign of the plane and the 239 people who were on board when it disappeared three weeks ago.\n\nAccording to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, 10 aircraft were sent to the new zone on Friday. The area is about 123,000 square miles in size — roughly the same as the state of New Mexico — and is located more than 1,100 miles west of Perth, Australia.\n\nOne of the planes that went to the area on Friday, the AMSA says, spotted some objects. But whether those objects are connected to the missing jet still needs to be established, and most likely can\'t be until ships get to the scene on Saturday.\n\nFrom Sydney, correspondent Stuart Cohen tells our Newscast Desk that the search zone has shifted because investigators have re-examined radar data and calculated that the jet may have been flying faster than previously thought — and fast enough that it burned through its fuel much sooner than had been estimated.\n\nAs the BBC reminds readers:\n\n""Search efforts had until Friday morning focused on an area some 2,500km (1,550 miles) to the southwest of the Australian city of Perth. Using satellite images, several nations have identified objects floating in the sea in that search area, but these have not been located and there is no evidence that they are related to the plane. ... ""Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that the fact that the search area had moved did not discount the earlier satellite images of possible debris further south. "" \'Because of ocean drift, this new search area could still be consistent with the potential objects identified by various satellite images over the past week,\' Mr Hussein said.""\n\nThose satellite images were at least several days old by the time investigators were able to examine them closely enough to say they showed objects that might possibly be debris from the jet. By the time the images were available, whatever was spotted had likely drifted considerably.\n\nInvestigators had repeatedly warned that there is a considerable amount of flotsam in the southern Indian Ocean, including large containers that have fallen off ships. The satellite images, they cautioned, might only have shown some of that flotsam.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Malaysia Airlines flight disappeared in the early hours of March 8, local time, which was midday March 7 on the East Coast of the U.S. Bound for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 passengers and crew, it was over the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and Vietnam when the last message from the cockpit to air traffic controllers — ""all right, good night"" — was heard.\n\nInvestigators believe the plane then turned sharply to the west, flew back over the Malay Peninsula and headed south over the Indian Ocean. It may have been in the air for six or seven more hours. Theories about what happened vary widely, from some sort of catastrophe on board that disabled the crew to a hijacking.\n\nAccording to the Australian maritime authority, six countries are assisting in the search and recovery operation — Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, China and the Republic of Korea.\n\nCopyright NPR 2019.', 'While one ship that\'s part of the search is reported to be in the area, others won\'t reach the location until Saturday.\nOur original post picks up the story and adds background:The difficult search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 shifted dramatically Friday.\n...

But as the wary allies focus on solving the Malaysia Airlines missing plane mystery, they are keenly aware of the boundaries of cooperation, diplomatic or military.\n\n""When they are out there and the U.S. is using its sensors, you can be absolutely sure that the Chinese are recording all of that and are analysing how it\'s done because that\'s very useful in understanding how the P8s work,"" David Brewster, a visiting fellow at the Strategic Defence and Studies Centre at the Australian National University, told Reuters.\n\nThe Poseidon, an anti-submarine warfare and electronic signals interception plane manufactured by Boeing Co, is the most advanced of its type. Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea all operate an earlier model, the P3 Orion, while China has the larger Russian-made Ilyushin.\n\nThe P8 only entered service in 2013 and information on its sophisticated sensors could be a prime target for Chinese intelligence.\n\n""I\'m not surprised to see a lot of security. There\'s a lot of political sensitivity,"" Brewster said.\n\nWestern forces are also keeping their eyes open. Air search crews for Malaysia Airlines plane said that Australian personnel were flying with the Chinese on their sorties. It was not clear if that was for security reasons or to assist with communications after the first Chinese aircraft to fly into Perth landed at the wrong airport last weekend.\n\nChinese Defence Ministry spokesman Geng Yansheng said on Thursday that Chinese forces had had ""effective communication"" with the other countries taking part in the search, including ""close coordination"" with the Australians and Malaysians.\n\nDIPLOMATIC SENSITIVITIES\n\nThen there are diplomatic sensitivities, chief among them the stormy relationships between Japan and its historical foes, regional superpower China and South Korea. By all accounts that has gone more smoothly than many had expected.\n\nEarlier this week, Australian Defence Minister David Johnston hosted a lunch at Perth\'s RAAF Base Pearce mess hall with a dozen representatives of both the Chinese and Japanese search teams, as well as the Australians.\n\nA defence ministry source in attendance told Reuters the teams enjoyed corned beef or chicken noodles in a convivial atmosphere, albeit sitting in their national groupings.\n\n""It was very amiable and relaxed, there was no tension whatsoever, it was all friendly - all very professional,"" the source said under condition of anonymity because the person was unauthorised to speak to the media.\n\nBringing together countries like China and Japan, which have a history of tensions over strategic grievances going back beyond World War Two, does raise cooperation issues, said Andrew Davies, a senior analyst for defence capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\n\nBut bigger political realities often faded, he said, when the issue at hand was getting the job done.\n\n""You might be surprised at how down-to-business the actual operators can be on the ground,"" he said.', 'Air search crews for Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane said that Australian personnel were flying with the Chinese on their sorties.\nThe Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 tragedy has raised many questions that leaders across a number of nations are struggling with.\nThe search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 is producing strange bedfellows.\nBut as the wary allies focus on solving the Malaysia Airlines missing plane mystery, they are keenly aware of the boundaries of cooperation, diplomatic or military.\nAir search crews for Malaysia Airlines plane said that Australian personnel were flying with the Chinese on their sorties.']"

The search is being redirected to another spot in the southern Indian Ocean on Friday in light of a new analysis that suggests the plane was traveling faster, and thus ran out of fuel earlier, than previously thought. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said the search is being shifted to a region 680 miles northeast of where planes and ships have been looking. “This is a credible new lead and will be thoroughly investigated today,” said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\n\nAuthorities explained that this “new lead” is based on their analysis, not a significant new clue. “There is a set of radar data from a number of sources, but most of this work is closer analysis of existing data rather than new radar data coming to light,” said Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.\n\nFour search planes arrived in the new area on Friday, and six ships were on their way there. The previous search area was known for strong winds and high waves, but conditions should be better in the new region.\n\nJohn Young, manager of AMSA’s emergency response division, told reporters he doesn’t feel the previous searches were pointless. “This is the normal business of search and rescue operations – that new information comes to light, refined analyses take you to a different place,” Young said. “I don’t count the original work as a waste of time.”\n\nStill, the chances of finding out what happened to Flight 370 are becoming more slim every day.

where an international team is looking for wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 today, Australian authorities said.\n\nThe Australian Maritime and Safety Authority (AMSA) said it was awaiting images from the Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion, which was on its way back to base.\n\nThe sightings would need to be confirmed by ship, which was not expected until Saturday, AMSA said in its official twitter feed.\n\nAn international air and sea taskforce hunting for the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 was re-directed today to an area 1,100 km north of where they have been searching for more than a week, after Australian authorities received new radar information from Malaysia.\n\nThe dramatic shift in the search area, moving it further than the distance between London and Berlin, followed analysis of radar data that showed the missing plane had travelled faster, and so would have run out of fuel quicker, than previously thought.\n\n“I’m not sure that we’ll get perfect weather out there, but it’s likely to be better more often than what we’ve seen in the past,” John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told reporters, adding the previous search site was being abandoned.\n\n“We have moved on from those search areas to the newest credible lead,” he said.\n\nThe new search area is larger, but closer to the Australian west coast city of Perth, allowing aircraft to spend longer on site by shortening travel times.\n\nIt is also vastly more favourable in terms of the weather as it is out of the deep sea region known as the Roaring 40s for its huge seas and frequent storm-force winds.\n\nFor more than a week, ships and surveillance planes have been scouring seas 2,500 km southwest of Perth, where satellite images had suggested there could be debris from Flight MH370, which went missing on March 8th with 239 people aboard.\n\nTen aircraft searching today were immediately re-directed to the new area of 319,000 sq km . roughly the size of Poland, around 1,850 km west of Perth.\n\nThe Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation was also redirecting satellites there, AMSA said.\n\nA flotilla of Australian and Chinese ships would take longer to shift north, however, with the Australian naval ship the HMAS Success not due to arrive until tomorrow morning.\n\nThe shift was based on analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said.\n\nAt that time, the Boeing 777 was making a radical diversion west from its course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nATSB Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan said radar and satellite polling data had been combined with information about the likely performance of the aircraft, speed and fuel consumption in particular, to arrive at the best assessment of the area in which the aircraft was likely to have entered the water.\n\nAn international investigative team continued to analyze the data, Dolan said, which “could result in further refinement of the potential flight path of MH370”.\n\nShifting searches\n\nThe latest twist underscores the perplexing and frustrating hunt for evidence in the near three-week search.\n\nIt comes less than a day after the latest reports of sightings of possible wreckage, captured by Thai and Japanese satellites in roughly the same frigid expanse of sea as earlier images reported by France, Australia and China.\n\nSatellite images had shown suspected debris, including pieces as large as 24 meters, within the original search area in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nPotential debris has also been seen from search aircraft, but none has been picked up or confirmed as the wreckage of Flight MH370, which disappeared from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off.\n\nOfficials believe someone on board may have shut off the plane’s communications systems before flying it thousands of miles off course, where it crashed into the ocean in one of the most isolated and forbidding regions on the planet.\n\nTheories range from a hijacking to sabotage or a possible suicide by one of the pilots, but investigators have not ruled out technical problems.\n\nDavid Brewster, a visiting fellow at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University, said it was surprising that the new data analysis was just coming to light.\n\n“The Malaysians have never really had to handle a search and rescue operation of this nature before so it is maybe complicated by lack of experience,” Mr Brewster said.\n\n“There is no doubt they haven’t got their systems working smoothly in terms of sharing within Malaysian organizations or with neighboring countries.”\n\nReinforcements\n\nThe US Navy said on Friday it was sending a second P8-Poseidon, its most advanced maritime surveillance aircraft, to help in the search.\n\n“It’s critical to continue searching for debris so we can reverse-forecast the wind, current and sea state since March 8th to recreate the position where MH370 possibly went into the water,” said Commander Tom Moneymaker, a US 7th Fleet oceanographer.\n\nThe United States has also sent a device that can be towed behind a ship to pick up faint pings from the plane’s black box voice and data recorders, but time is running out.\n\n“We’ve got to get this initial position right prior to deploying the Towed Pinger Locator since the MH370’s black box has a limited battery life and we can’t afford to lose time searching in the wrong area,” Mr Moneymaker said.\n\nThe prolonged and so far fruitless search and investigation have taken a toll, with dozens of distraught relatives of 150 Chinese passengers clashing with police and accusing Malaysia of “delays and deception”.\n\nChinese insurance companies have started paying compensation to the families of passengers, some of the firms and state media said.\n\nReuters', 'A plane had spotted objects in the new Indian Ocean search area where an international team is looking for wreckage from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 today, Australian

It indicates the plane was traveling faster than was previously thought, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance it traveled south.\n\nTwo sets of data were compared: the ""pinging"" from a satellite to the aircraft, which gives the approximate location of the plane within the ""arc"" stretching from Malaysia to the southern Indian Ocean, and the various projections of aircraft performance, in particular speed and fuel consumption. That resulted in the ""best assessment of the area where it entered the water,"" Dolan said.\n\nDolan said that he previous analysis had a range of possible assumptions about aircraft speed, and those assumptions have now been refined. Dolan could not say exactly how much faster the plane is believed to have been traveling, compared to earlier estimates.\n\n""INEXACT SCIENCE""\n\nAccording to John Young, manager of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority\'s emergency response division, this kind of twists and turns ""is the normal business of search and rescue operations.""\n\nDolan added: ""This will remain a somewhat inexact science.""\n\nNEW SEARCH AREA:\n\nThe new search zone is both closer to western Australia — and therefore easier for search crews to reach — and does not have the same harsh weather conditions as the old search location.\n\nRobin Beaman, a marine geologist and research fellow at Australia\'s James Cook University, said the new information means any debris that has sunk is likely to be in deeper water than previously thought, perhaps about 4,600 meters (15,100 feet) rather than 3,000 meters (9,842 feet).\n\nSATELLITE IMAGES:\n\nImages that have emerged from various satellites ""may or may not be objects,"" and none of them have actually been spotted by searchers, Young said.', 'It indicates the plane was traveling faster than was previously thought, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance it traveled south.\nThat resulted in the ""best assessment of the area where it entered the water,"" Dolan said.\nDolan said that he previous analysis had a range of possible assumptions about aircraft speed, and those assumptions have now been refined.\nDolan could not say exactly how much faster the plane is believed to have been traveling, compared to earlier estimates.\nSATELLITE IMAGES:Images that have emerged from various satellites ""may or may not be objects,"" and none of them have actually been spotted by searchers, Young said.']"

Most of the objects measured from about 3-65 feet.\n\nMr Young said those satellite images “may or may not actually be objects” and acknowledged that the search had moved away from that previous area.\n\nHe said it not unusual to make such changes and dismissed questions that the earlier searches had been a wasted effort.\n\n“This is the normal business of search and rescue operations - that new information comes to light, refined analyses take you to a different place,” he said. “I don’t count the original work as a waste of time.”\n\nThe new area is 123,000 square miles and about 1,250 miles west of Perth. The sea depth in the new area ranged from 6,560-13,120 feet, Mr Young said.\n\nAustralia’s HMAS Success and five Chinese vessels were on their way, and that the Success was expected to arrive there tomorrow night local time.\n\nStrong winds and currents have made it difficult to pinpoint objects spotted so far, and the search has yet to produce any trace of the plane.\n\nMalaysian officials said earlier this week that satellite data confirmed the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nAuthorities are rushing to find any piece of the plane to help them locate the so-called black boxes, or flight data and voice recorders, that will help solve the mystery of why the jet, en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, flew so far off-course. The battery in the black box normally lasts about a month.\n\nFor relatives of the 239 people aboard Flight 370, the various clues and failed searches so far have just added to their agonizing waits.\n\nWang Zhen, whose parents were aboard the missing plane, said he was becoming exasperated.\n\n“There is nothing I can do but to wait, and wait,” he said from Beijing. “I’m also furious, but what is the use of getting furious?”\n\nAmsa said the change came after the updated new information, based on continuing analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost with the Boeing 777.\n\nIt said the analysis indicated the aircraft was travelling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel use and reducing the possible distance the aircraft could have flown into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe previous search area was more south west and about 1,550 miles from Perth.\n\n“This is a credible new lead and will be thoroughly investigated today,” Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said.\n\n“This is an extraordinarily difficult search, and an agonising wait for family and friends of the passengers and crew. We owe it to them to follow every credible lead and to keep the public informed of significant new developments. That is what we are doing.”', 'AIR crews have begun searching a new area of the Indian Ocean for signs of the missing Malaysian airliner after new radar data analysis suggested the jet flew faster than originally thought.\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 370 would have used up more fuel, which may have reduced the distance it travelled, Australia said.\nFour search planes were in the area today and six ships were heading there, said John Young, manager of Amsa’s emergency response division, adding they had moved on from the previous search area, about 1,550 miles from Perth, in Western Australia, the launching base for the search.\nThe new search area is more than 600 miles north of an area in which apparently floating objects were spotted by Japanese, Thai and French satellites earlier this week.\nThe previous search area was more south west and about 1,550 miles from Perth.']"

The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has moved again.\n\nIn a stunning turn, Australian authorities announced Friday they were abandoning the remote region of Indian Ocean where search crews had spent more than a week looking for the plane. A new analysis of satellite data showed the plane could not have flown that far south, they said.\n\n“We have moved on from those search areas,” said John Young, general manager of emergency response for the Australian maritime authority.\n\nThe new zone is 680 miles (about 1,100 kilometers) to the northeast, closer to the Australian coast.\n\nIn what could be a sign the search is on the right track, or possibly yet another letdown, the agency said five of the 10 planes dispatched to the new search zone had spotted objects in the waters below. Crews took photographs of the objects, and those images will be analyzed overnight, the authority said.\n\n“The objects cannot be verified or discounted as being from MH370 until they are relocated and recovered by ships,” the authority said in a statement.\n\nCNN’s Kyung Lah, who went out on a U.S. Navy P-8 search plane Friday, said the crew of that plane spotted white objects, orange rope and a blue bag.\n\n“At one point, sure, everybody on board got a little excited, but it’s impossible to tell from that distance what anything is,” she said.\n\nExactly what the planes had found was unclear, but if the finds turn out to be something other than plane debris, it would not be the first time.\n\nA Chinese aircraft reported spotting possible aircraft debris early in the search, but that sighting turned out to be nothing.\n\n‘We have not seen any debris’\n\nFriday’s developments cap three weeks of frequent false leads in the search for the plane, which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard.\n\nMalaysian authorities announced Monday that an analysis of satellite signals sent by the plane indicated that it must have gone down in the southern Indian Ocean. Analysts who relied on sophisticated mathematics to come to their conclusion couldn’t offer a specific impact spot, however.\n\nThe decision to move the search zone came after additional analysis indicating the plane didn’t fly as far south as previously thought, acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Friday.\n\nThe old area had seemed promising after repeated satellite images showed multitudes of objects floating in the water.\n\nBut Young said Australian authorities had concluded the images did not show aircraft wreckage.\n\n“In regards to the old areas, we have not seen any debris,” he said, adding that he would not classify anything satellites or planes have spotted as debris. “That’s just not justifiable from what we have seen.”\n\nBetter conditions\n\nThe new zone remains vast — roughly 123,000 square miles (319,000 square kilometers). It is still also remote — 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) west of Perth.\n\nBut Young said conditions there are “likely to be better more often” than they were in the old search area, where poor weather has grounded flights two days this week.\n\nPlanes will be able to spend more time in the air because the new search zone is closer to land, Young said.\n\nU.S. flight crews involved in the search aren’t frustrated or disillusioned by the sudden change in the search, said Cmdr. William Marks of the Navy’s U.S. 7th Fleet.\n\n“For the pilots and the air crews, this is what they train for,” he said. “They understand it.”\n\nWasted time?\n\nSome analysts, however, raised their eyebrows at the sudden shift.\n\n“Really? That much debris and we’re not going to have a look at it to see what that stuff might be?” said David Gallo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who helped lead the search for the flight recorders from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.\n\nOthers lamented the amount of time, money and resources that were spent in the old search area.\n\n“This is time that has been wasted, there’s no question,” said CNN aviation analyst Miles O’Brien.\n\nHishammuddin disputed that suggestion.\n\n“I don’t think we would’ve done anything different from what we have done,” he said.\n\nCNN safety analyst David Soucie said it was “a good sign” that experts had adjusted their assumptions.\n\n“Assumptions are the key to all of this,” he said. “If you assume something and you end up with a final conclusion, you have to constantly review that.”\n\nVast, evolving search\n\nThe shifting hunt for Flight 370 has spanned oceans and continents.\n\nIt started in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, where the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers.\n\nAfter authorities learned of radar data suggesting the plane had turned west across the Malay Peninsula after losing contact, they expanded the search into the Strait of Malacca.\n\nWhen those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean.\n\nIt then ballooned dramatically after Malaysia announced March 15 that satellite data showed the plane could have flown along two huge arcs, one stretching northwest into the Asian landmass, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe search area at that point reached nearly 3 million square miles.\n\nOn Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that further analysis of the data had led authorities to conclude the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far from land.\n\nMalaysian officials told the families of those on board that nobody would have survived.

A new analysis of satellite data showed the plane could not have flown that far south, they said.\n\n“We have moved on from those search areas,” said John Young, general manager of emergency response for the Australian maritime authority.\n\nThe new zone is 680 miles (about 1,100 kilometers) to the northeast, closer to the Australian coast.\n\nA New Zealand air force surveillance plane flying over the new search area spotted unidentified objects floating in the water and was returning to its base in Perth, Australia, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said on Twitter.\n\nThe agency was waiting for images of the objects for analysis but said the finds would not be confirmed until Saturday, when a ship is expected to arrive at the site.\n\nExactly what the plane had found was unclear, but if the finds turn out to be something other than plane debris, it would not be the first time.\n\nA Chinese aircraft reported spotting possible aircraft debris early in the search, but that sighting turned out to be nothing.\n\n‘We have not seen any debris’\n\nFriday’s developments cap three weeks of frequent false leads in the search for the plane, which disappeared on March 8 with 239 people aboard.\n\nMalaysian authorities announced Monday that an analysis of satellite signals sent by the plane indicated that it must have gone down in the southern Indian Ocean. Analysts who relied on sophisticated mathematics to come to their conclusion couldn’t offer a specific impact spot, however.\n\nThe decision to move the search zone came after additional analysis indicating the plane didn’t fly as far south as previously thought, acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Friday.\n\nYoung said Australian authorities had concluded a series of satellite images taken over the old search zone showing objects floating in the ocean did not show aircraft wreckage.\n\n“In regards to the old areas, we have not seen any debris,” he said, adding that he would not classify anything satellites or planes have spotted as debris. “That’s just not justifiable from what we have seen.”\n\nHishammuddin seemed to dispute Young’s account, suggesting that the new search area “could still be consistent” with the idea that materials spotted in recent satellite photos over the previous search area are connected to the plane. The materials could have drifted in ocean currents, he said.\n\nBetter conditions\n\nThe new zone remains vast — roughly 123,000 square miles (319,000 square kilometers). It is still also remote — 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) west of Perth.\n\nBut Young said conditions there are “likely to be better more often” than they were in the old search area, where poor weather has grounded flights two days this week.\n\nPlanes will be able to spend more time in the air because the new search zone is closer to land, Young said.\n\nU.S. flight crews involved in the search aren’t frustrated or disillusioned by the sudden change in the search, said Cmdr. William Marks of the Navy’s U.S. 7th Fleet.\n\n“For the pilots and the air crews, this is what they train for,” he said. “They understand it.”\n\nWasted time?\n\nSome analysts raised their eyebrows at the sudden shift.\n\n“Really? That much debris and we’re not going to have a look at it to see what that stuff might be?” said David Gallo of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who helped lead the search for the flight recorders from Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.\n\nOthers lamented the amount of time, money and resources that were spent in the old search area.\n\n“This is time that has been wasted, there’s no question,” said CNN aviation analyst Miles O’Brien.\n\nBut Young and Hishammuddin disputed that suggestion.\n\n“I don’t think we would’ve done anything different from what we have done,” Hishammuddin said.\n\nYoung said previous searches were based on the information authorities “had at the time.”\n\n“That’s nothing unusual for search and rescue operations,” he said.\n\nCNN safety analyst David Soucie said it was “a good sign” that experts had adjusted their assumptions.\n\n“Assumptions are the key to all of this,” he said. “If you assume something and you end up with a final conclusion, you have to constantly review that.”\n\nVast, evolving search\n\nThe shifting hunt for Flight 370 has spanned oceans and continents.\n\nIt started in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, where the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers.\n\nAfter authorities learned radar data suggested the plane had turned west across the Malay Peninsula after losing contact, they expanded the search into the Strait of Malacca.\n\nWhen those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean.\n\nIt then ballooned dramatically after Malaysia announced on March 15 that satellite data suggested the plane’s last position was somewhere along two huge arcs, one stretching northwest into the Asian landmass, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe search area at that point reached nearly 3 million square miles.\n\nOn Monday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that further analysis of satellite data had led authorities to conclude that the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far from land.\n\nMalaysian officials told the families of those on board that nobody would have survived. But many relatives have said that only the discovery of wreckage from the plane will convince them of the fate of their loved ones.', '× New objects sighted as MH370 search shifts dramatically(CNN) — Forget all those satellite photos showing promising patches of debris.\nYoung said Australian authorities had concluded a series of satellite images taken over the old search zone showing objects floating in the ocean did not show aircraft wreckage.\nPlanes will be able to spend more time in the air because the new search zone is closer to land, Young said.\nU.S. flight crews involved in the search aren’t frustrated or disillusioned by the sudden change in the search, said Cmdr.\nWhen those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean.']"

The inflation number will be the big test of that statement,” said Brian Daingerfield, a foreign-exchange strategist at RBS.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.0636% rose to $1.3759 from $1.3744 late Thursday, posting a weekly loss of 0.3%. Preliminary data suggested a 1% rise in German consumer prices from a year ago. Data also showed that Spain slipped into deflation this month, building anticipation for March’s euro-zone inflation data due Monday. Confidence about the euro-zone economy rose in March, especially in the services and retail sectors.\n\n“In the context of the ECB’s price stability mandate, it will become increasingly indefensible not to act if inflation falls to a new low,” said Camilla Sutton, chief foreign-exchange strategist at Scotiabank, in a note. The ECB targets inflation of just under 2% in the medium term.\n\nECB officials have been signalling that the central bank could consider nonstandard measures to ease policy further, including negative deposit rates, and have discussed how the high exchange rate has weighed on inflation. At the same time, the Federal Reserve is on track to end its bond-buying program this year and could begin to hike rates approximately six months after that, according to comments from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen. That would be positive for the U.S. currency.\n\nThe dollar USDJPY, -0.17% jumped to 102.82 yen from ¥102.17 late Thursday, netting a 0.5% weekly gain. The Australian dollar AUDUSD, -0.1023% fell to 92.46 U.S. cents from 92.61 U.S. cents, but posted a weekly gain of 1.8%. For the month, the Aussie has jumped 3.6% against the U.S. unit.\n\nThe Aussie has gained this month in part due to strengthening domestic data and a resulting shift to a more neutral policy stance from the Australian central bank, said Daingerfield of RBS.\n\nThe dollar was set to log monthly declines against emerging currencies such as the Brazilian real, Indian rupee, and Turkish lira.\n\nU.S. data released Friday showed consumer spending rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in February, the fastest pace since November. But purchases of big-ticket items declined for the third month.\n\nThe ICE dollar index DXY, +0.07%, a measure of the dollar’s strength against six rivals, rose to 80.170 from 80.123.

57056,http://www.investing.com/analysis/threat-of-deflation-sends-euro-to-three-week-lows-207783,business,"[""The main impulse, today, is the heightened deflationary risk in the euro area, sparked by Spanish and German state inflation figures. The euro area's flash CPI will be reported Monday ahead of next Thursday's ECB meeting.\n\n\n\nSince Draghi's comments that recognized that the euro's strength, while not a target of policy directly, was becoming a risk to the growth and inflation goals of the central bank, and Bundesbank President Weidmann apparently dropping his opposition to QE (in theory), the euro has slowly surrendering the gains scored in response to the do-nothing ECB meeting.\n\n\n\nSpain reported a 0.2% decline in the preliminary reading of March CPI. The market has expected an unchanged reading of 0.1% for the EU harmonized measure. It is the lowest since Oct 2009. In the euro-area measure, Spain is about 1/8. However, the German states that have reported suggest slippage in the national estimate that will be reported in the North American morning. The harmonized measure may ease below 1.0%.\n\n\n\nAdding insult to injury, the real sector data has disappointed, as well. Spanish retail sales recovered strongly last year. Retail sales were contracted at an almost 12% year-over-year pace at the end of 2012. In September, it was rising a little more than 2%. In February, it fell 0.5% after a 0.5% gain in January.\n\n\n\nThe French disappointment was just as disturbing. Following news earlier this week of a further rise in unemployment, today France reported a 0.3% fall in February consumer spending on a year-over-year basis. The Bloomberg consensus expected a 0.7% gain. On the month, sales rose 0.1%, not 0.8% as was expected.\n\n\n\nThe net effect has been to boost expectations for ECB action next week. The 1-year/1-year EONIA rate, which has become a popular way to gauge expectations, is falling today, as it has each day this week, for its longest streak in a year. It stands at a 2-week low near 18 bp. The heightened risks that the ECB responds come at the same time the rise in short-term US rates, sparked by the FOMC and Yellen's comments have not been reversed.\n\n\n\nThis has sent the US-German 2-year spread above 30 bp, the highest since mid-2012 (~33 bp), which is essentially the high since the crisis. Although it the relationship had broken down, over the long-term, we find it have been a useful guide. Perhaps the fact that both sides are moving in opposite directions and the sheer magnitude is going to pull the euro back into its orbit.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the LTRO payment announcement today will be closely watched. Banks have stepped up their payments in recent weeks, and very little appears to have been rolled into the main repo operations. Banks have paid down about 40 bln euro sin the past three week. Excess liquidity in has fallen below 105 bln euros, which represents a new low since the LTRO's.\n\n\n\nAfter taking out the FOMC low (~$1.3750) in North America yesterday, the soft data allowed European participants push through the door that was already open. The euro found a bid ahead of $1.3700. A break of there could set up a quick move toward the $1.3640-50 area. The short-term speculative market has been accumulating a significant long euro position.\n\n\n\nIn the futures market, the gross long position has risen consistently from about 67.6k contracted in early February to 118k contracts as of March 18. The cost of holding euro positions has increased (interest rate differential) and the risk of ECB action next week has increased. Late longs are in weak hands and we suspect that money management discipline is flushing out some of these. However, many economists and analysts are warning of disappointment with the ECB, in which case the euro would likely recover by the end of next week.\n\n\n\nSeparately, the other theme that has emerged this week is the strength of the dollar-bloc currencies. They are easily the strongest of the majors this week with 1.8%-2.0% gains and the Aussie leading the way. It reached almost $0.9300 in Asia before pulling back. The pullback has been shallow and we suspect the market is not down yet and will push toward $0.9340 and possibly $0.9400. The technical trade idea suggested yesterday, the head and shoulders pattern in the euro against the Australian dollar, has continued to unfold. Recall the key break was at A$1.50 and the measuring objective is A$1.42, with the initial target near A$1.4730. It tested A$1.4780 today.\n\n\n\nThe New Zealand dollar is also extending its gains and approached $0.8700 today, a new 3-year high. It finished 2013 near $0.8200. It is the strongest major currency this quarter, gaining 5.8%. On the other hand, the Canadian dollar is the second strongest currency this week, but is the weakest on the quarter, losing about 3.5%. The US dollar is finding support near CAD1.10, but there too the market does not seem to have finished washing out the weak positions. There has been a large rise in short Canadian dollar futures positions, in recent weeks.\n\n\n\nThe US reports February personal income and consumption and the University of Michigan consumer confidence. These are not typically market movers. The Fed's George, a hawk, speaks, and this means no push against Yellen's 6-month framework. Lastly, we note that one mystery has deepened. Yesterday the Fed reported its custody holdings jumped $54.2 bln. This is the second large rise in a row for a combined $88.5 bln, after falling $104.5 bln in the previous week."", 'The main impulse, today, is the heightened deflationary risk in the euro area, sparked by Spanish and German state inflation figures.\nFollowing news earlier this week of a further rise in unemployment, today France reported a 0.3% fall in February consumer spending on a year-over-year basis.\nBanks have paid down about 40 bln euro sin the past three week.\nThe cost of holding euro positions has increased (interest rate differential) and the risk of ECB action next week has increased.\nThis is the second large rise in a row for a combined $88.5 bln, after falling $104.5 bln in the previous week.']"

Even so, the price action in several cross rates was quite interesting. The dollar started the session on a weak footing in Asia, but found its composure later in the session. The euro struggled to stay above some relevant short‐term support levels in several cross rates. EUR/USD challenged again extensively the 1.3750 support area. A clean break didn’t occur yet, but the test is ongoing.\n\nOvernight, Asian equities mostly show moderate gains. Markets take comfort from comments of Chinese Premier Li that the government has measures in place to support the economy. Still, those easing China tensions have no big impact on core bonds yields or on the major USD cross rates. USD/JPY is holding stable in the low 102 area despite end of quarter repositioning activity.\n\nEUR/USD remains in the defensive struggling to preserve the 1.3750/29 lows.\n\nToday, the calendar is well filled, especially in Europe. The EMU confidence data are expected to confirm the scenario of a gradual recovery. However, this information was already available via the preliminary PMI. The market reaction should be limited in case of no big surprise. The focus for bond and currency traders will be on the (regional) German inflation data. The consensus expects a 0.4% M/M and 0.9% Y/Y increase. The picture for the German inflation is less clear than for the EMU measure on Monday, where we see clear downside risks. So, it is no done thing that today’s data will reinforce the case for more ECB easing. Even so, one can expected ongoing nervousness as the regional data filter through. In the US, the personal income and spending, and the final Michigan consumer confidence will be published. The data have potential to move the market intraday, but the focus of US traders will already turn the key early month data expected next week.\n\nEarlier this week, EUR/USD came gradually under pressure as markets turned more cautious on the euro ahead of the German/EMU inflation and next week’s ECB policy meeting. EUR/USD is testing the recent lows as the markets see the chance for more easing becoming again more realistic. It is not clear whether today’s data will reinforce the view, but the debate will probably persist. A euro rebound, if any, will probably remain limited. A cautious sell‐on upticks approach can be considered. The jury is still out regarding a more broad‐based dollar rebound. For that to happen, stronger US eco data are needed. Also keep an eye at the (short‐term) bond yield differentials between the dollar and the euro. Will a further rise finally support the dollar against the euro? Even so, the 1.40 barrier is now better protected.\n\n\n\n\n\nSterling rallies on strong retail sales\n\nThursday, sterling extended its gains versus euro and dollar following strong UK retail sales, which stimulates thinking that the BoE will be obliged to tighten policy sooner rather than later. The full daily price action in both pairs occurred on the release of the figures. Both before and afterwards the pairs moved sideways. The move is technically relevant for EUR/GBP, as the pair dropped below 0.8285, which if confirmed opens the road towards the cycle lows below 0.82. Cable’s three day rebound was extended pushing cable further away from the 1.6460 reaction low.\n\nOvernight, the UK GFK consumer confidence improved slightly more than expected from ‐7 to ‐5. Until now, the report had no noticeable impact on sterling trading. Even so, it might help to keep the recent sterling positive momentum in place.\n\nLater today, the UK eco calendar is fairly uneventful (Q4 final GDP revision, Q4 current account), but the EMU calendar contains the EU Commission Confidence data and German inflation. We see risks for upward surprises in the confidence data. The picture for the German inflation is less clear but there are downside risks for the EMU inflation on Monday. Even so, we think German inflation is the most important data series today as the confidence data follow the PMI’s that cover partly the same theme. A downward surprise on inflation may raise expectations that the ECB may after all ease its policy further. We are cautious though as the ECB suggested last meeting it had finished its easing campaign. Nevertheless, a downward surprise would weigh on the euro benefitting thus sterling. Of course, following a four day winning streak and ahead of the weekend, sterling bulls may be a bit tired and looking to safeguard the short term gains.\n\nRecently, EUR/GBP was hovering in a tight range between 0.8320 and 0.84. After yesterday’s correction, this short‐term range bottom is broken. It opens the way for a retest of the 0.8157 year low. This move can occur due to sterling strength or because weak inflation stimulates easing hopes in the euro. .', 'Today, the calendar is well filled, especially in Europe.\nThe EMU confidence data are expected to confirm the scenario of a gradual recovery.\nThe focus for bond and currency traders will be on the (regional) German inflation data.\nLater today, the UK eco calendar is fairly uneventful (Q4 final GDP revision, Q4 current account), but the EMU calendar contains the EU Commission Confidence data and German inflation.\nThe picture for the German inflation is less clear but there are downside risks for the EMU inflation on Monday.']"

Eco data couldn’t cause significant moves. German Bunds outperformed US Treasuries, as investors clearly fear the outcome of today’s German inflation numbers and Monday’s EMU figures. At the end of European trading, the German Bund came very close to the contract high at 143.97. On a daily basis, the German yield curve shed 2.2 bps (30‐yr) to 3.2 bps (10‐yr). In the US, yield changes were more modest, ranging between +0.4 bps (2‐yr) and ‐1.6 bps (30‐yr). The US 30‐yr yield nevertheless tested key support around 3.5%.\n\nToday, the focus will be on the German HICP inflation data for March, which give a preview for the EMU data on Monday. Furthermore, EC’s confidence indicators, US personal income and spending and the final reading of US Un. of Michigan consumer confidence will be released. The ECB announces LTRO repayments and ECB’s Weidmann and Fed’s George are scheduled to speak.\n\nIn Germany, HICP inflation is forecast to have eased slightly in March, from 1.0% Y/Y to 0.9% Y/Y. On a monthly basis however, inflation is expected to have increased by 0.4% M/M. The relatively late timing of Easter will probably keep inflationary pressures limited in March, before picking up in April. Base effects are limited for Germany, contrary to the EMU measure, and we believe that the annual rate might even surprise on the upside. EC’s economic confidence is forecast to extend its uptrend in March, rising from 101.2 to 101.4, which if confirmed would be the 11th consecutive increase. The headline figure will probably be supported by a strong rebound in consumer sentiment, which was already shown by the first estimate. Therefore, we believe that the risks are for an upward surprise. In the US, both personal income and spending are expected to have increased by 0.3% M/M in March. Also interesting will be the PCE deflator. A limited 0.2% M/M rise is estimated, which would push the annual rate down to 0.9% Y/Y. We see risks for an upward surprise supported by higher prices in the services sector. The final reading of Michigan consumer sentiment is expected to show a limited upward revision, from 79.9 to 80.5, after the first estimate surprised on the downside. After the strong Conference Board’s reading, we see risks for a stronger upside revision.\n\nOvernight, NY Fed Dudley and Chicago Fed Evans spoke. Dudley refrained from commenting on monetary policy but said that the Fed should be watchful for ripple effects from emerging markets. Evans was dovish as usual, saying monetary policy is highly accommodative and needs to remain so for some time (risks outweigh costs!). Only high inflation would force his hand, but he sees this risk as very low.\n\nThe US Treasury finalised its end‐of‐month refinancing operation with good $29B 7‐yr Note auction. The auction stopped well below the 1:00 PM bid side and the bid cover was very close to the average over the prior year (2.59 vs. 2.57). A good direct bid led a solid overall buy side demand. This auction followed strong 2‐yr, 5‐yr and 2‐yr FRN Note auctions earlier this week.\n\nThe Italian debt agency taps the on the run 5‐yr BTP (€2‐3B 2.5% May2019) and 10‐yr BTP (€3‐3.75B 3.75% Sep2024). Especially the 10‐yr BTP trades rather rich on the 10‐yr part of the Italian curve. Nevertheless, compared to Spanish Bono’s/Obligacions, there is still some pick‐up. Adding the ongoing strong sentiment towards the periphery, we therefore believe the auctions should be okay. The total amount of BTP’s on offer is also the lowest since last year. Additionally, Italy will try to raise €2.5‐3.25B with the launch of a new 5‐yr CCTeu (Nov2019).\n\nOvernight, most Asian equities trade positive with a Chinese underperformance amid growth supportive talk by President Keqiang. Japanese eco data were stronger but didn’t influence trading. Comments by Fed Dudley and Evans (see above) couldn’t inspire trading.\n\nToday, the eco calendar heats up. The main item will be German inflation numbers. We see risks for a higher outcome, which is negative for core bonds. Other eco numbers could surprise on the upside, which could add to selling. Technical factors, like end of quarter buying and the end of the Japanese fiscal year might cause some intraday gyrations.\n\nTechnically, the Bund tested the contract high yesterday after dovish ECB comments earlier this week and in anticipation of (lower) inflation numbers and next week’s ECB meeting. In the German 10‐yr yield, we are close to 1.5% key support. Therefore, today and Monday’s outcome will be extra important, but we don’t anticipate a break. The US Note future is trading near the middle of a sideways range, awaiting the outcome of next week’s eco releases. The technical picture of the US 30‐yr yield (see above) sends a first warning signal though.', 'German Bunds outperformed US Treasuries, as investors clearly fear the outcome of today’s German inflation numbers and Monday’s EMU figures.\nOn a daily basis, the German yield curve shed 2.2 bps (30‐yr) to 3.2 bps (10‐yr).\nToday, the focus will be on the German HICP inflation data for March, which give a preview for the EMU data on Monday.\nThe main item will be German inflation numbers.\nIn the German 10‐yr yield, we are close to 1.5% key support.']"

The ECB meets on Thursday to decide on policy.\n\nThe euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3710 and was on track to end lower for a second straight week. Against the yen, the common currency fell to 139.96 yen, its lowest level since early March.\n\n“The March consumer inflation numbers for the euro zone are important and we expect a soft reading which will lead to expectations of a dovish ECB,” said Yujiro Gato, currency analyst at Nomura.\n\n“So there are downside risks to the euro going into next week, although having said that there is always a chance that the ECB may disappoint and take no action. In that case, the euro is bound to react strongly.”\n\nThe euro has sagged since comments this week for more ECB action came surprisingly from Germany, whose policymakers have repeatedly voiced concerns about unorthodox monetary easing.\n\nECB Governing Council member and Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said negative interest rates were an option to temper euro strength and buying loans and other assets from banks to support the bloc was not out of the question.\n\nPeripheral European government bond yields hit a multi-year trough on Friday while the premium that U.S. two-year debt pays over German paper widened.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of economists polled by Reuters expect no imminent rate move at the April 3 meeting.

The ECB meets on Thursday to decide on policy.\n\nThe euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3710 and was on track to end lower for a second straight week. Against the yen, the common currency fell to 139.96 yen, its lowest level since early March.\n\n“The March consumer inflation numbers for the euro zone are important and we expect a soft reading which will lead to expectations of a dovish ECB,” said Yujiro Gato, currency analyst at Nomura.\n\n“So there are downside risks to the euro going into next week, although having said that there is always a chance that the ECB may disappoint and take no action. In that case, the euro is bound to react strongly.”\n\nThe euro has sagged since comments this week for more ECB action came surprisingly from Germany, whose policymakers have repeatedly voiced concerns about unorthodox monetary easing.\n\nECB Governing Council member and Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said negative interest rates were an option to temper euro strength and buying loans and other assets from banks to support the bloc was not out of the question.\n\nPeripheral European government bond yields hit a multi-year trough on Friday while the premium that U.S. two-year debt pays over German paper widened.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of economists polled by Reuters expect no imminent rate move at the April 3 meeting. Only two of 72 economists predicted a rate cut, versus 26 of 78 who did before last month’s meeting.\n\nKIWI ON FIRE\n\nWell ahead of every other developed country in normalising policy is New Zealand, which this month lifted interest rates from a record low and flagged more tightening.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the New Zealand dollar has been among the strongest performers in recent months. It rose as far as $0.8697 a high not seen since August 2011. Against the yen, the kiwi hit a six-year high of 88.86.\n\nThe U.S. dollar traded little changed at 102.15 yen. The yen showed limited reaction to data that showed Japan’s core consumer prices rising 1.3 percent in February from a year earlier, posting a ninth straight month of gains and hinting that the economy is making some progress to overcome 15 years of deflation.\n\nJapan’s CPI is expected to gather more attention after the country raises its consumption tax in April, which may cool consumer spending and raise speculation of further monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.\n\n“Into the March 31, year-end dollar/yen may be pressured below 102, but thereafter concerns about the negative impact from April’s sales tax hike might weigh on the yen,” said Tom Levinson, currency strategist at ING.

57079,http://blogs.reuters.com/macroscope/2014/03/28/ecb-uncertainty/,business,"['For European markets, Germany’s March inflation figure is likely to dominate today. It is forecast to hold at just 1.0 percent. The European Central Bank insists there is no threat of deflation in the currency area although the euro zone number has been in its “danger zone” below 1 percent for five months now.\n\nHaving appeared to set a rather high bar to policy action at its last meeting, this week the tone changed. Most notable was Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, normally a hardliner, who said printing money was not out of the question although he would prefer negative deposit rates as the means to tackle an overly strong euro.\n\nThat looked like a significant shift although he did stress there was no need for imminent action.\n\nHas something changed? Certainly the currency seems to be focusing minds though it’s probably too early for anything dramatic at next week’s policy meeting. With inflation running at just 0.7 percent and the euro near $1.40 – buoyed by emerging market outflows – further currency appreciation would cut import prices in a way that will push inflation lower still.\n\nWeidmann speaks again this afternoon.\n\nChina’s Xi Jinping has said little during his week travelling Europe but will hold a news conference with Germany’s Angela Merkel later in the day.\n\nAs we reported from sources yesterday, Frankfurt will become the first hub for yuan payment transactions in Europe with the German and Chinese central banks set to seal the deal today. That’s one in the eye for London which has been pushed hard as the yuan offshore trading centre by the British government and will sign its own agreement next week.\n\nWhether he likes it or not, Xi is also a key player in the Ukraine crisis. Beijing has stayed studiously to one side of the Ukraine crisis, as is its wont, and Moscow still has high hopes of a huge natural gas supply deal with China that is apparently close after years of negotiations.\n\nBeijing has said sanctions are not the way forward but it abstained rather than voted against a U.N. Security Council resolution that declared the Crimea referendum was invalid. Xi called for a political solution earlier in the week but did not harden China’s position towards Moscow while making a vague offer of help to Ukraine.\n\nAfter a brief wobble, Ukraine’s parliament last night passed a law accepting austerity measures demanded by the IMF in return for a bailout which the Fund hopes will total $27 billion.\n\nDomestic gas prices will rise by a vicious 80 percent but the prospect of default and financial chaos has presumably been banished and the IMF said there was no need for debt restructuring.\n\nIn years to come, this could be looked upon as a turning point for the country if it can elect credible leaders in May who will bear down on corruption and press on with economic reforms. Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko threw her hat into the presidentiai ring yesterday.\n\nAll that presumes that Russia does not do its best to hinder its neighbour’s recovery while to turn around Ukraine’s uncompetitive Russia-directed industry towards the west will be a mighty task. But for Europe and the United States, there is a clear political incentive to make a success of this.\n\nAfter the best part of a week in Europe, Barack Obama will visit Saudi Arabia and is expected to seek to ease concerns that the United States is neglecting an old ally after top Saudis objected to a growing rapprochement between Washington and their rival Iran.\n\nTurkish municipal elections loom on Sunday with the tentacles of a corruption saga that has embroiled Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan’s government spreading ever further.\n\nYesterday, Erdogan denounced as “villainous” the leaking of a recording of top security officials discussing possible military action in Syria to the video-sharing site YouTube and ordered the shutdown of the site.\n\nThe OECD publishes its annual sovereign borrowing outlook. It will gauge the supply of “safe” sovereign assets and the challenges for debt managers of the continuing volatility in global markets, combined with uncertainties about the timing of the U.S. Federal Reserve tapering.\n\nIt’s ratings Friday and we’ve had a clutch of reviews already. S&P has lowered Nigeria’s credit outlook to negative while upgrading its view of Hungary to stable, saying it could upgrade if Viktor Orban’s government initiates “pro investment” policies. S&P has also affirmed Luxembourg and Sweden at ‘AAA’ and Austria at ‘AA+’. Fitch has confirmed Finland’s ‘AAA’ status.\n\nMoody’s is due to pronounce on Russia later, which could make for interesting reading.\n\nRomania’s central bank is expected to keep rates at a record low 3.5 percent today and through this year.', 'Having appeared to set a rather high bar to policy action at its last meeting, this week the tone changed.\nThat looked like a significant shift although he did stress there was no need for imminent action.\nCertainly the currency seems to be focusing minds though it’s probably too early for anything dramatic at next week’s policy meeting.\nChina’s Xi Jinping has said little during his week travelling Europe but will hold a news conference with Germany’s Angela Merkel later in the day.\nRomania’s central bank is expected to keep rates at a record low 3.5 percent today and through this year.']"

Japan’s Nikkei was flat as trading wound down ahead of the end of their financial year on March 31.\n\nAll the talk of a possible easing by the ECB pulled down bond yields across the European Union and undermined the euro. German inflation data is due later and a low reading would only add to the pressure.\n\nPeripheral European bond yields are already at multi-year lows while the premium that U.S. two-year debt pays over German paper widened to its fattest since late 2012.\n\nThat saw the euro peel off to $1.3746 and a long way from its March peak of $1.3967. Its largest losses came against the New Zealand dollar which has been on a tear since the country’s central bank raised interest rates a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand has all but promised to hike rates several more times this year, setting it far apart from other developed nations and sending its currency to a two-and-a-half year peak on the U.S. dollar.\n\nAsian stocks had got little inspiration from Wall Street, where the Dow and the S&P 500 both ended a fraction lower.

Direct bidders, which include central banks, took a record share of the sale, leaving dealers scrambling to cover short positions.\n\nThe demand for U.S. debt also showed up in the amount of Treasuries that the Federal Reserve holds on behalf of foreign central banks, which surged by a record $56 billion in the week to Thursday, on top of a $32 billion jump the previous week.\n\nThe inflow almost entirely reversed a mysterious $104 billion drop three weeks ago that many had thought was due to Russia pulling its money out of the U.S. to avoid possible sanctions over Ukraine.\n\nWhatever the source of the demand it has helped drag down longer-term U.S. yields and contributed to a marked flattening of the yield curve.

Both the Australian market and MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were barely changed.\n\nThere was more life in currencies as talk of ECB action pulled down bond yields across the EU and undermined the euro.\n\nPeripheral European bond yields hit a multi-year trough on Thursday while the premium that U.S. two-year debt pays over German paper widened to its fattest since late 2012.\n\nThat saw the euro peel off to $1.3742 and a long way from the March peak of $1.3967. Its largest loss of 1.2 percent came against the New Zealand dollar which has been on a tear since the country’s central bank raised interest rates a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand has all but promised to hike rates several more times this year, setting it far apart from other developed nations and sending its currency to a two-and-a-half year peak on the U.S. dollar.\n\nAsian stocks got little inspiration from Wall Street, where the Dow and the S&P 500 both ended a fraction lower. The Nasdaq extended its recent pullback with a loss of 0.54 percent.\n\nInvestors seemed to derive scant comfort from the final revision to fourth-quarter growth to 2.6 percent and a decline in weekly jobless claims to a four-month low.\n\nYet the sluggishness of U.S. stocks contrasts with a sudden revival in emerging markets, leading some to suspect that stretched valuations on Wall Street are leading fund managers to go bargain hunting elsewhere.\n\nThe MSCI index of emerging shares has climbed for five straight sessions to the highest in two months. The index for Latin America boasted its biggest daily gain on Thursday since July 2012 as Brazilian markets rallied.\n\nTREASURIES IN DEMAND\n\nIn debt markets, a sale of U.S. seven-year Treasury paper drew red hot demand, just as a five-year auction had on Wednesday. Direct bidders, which include central banks, took a record share of the sale, leaving dealers scrambling to cover short positions.\n\nThe demand for U.S. debt also showed up in the amount of Treasuries that the Federal Reserve holds on behalf of foreign central banks, which surged by a record $56 billion in the week to Thursday, on top of a $32 billion jump the previous week.\n\nThe inflow almost entirely reversed a mysterious $104 billion drop three weeks ago that many had thought was due to Russia pulling its money out of the U.S. to avoid possible sanctions over Ukraine.\n\nWhatever the source of the demand it has helped drag down longer-term U.S. yields and contributed to a marked flattening of the yield curve. The spread between five-year notes and thirty-year bonds has shrunk to its smallest in five years.\n\nThe shift also reflects speculation that U.S. interest rates will rise sooner than first thought and thus keep inflation well contained below 2 percent.\n\nThe downward revision in the market’s inflation expectations might also be one reason gold has taken a turn for the worse in recent sessions. On Friday, the metal was stuck at $1,291.56 an ounce having lost 7 percent in nine sessions.\n\nIn the oil market, Brent rose to $107.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures were steady at $101.24.

As the Federal Reserve in the United States signals an eventual turnaround in its ultra-loose monetary policy, ECB policymakers have left the door open to extraordinary measures if deflation risks in the euro zone pick up. The ECB\'s policy bias has been a major driver in this year\'s rally in peripheral bonds, which have outpaced German Bunds and U.S. Treasuries, the world\'s main benchmarks for borrowing costs. Yields have fallen to pre-crisis levels even in Greece, where the euro zone sovereign debt crisis erupted in 2010 and culminated in Athens defaulting on its debt two years ago. The latest trigger for speculation on what the ECB might do next came unexpectedly from Germany, whose policymakers have repeatedly voiced concerns about unorthodox monetary easing. ECB Governing Council member and Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann said earlier this week negative interest rates were an option to temper euro strength and buying loans and other assets from banks to support the bloc was not out of the question. ""The more dovishly perceived ECB talk over the last couple of days has supported the push to lower yields across the EGB (euro zone government bond) space,"" said Norbert, European rates strategist at Nomura. While the euro has already stopped falling and stock markets have stabilised, bond traders said the ECB\'s comments simply gave investors another reason to keep buying peripheral debt, already in high demand since the start of the year. Any further ECB easing would at least anchor yields on top-rated debt at ultra-low levels so that investors chasing higher returns would be forced to look down the ratings scale. The central bank meets next Thursday. Spanish 10-year yields fell 4 basis points to a new eight-year low of 3.25 percent while Italian yields were down by a similar amount to a new 8-1/2 year low of 3.289 percent. Portuguese yields slid to a new four-year low of 4.048 percent, according to Reuters data. Despite the falls, the bonds still offered a premium over Bunds, which yielded 1.54 percent, 3 bps less than the Wednesday close. Greek bonds, the region\'s highest yielders, offered 6.92 percent. ""Investors are still hunting for yield and on top of that we see improving economic growth (in the periphery), reduced political risk in Italy, expectations of Portugal moving out of its bailout,"" said ING rate strategist Alessandro Giansanti. Data on Thursday showing private sector loans in the euro zone contracted further in February boosted ECB speculation even more. ECB figures also showed euro zone banks mainly increased their holdings of sovereign debt in February after they passed the year-end deadline for balance sheet data under the central bank\'s asset review. Some in the market said banks seeking to offset the impact of rising loans on their budgets were also driving buying of peripheral euro zone bonds. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Euro zone money supply link.reuters.com/zak35s Euro zone inflation link.reuters.com/vex45v ECB rates link.reuters.com/vex45v Peripheral bond yields link.reuters.com/vex45v ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ GAUGING EXPECTATIONS Evidence that the latest leg in the bond market rally was driven by ECB expectations could be found in the flattening of two/five-year yield curves and the steepening of the five/10-year yield curves, analysts said. Five-year bonds outperform their peers when expectations of looser monetary policy grow as investors search for higher yields in longer-dated maturities and expect the tightening cycle to start later. While yields fall across the curve, 10-year yields fall less because of their term premium. Five-year bond yields fell more than their two- and 10-year peers across the euro zone on Thursday. In Italy and Portugal five-year bond yields fell 4-8 basis points. Money markets also showed that investors were positioning for further policy easing. Forward overnight Eonia bank-to-bank borrowing rates, one of the best gauges of that, traded 3-6 bps below the 0.172 percent spot Eonia rate. There was some scepticism though that ECB action was imminent despite the market expectations. ""When ECB speakers talk about potential further measures the \'if needed\' is the important bit in any comments about further easing which has to be seen against the backdrop of the ECB\'s easing bias,"" Aul said. ""This is therefore basically a reiteration of the ECB\'s forward guidance and doesn\'t imply immediate action from the ECB.""

Respondents were allowed to choose more than one option.

But the fund will be allowed to borrow.\n\nAnd while the reform enables the central bank to initiate bank closures, the process for shutting them down is complex, leaving six of 45 economists unconvinced the deal will have a significant impact.\n\nBAILOUTS STILL A RISK\n\nAnswering a separate question, 24 of 42 respondents - including those who expected the deal to be beneficial - said it will not be enough to end government bailouts.\n\n“The European banking union project was meant to address the very origin of the euro zone crisis by ending the vicious cycle between weak banks, systemic market panic, expensive taxpayer-funded bailouts and government debt crises,” said Lena Komileva, economist at G+ Economics.\n\n“All of those drove countries like Cyprus, Ireland and Spain to the brink of sovereign bankruptcy and raised doubts about the euro’s survival. The deal that was reached will not prevent either from recurring.”\n\nAPRIL ECB POLICY DECISION\n\nThe wider poll of 72 economists found all but two expect the ECB to leave rates on hold next week despite February inflation at an uncomfortably low 0.7 percent.\n\nAn increasing number of analysts - 33 of 53 in Thursday’s poll versus 27 of 45 in an economy poll conducted last month - also agree with the ECB’s decision to leave policy unchanged.\n\nOf the 20 who do not agree, most said the bank should start buying sovereign bonds outright - something that, while not out of the question if aimed at fighting deflation, would need strong justification under rules that ban the ECB from directly financing governments.\n\nAlthough the poll’s median responses showed no change in rates until at least October 2015 - the end of the survey’s horizon - some chance of a rate cut remains, possibly as early as next week. The median forecast on the likelihood of a cut on April 3 was just 15 percent.\n\n“We think the hurdle is high for (ECB action) next week but we can’t rule it out given that there are still concerns about bank lending and also there is a risk that inflation could disappoint,” said Jeavon Lolay, head of international macroeconomics at Lloyds Banking Group.
