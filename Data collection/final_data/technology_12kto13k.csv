It was exciting, emotional, dramatic.""Waldron told the press that Deprill\'s mother had been raped while traveling abroad and become pregnant. She abandoned her baby at the Burger King knowing someone would immediately find her. She was only 17 at the time, and kept the pregnancy hidden from her parents.""She left the baby in a location where the baby would be found and cared for. She kissed the baby on the forehead, Katheryn, and left,"" said Waldron.After the meeting, Deprill said her mother ""was extremely upset that she had to leave me and it wasn\'t what she wanted, but she felt she had no other means.

How many bands were the Beatles?"" Roger Kay, analyst at research firm Endpoint Technologies Associates said. ""Also, there\'ve been a lot of high priced IPOs and mergers and acquisitions (of late) and when valuations get frothy, investors get disappointed when returns don\'t measure up to expectations.""Candy Crush, a free game, is now a household name and has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch on mobile devices. Using the ""freemium"" model, King makes money by selling players extra lives and other add-ons.King\'s dismal debut dragged down other gaming stocks on Wednesday. Zynga shares fell over 4 percent, while smaller player Glu Mobile slipped 4.5 percent.When Zynga debuted in 2011 with about the same valuation as King, its stock ended down 5 percent on opening day.""FarmVille"" maker Zynga\'s market value has since shrunk to just over $4 billion, falling victim to concerns about the danger of investing in companies that rely heavily on a hit game.""This was mispriced,"" Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said of the King debut. ""There are a lot of IPOs in the pipeline so investors are not starving ... and are being picky. Today\'s action also says investors are not going to ignore fundamentals.""King\'s shares closed down about 16 percent at $19.00 on Wednesday. JP Morgan, Credit Suisse and BofA Merrill Lynch were the lead underwriters for the offering.There are some signs new titles from King\'s portfolio may be gaining traction. Analysts have pointed out that ""Farm Heroes Saga"" has seen momentum since its January mobile launch.The title has since landed on the list of top 10 highest-grossing apps on Apple\'s iOS platform, but whether the game will prove to be a money-making title in coming months remains to be seen.LONG-TERM RUNDespite its first-day fizzle, the company\'s real test will be to convince investors that it can build a sustainable business.""To us it\'s not about today but (a run) over the course of years and executing our plans,"" Hope Cochran, King\'s chief financial officer, said in an interview. ""Having a stable group of global franchises is really what we\'re focused on.""King sold 15.5 million shares of the 22.2 million offered, with the rest coming from stakeholders including private equity firm Apax Partners, which remains the biggest shareholder. King raised about $500 million in its IPO.In February, King said an average 144 million daily active users played its games more than 1.4 billion times per day.Unlike companies like Twitter that went public last year with no profits on their balance sheet, King has been profitable since 2005.""Candy Crush,"" which was first launched on Facebook in April 2012, was released on Apple devices in November that year and on Android devices a month later.The spectacular popularity of ""Candy Crush"" helped King generate revenue of $602 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, up from $22 million in the first quarter of 2012.The stock\'s less-than-impressive debut will be noted by youthful rivals such as San Francisco-based Kabam and Kixeye, known for strategy games like ""Kingdoms of Camelot"" and ""War Commander"", which are looking to make market listings or secure new financing.King has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. It posted profit before tax of $714.3 million in 2013.Apax will retain a 44.2 percent stake in the company, if underwriters fully exercise their option to buy shares.Chief executive Riccardo Zacconi, who has led King since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 percent stake.- Reuters', '""Candy Crush, a free game, is now a household name and has been downloaded more than 500 million times since its launch on mobile devices.\nUsing the ""freemium"" model, King makes money by selling players extra lives and other add-ons.King\'s dismal debut dragged down other gaming stocks on Wednesday.\n""This was mispriced,"" Sterne Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia said of the King debut.\n""King\'s shares closed down about 16 percent at $19.00 on Wednesday.\n""King sold 15.5 million shares of the 22.2 million offered, with the rest coming from stakeholders including private equity firm Apax Partners, which remains the biggest shareholder.']"

The first image was artificially colored red, the second green and the third blue. 2012 VP113 moved between each image as seen by the red, green and blue dots. (Scott Sheppard/Carnegie Institution for Science)\n\nMore than 7 billion miles away from the sun, out on the far reaches of the solar system, astronomers have spotted a planet-like object they’ve never seen before, and they’ve nicknamed it Biden.\n\nNot that it has any real similarities to the vice president, other than a reddish tint and, arguably, its inclination toward the far-out. The name is more coincidence than anything and may be changed to something more official and mythological soon. But for now, Smiling Joe has his own celestial body — 2012 VP-113, which its discoverers have shortened to VP, or Biden.\n\nScientists Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii reported the find in the science journal Nature.\n\n“It goes to show that there’s something we don’t know about our solar system, and it’s something important,” Trujillo told Nature. “We’re starting to get a taste of what’s out beyond what we consider the edge.”\n\nWe don’t know what it’s made of yet — although with a temperature of minus 430 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s likely covered in ice. It’s about 280 miles in diameter, a dot compared with Earth, which is 7,900 miles across.\n\nScientists hope it can provide new clues about how our solar system formed.\n\nSheppard and Trujillo first saw the object, which could be a dwarf planet, using a 520-megapixel camera on a ground telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. To see objects so far away from Earth, they take three pictures of the sky, an hour or two apart, creating a time-lapse movie of the night sky. Anything that changes location over the course of the pictures is something worth investigating.\n\nSheppard says that it takes a year or two after discovery, after observing the object’s orbit, before they’ll know whether their find is significant.\n\nIn 2003, Trujillo and several other scientists found the first object in this part of the solar system, known as the inner Oort cloud. They named it Sedna after the Inuit goddess of the sea, given their similar living arrangements. The goddess lived underneath the Arctic Sea, while Sedna, covered in ice, charts a path around the sun in the coldest known part of the solar system.\n\nScientists originally thought that Sedna, which is nearly twice as big as its newfound neighbor, was just an oddity, a lone possible dwarf planet that accidentally ended up at the farthest reaches of the solar system. Now that they’ve made a similar find, there’s proof that there might be thousands of Sedna-like orbs dotting the far sky.\n\nThe Minor Planet Center, which is headquartered at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., gives out names to aspiring dwarf planets, and it was the source of the VP-113 name. Once the object’s orbit is established, Trujillo and Sheppard will be able to submit their own name for consideration to the International Astronomical Union. Following the example of Sedna, Trujillo and Sheppard are thinking of something to do with Arctic mythology.\n\n“We’re surprised at the number of people who asked us about the Biden nickname,” Sheppard said. They placed bets on how many news articles about their find would mention the object’s tenuous political connection. Sheppard guessed a handful, and Trujillo thought even fewer would bother with mentioning Biden. Since nearly every article has found the vice president’s peripheral role a pertinent detail, Sheppard guesses he won.\n\n“We even joked that maybe Biden will give us a call sometime and invite us to the White House.”', '(Scott Sheppard/Carnegie Institution for Science)More than 7 billion miles away from the sun, out on the far reaches of the solar system, astronomers have spotted a planet-like object they’ve never seen before, and they’ve nicknamed it Biden.\n“It goes to show that there’s something we don’t know about our solar system, and it’s something important,” Trujillo told Nature.\nScientists hope it can provide new clues about how our solar system formed.\nIn 2003, Trujillo and several other scientists found the first object in this part of the solar system, known as the inner Oort cloud.\nFollowing the example of Sedna, Trujillo and Sheppard are thinking of something to do with Arctic mythology.']"

VP 113’s closest approach is 80 times as far as Earth’s orbit of the sun - roughly twice as far as the Kuiper Belt.\n\n“In the current architecture of the solar system, Sedna and 2012 VP113 should not be there,” writes astronomer Megan Schwamb, of the Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan, in a separate Nature article.\n\nComputer simulations provide a few potential scenarios.\n\nLead researcher Chad Trujillo favors the idea that a sibling star forming in the same stellar nursery as the sun gravitationally elbowed some Oort Cloud residents inward as it flew by.\n\nSheppard suggests that another planet at least as massive as Earth got bumped out of the solar system, taking some Kuiper Belt bodies with it along the way.\n\nThat renegade planet or planets actually may still be lurking in the farthest reaches of the solar system, too dim and\n\nremote to be detected by currently available telescopes and cameras, Sheppard said.\n\nA third option is that the sun has a companion, something five- to 10 times the mass of Earth, whose gravity is pinning Sedna, VP 113 and potentially millions of other dwarf-like planets in unusual and distant orbits.\n\n“With our discovery of one more object, we can’t rule out one theory or another,” Trujillo said.\n\nMore residents of the region, now known as the inner Oort Cloud, soon may make their presence known.\n\nAstronomers are working to confirm six other Sedna-like objects found last year.

It was co-discovered by the Gemini Observatory\'s Chadwick Trujillo and Carngegie Mellon University\'s Scott Sheppard.\n\n""This is an extraordinary result that redefines our understanding of our solar system,"" stated Linda Elkins-Tanton, director of Carnegie’s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, in a statement.\n\nHow does this new world measure up to some of the other dwarf planets discovered? Below are summaries of other large worlds of this category in our Solar System.\n\nPluto: Perhaps the most famous of the dwarf planets because it used to be classified as a planet itself. The International Astronomical Union demoted it in 2006 after the discovery of other worlds its size. At 2,300 km in diameter, it\'s one of the bigger dwarf planets. It also hosts five moons, most of which were discovered while the New Horizons spacecraft was en route for its forthcoming 2015 flyby. NASA says it ""probably has a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. More exotic ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat its surface."" Its orbit ranges between 30 and 49 astronomical units (AU, the Earth-Sun distance of 150 million km) from the Sun.\n\nEris: When it was discovered in 2003, the research team estimated that the dwarf planet could be bigger than Pluto itself. It was called the tenth planet for a while, until the IAU created the new classification of ""dwarf planet"". Its exact dimensions remain uncertain, but further observations show it could be a bit smaller than Pluto. ""The dwarf planet is often so far from the sun that its atmosphere collapses and freezes on the surface in an icy glaze. The coating gleams brightly, reflecting as much sunlight as freshly fallen snow,"" NASA says. It also has a moon, Dysmonia.\n\nCeres: This was the first dwarf planet discovered, in 1801, but for centuries it was called an asteroid. With a mean diameter of about 950 km, however, the object is round and was reclassified as a dwarf planet along with Pluto and Eris. Astronomers believe it has a distinct core (just like Earth) and may have substantial reservoirs of water ice under the surface. Scientists have spotted what they thought was water vapor plumes shooting up from the surface as Ceres gets closer to the sun. It orbits about 2.77 AU from the sun.\n\nIllustration of some of the Dwarf planets. Image credit: Wikimedia Commons/NASA\n\nMakemake: Like Eris, its discovery in 2005 made astronomers reconsider the definition of a planet. Little is known about this distant world, but astronomers have detected evidence of nitrogen and possible ethane and methane on its surface. The world may also have tholins, which NASA calls ""molecules that form whenever solar ultraviolet light interacts with substances such as ethane and methane."" That would cause a red colour if was happening (and the world does look slightly red in observations). Its orbit ranges between 39 and 53 AUs, according to the educational website Windows To The Universe, and it\'s likely about half the size of Pluto.\n\nHaumea: This world, which is about the same size as Pluto, is one of the fastest-rotating objects known in our Solar System -- producing an odd shape. It lies about 42 AU from the Sun and also has two moons, Hi\'aka and Namaka. ""It is possible a massive impact billions of years ago set off Haumea\'s spin and created its moons,"" NASA said.\n\nSedna: Remarkable for its reddish color and its location further than any other dwarf planet discovered before 2012 VP113, Sedna is estimated at no more than 1,770 kilometres in diameter.', 'How does this new world measure up to some of the other dwarf planets discovered?\nAt 2,300 km in diameter, it\'s one of the bigger dwarf planets.\nIt was called the tenth planet for a while, until the IAU created the new classification of ""dwarf planet"".\nCeres: This was the first dwarf planet discovered, in 1801, but for centuries it was called an asteroid.\nSedna: Remarkable for its reddish color and its location further than any other dwarf planet discovered before 2012 VP113, Sedna is estimated at no more than 1,770 kilometres in diameter.']"

And today scientists have announced the discovery of a second, mysterious object far, far away from the Sun but still in orbit around our star.\n\nThe object does not yet have a name — for now it’s 2012 VP113 — and it’s a lot like Sedna, which was found in 2003.\n\nAccording to a research paper published in Nature today, this object is estimated to be about 280 miles across, or about the distance from Galveston to Dallas. At such a size it would likely be considered a dwarf planet, in the same category as Pluto. Sedna is about twice as large.\n\nBut the orbit of this object is anything but Pluto-like, and it’s discovery is helping astronomers to better understand what conditions are like at the edge of our solar system.\n\nTo put this discovery let us first take a look at the solar system.\n\nIn the graphic above the scale bar is in astronomical units, with each set distance beyond 1 AU representing 10 times the previous distance. One AU is the distance from the sun to the Earth, which is about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. Neptune, the most distant planet from the sun, is about 30 AU. Pluto’s orbit fluctuates between 30 AU and 50 AU from the Sun.\n\nThe new objects, like Sedna and 2012 VP113, have much more eccentric orbits. Sedna, for example, makes its closest approach at 76 AU, but at the most distant part of its orbit is nearly 1,000 AU from the Sun. The new object, 2012 VP113, comes within 80 AU of the Sun at perihelion.\n\nTo understand how eccentric these orbits are here’s the orbit of Sedna compared to that of the other planets and Pluto (in purple) in our solar system.\n\nAstronomers believe both Sedna and the new object are members of a population of “inner Oort cloud” objects, and that there are likely many other of these tiny worlds.\n\nHere’s one more image showing both Sedna (orange), the new object, and the rest of the solar system,\n\nThe distant objects not only are fascinating in and of themselves — what are they? rocky? ice balls? where Katy evacuated to?– their existence, and their nature, will help astronomers further pin down how the solar system formed.', 'When most people think about the solar system, they consider the Sun, the eight planets, and Pluto.\nBut although space is, indeed, mostly empty the solar system is a rather complex place.\nBut the orbit of this object is anything but Pluto-like, and it’s discovery is helping astronomers to better understand what conditions are like at the edge of our solar system.\nTo put this discovery let us first take a look at the solar system.\nwhere Katy evacuated to?– their existence, and their nature, will help astronomers further pin down how the solar system formed.']"

(One astronomical unit is the distance between the Earth and the sun.) That’s far beyond the Kuiper belt, an icy field of debris that sits beyond Neptune’s orbit between 30 and 55 astronomical units.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the dwarf planet is incredibly far out, it’s still not far enough to be part of the Oort cloud, a hypothesized cloud of icy debris that surrounds the solar system’s disc in a spherical shell that stretches a mind-blowing 5,000 to 100,000 astronomical units from the sun. 2012 VP-113’s orbit stretches for a few hundred astronomical units, in what scientists thought was an empty doughnut ring of space between the Oort cloud and the Kuiper belt.\n\nThat assumption began to change in 2003 with the discovery of Sedna sitting near the inner edge of this no man’s land. Roughly 600 miles wide, Sedna is big enough to qualify as a dwarf planet. So scientists were puzzled: Was Sedna a freakish one-off, or was it part of a population of rocky bodies in that supposedly empty area – an inner Oort cloud?\n\nAn inner Oort cloud would be valuable to study, scientists said, because these objects are so far away from the gravitational pull of either the planets or the distant stars that they’re like a dynamic “fossil” of interplanetary movement in the early solar system.\n\nSheppard and Trujillo wanted to look for more Sedna-like objects in this area; if they could find more, they’d show that it wasn’t an anomaly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking for such distant, dim objects is not easy. Unlike the distant stars in the night sky, rocks don’t make their own light. So the astronomers have to look for faint, moving glints of reflected sunlight off these distant bodies. That means the sun’s rays have to travel all the way out to this dark, cold interplanetary fringe and then come all the way back to us.\n\nThe researchers used the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the NOAO 4-meter telescope in Chile and scanned the sky looking for such dim, slow-moving objects. After months of analysis, the scientists picked up on an intriguing signal in the sky.\n\n“It was the slowest moving thing I’d seen in the discovery process, so immediately I knew it was interesting,” Sheppard said of finding 2012 VP-113. “It was very exciting to know that you’ve discovered this object that’s way out there.”\n\nThe scientists estimated that there could be about 1,000 objects in the inner Oort cloud with diameters of 1,000 kilometers or greater – and some of them could be as large as Mars.\n\nWhat’s more, Sedna and 2012 VP-113 seem to be making their closest approach to the sun at similar angles – which could mean that there’s a giant planet out there, tugging at both of their orbits in the same way. This ghost planet could be from 1 to 20 Earth masses, Sheppard said, though it’s still also possible that the dwarf planets were pulled there by the tug from a passing star in the sun’s early history.\n\n“It’s not a complete explanation, but it’s a possible explanation,” said UCLA astronomer David Jewitt, who first discovered Kuiper belt objects and was not involved in the new discovery.\n\nAstronomers will have to find far more of these distant objects and catch enough of them traveling in the same direction before they can say whether a giant planet is lurking in the inner Oort cloud, Jewitt said.\n\n“It isn’t watertight,” he added, “but it’s very, very interesting.”', 'The new dwarf planet 2012 VP-113, described Wednesday in the journal Nature, helps confirm the existence of an “inner Oort cloud” in an interplanetary no man’s land that was once thought to be empty but could potentially be teeming with rocky denizens.\nAdvertisementWhile the dwarf planet is incredibly far out, it’s still not far enough to be part of the Oort cloud, a hypothesized cloud of icy debris that surrounds the solar system’s disc in a spherical shell that stretches a mind-blowing 5,000 to 100,000 astronomical units from the sun.\n2012 VP-113’s orbit stretches for a few hundred astronomical units, in what scientists thought was an empty doughnut ring of space between the Oort cloud and the Kuiper belt.\nRoughly 600 miles wide, Sedna is big enough to qualify as a dwarf planet.\nSo scientists were puzzled: Was Sedna a freakish one-off, or was it part of a population of rocky bodies in that supposedly empty area – an inner Oort cloud?']"

Their finding will be described in the journal Nature tomorrow.\n\nThe astronomers said the two dwarf planets appear to be part of the inner Oort cloud, a vast shell of thousands of comets and icy bodies predicted decades ago to be surrounding the solar system at a great distance from the Sun but with no hard evidence.\n\n“The discovery of 2012VP113 shows that Sedna is not unique — both are likely to be objects of the inner Oort cloud,” said Sheppard, who specialises in the history and formation of the solar system.\n\nThe astronomers, using a telescope in the highlands of Chile, first noticed the new object in November 2012 and tracked its movement for over a year. Their calculations suggest that 2012VP113’s closest orbital point to the Sun is about 80 times the distance of the Earth to the Sun, a measure called Astronomical Unit (AU), and its furthest point is about 450AU.\n\n“What’s really interesting is that neither Sedna nor 2012VP113 come close to the Sun, they always stay very far out,” said Chadwick Turjillo, the second astronomer at the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.\n\n“This is a puzzle because we don’t know how they can get so far out — it is possible they formed closer to the Sun and were thrown out by gravitational influences during the last stages of the formation of the solar system,” Turjillo told The Telegraph in a telephone interview, speaking from Hawaii.\n\nTheir calculations of the orbital behaviour of the new dwarf planet and Sedna also suggest that a massive super-Earth-like object may exist even further beyond, at the extreme edge of the solar system about 250AU from the Sun. “This is a tenuous possibility — it would be hard to explain how an even bigger planet could have formed at an even greater distance from the Sun,” Turjillo said.\n\nAn Indian astronomer not associated with the finding said a super-Earth in the outermost realms of the solar system would challenge current theories of the formation of the planets.\n\n“One way to explain this would be that the solar system captured a rogue planet from another stellar system,” said Sujan Sengupta, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.\n\n“But there may be many other explanations for the orbital behaviour of Sedna and 2012VP113,” Sengupta said. “A system of several Sedna-like dwarf planets orbiting each other might explain the observed behaviour.”\n\nSheppard and Turjillo will get an opportunity to assign a formal name to the dwarf planet. The provisional name follows International Astronomical Union rules. The 2012 specifies the year of discovery, V is assigned to all objects discovered in the first half of November, and P113 is a code that uniquely identifies all asteroids and other objects discovered during that half of the month.\n\nThe astronomers will need to study the planet’s orbit in greater detail before they can name it. “In a few years, we’ll name it after some Arctic mythology from the Eskimos or the Inuits,” said Sheppard. “Arctic because these objects are so cold and distant from the Sun.”\n\nWhile Pluto, discovered in 1930 by an American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, was labelled the solar system’s ninth planet, discoveries over the past decade have prompted some astronomers to wrest that title away.\n\n“We thought Pluto was unique for over 70 years, we now know it shares its orbit with thousands of other objects in the Kuiper belt,” said Sheppard. The Kuiper belt is a zone of frozen objects beyond Neptune, between 30AU and 50AU from the Sun.\n\nThe inner Oort cloud, calculated by some astronomers to begin at about 2,000AU and extend up to 20,000AU, is believed to be part of the Oort cloud, predicted by a Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950, a shell of comets that extends to nearly 50,000AU or nearly half-way to the nearest star.', 'The object appears to be a smaller version of another dwarf planet named Sedna spotted 10 years ago in the outskirts of the solar system, the astronomers said.\nTheir calculations of the orbital behaviour of the new dwarf planet and Sedna also suggest that a massive super-Earth-like object may exist even further beyond, at the extreme edge of the solar system about 250AU from the Sun.\nAn Indian astronomer not associated with the finding said a super-Earth in the outermost realms of the solar system would challenge current theories of the formation of the planets.\n“One way to explain this would be that the solar system captured a rogue planet from another stellar system,” said Sujan Sengupta, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore.\n“A system of several Sedna-like dwarf planets orbiting each other might explain the observed behaviour.”Sheppard and Turjillo will get an opportunity to assign a formal name to the dwarf planet.']"

His study was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.""The big question is, how is this formed? How can you get an object out there?"" he said. ""We really don\'t know an answer to that yet.""This dwarf planet is unusual because of its orbit, Trujillo said. On its elliptical path, the closest it ever comes to the sun is still very far away from the rest of the solar system. Its full orbit is farther than the orbit of any other object we know of in the solar system.""Nothing that we currently know in the solar system can make objects that are so distant all the time, that never come close to any of the planets,"" Trujillo said.The most distant major planet from the sun is Neptune, orbiting our star at a distance of 30 astronomical units. One astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the sun -- about 150 million kilometers, or 93 million miles.Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut-shaped ring of small objects, which extends from about 30 to 55 AU, according to NASA. This belt may contain hundreds of thousands of large icy objects and trillions of comets, if not more. Pluto is considered a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt.The awkwardly-named 2012 VP113 is much farther from the sun, at 83 astronomical units. That puts it at 83 times the distance between our own planet and the sun.But in terms of average distance from the sun, there is a dwarf planet even farther out: Eris, which Trujillo helped discover. Eris is bigger than Pluto, and has a satellite called Dysnomia. The presence of Eris helped scientists determine that Pluto should not be counted among the major planets.Sedna, a dwarf planet that Trujillo co-discovered as well in 2004, is located in the same distant area, and takes about 10,500 years to orbit the sun.""Finding Sedna so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke,"" said Mike Brown, professor of astronomy at California Institute of Technology, in an e-mail. ""But this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be. Not at all what I would have guessed.""This home of Sedna and 2012 VP113 is called the ""inner Oort Cloud."" It may be where some comets come from, Trujillo said.Trujillo\'s study also suggests that there could be a large planet that no one has seen, way out at 250 astronomical units, affecting the orbits of Sedna and the new dwarf planet. But this is only a theory; the planet has not been detected.Brown, who was not involved in this study, also co-discovered Sedna.""These unusual objects -- Sedna and this new one -- can tell us about very early in the solar system, when the sun and planets were just forming,"" Brown said.Scientists have not been able to discern what 2012 VP113\'s composition is, but most would suspect it is icy because of its distance from the sun, Trujillo said. Its color is slightly reddish, and ""not especially unusual compared to Kuiper Belt objects,"" Trujillo said.Trujllio and colleagues estimate that the new dwarf planet is relatively small -- about 450 kilometers (280 miles) in diameter, which less than the driving distance from Philadelphia to Boston. It\'s probably ball-shaped, he said.So why is this not a major planet such as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars? Trujillo explains that a bona fide planet is big enough that other objects in its orbit will be sucked into it gravitationally. A dwarf planet is not big enough to become gravitationally dominant; it\'s too small to pull in objects in the area of its path.It\'s possible that this dwarf planet formed very early in our solar system\'s history, in the region between Jupiter and Saturn, and then got thrown out beyond Pluto. One theory is that, billions of years ago, another star passed by our sun and took material with it out to a distant orbit.As far as we know, it\'s too cold out where the dwarf planet is to have liquid water, Trujillo said.""To me, what this discovery really shows is that we are on verge of finally being able to read the story that Sedna is trying to tell us, and that the next few years should bring a flood of new discoveries in this new region of the outer solar system,"" Brown said.2012 VP113 will be eventually renamed, but Trujillo\'s website says it\'s informally called ""Biden"" because of the ""VP"" designation.', 'Advertisement New dwarf pink planet found in our solar system Dwarf planet\'s current name is 2012 VP113 Share Shares Copy Link CopyFor anyone holding out hope of Pluto being reinstated as a major planet, you should probably do as they say in the movie ""Frozen"" and ""let it go.\n""This dwarf planet is unusual because of its orbit, Trujillo said.\nOn its elliptical path, the closest it ever comes to the sun is still very far away from the rest of the solar system.\nIts full orbit is farther than the orbit of any other object we know of in the solar system.\nPluto is considered a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt.The awkwardly-named 2012 VP113 is much farther from the sun, at 83 astronomical units.']"

Until now, the lone known resident in this part of the solar system was an oddball dwarf planet spotted in 2003, named Sedna after the mythological Inuit goddess who created the sea creatures of the Arctic.\n\nThe latest discovery shows “Sedna is not a freak. We can have confidence that there is a new population to explore,” Yale University senior research scientist David Rabinowitz said in an email. He was one of Sedna’s discoverers, but had no role in the new find detailed in Thursday’s issue of the journal Nature.\n\nFor years, astronomers hunted in vain for other Sednas in the little-studied fringes of the solar system.\n\nThe new object, 2012 VP113, was tracked using a new camera on a ground telescope in Chile by Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC, and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. Trujillo was part of the team that found Sedna.\n\nLike Sedna, VP is a dwarf planet. It’s jokingly nicknamed “Biden” after Vice President Joe Biden because of the object’s initials. It measures about 280 miles across, or half the diameter of Sedna. It’s bone-chilling cold, with a temperature of around minus 430 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nUnlike red and shiny Sedna, the newfound object is more pink and much fainter, which made it hard to detect.\n\nBy contrast, Earth is about 7,900 miles across and located 93 million miles from the sun.\n\nSedna and VP reside in what’s known as the inner Oort cloud in the outer edge of the solar system, where some comets, such as the sun-diving Comet ISON, are thought to originate. ISON broke apart last year after brushing too close to the sun.\n\n“Finding Sedna so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke. But this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be. Not at all what I would have guessed,” Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, said in an email.\n\nBrown, self-proclaimed “Pluto killer,” led the Sedna team, but was not part of the new discovery.\n\nFar from being deserted, Sheppard and Trujillo estimate there are probably thousands of similar objects in the inner Oort cloud.\n\n“These objects are not unique. There’s a huge number out there,” Sheppard said.\n\nNot all of them will be visible to telescopes because they’re so far away and it takes a long time for them to swing by the sun. Sedna and VP were spotted at their closest approach to the sun, which allowed light from the sun to hit the objects and bounce back to observatories on Earth.\n\nVP is currently the third-farthest object in the solar system after dwarf planet Eris and Sedna, but it has an eccentric, elongated orbit that can take it out to 42 billion miles from the sun. Sedna can loop out as far as 84 billion miles from the sun at its farthest point.\n\nNow that Sedna has company — and likely lots of it — scientists are searching for more objects in an effort to learn how they and the solar system formed and evolved.\n\nIn a separate discovery published in Nature, a team led by Felipe Braga-Ribas of the National Observatory in Brazil found a pair of rings around an asteroid-like interloper in the outer system named Chariklo.\n\nWhile not as dazzling as Saturn’s rings, it’s the first time rings have been discovered outside of the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

Until now, the lone known resident in this part of the solar system was an oddball dwarf planet spotted in 2003 named Sedna after the mythological Inuit goddess who created the sea creatures of the Arctic.\n\nThe latest discovery shows “Sedna is not a freak. We can have confidence that there is a new population to explore,” Yale University senior research scientist David Rabinowitz said in an email. He was one of Sedna’s founders, but had no role in the new find detailed in Thursday’s issue of the journal Nature.\n\nFor years, astronomers hunted in vain for other Sednas in the little-studied fringes of the solar system.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nREAD MORE: 16×9: The search for life on other planets\n\nThe new object, 2012 VP113, was tracked using a new camera on a ground telescope in Chile by Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., and Chad Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. Trujillo was part of the team that found Sedna.\n\nLike Sedna, VP is also a dwarf planet. It’s jokingly nicknamed “Biden” after Vice-President Joe Biden because of the object’s initials. It measures about 280 miles (450 kilometres) across, or half the diameter of Sedna.\n\nUnlike red and shiny Sedna, the newfound object is more pink and much fainter, which made it hard to detect.\n\nBy contrast, Earth is about 12,713 kilometres across and located 149.66 million kilometres from the sun.\n\nSedna and VP reside in what’s known as the inner Oort cloud in the outer edge of the solar system where some comets such as the sun-diving Comet ISON are thought to originate. ISON broke apart last year after brushing too close to the sun.\n\nREAD MORE: NASA announces 715 newly discovered planets\n\n“Finding Sedna so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke. But this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be. Not at all what I would have guessed,” Mike Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology, said in an email.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBrown led the Sedna team, but was not part of the new discovery.\n\nFar from being deserted, Sheppard and Trujillo estimate there are probably thousands of similar objects in the inner Oort cloud.\n\n“These objects are not unique. There’s a huge number out there,” Sheppard said.\n\nSpace is vast, but it may not be so lonely after all: A study finds the Milky Way is teeming with billions of planets that are about the size of Earth, orbit stars just like our sun, and exist in the Goldilocks zone – not too hot and not too cold for life. NASA\n\nNot all of them will be visible to telescopes because they’re so far away and it takes a long time for them to swing by the sun. Sedna and VP were spotted at their closest approach to the sun, which allowed light from the sun to hit the objects and bounce back to observatories on Earth.\n\nVP is currently the third farthest object in the solar system after dwarf planet Eris and Sedna, but it has an eccentric, elongated orbit that can take it out to 67.6 million kilometres from the sun. Sedna can loop out as far as (135 million kilometres from the sun at its farthest point.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nNow that Sedna has company – and likely lots of them – scientists are searching for more objects in an effort to learn how they and the solar system formed and evolved.\n\nIn a separate discovery published in Nature, a team led by Felipe Braga-Ribas of the National Observatory in Brazil found a pair of rings around an asteroid-like interloper in the outer system named Chariklo.\n\nWhile not as dazzling as Saturn’s rings, it’s the first time rings have been discovered outside of the four gas giants – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. How little Chariklo got its rings remains a mystery, but scientists think they may have formed from debris from a violent collision.', 'LOS ANGELES – Peering into the far reaches of the solar system, astronomers have spied a pink frozen world 12 billion kilometres from the sun.\nUntil now, the lone known resident in this part of the solar system was an oddball dwarf planet spotted in 2003 named Sedna after the mythological Inuit goddess who created the sea creatures of the Arctic.\nFor years, astronomers hunted in vain for other Sednas in the little-studied fringes of the solar system.\nLike Sedna, VP is also a dwarf planet.\nSedna and VP reside in what’s known as the inner Oort cloud in the outer edge of the solar system where some comets such as the sun-diving Comet ISON are thought to originate.']"

(Photo : Courtesy Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo.)\n\nThe discovery of a distant dwarf planet in the far reaches of our solar system suggests that there may be a lot more beyond the system\'s perimeter than meets the eye.\n\nThe new dwarf planet, known for the time being as 2012 VP113, is only the second such object to be found orbiting the outer perimeter of our solar system in a region known as the Oort Cloud. However, the dwarf planet\'s discovery hints that there may be many more of these distant and icy worlds that we have not yet seen in our own stellar backyard.\n\nThe orbit of this new dwarf planet - which lurks about 250 times farther away from the Sun than Earth - is likely influenced by an even bigger planet hiding somewhere in the dim reaches of the solar system. The object is so distant that astronomers had not ever seen an object moving so slowly through space, according to a report on the Nature blog.\n\nAstronomers are theorizing that the same mystery plant could also influence the orbit of the other only known dwarf planet in the Oort Cloud, an object known as Sedna.\n\nWriting in the journal Nature, Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution of Science and Chadwick Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory report that there are likely many more objects are waiting to be found in the Oort Cloud and that an enormous planet, perhaps up to 10 times the size of Earth, is also influencing the orbit of these dwarf planets from a currently unknown location.\n\nBased on the swath of sky the astronomers surveyed - equal to the space about 220 full Moons would take up - the they concluded that around 900 objects with orbits like Sedna and 2012 VP113 and a size greater than 1,000 kilometers across are out there waiting to be found. The researchers are currently tracking at least six potential candidates.\n\n""Some of these inner Oort cloud objects could rival the size of Mars or even Earth. This is because many of the inner Oort cloud objects are so distant that even very large ones would be too faint to detect with current technology,"" Sheppard said in a statement from Carnegie.\n\n""The search for these distant inner Oort cloud objects beyond Sedna and 2012 VP113 should continue, as they could tell us a lot about how our Solar System formed and evolved,"" Sheppard said.\n\nAt about 450 kilometers across 2012 VP113 is about half the size of Sedna and is likely made of ice, the researchers report.\n\nThe astronomers estimate that it takes about 4,000 years for the dwarf planet to orbit the Sun.\n\nMichael Brown, a planetary astronomer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, told the Nature blog that astronomers have long been searching for objects like Sedna, and now finding one reduces the chances of Sedna being a fluke.\n\n""But astronomers now have to come up with ideas to explain how these objects remain tightly gravitationally bound to the Sun when they orbit so far away,"" Nature reported. One theory is that during the solar system\'s infancy a nearby star\'s gravity disrupted the forming solar system and dragged some fragments out towards the edge. Another possibility is that a massive rogue planet passed through at some point and knocked objects that were closer out to the perimeter of the system.\n\nEither way, the distance of the newfound dwarf planet is staggering. The object gets no closer than 12 billion kilometers from the Sun and at is farthest point is some 67 billion kilometers away from the star it orbits. Earth, on the other hand is just 149 million km from the Sun, and even Neptune - the most distant planet - is only 4.5 billion km away.\n\n""To all intents and purposes, in the current architecture of the solar system, Sedna and 2012 VP113 should not be there,"" astronomer Megan Schwamb of Taiwan\'s Academia Sinica, said in a commentary accompanying the study, as reported by National Geographic.

What no one can really say is when. Boundaries in space are entirely human vanities, there is no \'Now leaving the Local System\' sign after Pluto.\n\nWell, it\'s all so unsettled that two percent of astronomers even decided Pluto wasn\'t even a planet.\n\nBut no matter how we define a planet, the solar system has a new most-distant member, according to new work from Carnegie\'s Scott Sheppard and Chadwick Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory. In Nature, they report the discovery of the distant dwarf planet 2012 VP113 beyond the known \'edge\' of the Solar System.\n\nIt\'s likely one of thousands of distant objects that are thought to form the inner Oort cloud, nothing special there, but what is special is that their work indicates the potential presence of an enormous planet, perhaps up to 10 times the size of Earth, that has not yet seen but may be influencing the orbit of 2012 VP113 as well as other inner Oort cloud objects.\n\nThe known Solar System can be divided into three parts: the rocky planets like Earth, which are close to the Sun; the gas giant planets, which are further out; and the frozen objects of the Kuiper belt, which lie just beyond Neptune\'s orbit. Beyond this, there appears to be an edge to the Solar System where only one object, Sedna, was previously known to exist for its entire orbit. But the newly found 2012 VP113 has an orbit that stays even beyond Sedna, making it the furthest known in the Solar System.\n\n""This is an extraordinary result that redefines our understanding of our Solar System,"" says Linda Elkins-Tanton, director of Carnegie\'s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism.\n\nSedna was discovered beyond the Kuiper Belt edge in 2003, and it was not known if Sedna was unique, as Pluto once was thought to be before the Kuiper Belt was discovered. With the discovery of 2012 VP113 it is now clear Sedna is not unique and is likely the second known member of the hypothesized inner Oort cloud, the likely origin of some comets.\n\n2012 VP113\'s closest orbit point to the Sun brings it to about 80 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun, a measurement referred to as an astronomical unit or AU. For context, the rocky planets and asteroids exist at distances ranging between .39 and 4.2 AU. Gas giants are found between 5 and 30 AU, and the Kuiper belt (composed of thousands of icy objects, including Pluto) ranges from 30 to 50 AU. In our solar system there is a distinct edge at 50 AU. Only Sedna was known to stay significantly beyond this outer boundary at 76 AU for its entire orbit.\n\n""The search for these distant inner Oort cloud objects beyond Sedna and 2012 VP113 should continue, as they could tell us a lot about how our Solar System formed and evolved,"" says Sheppard.\n\nSheppard and Trujillo used the new Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the NOAO 4 meter telescope in Chile for discovery. DECam has the largest field-of-view of any 4-meter or larger telescope, giving it unprecedented ability to search large areas of sky for faint objects. The Magellan 6.5-meter telescope at Carnegie\'s Las Campanas Observatory was used to determine the orbit of 2012 VP113 and obtain detailed information about its surface properties.\n\nFrom the amount of sky searched, Sheppard and Trujillo determine that about 900 objects with orbits like Sedna and 2012 VP113 with sizes larger than 1000 km may exist and that the total population of the inner Oort cloud is likely bigger than that of the Kuiper Belt and main asteroid belt.\n\n""Some of these inner Oort cloud objects could rival the size of Mars or even Earth. This is because many of the inner Oort cloud objects are so distant that even very large ones would be too faint to detect with current technology"", says Sheppard.\n\nBoth Sedna and 2012 VP113 were found near their closest approach to the Sun, but they both have orbits that go out to hundreds of AU, at which point they would be too faint to discover. In fact, the similarity in the orbits found for Sedna, 2012 VP113 and a few other objects near the edge of the Kuiper Belt suggests that an unknown massive perturbing body may be shepherding these objects into these similar orbital configurations. Sheppard and Trujillo suggest a Super Earth or an even larger object at hundreds of AU could create the shepherding effect seen in the orbits of these objects, which are too distant to be perturbed significantly by any of the known planets.', 'We know the Voyager spacecraft has left the solar system.\nBut no matter how we define a planet, the solar system has a new most-distant member, according to new work from Carnegie\'s Scott Sheppard and Chadwick Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory.\nIn Nature, they report the discovery of the distant dwarf planet 2012 VP113 beyond the known \'edge\' of the Solar System.\n""This is an extraordinary result that redefines our understanding of our Solar System,"" says Linda Elkins-Tanton, director of Carnegie\'s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism.\n""Some of these inner Oort cloud objects could rival the size of Mars or even Earth.']"

The dwarf planet is believed to be located within the inner Oort cloud, joining the dwarf planet Sedna as a distant member of the solar system.\n\nAccording to NASA, the discovery of the distant dwarf planet helps define the outer edge of the solar system while also leading to new insights on the mysterious Oort Cloud, considered the “edge” of the solar system. This area could contain up to 2 trillion comets and other objects and is located between 5,000 and 100,000 astronomical units away from the sun, reports NASA. (Each AU is the average distance between the sun and Earth, roughly 93 million miles.) The researchers break up the Oort Cloud into two sections, the much closer inner part, which contains Sedna and the newly discovered dwarf planet, and the outer section, which is believed to be where some comets originate. The Kuiper Belt is located outside of the orbit of Neptune and contains hundreds of thousands of icy objects.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nThe discovery of 2012 VP113 occurred on Nov. 5, 2012, and was led by Chadwick Trujillo, from the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, and Scott Sheppard, from the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.

48180,http://www.nanowerk.com/news2/space/newsid=34961.php,technology,"['New planet-like body found sneaking through the inner Oort cloud\n\n(Nanowerk News) A new, planet-like body has been found on the outer edges of the solar system. This object, called 2012VP 113 , is the second body of its class found since the identification of the dwarf planet Sedna in 2003. It joins an exclusive club composed of some of the strangest objects in the solar system.\n\nThe observable solar system can be divided into three regions: the rocky planets including the Earth and asteroids of the inner solar system, the gas giant planets, and the icy Kuiper Belt objects, which include Pluto. The Kuiper belt stretches from beyond Neptune, which is at 30 astronomical units (one astronomical unit, AU, represents the distance between the Earth and the sun), to about 50AU.\n\nSedna and 2012VP 113 are strange objects, because they reside in a region where there should be nothing, according to our theories of the solar system formation. Their orbit is well beyond that of Neptune, the last recognised planet of the solar system, and even beyond that of Pluto, which differs from planets because of its size, unusual orbit, and composition. (Pluto, once considered a planet, is now considered the lead object of a group of bodies called plutinos.)\n\nThe closest Sedna, which is 1000km-wide, gets to the sun is about 76AU and for 2012VP 113 , which is 450km-wide, that distance is 80AU. Their orbits are also at weird inclinations compared to most other solar system objects.\n\nThe results of the discovery have been published in Nature (""A Sedna-like body with a perihelion of 80 astronomical units""). Chadwick Trujillo of Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, who was also involved in finding Sedna, and Scott Shepherd of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who found 2012VP 113 with Trujillo, propose that these objects are members of the inner Oort cloud.\n\nThe Oort cloud is a hypothetical region that is thought to stretch outwards beyond the Kuiper belt. Beyond 5000AU, the Oort cloud expands out into a sphere centred on the sun. We have no direct evidence that the Oort cloud exists, but indirect evidence comes in the form of comets with extremely elongated orbits.\n\nStephen Lowry at the University of Kent said, \x93The orbital properties of these two objects are so very different from that of the Kuiper belt objects that it wouldn\x92t be wrong to suggest they may be part of the inner Oort cloud.\x94\n\nThe fact that these objects exist is remarkable, since they exist in a region where material is thought to have been too sparse for them to form. Current thinking is that they actually formed in the giant-planet region, and that their orbits may carry the signature of whatever events caused them to scatter to such distances. It is hoped that this discovery will lead efforts to find other objects.\n\nDavid Rothery of Open University said, \x93This is a remarkable discovery, but it is not entirely surprising. When they found Sedna, there was hope that they would find others in that region.\x94\n\nBut the fact that it took Trujillo, who was involved in the original team that found Sedna, more than ten years to find Sedna\x92s neighbour speaks to the challenge of discovery. \x93The farther you get from the sun, the less sunlight falls on these objects, which makes the task of locating them harder,\x94 Lowry said.\n\n\x93Worse still,\x94 Lowry continued, \x93the eccentric orbits of these objects means that there is very tiny window in which they can be observed from even the most powerful telescopes on Earth. What is needed to find these objects is not just technology but persistence.\x94 For example, Sedna gets as close as 76AU away from the sun, but at its farthest it is nearly 1000AU. Its orbital period is about 11,400 years, which means it spends lots of time too far out to be detected.', 'New planet-like body found sneaking through the inner Oort cloud(Nanowerk News) A new, planet-like body has been found on the outer edges of the solar system.\nIt joins an exclusive club composed of some of the strangest objects in the solar system.\nThe observable solar system can be divided into three regions: the rocky planets including the Earth and asteroids of the inner solar system, the gas giant planets, and the icy Kuiper Belt objects, which include Pluto.\nTheir orbits are also at weird inclinations compared to most other solar system objects.\nThe Oort cloud is a hypothetical region that is thought to stretch outwards beyond the Kuiper belt.']"

His study was published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\n“The big question is, how is this formed? How can you get an object out there?” he said. “We really don’t know an answer to that yet.”\n\nThis dwarf planet is unusual because of its orbit, Trujillo said. On its elliptical path, the closest it ever comes to the sun is still very far away from the rest of the solar system. Its full orbit is farther than the orbit of any other object we know of in the solar system.\n\n“Nothing that we currently know in the solar system can make objects that are so distant all the time, that never come close to any of the planets,” Trujillo said.\n\nThe most distant major planet from the sun is Neptune, orbiting our star at a distance of 30 astronomical units. One astronomical unit is the average distance between the Earth and the sun — about 150 million kilometers, or 93 million miles.\n\nBeyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut-shaped ring of small objects, which extends from about 30 to 55 AU, according to NASA. This belt may contain hundreds of thousands of large icy objects and trillions of comets, if not more. Pluto is considered a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt.\n\nThe awkwardly-named 2012 VP113 is much farther from the sun, at 83 astronomical units. That puts it at 83 times the distance between our own planet and the sun.\n\nBut in terms of average distance from the sun, there is a dwarf planet even farther out: Eris, which Trujillo helped discover. Eris is bigger than Pluto, and has a satellite called Dysnomia. The presence of Eris helped scientists determine that Pluto should not be counted among the major planets.\n\nSedna, a dwarf planet that Trujillo co-discovered as well in 2004, is located in the same distant area, and takes about 10,500 years to orbit the sun.\n\n“Finding Sedna so far away seemed odd and potentially a fluke,” said Mike Brown, professor of astronomy at California Institute of Technology, in an e-mail. “But this one is beginning to make it look like that might be a typical place for objects to be. Not at all what I would have guessed.”\n\nThis home of Sedna and 2012 VP113 is called the “inner Oort Cloud.” It may be where some comets come from, Trujillo said.\n\nBrown, who was not involved in this study, also co-discovered Sedna.\n\n“These unusual objects — Sedna and this new one — can tell us about very early in the solar system, when the sun and planets were just forming,” Brown said.\n\nScientists have not been able to discern what 2012 VP113’s composition is, but most would suspect it is icy because of its distance from the sun, Trujillo said. Its color is slightly reddish, and “not especially unusual compared to Kuiper Belt objects,” Trujillo said.\n\nTrujllio and colleagues estimate that the new dwarf planet is relatively small — about 450 kilometers (280 miles) in diameter, which less than the driving distance from Philadelphia to Boston. It’s probably ball-shaped, he said.\n\nSo why is this not a major planet such as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars? Trujillo explains that a bona fide planet is big enough that other objects in its orbit will be sucked into it gravitationally. A dwarf planet is not big enough to become gravitationally dominant; it’s too small to pull in objects in the area of its path.\n\nIt’s possible that this dwarf planet formed very early in our solar system’s history, in the region between Jupiter and Saturn, and then got thrown out beyond Pluto. One theory is that, billions of years ago, another star passed by our sun and took material with it out to a distant orbit.\n\nAs far as we know, it’s too cold out where the dwarf planet is to have liquid water, Trujillo said.\n\n“To me, what this discovery really shows is that we are on verge of finally being able to read the story that Sedna is trying to tell us, and that the next few years should bring a flood of new discoveries in this new region of the outer solar system,” Brown said.\n\n2012 VP113 will be eventually renamed, but Trujillo’s website says it’s informally called “Biden” because of the “VP” designation.', '× New Dwarf planet discovered at solar system’s edgeElizabeth Landau, (CNN) — For anyone holding out hope of Pluto being reinstated as a major planet, you should probably do as they say in the movie “Frozen” and “let it go.”But here’s a new exciting find from the far reaches of our solar system: Astronomers have discovered a dwarf planet that’s even farther away than Pluto — so far, in fact, that its orbit reaches into a new edge of the solar system.\n“We really don’t know an answer to that yet.”This dwarf planet is unusual because of its orbit, Trujillo said.\nIts full orbit is farther than the orbit of any other object we know of in the solar system.\nIt’s possible that this dwarf planet formed very early in our solar system’s history, in the region between Jupiter and Saturn, and then got thrown out beyond Pluto.\nAs far as we know, it’s too cold out where the dwarf planet is to have liquid water, Trujillo said.']"

A newly discovered, extremely distant dwarf planet with the tentative name of 2012 VP113 was announced. It appears as nothing more than a dot on images but we know a few things about it.\n\nFor a start, it is approximately 450km across, which is pretty small by planetary standards and means that it is almost certainly an irregular lump of rock and ice rather than a spherical ""world"".\n\nWe know also that it never comes closer than 80 times the distance of the Earth to the sun. And it’s pink. Honestly, it is.\n\nAll in all, it’s a rather exotic place. Yet the most important part of the research is that this discovery could be the tip of a celestial iceberg. Before today’s announcement only one other celestial object, the dwarf planet Sedna, was known to exist so far from the sun.\n\nScott Sheppard at the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Chadwick Trujillo of the Gemini Observatory are responsible for the new discovery. Based upon the amount of sky they had to search before uncovering 2012 VP113, they estimate that there could be approximately 900 other objects with diameters of 1,000km or more out there.\n\nIf true, then we have not simply discovered a new dwarf planet, we have begun to redefine the architecture of the solar system.\n\nThere are millions of asteroids in the belt between Mars and Jupiter but only one, Ceres, is about 1,000km across. For comparison, Mercury, the smallest planet, is 4,879km across, and Earth is 12,742km. The astronomers speculated that some of these far-distant worlds could be larger than Mars (6,779km) or even Earth.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, I discovered that theoreticians were all but predicting a second solar system’s worth of planets at extreme distances from the sun. They came to this conclusion because of computer simulations of planetary formation. They were investigating the prevailing view that 4.6bn years ago, a plethora of large asteroids collided repeatedly to build the planets of today.\n\n\n\nHowever, the simulations showed that not every close encounter ended in collision. Sometimes planets would experience a near-miss. In these, the smaller of the two could be gravitationally slung out of the simulated solar system. Because the computers of the time only had limited power, the astronomers couldn’t track their eventual whereabouts.\n\n\n\nIt seemed entirely reasonable to suppose that some of those errant worlds would have been thrown clear to wander interstellar space. Others will have been placed at extreme distance, where they will be orbiting even today, having been unable to completely break free of the sun’s gravitational grip.\n\n\n\nToday’s announcement backs up this view, and promises more for the future.\n\n\n\nThe next generation of survey telescopes, such as the Large Synoptic Survey telescope, should be powerful enough to see some of these distant worlds. It may also see something even larger, according to Sheppard and Trujillo.\n\nIn the most speculative part of today’s announcement the astronomers noted that 2012 VP113 shares a similar inclination in its orbit to the previously discovered Sedna,which Trujillo also had a hand in discovering, and which was originally termed 2003 VB12. They suggest that a much larger planet’s gravity could be corralling both objects.\n\nThey suggest that this as yet unseen gravitational sheep dog would be huge: perhaps 10 times the mass of the Earth, and orbiting a few hundred times further from the sun than our planet. Such ‘Super Earths’ are now routinely found around other stars. To find one in our solar system would constitute as much of a shake up as the discovery of Uranus, Neptune or Pluto did back in 1781, 1846, 1930 respectively.\n\n\n\nBut don\'t hold your breath.

This object, called 2012VP 113 , is about 450km wide and is the second body of its class found since the identification of the dwarf planet Sedna in 2003, and it joins an exclusive club composed of some of the strangest objects in the Solar System.\n\nThe observable Solar System can be divided into three regions: the rocky terrestrial planets and asteroids of the inner Solar System, the gas giant planets, and the icy Kuiper Belt objects, which include Pluto. The Kuiper Belt stretches from beyond Neptune, which is at 30 astronomical units (where 1AU is the typical distance between the Earth and the Sun), to about 50AU.\n\nSedna and 2012VP 113 are strange objects because they reside in a region where there should be nothing, according to our theories of the Solar System formation. Their orbit is well beyond that of Neptune, the last recognized planet of the Solar System, and even beyond that of Pluto, which differs from planets because of its size, unusual orbit, and composition. (Pluto, once considered a planet, is now considered the lead object of a group of bodies called plutinos.)\n\nThe closest Sedna gets to the Sun is at about 76AU, and for 2012VP 113 that distance is 80AU. Their orbits are also at weird inclinations compared to most other Solar System objects.\n\nChadwick Trujillo of Gemini Observatory in Hawaii, who was also involved in finding Sedna, and Scott Shepherd of the Carnegie Institution for Science, who found 2012VP 113 with Trujillo, propose that these objects are members of the inner Oort Cloud.\n\nThe Oort Cloud is a hypothetical region that is thought to stretch outward beyond the Kuiper Belt along the plane of the Solar System. Beyond 5,000AU, the Oort Cloud expands out into a sphere centered on the Sun. We have no direct evidence that the Oort Cloud exists, but indirect evidence comes in the form of comets with extremely elongated orbits.\n\nStephen Lowry at the University of Kent said, ""The orbital properties of these two objects are so very different from that of the Kuiper Belt objects that it wouldn\'t be wrong to suggest they may be part of the inner Oort Cloud.""\n\nThe fact that these objects exist is remarkable since they exist in a region where material is thought to have been too sparse for them to form. The current thinking is that they actually formed in the giant-planet region and that their orbits may carry the signature of whatever events caused them to scatter to such distances. It is hoped that this discovery will lead efforts to find other objects.\n\nDavid Rothery of Open University said, ""This is a remarkable discovery, but it is not entirely surprising. When they found Sedna, there was hope that they would find others in that region.""\n\nBut the fact that it took Trujillo, who was involved in the original team that found Sedna, more than 10 years to find Sedna\'s neighbor speaks to the challenge of discovery. ""The farther you get from the Sun, the less sunlight falls on these objects, which makes the task of locating them harder,"" Lowry said.\n\n""Worse still,"" Lowry continued, ""the eccentric orbits of these objects means that there is a very tiny window in which they can be observed from even the most powerful telescopes on Earth. What is needed to find these objects is not just technology but persistence."" For example, Sedna gets as close as 76AU away from the Sun, but at its farthest it is nearly 1000AU. Its orbital period is about 11,400 years, which means it spends lots of time too far out to be detected.\n\nWhile 2012VP 113 and Sedna provide some information about the inner Oort Cloud, to say any more, scientists are going to need more than two data points. Next-generation instruments such as the Subaru telescope in Hawaii and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in Chile may hold the answers.\n\nNature, 2014.

Researchers said the discovery proves the existence of the inner Oort cloud, a region of icy bodies that lies far beyond the orbit of Neptune – which at 4.5bn kilometres from the sun is the most remote planet in the solar system.\n\nUntil a proper name is decided upon, the body is known only as 2012 VP 113 . According to the science journal Nature, the team that discovered it call it VP for short, or ""Biden"", after US vice president Joe Biden.\n\nIts pink tinge comes from radiation damage that alters the make-up of frozen water, methane and carbon dioxide on the surface.\n\nThough exciting in its own right, the discovery raises a more tantalising prospect for many astronomers: that a ""Super Earth"" up to 10 times the mass of our planet orbits the sun at such a great distance that it has never been seen.\n\nThree images of the newly discovered dwarf planet 2012 VP 113 taken about two hours apart on 5 November 2012. Photograph: Scott S Sheppard/Carnegie Institution for Science\n\nAstronomers found 2012 VP 113 by taking snapshots of the night sky an hour or so apart with an instrument called the Dark Energy Camera on the US National Optical Astronomy Observatory telescope in Chile. When they turned the images into a time-lapse movie of the sky, they could see the new body moving against the background of stationary stars.\n\n""This object has the most distant orbit known,"" Scott Sheppard at the Carnegie Institution of Washington told the Guardian. ""It extends the known boundary of the observable solar system.""\n\nThe object\'s orbit brings it as close as 12bn kilometres from the sun, and swings out as far as 67bn kilometres. There are comets that come from even farther out, but they pass much closer to our home planet.\n\nThe solar system has three distinct regions. Closest to the sun are the rocky planets, such as Venus, Earth and Mars. Farther out are the gas giants, such as Saturn and Jupiter. More distant still, beyond the orbit of Neptune, is a band of icy objects called the Kuiper belt.\n\nIn 2003, astronomers found an object beyond the Kuiper belt, which they called Sedna. For more than a decade, the object was a loner, an anomaly in the solar system. But the new body, 2012 VP 113 , lurks in the same no-man\'s land of space, leading astronomers to believe there could be thousands of similar bodies waiting to be discovered there.\n\n""People wondered if Sedna was unique, and 10 years on, we have at last found another object that shows it is not. There is probably a large population of objects out there,"" Sheppard said.\n\nThe dwarf planet (coloured dots). Three images, each taken about two hours apart, were combined into one. The first was artificially colored red, second green and third blue. The background stars and galaxies did not move and so their red, green and blue images combine to show up as white sources. Photograph: Scott S Sheppard/Carnegie Institution for Science\n\nThe region of space where Sedna and 2012 VP 113 were found is called the inner Oort cloud. Astronomers are unsure how this remote cloud of objects formed, but there are three competing theories. One is that a rogue planet was flung out of the early solar system and dragged the Oort cloud material with it.\n\nAnother is that the material was pulled out of the inner solar system by a passing star. The third option has the same job done by planets orbiting stars born in the same cluster as the sun.\n\n""What is exciting about this work is that we know the inner Oort cloud is there. This is the second object we know of, and it\'s a smoking gun,"" said Meg Schwamb, a planetary scientist at the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics at Academica Sinica in Taiwan. By studying the objects, astronomers hope to confirm how the inner Oort cloud formed.\n\nSheppard found the new object, reported in Nature, with fellow astronomer, Chad Trujillo, who works at the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. Trujillo was a co-discoverer of Sedna in 2003.\n\nThe latest work has already thrown up an intriguing possibility. The angle of the body\'s orbit and that of Sedna\'s are strikingly similar, an effect most likely caused by the gravitational tug of another, unseen body. One possibility is a ""Super Earth"" that traces so large an orbit around the sun that it has never been seen.\n\n""If you took a Super Earth and put it a few hundred astronomical units out, the gravity could shepherd Sedna and this new object into the orbits they have,"" said Sheppard. An astronomical unit (AU) is around 150m kilometres, or the mean distance from Earth to the sun.\n\nEarlier this month, Nasa\'s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) reported the results from its search for ""Planet X"", a hypothesised planet far out in the solar system. It found no evidence for a new planet larger than Saturn within 10,000 AU of the sun. But Saturn is 95 times more massive than Earth, so a smaller Super Earth could go undetected in that region.', 'Until a proper name is decided upon, the body is known only as 2012 VP 113 .\nThree images of the newly discovered dwarf planet 2012 VP 113 taken about two hours apart on 5 November 2012.\n""It extends the known boundary of the observable solar system.""\nAnother is that the material was pulled out of the inner solar system by a passing star.\nEarlier this month, Nasa\'s Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) reported the results from its search for ""Planet X"", a hypothesised planet far out in the solar system.']"

Sheppard: Carnegie Institution for Science\n\nstill waiting to be discovered—even new (dwarf) planets. Today, researchers from the Carnegie Institute in Washington D.C. and the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii announced they had found a new small world called 2012 VP113, a distant potential dwarf planet twice as far away from the sun as Pluto. And it could be just a taste of what else is out there.\n\nEven smaller and fainter than Pluto, 2012 VP113 was first spotted a year and a half ago by Scott Sheppard and Chadwick Trujillo, friends who met in grad school at the University of Hawaii and collaborators for 15 years. ""There was a chance we\'d find a bunch of nothing so it\'s definitely exciting,"" Sheppard says of the discovery.\n\nIn the time since then, the pair has gathered enough data on the new find, now detailed in a new study in Nature. It\'s an icy ball of water and methane that measures just 15 degrees above absolute zero. It has a pinkish hue and is 280 miles in diameter—about the size of the state of Wisconsin.\n\nThey\'ve even come up with a better name for it than the technical 2012 VP113. Since it has ""VP"" in the name, they call it ""Biden.""\n\nRight now, Biden is about 80 times farther away from the sun than the Earth is. From that distance, the sun looks just like a bright star in the sky, Sheppard says. And that\'s as close as Biden gets. The object has an elongated orbit that can carry it as far away as 450 times the distance between Earth and Sun.\n\nScott S. Sheppard: Carnegie Institution for Science\n\nOrbit diagram for the outer solar system. Sedna\'s orbit is shown in orange while 2012 VP113\'s orbit is shown in red.\n\nDwarf planets are the class that now include several objects around the solar system, including Pluto, that are round and big enough to be planets but have not ""cleared their neighborhood."" Prior to the discovery of Biden, the last such outpost of the solar system was a dwarf planet known as Sedna, which was discovered in 2003. ""This is just another Sedna-like object,"" says Hal Levison, a scientist who studies the formation and evolution of the solar system at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado.\n\nThe discovery means that there could be a swarm of such objects waiting to be discovered out beyond Pluto, Sheppard says, in the area beyond the Kuiper Belt, an icy ring of objects where Pluto is located. ""They\'re in this no-man\'s-land area. Originally people didn\'t think there would be anything there,"" he says. The fact that there are now two large objects found there, Sedna and Biden, has broad implications for how scientists understand both the current and early Solar System.\n\nPeculiarities in the orbits of these two tiny objects hint at more discoveries waiting to be made. Researchers are bound to find more like them, Sheppard says, and some could be very big, ""even as big as Mars or Earth."" He says there\'s even the possibility that a super-Earth—10 times the size of our planet—lurks out there. Now, Sheppard and Trujillo are not the first to suggest the existence of an unknown planet in far-flung regions of the solar system. Clyde Tombaugh, for example, discovered Pluto in 1930, looking for a planet thought to be influencing Neptune\'s orbit and several other distant objects have been proposed to explain everything from comets to mass extinctions. But Levison is guardedly intrigued, even though past searches for a large, faraway planet turned up nothing. ""It\'s seducing me,"" he says.\n\nScott S. Sheppard: Carnegie Institution for Science\n\nThese images show the discovery of the new inner Oort cloud object 2012 VP113 taken about 2 hours apart on November 5, 2012. Images by Scott S. Sheppard, Carnegie Institution for Science.\n\nIn addition to changing how we think about the current solar system, Sheppard says that the discovery shows what the solar system looked like in the first 100 million years of its existence, when the planets formed around the sun. ""It means the solar system was different than it was today, probably more chaotic,"" he says. Flung way out to edges of the Sun\'s gravitational field, Biden and Sedna are pieces of forensic evidence that help scientists such as Levison determine this history of the solar system. ""It\'s like a bloody murder scene,"" Levison says. ""Sometimes the blood spattering on the walls tells you more than the bodies on the floor.""\n\nIf 2012 VP113 is to officially become a dwarf planet, fully sanctioned by the Minor Planet Center, they will have to pick a new name for it (""Biden"" will definitely be out of the running). Because it comes from such a cold region, Sheppard is considering looking to Inuit mythology for inspiration, similar to how the names for the major planets come from Roman mythology.\n\nBut to get to that point the scientists still need to get in several more years of observations before it fades off into the farthest reaches of the solar system. It won\'t return for about 4000 years, but perhaps the next time it comes back it\'ll bring along a bigger sister.', 'Scott S.

Late last night, Brazil broke ground and became the first country to pass a bill protecting the rights of internet users.\n\nAn ""overwhelming"" majority of Brazil\'s Chamber of Deputies voted for the internet bill of rights bill called the ""Marco Civil da Internet,"" according to ZDNet. The bill, a result of a four-year process, is the first to set internet governance principles in Brazil, which protects freedom of expression, the right to privacy, and net neutrality -- the most emphasized provision in the piece of legislation. While the Marco Civil bill still needs to pass the Senate before getting approval by President Rousseff, it appears the most difficult process for its approval has been completed.\n\nThe Marco Civil bill was first officially drafted in 2009, and went through a long process of approval and consultation, including an 18-month period of discussion through the internet by various stakeholders, including telecommunications companies, government agencies, civil organizations, and users, according to Access Now.\n\nWhile not perfect for internet activists, due to disagreements and extended wrangling over parts of the legislation, the Marco Civil legislation includes key provisions that protect netizens in Brazil -- some which appear to be a direct result of the 2013 revelations about the U.S. National Security Agency\'s surveillance activities, especially those relating to NSA\'s spying on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.\n\nSome of the important aspects of the Marco Civil bill include:\n\nOpen Principles\n\nMarco Civil asserts regulations supporting strong rights for Brazilians on the net, as well as future-aware principles for the internet\'s operation, including freedom of expression, open standards, protection of personal data, multi-stakeholder administration, and accessibility. Taken as a whole, the principles support an open, inclusive, and democratic culture for Brazil\'s internet, and implicitly limit central control over it.\n\nPrivacy\n\nOne privacy measure that Rousseff wanted to be included would have been a substantial protection against outside spying. The ""forced data center localization"" provision would have demanded that some kinds of internet companies keep their data centers physically within Brazil\'s boundaries. The provision created a great deal of controversy, because obviously that would create massive and expensive logistical problems, so to get it passed, it wasn\'t included.\n\nInstead, Marco Civil asserts Brazilian jurisdiction over data and services in Brazil, and also requires consumer internet service providers (ISPs) to retain user data for no more than a year, which is shorter than the five year period previously proposed. In addition, other provisions in the bill create safe harbors for online intermediaries in Brazil, and prohibit Deep Packet Inspection (a common tool to filter out malicious traffic, but which can also be used for data mining and surveillance) when it threatens Brazilians\' privacy at the level of their physical internet connection.\n\nNet Neutrality\n\nThe most important, and most emphasized, portion of the revolutionary Marco Civil bill protects net neutrality -- something which the U.S. hasn\'t quite figured out yet. The bill says that ISPs must treat all data that goes through their network in the same way, and not set higher or lower speeds for different internet content or services. ISPs also can\'t suspend users\' connections unless in the case of debt, and internet companies are responsible for delivering and maintaining the same quality of service agreed upon in contract terms -- meaning no throttling.\n\nBrazil, Latin America and the Future of the Internet\n\nWhile clearly not all countries in Latin America are internet-progressive, Latin American markets are increasingly driving many of the technology industry\'s priorities, with incredible market growth recently (with more potential growth), and populations that are increasingly conscious of the civil issues the internet brings.\n\nThe Marco Civil bill is the first of its kind in the world, and will likely become law before NETmundial, a global conference on internet governance that Brazil is hosting next month. In this way, Brazil and Latin America might lead the world towards Sir Berners-Lee\'s vision of a mature, civilly responsible net.', 'Earlier this month, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, called for a ""Bill of Rights"" for the web on its 25th birthday.\nLate last night, Brazil broke ground and became the first country to pass a bill protecting the rights of internet users.\nAn ""overwhelming"" majority of Brazil\'s Chamber of Deputies voted for the internet bill of rights bill called the ""Marco Civil da Internet,"" according to ZDNet.\nWhile the Marco Civil bill still needs to pass the Senate before getting approval by President Rousseff, it appears the most difficult process for its approval has been completed.\nNet NeutralityThe most important, and most emphasized, portion of the revolutionary Marco Civil bill protects net neutrality -- something which the U.S. hasn\'t quite figured out yet.']"

48210,http://panampost.com/belen-marty/2014/03/26/brazilians-face-new-constitution-for-internet-regulation/,technology,"[""Español After intense lobbying efforts over the last two and a half years, last night the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies finally approved the main text of a bill that aims to regulate the internet. The new law will function as a “constitution” for the internet, ensuring certain guarantees, rights, principles, and obligations. It seeks to guarantee privacy rights for users, especially those related to the security of internet communications.\n\nWhile the bill provoked debate throughout the parliamentary session, it was, in the end, approved without much resistance. According to Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, the voting ended as a purely symbolic gesture, as no votes were actually tallied. Members of the Popular Socialist Party (PPS) were the only representatives to vote against the bill.\n\nMargaret Tse of the Liberdade Institute, an NGO based in Porto Alegre dedicated to spreading the benefits of a free society and limited governments, told the PanAm Post that this new law, promoted by the government of Brazil, was designed to guarantee civil rights for internet users in the country. According to the her, “Brazilian legislators approved a bill that standardizes the way internet companies operating in Brazil will need to respond to legal requests.”\n\nAccording to the architect of the bill, Representative Alessandro Molon of the Workers Party (PT), Brazilians need this law “to protect the essence of the internet, which is threatened by both market and government forces.”\n\nIdeli Salvati, minister of institutional relations, said the legislation will force companies like Google and Facebook to comply with Brazilian law when a case involves a local citizen’s information, including any data that may be stored in other countries. With regard to net neutrality, the text of the bill approved by the Brazilian Congress stipulates that companies may not limit user access to specific content or tier their prices for different providers and their services.\n\nThis regulation gained traction following allegations of spying from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who revealed that the agency was secretly gathering data on personal communications, including that of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Brazil’s government has passed this new law as it prepares to host the International Conference on Global Governance in Sao Paulo in April.\n\nRegulation or Censorship?\n\nThis new initiative by the Rousseff administration is not without its critics. The Liberdade Institute has expressed concerns and stated that “the main theme of this bill is to provide permanent regulation of the internet in favor of the state, and even if this current administration does not censor, it empowers other political parties in the future to implement internet censorship.”\n\nThe principal question being posed by the NGO is, “Is this new law protecting the individual liberty of citizens, or is it protecting politicians?”\n\nTse of the Liberdade Institute explains that, relative to other counties throughout the world, Brazil has had more content removed from Google through similar legislation. According to Tse, this sort of regulation “tends to worsen censorship.”\n\nRoberto Chiocca, of the Mises Institute Brazil, sharply criticized the new law by saying, “nothing good can come from a plan to regulate the internet.” He further stated, “An environment that functions well, even virtual, does so because it is anarchic. They want to destroy it by making it ‘democratic.'”"", 'The new law will function as a “constitution” for the internet, ensuring certain guarantees, rights, principles, and obligations.\nIt seeks to guarantee privacy rights for users, especially those related to the security of internet communications.\nWhile the bill provoked debate throughout the parliamentary session, it was, in the end, approved without much resistance.\nAccording to Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.

48211,https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2014/03/26/a-bill-of-internet-rights-for-brazil,technology,"['\n\nGuest blog post from Ronaldo Lemos, Access Board Member, Project Lead of the Creative Commons of Brazil, and the Director of the Rio Institute for Technology and Society\n\nLast night, Brazil´s Congress approved the “Marco Civil,” a landmark piece of legislation comprehensively protecting human rights online. The vote follows closely on the heels of the Web´s 25th anniversary and Sir Tim Berners-Lee call for a “Magna Carta” of the internet. Brazil is the first country in the world to hear that call. Effectively, the Marco Civil creates a bill of rights for the Brazilian internet, a first for the world.\n\nThe Marco Civil was originally drafted by means of an open and collaborative online process. From the time it became clear that Brazil needed a bill of rights for the internet, it also became clear that the internet itself could and should be used to draft it. An 18-month consultation process followed, including contributions from a variety of stakeholders. It was truly a hybrid and transparent forum: users, civil society organizations, telcos, governmental agencies, all provided comments side-by-side. Each contributor could see the others’ contributions, and all cards on the table had to be considered.\n\nThe process was successful, leading a draft that was turned into a bill that was proposed by the Government for the consideration of the Brazilian Congress.\n\nThe final version boldly protects net neutrality, which is at the heart of the bill. It also protects privacy, clearly prohibiting NSA-like practices. For instance, the use of Deep Packet Inspection which might threat the user´s privacy at the physical layer of the connection is now illegal in Brazil. The Marco Civil protects freedom of expression, creating safe harbors for online intermediaries in Brazil, which would require internet platforms to only take down content when served with a valid court order (although this doesn’t apply to copyright-related materials, which will be addressed in a forthcoming piece of legislation).\n\nAnother important principle of the Marco Civil is that if fosters a multistakeholder approach to internet governance in Brazil and abroad. In short, it translates the principles of the Brazilian Constitution to the online world. It is a victory for democracy, and for what it stands for.\n\nIn that sense, the Brazilian Marco Civil goes in opposite direction of other laws that have been passed recently in countries such as Turkey or Russia, which expand the powers of governments to interfere with the internet. Brazil´s law can be an example to other countries willing to take seriously the importance of the net to facilitating both development and a rich and open public sphere.\n\nIn the wake of the Snowden revelations, Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff demanded a new article to be included in the Bill. It created a “forced data center localization” provision, which would have required certain types of companies to keep their data centers physically located in Brazil. That provision received a great deal of criticism, including by me. In the end, the article was removed from the bill, and no forced localization of data has been included in the bill. Instead, a provision asserting the Brazilian jurisdiction over data and services offered in Brazil has been included. It is not perfect, but much better than the forced localization alternative.\n\nThe Marco Civil also includes a requirement that ISPs providing connectivity services and other internet services retain user data for a year and six months respectively, but this is significantly shorter than the five years that was previously proposed. It also creates a standard that improves on the current practices of data retention in Brazil, which were not defined by law, and because of that, quite uncertain.\n\nFrom start to finish, the approval of Marco Civil took about 7 years of intense debate with numerous people been involved in the process along th eway. The support of civil society and an active participation on the part of the Brazilian public was crucial. One highlight is the performance of the rapporteur of the project, Congress Member Alessandro Molon, who understood the bill from its very beginning and gathered the technical expertise necessary to defend it to the end. His conduct regarding Marco Civil should be an inspiration to politicians dealing with similar issues. The bill is now headed to the Brazilian Senate for a vote, which could happen any day now. However, the loud celebration of the approval of the Marco Civil in the lower house will likely be persuasive over the Senate and deter further changes. It´s carnival for the Brazilian internet!\n\nSee Access’ previous campaigns on the Marco Civil', 'Effectively, the Marco Civil creates a bill of rights for the Brazilian internet, a first for the world.\nThe Marco Civil was originally drafted by means of an open and collaborative online process.\nFrom the time it became clear that Brazil needed a bill of rights for the internet, it also became clear that the internet itself could and should be used to draft it.\nAnother important principle of the Marco Civil is that if fosters a multistakeholder approach to internet governance in Brazil and abroad.\nIt´s carnival for the Brazilian internet!']"

A corresponding provision would be added to an “Internet bill of rights” and net neutrality bill that had been pending in the Brazilian legislature for years.\n\nHowever, in a concession to intense lobbying by Google and other major American tech companies, that local storage requirement was dropped from the final language that passed the lower house (Google Translate) of the Brazilian Congress on Tuesday.\n\nThe bill, known formally as the “Marco Civil da Internet,"" does require that Brazilian privacy and data protection law be respected if the foreign company offers services to Brazilians, even if the company does not maintain an economic presence in the South American state. The bill also includes short-term exemptions to net neutrality in the case of “emergency services” or “technical requirements.”\n\nIf the bill passes the Brazilian senate and is signed into law, it would make the country the largest ever to enshrine net neutrality in its legal code, following the lead of the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Chile.\n\nBut the final form of the legislation may not fully restore trust in foreign service providers. In September 2013, a Brazilian official at the United Nations lamented the role of foreign service providers in the spying against his country. “We have no [similar technological surveillance] capabilities in Brazil,” Guilherme Patriota, the deputy permanent representative at the Permanent Mission of Brazil to the United Nations, told Ars.\n\n“I think the Snowden revelations have proven me right,” Patriota added.

Thus, users can navigate whenever they want in the limit of their data and speed package.\n\nThe Brazilian Executive Power accepted to set standards for regulatory neutrality and established a presidential decree that will detail the concept of neutrality, without much change in the content. Behind the scenes, the move was interpreted as an honorable PMDB exit.\n\nAnother modification sponsored by the government in order to avoid a defeat in the House was the removal of the requirement for nationalization of data users storage centers. That was one of the measures advocated by President Dilma Rousseff as a way to respond to news of U.S. spying against Brazilian authorities.\n\nThe original version stated that an Executive decree would regulate the obligation of companies like Google and Facebook to keep user data storage structure in the country.\n\nTo do this they would have to replicate in the country a structure that is similar to other countries including the United States. According to the government the measure would give greater protection to data from the country.\n\nIt was decided, however, that the data will be submitted to Brazilian law.

Part of that plan involved mandating local storage, but that proved to be a major sticking point and Rousseff backed off a week ago in order to aid the wider bill’s passage.\n\nNet neutrality is of course also a potential blocker, though clearly not enough to stop the Chamber of Deputies passing the Marco Civil.

So I want to welcome everyone tuning in online, and I want to thank our global webcast sponsor, Telefonica. We will also be live tweeting throughout the conference, so I invite you to tweet with us using the hashtag PanoramaBR—and I will be tweeting too, so tune in!\n\nThis event is made possible through our pan-regional Latin American cities series sponsors: AES, Citi, J.P. Morgan, Microsoft, N.E.C., and Pepsico; and through our corporate sponsor: Standard and Poor’s. I would also like to thank CAF for their support, as well as our media sponsor, The Financial Times.\n\nThank you all so much. Muito obrigada.\n\nFinally, many thanks to my team for their wonderful work in the organization of this conference: Natalia Williamson, Diogo Ide, and Luisa Leme.\n\nThis is an exciting year for Brazil, between the elections and the World Cup, which will bring millions of domestic and international tourists to Brazil’s 12 host cities to watch Brazil win ….. Well, maybe!\n\nAs we all know, Brazil faces many challenges over the next few years. But where there are challenges, there are also opportunities – and in the case of Brazil, I would say there are huge opportunities.\n\nIn spite of some volatility, Brazil continues to be the investment destination in the region. It was the fourth largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world, and the main recipient in Latin America in 2013, responsible for 47% of the region’s total.\n\nGrowth was better than expected last year in the country, supported by high levels of investment, which increased 6.5% up to the third quarter of 2013. And as U.S. numbers pick up – with a forecasted 3.1% growth for this year and 3.4% for the next – prospects for the global economy and the region look more promising.\n\nWealth in Brazil is no longer solely concentrated in the southeast, but is being redistributed throughout the country by a rising and newly empowered middle class. This new force has created an important consumer market that is pushing the economy forward, and simultaneously demanding improvements in education, healthcare, transparency, and urban transportation, which should ultimately lead to better public policies for the nation.\n\nAfter a decade of strengthening the domestic market through social inclusion policies, the challenge today is how to generate and maintain sustainable future growth that creates high-quality jobs and effectively addresses the demands of the new middle class. I believe so much of Brazil’s opportunity lies in education, competitiveness, and entrepreneurship.\n\nToday, Brazil is heavily investing in education, with initiatives like Pronatec, which will expand technical schools around the country, and the science mobility program, which will send 100,000 STEM undergraduates abroad to the world’s best universities. With 75% of oil royalties going to education, the ministry’s budget will increase by $35 billion over the next 10 years, allowing for new and better investments in Brazil’s students.\n\nAnd while there is still a way to go, we are also already beginning to see important policy changes around competitiveness in the country, including the recent infrastructure concession program, which will reduce costs for all industries. It is the biggest logistics overhaul program in the world, with $88 billion of investments needed. The program will address bottlenecks by expanding and building new roads, ports, airports, and railways to connect people living in different regions and facilitate trade flows in and out the country.\n\nAnd I am certain that the greatest potential for the nation is in its people. Brazil is one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the world. Despite the obstacles, 30% of adults here are either trying to launch a business or already own a venture less than 42 months old.\n\nThat is in comparison to 22% of adults in my country. And the story is even better for women, who in the last three years headed 52% of small and medium enterprises.\n\nThese entrepreneurs are driving growth—small and medium-sized companies make up 20% of Brazil’s GDP and over 50% of the country’s formal jobs. Efforts to reduce barriers and boost innovation will help transform these entrepreneurs into an even stronger engine of growth for the country.\n\nThis is an exciting time for Brazil. And to discuss some of these critical issues, we have with us today an amazing lineup of speakers who will discuss the upcoming presidential elections; technology and small- and medium-sized enterprises, and the economic outlook for Brazil. And we hope you will all stay for our final keynote from Governor Eduardo Campos.\n\nThank you.\n\nAgain, I am thrilled to be back in São Paulo, continuing our tradition of strong and dedicated programmatic activity around Brazil.', 'REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERYLocation: São Paulo, BrazilPrezados convidados, bom dia!\nGostaria de agradecer a presença de todos e dizer que estamos muito felizes de estarmos de volta em São Paulo.\nWe are being joined by an even larger audience from around the world via our live webcast of today’s event.\nSo I want to welcome everyone tuning in online, and I want to thank our global webcast sponsor, Telefonica.\nAgain, I am thrilled to be back in São Paulo, continuing our tradition of strong and dedicated programmatic activity around Brazil.']"

Dr. Highton, who been studying salamanders within the region since 1957, has collected hundreds of thousands of salamanders. These specimens are now preserved in jars at the Smithsonian Institution\'s Museum Service Center in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nKaren R. Lips, an associate professor of biology at the University of Maryland and the study\'s senior author, decided to find out why the population of salamanders were decreasing.\n\nShe initially suspected some kind of disease. A fungal disease called chytridiomycosis had caused a significant decline of frog populations in Central America, says Dr. Lips, and she thought there might be something similar affecting Appalachian salamanders, who, like frogs, are amphibians and prefer moist habitats.\n\nLips and her team examined some 16 different varieties of salamanders, and they ruled out disease. But they noticed something funny about the animals.\n\nBy comparing museum species of salamanders to the ones that were caught from the same sites between 2011 and 2012, the researchers concluded that salamanders within the Appalachian Mountains were actually shrinking. Their average body length (minus the tail) of these species ranges from 1.5 inches to 2.3 inches, says Lips. Some species showed a reduction of two percent while others shrank by seven or eight percent. One species shrank by as much as 18 percent.\n\n""This is one of the largest and fastest rates of change ever recorded in any animal,"" Lips said in a press release. ""We don\'t know exactly how or why it\'s happening, but our data show it is clearly correlated with climate change.""\n\nResearchers arrived at this conclusion after Clemson University biologist Michael W.

As the temperature increases, so does their metabolic rate. To compensate for increased energy needs, the animals have to make some trade-offs. So they might shrink, becoming easier prey. The smaller females will also give birth to fewer offspring than their larger counterparts, Lips says.\n\n""Right now we don\'t know what this means for the animals,"" Lips said.

That\'s the key finding of a new study, published March 25 in the journal Global Change Biology, that examined museum specimens caught in the Appalachian Mountains from 1957 to 2007 and wild salamanders measured at the same sites in 2011-2012. The salamanders studied from 1980 onward were, on average, 8% smaller than their counterparts from earlier decades. The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations -- settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most.\n\nScientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change, and this is strongest confirmation of that prediction.\n\n""This is one of the largest and fastest rates of change ever recorded in any animal,"" said Karen R. Lips, an associate professor of biology at the University of Maryland and the study\'s senior author. ""We don\'t know exactly how or why it\'s happening, but our data show it is clearly correlated with climate change."" And it\'s happening at a time when salamanders and other amphibians are in distress, with some species going extinct and others dwindling in number.\n\n""We don\'t know if this is a genetic change or a sign that the animals are flexible enough to adjust to new conditions,"" Lips said. ""If these animals are adjusting, it gives us hope that some species are going to be able to keep up with climate change.""\n\nThe study was prompted by the work of University of Maryland Prof. Emeritus Richard Highton, who began collecting salamanders in the Appalachian Mountains in 1957. The geologically ancient mountain range\'s moist forests and long evolutionary history make it a global hot spot for a variety of salamander species. Highton collected hundreds of thousands of salamanders, now preserved in jars at the Smithsonian Institution\'s Museum Service Center in Suitland, MD.\n\nBut Highton\'s records show a mysterious decline in the region\'s salamander populations beginning in the 1980s. Lips, an amphibian expert, saw a similar decline in the frogs she studied in Central America, and tracked it to a lethal fungal disease. She decided to see whether disease might explain the salamander declines in the Appalachians.\n\nBetween summer 2011 and spring 2012, Lips and her students caught, measured and took DNA samples from wild salamanders at 78 of Highton\'s collecting sites in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina. Using relatively new techniques for analyzing DNA from preserved specimens, the researchers tested some of Highton\'s salamanders for disease.\n\nLips found virtually no fungal disease in the museum specimens or the living animals. But when she compared size measurements of the older specimens with today\'s wild salamanders, the differences were striking.\n\nBetween 1957 and 2012, six salamander species got significantly smaller, while only one got slightly larger. On average, each generation was one percent smaller than its parents\' generation, the researchers found.\n\nThe researchers compared changes in body size to the animals\' location and their sites\' elevation, temperature and rainfall. They found the salamanders shrank the most at southerly sites, where temperatures rose and rainfall decreased over the 55-year study.\n\nTo find out how climate change affected the animals, Clemson University biologist Michael W. Sears used a computer program to create an artificial salamander, which allowed him to estimate a typical salamander\'s daily activity and the number of calories it burned. Using detailed weather records for the study sites, Sears was able to simulate the minute-by-minute behavior of individual salamanders, based on weather conditions at their home sites during their lifetimes.\n\nThe simulation showed the modern salamanders were just as active as their forbears had been. But to maintain that activity, they had to burn 7 to 8 percent more energy. Cold-blooded animals\' metabolisms speed up as temperatures rise, Sears explained.\n\nTo get that extra energy, salamanders must make trade-offs, Lips said. They may spend more time foraging for food or resting in cool ponds, and less time hunting for mates. The smaller animals may have fewer young, and may be more easily picked off by predators.\n\n""Right now we don\'t know what this means for the animals,"" Lips said. ""If they can start breeding smaller, at a younger age, that might be the best way to adapt to this warmer, drier world. Or it may be tied in with the losses of some of these species.""\n\nThe research team\'s next step will be to compare the salamander species that are getting smaller to the ones that are disappearing from parts of their range. If they match, the team will be one step closer to understanding why salamanders are declining in a part of the world that once was a haven for them.\n\nThis research was funded by the University of Maryland-Smithsonian Institution Seed Grant Program.', 'Salamanders shrinking as their mountain havens heat upRelated images(click to enlarge)Wild salamanders living in some of North America\'s best salamander habitat are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier, forcing them to burn more energy in a changing climate.\nScientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change, and this is strongest confirmation of that prediction.\n""We don\'t know exactly how or why it\'s happening, but our data show it is clearly correlated with climate change.""\nThe geologically ancient mountain range\'s moist forests and long evolutionary history make it a global hot spot for a variety of salamander species.\nThe smaller animals may have fewer young, and may be more easily picked off by predators.']"

According to a new report published in Global Change Biology salamanders caught in the Appalachian Mountains since 1980 are, on average, 8 percent smaller than museum specimens caught before then.\n\nIts the confirmation of something that has long been posited: Higher temperatures cause creatures to expend more energy, and if you’re expending more energy, you’re going to be smaller. University of Maryland professor Karen Lips says that the speed at which the salamanders have shrunk is “one of the largest and fastest rates of change ever recorded in any animal.”\n\nA 2011 paper published in Nature Climate Change by David Bickford of the National University of Singapore is often cited as one of the first warning signs that this was even possible. In that paper, Bickford wrote that the “observed and expected patterns of decreased body size are widespread across different taxa, and are likely to be reported from an increasingly wide array of taxa over the coming century.” He cited at least 38 mammals, birds, frogs, fish, and plants that had shrank due to climate change. Another 9 species showed some growth because of the phenomenon.\n\n“It’s like a general law of chemistry and biology,” Lips said.\n\nAs one biologist explained to me last year, when there’s less energy going into an ecosystem, there’s less energy that can be spent. If temperatures are higher, the cold-blooded salamanders are forced to spend more energy in order to maintain a similar lifestyle. As a result, they are smaller.\n\nThe implications for all of this aren’t exactly known—it’s possible that as the climate changes, certain species, such as salamanders, get smaller, and everything goes on more or less as normal. But Lips says that’s probably not the case. She’s an expert on chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease she helped identify in Panama that has since spread throughout the world and has devastated amphibian populations along the way. While researching these salamanders, she expected to find that they had been infected by the fungus, because their population has been dwindling. Instead, she found nothing.\n\n“We couldn’t find the disease anywhere in these animals but noticed they were definitely not as abundant as they used to be, so we thought, ‘What could actually cause this?’” she said. “Other than disease, climate was the only thing I could think of.”\n\nTo test the theory, Lips thought of Bickford’s paper, and decided to compare salamanders in the field with museum specimens. From there, she found that ones in the wild are smaller than their historical counterparts.\n\nTo confirm whether the shrinkage is definitively due to temperature increases, Lips is designing a set of experiments to raise salamanders in different lab environments. From there, she’ll be able to test whether they show any sort of ill effects from being smaller and whether there’s anything to suggest that smaller amphibians will do worse in a wild environment.\n\nShe theorizes that it puts them at a disadvantage.\n\n“I think with amphibians and reptiles, bigger is almost always better. There’s fewer things that can eat you, you can produce more offspring, life is better overall,” she said. “But it’s not totally obvious how bad this is.”\n\nBetter to shrink than to die off: ""They’re changing pretty quick. They’re certainly trying to keep up, so that\'s a good thing for them,"" she said.\n\nThat was the crux of Bickford’s paper, as well. Anytime you screw with nature, there’s going to be unintended consequences, both for that species and, potentially, for humans.\n\n“Although there will be adaptive responses that natural selection will favor, ecosystem services and global ecological processes will most likely be altered, but not in the ways that will benefit human livelihoods. Reduction in nutrients, food availability, and water will probably have negative implications and are inter-related with climate change and shrinking organisms,” he wrote. “We need to understand how and why organisms are shrinking, how feasible it is to mitigate or adapt to such climate change effects, and what it means for biodiversity and humanity if we are unable to change this pattern.”', 'Image: Nicholas CarusoThe changing climate is shrinking salamanders in Appalachia as the amphibians are forced to burn more energy in order to survive.\nAs one biologist explained to me last year, when there’s less energy going into an ecosystem, there’s less energy that can be spent.\nIf temperatures are higher, the cold-blooded salamanders are forced to spend more energy in order to maintain a similar lifestyle.\nReduction in nutrients, food availability, and water will probably have negative implications and are inter-related with climate change and shrinking organisms,” he wrote.\n“We need to understand how and why organisms are shrinking, how feasible it is to mitigate or adapt to such climate change effects, and what it means for biodiversity and humanity if we are unable to change this pattern.”']"

In modern times, though, just a small warming has been enough to dramatically change them—and perhaps threaten their future. Salamanders in the southern Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia have gotten smaller over the past 50 years due to increasing temperatures in their habitats, a new study has concluded. It’s the first confirmation that climate change can alter body size, a connection that had only been hypothesized in the past, and one of the fastest studied responses to changing temperatures on record.\n\n“This is helping us understand yet another way in which climate change could play out,” says ecologist Michael Adams of the U.S. Geological Survey in Corvallis, Oregon, who was not involved in the new work. “In this case, we’re learning how it can change the life history of an organism.”\n\nOver the past decade, scientists have documented several population declines in amphibians, including salamanders. But the causes of these declines have been hard to work out; some are due to disease, others to habitat loss or invasive species. Karen Lips, a biologist at the University of Maryland, College Park, wanted to determine what was behind dropping numbers of Plethodontidae, or lungless salamanders, across the eastern United States. The Appalachians are home to more salamander species than any place on Earth, many unique to the area. The Plethodontidae, the most numerous, represent a large and diverse family of salamanders that all respire through their skin. The salamanders play a key role in the ecosystems of the mountains, consuming insects that are too tiny for most other vertebrates.\n\nLips and her colleagues analyzed more than 9000 salamanders from a dozen different Plethodontidae species, some from museum specimens collected as early as 1950 and others from 85 current locations across the southern Appalachians. Although they didn’t find widespread evidence of disease, they did notice another trend: The salamanders had gotten smaller. Salamanders collected after 1980 were 8% smaller than those from decades past. The trend was most significant in places that had seen the largest shifts in climate during that time: low elevations with an increase in temperature and a decrease in rain, the team reports online today in Global Change Biology. On average, the salamanders shrunk by 1% per generation.\n\nLungless salamanders, Lips explains, are highly sensitive to changes in their surrounding environment because of the way they breathe through their skin. When the temperature rises, their body speeds up. Using computer modeling, Lips’ collaborators showed that temperature increases in the areas of the Appalachians that have warmed over the past 50 years could speed the salamanders’ metabolisms by more than 7%.\n\nLips’ team hasn’t yet confirmed the mechanism by which the change in body size has occurred, although she hypothesizes that it’s driven by the salamanders’ metabolisms. “If it’s a little bit warmer, the animal is going to burn through its calories much faster,” Lips says. If availability of extra calories or extra time to forage is limited, the salamanders will grow to a smaller adult size due to this increased calorie burn. And smaller salamanders, she says, lay fewer eggs and are more susceptible to predators. “In general, bigger is better for these guys,” Lips says.\n\nThe scientists haven’t yet confirmed that the salamanders’ smaller size is behind the documented population declines, though they are confident that climate change is what’s driving the shrinkage in body size.\n\nJoseph Milanovich, an ecologist at Loyola University Chicago in Illinois, says that an ability to alter their body size could be what has allowed salamanders to survive previous temperature fluctuations. “These organisms have been on Earth for hundreds of millions of years,” he notes. “They’ve been through climate warming and cooling cycles before.” So the flexibility to alter their metabolism and body size may be an adaptation that’s arisen throughout these cycles. But that doesn’t mean that their current decrease in size will allow them to survive the faster pace of climate change that’s occurring now, Milanovich says.\n\nLips and her colleagues next plan to study how the change in body size affects the lungless salamanders’ interactions with each other and other species. The change in size, she says, could have broader effects on the Appalachian forest habitats they live in due to their key role in the food chain.\n\n“These guys are really important in the food web of the forest,” Lips says. “They are extremely abundant and they play an important role in nutrient cycling by eating bugs and converting those into food for birds and mammals.” So understanding how salamanders respond to climate change is likely one piece of the larger story of how entire ecosystems respond, she says.', 'Lungless salamanders, Lips explains, are highly sensitive to changes in their surrounding environment because of the way they breathe through their skin.\nLips’ team hasn’t yet confirmed the mechanism by which the change in body size has occurred, although she hypothesizes that it’s driven by the salamanders’ metabolisms.\nAnd smaller salamanders, she says, lay fewer eggs and are more susceptible to predators.\nThe scientists haven’t yet confirmed that the salamanders’ smaller size is behind the documented population declines, though they are confident that climate change is what’s driving the shrinkage in body size.\nLips and her colleagues next plan to study how the change in body size affects the lungless salamanders’ interactions with each other and other species.']"

Although the HTC One\'s camera isn\'t the hefty 16-megapixel shooter of the Samsung Galaxy S5, HTC says its special technology will deliver nice, crisp shots. There is also a 5-megapixel camera with a wide angle lens for group selfies on the front of the new One.\n\nThe rest of the HTC One M8\'s specs are pretty standard fare for high-end smartphones in 2014, so far. The new One is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, running at 2.3 GHz. It also features 2 GB of RAM. HTC offers 16 and 32GB options for the One, with a micro SD card slot, which allows you to add as much as 128 GB more of storage. This is a huge improvement over last year\'s HTC One, which maxed out at 64 GB of storage.\n\nThe new One comes with Android 4.4 KitKat with the HTC Sense 6 and new BlinkFeed preinstalled. In terms of connectivity, there\'s 802.11 a/ac/b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0 with aptX. HTC also gave the new One a 2,600 mAh battery. The HTC One M8 became available online at 1 p.m. EST on Tuesday, starting at $199 with a two-year contract from AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile or Verizon Wireless. It will be available in Gunmetal Grey, Artic Silver and Amber Gold color options.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

But if you look a little closer, you’ll quickly realize that HTC improved the new edition of their flagship in various areas. Our comparison shows these differences, as well as the similarities.\n\n© AndroidPIT\n\nDesign\n\nThe design similarities are uncanny, having only been slightly changed in that the original form language and the aluminium body were reused. In this case of design, the expression ‘the devil is in the details’ really comes into effect: the chassis is now made of a unibody crafted from one single piece of aluminium which holds the hardware and display of the device.\n\nThe chassis on the new M8 is super similar to the original smartphone. © AndroidPIT\n\nIn total, the chassis was given more rounded edges, providing it with a much softer feel, despite the cold metallic body. The controls and ports were also slightly changed: the power button was moved from the left to the right side, while the headphone port is now underneath, and volume controls went from two individual buttons to a rocker.\n\nThe headphone jack has now moved to the bottom of the HTC One (M8). / © AndroidPIT\n\nSetup\n\nHere things get even more interesting: the new One (M8) has a micro SD slot, which supports cards with up to 128 GB. The stereo speakers on the front side of the device remain the same, as well as the infrared sensor. What’s new is the dual camera on the back-side that allows for post-editing of the focal point in pictures. The front camera now has 5MP instead of 2, which is more than the main camera. Again, HTC has implemented its UltraPixel Technology, which creates better pictures despite a lower resolution.\n\nThe power button switched sides in comparison to the older HTC One (M7). © AndroidPIT\n\nDisplay\n\nThe display got bigger, 5-inches instead of 4.7. The resolution remains the same with 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (Full HD). The pixel density has therefore lower, but is more than sufficient. Instead of two capacitive buttons under the display, the new One (M8) has three on-screen buttons that serve the purpose of navigation. The wide bar sporting the HTC logo is on the new M8 just like the HTC One (M7), yet no longer serves a purpose, therefore taking up space uselessly.\n\nThere are now on-screen buttons, though the HTC-logo sporting bar is still there, and has no use. / © AndroidPIT\n\nHardware\n\nThe new HTC One (M8) has received the newest and fastest in processors, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, which ticks at 2.3 GHz, complemented by 2GB of RAM, just like the older HTC One. Finally, the battery with 2,600 mAh offers slightly more juice than the original (2,300 mAh).\n\nSoftware\n\nThe most important functions of the new HTC One (M8) are the new motion gestures that HTC has clustered under the new term ‘’Motion Launcher’’. Via predetermined swipe gestures, the user can wake up the handset from standby mode and have it open directly to BlinkFeed or the last opened app. Double tapping on the display will turn on the device. When the One (M8) is held upright and the volume rocker is pressed, this will start the camera. Otherwise, not much has changed. Sense 6 will soon be available for all HTC One devices, though Motion Launch will remain exclusive to the M8.\n\nHTC One M7 vs HTC One M8\n\nHTC One (M7) HTC One (M8) System Android 4.4.2 (update), Sense 5.5 (update to Sense 6.0 coming this summer) Android 4.4.2, Sense 6 Display 4.7-inch, LCD, 1.920 x 1.080 Pixel, 468 ppi 5-inch, LCD, 1,920 x 1,080 Pixel, 441 ppi Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 600, 4 core, 1.7 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, 4 core, 2.3 gigahertz RAM 2 gigabyte 2 gigabyte Interneral storage 16 / 32 gigabyte 16 / 32 gigabyte + microSD (up to 128 GB) Battery 2,300 mAh 2,600 mAh Camera UltraPixel Technology, 1/3"" sensor, f2.0 aperture, 28 mm wide-angle UltraPixel Technology with a second camera for depth, 1/3"" sensor, f2.0 aperture, 28 mm wide angle, Dual-LED Front camera 2 MP, Weitwinkel 5 MP, Weitwinkel Connectivity LTE Cat 3, HSPA+, Bluetooth 4.0, IrDA, NFC, USB 2.0 LTE Cat 3, HSPA+, Bluetooth 4.0, IrDA, NFC, USB 2.0 Dimensions 137.4 x 68.2 x 9.3 mm 146.4 x 70.6 x 9.35 mm Weight 143 grams 160 grams SIM card Micro-SIM Nano-SIM Price (UVP) 519 USD (Amazon 26.03.2014) 649.99 USD (Amazon 26.03.2014)\n\nWhat do you think of the differences between the new and old HTC One models?

48257,http://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/03/five-attributes-htc-one-m8-offers-galaxy-s5.html,technology,"[""While everyone begins to let yesterdays HTC event and unveiling settle in and we attempt to collect our thoughts over everything we have taken in, we have looked at all the HTC One M8 has to offer in contrast to this years other most likely candidate for most popular flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S5. We have come up with five things that you won't find in the Galaxy S5 that HTC can offer you with their newest device. So, if you find yourself at odds with an impossible decision and want some help trying to weigh out what you should choose for your next device, maybe these five things can help to play a part.\n\nFirst off is the most obvious and probably one of the most coveted of the HTC One M8 and last years HTC One, the Boomsound stereo speakers. This particular feature really helps to amplify the audio experience one can have with just about anything on the device that gives off sound. You'll experience richer, more explosive audio for things like movies, games, and of course music. Boomsound is highly revered as one of the biggest reasons people love the HTC One devices, because the speakers are stereo and placed on the front, so the audio is shooting out directly at you. Next up is one you'll most certainly hear from a lot of people and that's the build quality. One of the other big reasons people have loved the HTC One devices is because of the premium feel of the design. While this doesn't matter to everyone, plenty of people really appreciate the nature of having a really nice looking device. The all metal body and brushed metal finish with rounded edges and corners of the HTC One M8 is one not to be forgotten.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe HTC One M8 also has a more true to life color quality within the display. It still uses a slightly higher color range than the standard sRGB color space, which is what gives its display those really eye popping vibrant colors, but when compared to the AMOLED display used in the Galaxy S5, it's more accurate and still manages to pull off looking exceptional. The last two things you won't find within the Galaxy S5 are the seamless uniformity of the Sense 6.0 user interface,(Touchwiz has been improved over previous versions of the UI, but it still lacks the elegance that Sense 6.0 has managed to elevate to)and the refocus feature effect for photos that is found within the HTC One M8 duo camera. The value of these features and specs may be more preference, but they are all things the Galaxy S5 lacks. With that said, either device could still provide a stellar experience to users, and the Galaxy S5 will undoubtedly have plenty of happy fans as it will have its own set of compelling attributes. So what say you tech lovers? HTC One M8 or Galaxy S5?"", ""We have come up with five things that you won't find in the Galaxy S5 that HTC can offer you with their newest device.\nFirst off is the most obvious and probably one of the most coveted of the HTC One M8 and last years HTC One, the Boomsound stereo speakers.\nAdvertisementThe HTC One M8 also has a more true to life color quality within the display.\nThe value of these features and specs may be more preference, but they are all things the Galaxy S5 lacks.\nHTC One M8 or Galaxy S5?""]"

It’s time to look at some first impressions.\n\nHardware and features\n\nThe HTC One M8 is a 4G Android smartphone running HTC’s proprietary Sense interface.\n\nThe new device is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 quad-core processor, and includes NFC, 2 gigabytes of RAM, along with 16 or 32 gigabytes of storage, which is expandable to 128 gigabytes through a microSD card.\n\nAs an introductory offer, HTC is also offering 65 gigabytes of cloud storage on Google Drive free for two years.\n\nThe device also includes a 5-inch full-HD display, with a resolution of 1080p, a 5-megapixel rear camera with a second camera to capture depth information, and a 5-megapixel front camera.\n\nThe device also supports DLNA wireless streaming media, and includes a micro-USB 2.0 (five-pin) port with mobile high-definition video link (MHL), which allows for HDMI video output with a special cable.\n\nAside from outright purchase, it is available for pre-order from Optus, Telstra and Vodafone, with Optus promising delivery from April 1.\n\nOptus is offering the device for $23 per month on a $35 plan, Vodafone is offering it for $10 per month on a $65 plan, while Telstra is offering it starting from $81 per month.\n\nWhat’s the consensus?\n\nGordon Kelly at Forbes is impressed by the bigger screen on the One M8, especially when compared to its predecessor:\n\nThe most obvious is the switch from a 4.7in to 5in 1080p Full HD screen which brings the M8 in line with the LG Nexus 5 (5in) and closer to the Samsung Galaxy S5 (5.1in) and LG G2 (5.2in). HTC is keeping quiet about the screen technology inside the M8, but with the bar already raised high the handset matches the razor sharp images of its rivals and appears to have better colour saturation and even wider viewing angles than the already excellent M7.\n\nAnother key new feature of the device that impresses Kelly is its ‘Dot View’ case:\n\nI’m not a great fan of cases being of the ‘just be careful’ mindset, but HTC has produced a genuinely useful case for the M8 with the ‘Dot View’. It is a somewhat descriptive name because the Dot View case does exactly that: show useful at-a-glance information by lighting up the dots in its material.\n\nFunctionality is limited at this stage, but a user can double tap it to see the time and weather and incoming calls light up. Cleverly you can answer these calls without needing to open the case as it will react to gestures meaning you can take a call on the move while still protecting your phone front and back.\n\nAndroid Community is impressed with the build quality, which is one of the strong points you’d expect from a HTC device:\n\nThe overall build quality of the HTC One (M8) is solid. Of course, those who have played with the previous generation One will likely not find that at all surprising. To that point though, HTC made mention about how this One (M8) sports more metal in the frame. Last year’s model was a housing made of 70 percent metal and this year HTC stepped it up to 90 percent. The One (M8) housing wraps all the way around the sides — right up to the edge of the display. The back is then slightly curved, and sporting a brushed look which gives an overall solid appearance.\n\nFinally, while SiliconRepublic is impressed by the device’s dual-camera technology, it remains somewhat limited – especially until third party developers take advantage of it:\n\nPlaying with the Duo Camera function on the HTC One M8 is something all users will do straight out of the box. Refocusing images after they’ve been captured is easy with UFocus, though, as you can see in the example below, sharpness deteriorates even when a short distance separates you from the farthest subject. I suspect that the performance of UFocus will ultimately depend on the quality of the original image.\n\nForegrounder effects, which apply cartoonish filters to the background only, are juvenile, but with the Duo Camera API opened up to developers, there’s potential for this feature to do much more. That’s where the excitement lies.\n\nShould I get one?\n\nIf you’re use a HTC and are looking to upgrade, it’s time to put in your pre-order. It appears the Taiwanese smartphone maker has delivered a solid improvement on its previous flagship smartphone.', 'However, despite its reputation for quality designs and good build quality, its early lead was overtaken by South Korean tech giant Samsung.\nThis week, the company announced a new flagship smartphone called the HTC One M8, and the company desperately needs it to be a success.\nHardware and featuresThe HTC One M8 is a 4G Android smartphone running HTC’s proprietary Sense interface.\nAs an introductory offer, HTC is also offering 65 gigabytes of cloud storage on Google Drive free for two years.\nAndroid Community is impressed with the build quality, which is one of the strong points you’d expect from a HTC device:The overall build quality of the HTC One (M8) is solid.']"

48269,http://blog.programmableweb.com/2014/03/26/htc-releases-apis-for-new-one-smartphone/,technology,"['HTC announced the One smartphone this week, its new flagship device for the year. The One is a sequel to last year\'s well-liked smartphone and ratchets up the sex appeal with an all-aluminum design. Its feature set, which includes a luscious 5-inch HD display, zippy four-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, and shiny metallic colors, will let it compete well against similar phones from other manufacturers. HTC believes developers can plan a role in the One\'s success, too, with new APIs for the camera and BlinkFeed.\n\nOne of the key features of the One is its Duo-Camera. The One actually has three cameras, but there are two cameras on the back that work together. HTC calls this setup a Duo-Camera. The main imager is a 4-megapixel shooter with pixels that are 300% bigger than ""normal"" pixels. HTC insists that these ultrapixels let in more light and result in better images. The second camera rates 2-megapixels, but it doesn\'t actually record image data with the camera fires. Instead, it is assisting with focus and collecting point-of-view data. This is critical.\n\nHTC gave the One some really neat photo-editing features - two of which rely on this secondary data collected by the One\'s second camera. For example, one gallery tool can be used to add a 3D effect to images. When the images are tiled side-to-side, you can see around objects in the image. It\'s a cool trick. The point-of-view data also helps with a tool called UFocus, which is adept at helping change the depth-of-field in any given image. (Sort of like a Lytro camera.)\n\nOne of the new APIs being released by HTC pertains to the Duo-Camera. Developers can use the API to build apps that take advantage of the One\'s two-camera configuration. Think how much more fun Instagram would be if it could let people post 3D images of their cat, or lunch, or drunken selves at a party? A bevy of existing apps could benefit from the new APIs, but it\'s more likely independent developers will be the ones to flex their creative muscles here.\n\nThe second API from HTC pertains to BlinkFeed. BlinkFeed is HTC\'s social news reader that is built into its Sense 6.0 user interface. BlinkFeed can be set to pull content from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as innumerable news sources. It wraps all the content up in an easy-to-digest digital magazine that One owners can snack on throughout the day. HTC is releasing an API for BlinkFeed because it hopes to improve the content offering to owners of the One. The APIs will allow developers to hook directly into BlinkFeed so One owners can more easily add that content to their feed.\n\nThese new APIs are a welcome offering from HTC, though it raises the question of just how much developer support a single phone can muster. Granted, Apple has tons of developer support even though it only makes one phone, but it has scale that HTC currently does not.', ""HTC announced the One smartphone this week, its new flagship device for the year.\nHTC believes developers can plan a role in the One's success, too, with new APIs for the camera and BlinkFeed.\nThe second camera rates 2-megapixels, but it doesn't actually record image data with the camera fires.\nHTC gave the One some really neat photo-editing features - two of which rely on this secondary data collected by the One's second camera.\nThese new APIs are a welcome offering from HTC, though it raises the question of just how much developer support a single phone can muster.""]"

For a little more context, we spoke with Tim McDonough, VP of Marketing at Qualcomm, who said that the chipset manufacturer began collaborating with HTC very early on. Qualcomm needed to build several new features into its roadmap to ensure that it could keep up with the M8\'s hefty imaging requirements.

The S5 is expected to begin shipping in April, with a starting price – assuming you sign a two-year contract – of $200.\n\nThat\'s on par with the HTC One.\n\nAlso on par: The KitKat operating system; the 5-inch display (to be fair, the S5 gets a 5.1-inch display, a fraction of an inch larger than the 5-inch display on the HTC One); and the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. In fact, the major differences between the S5 and the One will lie in each device\'s respective design, and the user interface layered over the Android OS: For the One, it\'s HTC Sense, and for the S5, it\'s Samsung\'s TouchWiz.\n\nAs Elyse Betters at Pocket-lint points out, there\'s also the question of connectivity.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

The latter smart phone obviously has more connectivity options, though it is missing nano SIM.""\n\nSo which phone is the better bet? Well, we suspect that for many users, it\'ll come down to personal preference: the Galaxy S5, with its friendly, plastic look, or the HTC One, with its sleek, industrial aesthetic. And it\'ll come down to momentum: The Galaxy S5 comes on the heels of the top-selling Galaxy S4, while the 2013 HTC One seemed to peak early, and then struggled to attract attention with consumers.', 'This week, HTC introduced the 2014 One, its latest flagship smart phone.\nInstead, it\'s the Samsung Galaxy S5, the latest in the long line of very popular Galaxy smart phones.\n""The Samsung Galaxy S5 features support for Wi-Fi, NFC, 4G LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, USB 3.0, and IrLED.\nWell, we suspect that for many users, it\'ll come down to personal preference: the Galaxy S5, with its friendly, plastic look, or the HTC One, with its sleek, industrial aesthetic.\nAnd it\'ll come down to momentum: The Galaxy S5 comes on the heels of the top-selling Galaxy S4, while the 2013 HTC One seemed to peak early, and then struggled to attract attention with consumers.']"

The M8 has a 1080p 5-inch display, quad-core Snapdragon processor, and 4.1 “UltraPixel” camera with 2MP focus sensor. All of these feature would work with Windows Phone just fine.

Is the HTC One M8 fairing any better? Or should you rather opt for the HTC Advance to save you plenty of bucks in case your device gets broken or damaged? Here are the details from HTC One M8 teardown.\n\nHTC One M8 teardown:\n\nThe experts at iFixit, the company which curates DIY guides and teardown videos to help professionals repair the devices, had given last year\'s One a meager 1 in the ranking. It ranks the devices on a repairability scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the easiest to repair and 1 being the hardest to manage. The factors that affect any device\'s repairability scale include irregular screws, glued components, or a very tight fighting to manage the device.\n\nIn the HTC One M8 teardown video, iFixit shares the situation inside the brand new HTC One (M8),\n\n""The display assembly cannot be replaced without tunneling through the entire phone. This makes one of most common repairs, a damaged screen, very difficult to accomplish.""\n\nLast year\'s HTC One (M7) had got only a 1 on iFixit\'s scale. If this gives you any relief, the latest HTC One (M8) gets a 2 from iFixit teardown experts. This is only a slight change which is because of the durable build. Nothing inside the device makes it an easy device for repairing. While we already did a drop, scratch and water test to see if the smartphone could sustain a few hits here and there; iFixit\'s One M8 teardown would show you what to expect realistically when you have a broken or damaged HTC One M8.\n\nThe experts noted that One\'s rear case is very difficult to remove without damaging it. The battery is also very difficult to access as it is glued to the main board. IFixit also notes that the repair work is made harder by the use of copious amounts of tape, adhesive, and copper shielding.\n\nHTC Advantage:\n\nThese findings confirm that getting an HTC Advantage warranty plan might just prove to be a good idea. This warranty program is being offered by HTC in US and will repair you a cracked or broken display screen within the first six months of usage. Replacing screen of the latest smartphones is one of the most costly repair operations. It is advised to get yourself this warranty package to get a free screen replacement. HTC is trying to make the deal more palatable with a 50 GB of free Drive storage and a guarantee that you will receive latest Android updates for the next two years.\n\n- Relevant HTC One news and guides:', 'Teardown experts had found HTC One M7 of 2013 one of the hardest to fix due to various design factors.\nHere are the details from HTC One M8 teardown.\nIn the HTC One M8 teardown video, iFixit shares the situation inside the brand new HTC One (M8),""The display assembly cannot be replaced without tunneling through the entire phone.\nIf this gives you any relief, the latest HTC One (M8) gets a 2 from iFixit teardown experts.\nHTC Advantage:These findings confirm that getting an HTC Advantage warranty plan might just prove to be a good idea.']"

48300,http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/25/htc-announces-the-new-one/,technology,"['Under the hood, you\'re looking at a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 801 and 2GB of RAM. Basically this phone will laugh in the face of almost any task you throw at it. Edit photos, put together video montages, play taxing 3D games -- this thing should churn through it all with ease. As far as storage goes, you\'ve got two options: either 16GB or 32GB. But if you feel that\'s not enough, there\'s a microSD slot for adding up to 128GB more. Plus, Google is throwing in 50GB of storage on Drive for two years, replacing Dropbox. Unless you\'re truly abusive to your gadgets, there\'s no way you should run out of room to store stuff. A sizable 2,600mAh battery keeps the whole thing chugging along for an estimated 20 hours of talk time or, with the new Extreme power saving mode enabled, 40 days of standby. Regardless, it\'s a nice, but smallish boost from the 2,300mAh one found in last year\'s model. And, of course, the expected set of radios and sensors are on board, including Bluetooth 4.0, dual-band 802.11ac WiFi, AWS compatibility, LTE, NFC, an accelerometer, gyroscope and barometer.\n\nOf course, the two big unique features from last year\'s model make a return here: the front-facing stereo speakers with BoomSound and the UltraPixel camera around back. But both have been given significant upgrades for 2014. The speakers are connected to a new dedicated amplifier and a more powerful DSP chip. They\'re also seated deeper in the phone\'s chassis, which should lead to richer, louder audio with better-defined low-end sound. The UltraPixel shooter around back is, for all intents and purposes, the same exact camera as last year. The sensor is the same 4-megapixel backside-illuminated one with giant 2µm pixels, but there\'s a new imaging processor attached and HTC has ditched the optical image stabilization tech. But, it\'s also added a second camera to the back in what it\'s calling a Duo Camera array. Truth be told, the second ""camera"" isn\'t actually a camera in the traditional sense; it\'s a depth sensor. It allows the One to perform all sorts of neat tricks especially in post processing, such as blurring backgrounds or changing the focus point like a Lytro.\n\nNo new flagship phone would be complete without a significant software update, and HTC isn\'t going to let you down. At its core, the One is running Android KitKat 4.4, which means it\'s got all of the latest enhancements straight from Google. On top of that, however, it\'s running Sense 6.0, which includes BlinkFeed and a heavy focus on themes. Several of its primary UI elements have been given subtle redesigns that bring a more modern and open look. Perhaps most exciting though, BlinkFeed has been opened up to developers, who will be able to push information to your feed. For example, Foursquare will be able to publish lunch recommendations or Fitbit can send you activity-tracking data. Interestingly, the company has also broken several of its proprietary apps free of its firmware, such as Zoe, which will find itself on the Play Store soon. That will make it much easier to push updates to users, which means features will be available much quicker.\n\nMost of the tweaks are relatively small, but Motion Launch is a pretty significant new feature. When the phone senses movement, it ""listens"" for prompts to launch particular apps or actions. For example, swiping right on the screen will take you straight to BlinkFeed; holding the volume rocker while turning the phone into landscape mode launches the camera; and you can answer a call simply by putting the phone to your ear -- all without unlocking it first. The Dot View case, seen above, extends those features, by allowing you to tap the case twice to receive notifications without turning on the phone\'s display.\n\nThe new HTC One will be available in three colors (gunmetal gray, glacial silver and amber gold) starting today, March 25th.\n\nRichard Lai and Brad Molen contributed to this report.', 'Of course, the two big unique features from last year\'s model make a return here: the front-facing stereo speakers with BoomSound and the UltraPixel camera around back.\nBut, it\'s also added a second camera to the back in what it\'s calling a Duo Camera array.\nTruth be told, the second ""camera"" isn\'t actually a camera in the traditional sense; it\'s a depth sensor.\nNo new flagship phone would be complete without a significant software update, and HTC isn\'t going to let you down.\nThe new HTC One will be available in three colors (gunmetal gray, glacial silver and amber gold) starting today, March 25th.']"

The phone has been out for a few days now and we’ve published our M8 review so we’re a lot more familiar with the device, but there hasn’t been a lot of news on the case side. We spotted cases from Qmadix, but can’t find a retailer for the One M8 model. Also, we’ve gotten information on Incipio’s offerings, which were added to the end of the article.\n\nThe HTC One M8 landed with much fanfare from HTC’s dedicated base of aluminum Android phone supporters. The original HTC One, now known as the M7, was known for its excellent build quality and the craftsmanship of its metal shell. The One M8 is no different, in fact it improved on the M7 in a number of ways. This leaves owners in an interesting situation: do you get this beautiful device and protect its outer shell with a case while hiding away that wonderful aluminum hairline finish, or do you boldly leave the case at home, living each day to its fullest, with your M8 unprotected from hazards of everyday life?\n\nIf you do opt for a case — and we in no way blame your for it — there are many good ones out there despite the fact that the phone is barely a few hours old. This article intents to round up the best options available and help you find the best One (M8) case for you. And now, on to the HTC One cases…\n\nHTC One M8 Dot View case – $50 ()\n\nCase-Mate Barely There clear plastic case – $25 ()\n\nCase-Mate Naked Tough – $35 ()\n\nOtterBox Commuter series – $40 ()\n\nCruzerlite Sline TPU case – $6 ()\n\nCruzerlite Bugdroid case – $13 ()\n\nSpigen Case Slim Armor – $25 ()\n\nIncipio DualPro – $30 ()\n\nIncipio Feather – $25 ()\n\nIncipio Watson folio – $45 ()\n\nOut of these cases the best of the bunch — at least so far — is the Dot View case. This HTC-made case features a hard plastic back and a soft-touch rubber flap. The front piece is perforated so that when the case is closed and you double-tap the display, the screen will brighten in a pixelated pattern. This will show off the time, the weather, any notifications that you might have, and if you missed any calls. If you get a call you can see the contact information for the person on the other end as well as accept the call, all with the case closed.\n\nAs you can see in the video, the Dot View case is quite cool. It’s also comfortable, relatively low profile, and has a hard, protective back. At $50 the Dot View isn’t cheap, but it uses nice materials and it’s genuinely something that adds a coolness factor to the smartphone, which is incredibly rare for a case. And because you can receive calls and see alerts with the case closed, it’s pretty useful as well. The Dot View is available in a dark grey and then a variety of colors, though it’s not clear if all the colors will be sold in the US.\n\nThe other cases I demoed — the OtterBox and Case-Mate — were much less impressive. The Case-Mate is a clear plastic shell that’s super light, but it’s also flimsy and has no bells or whistles. The fact that it’s perfectly clear is great, but once it picks up a few scuffs the crystal-like transparency will be gone and you’ll be left with a translucent piece of plastic. The main benefit here is that you’ll be able to see the M8’s aluminum finish while keeping the back and sides of the phone relatively protected. We haven’t seen it yet, but Case-Mate’s Naked Tough seems like a better option.\n\nThe OtterBox is, as always, the case for people who want maximum protection. It doesn’t have a front flap but it features a dual-layer design that pairs a soft, shock-absorbing rubber on the inside with hard plastic on the outside. And the OtterBox’s hard plastic is a whole different level than that found on the HTC Dot View or the Case-Mate, as it’s sturdier and clearly designed to take some punishment. That said the OtterBox case is bulky and isn’t something you’d want to use day-to-day, unless you have a nasty habit of breaking phones. Also, with this case on the One M8 you might has well have a phone made of plastic or possibly some form of scrap metal because the hairline aluminum will go completely unappreciated.\n\nAfter these, you have all the other standard options available. The companies that fall into this category of good-enough products include players like Speck, Incipio, and Spigen. We haven’t tested out any of these yet, but they are normally perfectly acceptable options, plus there is the added benefit that you might be able to find at design that you liked in the past and buy it again, such as the Cruzerlite Bugdroid that turned out to be a fine Nexus 5 case.\n\nThe big thing you’ll want to keep in mind is that you’ll want to double check and make sure that any case you buy is for the “HTC One M8” or the “HTC One 2014” as there are still HTC One M7 cases on the market and the cases are not compatible with one another.\n\nAs mentioned above, Incipio has a few cool looking cases available. If you are in search of a tougher case then the DualPro looks like a great pick. It combines a hard exterior with soft interior to provide maximum protection for the One M8. It’s a similar concept to the OtterBox, but in a more streamlined design. If you want dual-layer protection but you don’t want to lose your aluminum look-and-feel, you can spend an extra $5 and upgrade to the DualPro Shine(pictured to the right).\n\nIf you want something simpler than the DualPro Incipio offers the NGP, a simple soft case, and the Feather. Both are basic and streamlined, so they won’t add much bulk to your M8. The Feather is a hard case that snaps onto the M8, which is also available in a Shine (brushed aluminum-looking) version.\n\nThe case above is the Watson Folio from Incipo. It’s a $45 folio-style case, which means it has a pocket and flap built into the front. This will not only provide protection to that 1080p display, it will also fold into a kickstand and act as a wallet replacement. So, while $45 isn’t cheap, the Watson offers a lot and it’s still cheaper than the Dot View.', 'Update – 4/1/14 – The hunt for the best HTC One M8 case is still on.\nThis article intents to round up the best options available and help you find the best One (M8) case for you.\nAnd now, on to the HTC One cases…HTC One M8 Dot View case – $50 ()Case-Mate Barely There clear plastic case – $25 ()Case-Mate Naked Tough – $35 ()OtterBox Commuter series – $40 ()Cruzerlite Sline TPU case – $6 ()Cruzerlite Bugdroid case – $13 ()Spigen Case Slim Armor – $25 ()Incipio DualPro – $30 ()Incipio Feather – $25 ()Incipio Watson folio – $45 ()Out of these cases the best of the bunch — at least so far — is the Dot View case.\nAs you can see in the video, the Dot View case is quite cool.\nThe Feather is a hard case that snaps onto the M8, which is also available in a Shine (brushed aluminum-looking) version.']"

The M8 One features a bigger screen, a longer battery life, louder speakers and, most significantly, new motion sensors that reduce the need to actually press buttons on your phone.

48307,http://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/03/benchmarks-show-asian-model-htc-one-m8-scores-higher.html,technology,"[""Yesterday we got to see just how the HTC One M8 stacked up on the benchmark tests against some of the other top flagship devices through various benchmarks including graphics, performance, browser, etc. The only problem is that the tests were run on the US model of the HTC One M8 only. This isn't really a problem, but it lacks the results from testing the model of the HTC One M8 that is heading to the Asian markets, which has a slightly higher clocked Snapdragon 801 processor. Needless to say, we thought the results might be different, which is why we wanted to see how it tested as well, for comparison purposes. Sure enough, the processor did have an effect on how the results came out, and it seems the model headed for Asian markets is somewhat more powerful.\n\nFor those who are unaware, the model of the M8 that is headed to the US, Europe markets has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor clocked at 2.3 GHz, while the model headed to the Chinese and Asian markets houses a processor that comes clocking in at 2.5 GHz. This may not seem like a huge advantage or a huge change, but lets see how much if any differences lie between the two in regards to benchmark tests. Both benchmark tests seem to have been run by eprice, and they do test both models of the phone that have different variants of the Snapdragon 801 inside. First you can see that the test score results for the model of the M8 that is bound for the Asian markets comes out with a score of 35,964, while the model bound here for the US and other markets comes in with a score of 29,431. Now we can see that both benchmarks are run through the same tests, using AnTuTu benchmarks to get the scores.\n\nAs we said in yesterdays report about the benchmarks with the US model, benchmarks only mean so much. While the scores talk a big game and seem to provide some stellar results for those who would be using this type of device, there are many factors in which this could change for consumers. Real world results could be very different, or they could be relatively the same but the differences in performance could be unnoticeable. What do you think? Does the higher clocked processor give the Asian variant of the HTC One M8 a slight edge, or does it really matter in the end?\n\nAdvertisement"", ""The only problem is that the tests were run on the US model of the HTC One M8 only.\nThis isn't really a problem, but it lacks the results from testing the model of the HTC One M8 that is heading to the Asian markets, which has a slightly higher clocked Snapdragon 801 processor.\nNow we can see that both benchmarks are run through the same tests, using AnTuTu benchmarks to get the scores.\nAs we said in yesterdays report about the benchmarks with the US model, benchmarks only mean so much.\nDoes the higher clocked processor give the Asian variant of the HTC One M8 a slight edge, or does it really matter in the end?""]"
48308,http://www.longisland.com/news/03-26-14/htc-launches-its-new-android-flagship-the-one-m8.html,technology,"['Tech & Science, National & World News\n\nBy Christian Abbatecola Published: March 26 2014\n\nThe new iteration of HTC’s critically acclaimed smartphone is already available in store at Verizon and comes with a few improvements over its predecessor.\n\nHTC turned a lot of heads last year when it launched the One (M7)—a sleek, high-end Android smartphone with a unibody metal design curved to fit comfortably in the user’s hand—and is looking to up the ante with this year’s successor, the all new One (M8).\n\nThe new One keeps the metal design from last year while upping the screen size from 4.7” to an even 5”, and maintaining a full HD 1080p screen protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 3. Amateur photographers will be able to make the most of that screen when they use the new Duo Camera.\n\nLike last year’s model the new camera features an “Ultrapixel” lens, but this time around HTC added a second lens which acts a depth sensor and allows for some fun effects. Pictures can be edited so that the focus is shifted from the foreground to the background, sections can be blurred or unblurred, and separate images can be cropped together with ease. The front-facing camera has been upgraded as well from 2.1 megapixels to 5 MP, allowing for crystal clear video chatting (or some very detailed “selfies”).\n\nHTC is launching the One (M8) on the latest version of Android (4.4 KitKat) with the sixth generation of its Sense user interface. BlinkFeed—the service which allows owners to put notifications from their in-box, text messages, sports scores, and all their favorite social media platforms into a single easily viewable place—has made a return, but Android purists will be happy to know that it is no longer the default home screen.\n\nA set of gesture controls, dubbed Motion Launch, has also been added with the new One. Users can now answer calls without swiping or pressing any buttons simply by raising the phone to their ears, and they can ignore one by flipping the phone on its face. Double tapping the screen will wake the phone up from sleep, and turning it on its side and pressing the volume key will skip straight to the camera app.\n\nUnder the hood the new One is packing a 2.3 GHz quad-core processor (providing a little extra pep over last year’s 1.7 GHz processor), 2 gigabytes of RAM, and a choice of 16 or 32 GB of storage space. The initial memory is a downgrade from last year’s model, but HTC has added support for microSD cards which will now allow users to tack on additional 128 GB of memory if they feel the need.\n\nThe battery has also gotten boost from 2300 mAh to 2600, and while that might not be quite as hefty as Motorola’s Droid MAXX or even the Galaxy S5 the phone can still provide long lasting power through its new Extreme Power Saving mode. When enabled, this feature cuts off non-essential functions and shuts down background apps, allowing the device to last an estimated 15 hours on a mere 5% charge. It’s not a feature that the average user will want to have on all the time, and it won’t be available until HTC sends out an update for US owners, but it could help a person in a jam when there aren’t any chargers around.\n\nThough the HTC One (M8) was only announced yesterday, it is already available through Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint for order online. Those hoping to snag one for themselves in-person will likely have to head to a Verizon store, as the carrier exclusive in-store availability through April 9. Verizon is currently selling the 32 GB version for $199 on-contract.\n\n[Source: HTC]', 'Amateur photographers will be able to make the most of that screen when they use the new Duo Camera.\nLike last year’s model the new camera features an “Ultrapixel” lens, but this time around HTC added a second lens which acts a depth sensor and allows for some fun effects.\nHTC is launching the One (M8) on the latest version of Android (4.4 KitKat) with the sixth generation of its Sense user interface.\nThough the HTC One (M8) was only announced yesterday, it is already available through Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint for order online.\n[Source: HTC]']"

Optimizing existing support organizations for the digital world can be tricky if you don\'t have the right tools. Luckily, you can get started with your transformational journey as soon as this comprehensive guide hits your inbox.\n\nDownload eBook.\n\nAsk the Internet.\n\nThat\'s the pitch in HTC\'s TV ads for its new flagship smartphone, the HTC One M8. It\'s a pitch that hopes to acquire by word of mouth what HTC was unable to get for its predecessor: consumer mindshare.\n\n""The challenge for any vendor outside of Samsung and Apple in the North American market is to get on the radar screen,"" Gartner Research Vice President for Mobility Van L. Baker told TechNewsWorld.\n\n""HTC did that once in the past, but faded rapidly, which points to the challenges of staying on top of the market if you\'re not a Samsung or Apple,"" he observed.\n\n""The HTC One is a good product, but it isn\'t getting any significant share,"" he added. ""That shows how tough it is to rise above the noise level in the market.""\n\nNot for Everyone\n\nIn its TV ads for the M8, HTC is emphasizing the distinctiveness of the model.\n\n""At HTC, they don\'t make phones for everyone,"" says a black-clad pitchman with an English accent, ""just those who demand more."" That attitude is evident in the M8.\n\nThe new smartphone, which will be offered in gray, silver or gold, is encased in aluminum -- most other smartphones have plastic casings. In fact, HTC has increased the amount of metal surface in the M series from 70 percent to 90 percent. That makes the M8 heavier than its rivals, though -- 5.6 ounces, compared to 5 ounces for the Samsung Galaxy S5 and 4 ounces for the iPhone 5s.\n\nHigh industrial design standards are maintained in the latest model, too. For example, the M8 has a curved back that fits more comfortably in the hand than a flat surface.\n\n""Just the look and feel -- how it feels in the hand -- is far advanced from some of the Android devices out there,"" Chris Jones, vice president and principal analyst with Canalys, told TechNewsWorld.\n\nThe M8 has a larger screen than its predecessor the M7 -- 5 inches compared to 4.7 inches -- but the same resolution as the M7 -- 1080 x 1920 pixels -- which is finer than the iPhone (1136 x 640) but not as fine as the Galaxy S5 (1921 x 1080).\n\nAlthough the M8\'s display at 441 ppi isn\'t as dense as the M7\'s, it\'s still denser than the Samsung (431 ppi) and Apple (326 ppi) models.\n\nCamera Tricks\n\nWith the M8, HTV has boosted the unit\'s front-facing camera to 5 megapixels.\n\n""That\'s in recognition of the growing importance of the selfie,"" Ross Rubin, principal analyst with Reticle Research, told TechNewsWorld.\n\nAt the back of the M8, there\'s a smart LED flash that\'s designed to avoid ""hot spots"" in flash pictures. There are also two cameras -- one to capture depth-of-field information for a shot -- and a 4.1-MP main shooter. The depth-of-field camera allows shutterbugs to perform some photographic tricks after taking a shot, such as moving the focal point in a scene, similar to what can be done with a Lytro light field camera.\n\nWhile other smartphone makers have chosen to go with 5-MP or greater rear-facing cameras, HTC has chosen to trade fewer pixels for bigger pixels.\n\n""It\'s fully competitve with other phones,"" independent mobile analyst Michael Morgan told TechNewsWorld. ""The sensor is bigger. With a bigger sensor, you have better light sensitivity.""\n\nFor users who like to pump up the volume on their phones, HTC has boosted the output from the M8\'s BoomSound speakers 25 percent.\n\nAs Samsung did with its S5, HTC has added an extreme power feature to the M8 to increase the battery life of the unit as it reaches the end of a charge. For example, entering extreme power-saving mode with 20 percent power left on the battery will extend the life to 60 hours of standby time; at 10 percent, 30 hours; and at 5 percent, 15 hours.\n\nHardware Hard to Beat\n\nSome useful gesture support has been added to the M8 by HTC. For instance, double-tapping the phone will turn it on, and if you look at the caller ID of an incoming call on the display, you can raise the phone to your ear and answer the call without any taps or other fuss.\n\nThe M8, which runs on Android KitKat 4.4.2, has 2 GB of RAM and an optional 16 GB or 32 GB of onboard storage. It also has a new microSD slot that can add up to 128 GB of storage to the device.\n\nPlenty of processing muscle is provided to the M8 through its Qualcomm SnapDragon 801 quad core processor with each core running at 2.3 GHz.\n\nAs with the M7, the M8 is starting to garner good notices from analysts and reviewers, but it remains to be seen if the word-of-mouth campaign it\'s encouraging in its marketing for the phone will help it escape the fate of its predecessor.\n\n""It is up against some formidable competitors; however, from a device standpoint, the new HTC One is hard to beat,"" observed Canalys\'s Jones.\n\n""HTC must create the demand for the device through excellent marketing,"" he said, ""and then retail staff must be able to demonstrate its key features.""\n\nJohn Mello is a freelance technology writer and contributor to Chief Security Officer magazine.

While it\'s safe to consider a handful of the rumors as nothing more but conjecture, quite a bit of the information flying at high speed across the web will more than likely come to fruition at Tuesday\'s unveiling.\n\nLast month the Taiwan-based cell phone manufacturer announced its plan to unveil its new smartphone on March 25 instead of revealing it in Spain at the annual Mobile World Congress exhibit.\n\nSo many rumors have been leaked about the HTC One 2 or One Up that it\'s like getting to see your presents unwrapped days before Christmas but without the joy of getting to unwrap it and appreciating the gifts yourself.\n\nAlthough so much hype has been built up around the new device the audience that will be attending the London and New York events Tuesday will still be in for a treat.\n\nAccording to The Economic Times, earlier this month Roshan Jamkatel, a teenager from Schaumburg, Ill., somehow got his hands on the phone before and posted a YouTube video giving viewers a tour of the high-profile device.\n\nThe video was taken down but numerous websites got a chance to post it before also being ordered to remove it.\n\nThe publication reported that HTC Senior Global Online Communications Manager Jeff Gordon posted a message to Jamkatel\'s Twitter account.\n\n""It\'s not going to be a good week for you, my friend,"" Gordon wrote.\n\nJamkatel replied via Twitter that the phone was a fake, but Gordon wrote, ""We have the IMEI and all the other info.

The Galaxy Note 3 is considered a phablet, but the HTC One M8 is not that much smaller, so comparing the two makes sense for those looking to purchase a top-of-the-line handset. So how do they stack up against one another? Here is a spec by spec comparison of the two.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Galaxy Note 3 features an innovative new design with the leather-like plastic backing, which gives it a classy and sophisticated look. The HTC One M8 comes with a refined version of the metal body found on the original version. Both are pleasing aesthetically and make for a great companion in the business environment.\n\nSamsung made a step in the right direction with the Note 3 and HTC definitely stuck with what worked with the M8. This area comes down to preference.\n\nSpeed\n\nThe Galaxy Note 3 comes with a Snapdragon 800 chip with 3GB RAM, making it one of the fastest handsets on the market. The HTC One M8 comes with a Snapdragon 801 with 2GB RAM, which is still pretty impressive, but not as powerful as the Note 3. It's hard to touch the Note in this area, however, the HTC One is still works quick and efficiently. The Galaxy Note 3 would take it in this area.\n\nCamera\n\nThe HTC One M8 comes with a 4-Ultrapixel camera with tons of extra software for customizing videos and pictures. The Galaxy Note 3 packs a 13-megapixel camera that comes with High Dynamic Range, Touch Focus, and dual-shot. The One M8 might have a slight advantage thanks to the dual camera on the back. The Note 3 has the ability to shoot video in 4k, which is definitely a plus.\n\nThese are both top-of-the-line cameras that deserve a significant amount of recognition. It's tough to decide which one is better without using both for a good amount of time.\n\nExtras\n\nThe HTC One M8 features the best speakers on the smartphone market at this point, which could eliminate the need for a Bluetooth or USB accessory. The Galaxy Note 3 comes with the S Pen, which allows for a completely different category of apps to be used on the handset. The Note would be better for the creative type, while the HTC One would be a better fit for a music lover.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe HTC One M8 is definitely one of the best devices HTC has ever released while the Galaxy Note 3 might be the single best Samsung handset to date. This is a tough choice and would really come down to a matter of preference. The M8 is cheaper, but the Note 3 is such a powerhouse. Both are classy and both are great to use for just about anything.

48325,http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/26/htc-one-m8-2014-benchmarks-with-snapdragon-801/\?ncid=rss_truncated,technology,"[""Honest cheating\n\nThere's no room here to go back over the whole cheating controversy, but let's just say it's been a pretty depressing affair. In fact, if HTC hadn't made a significant change to the way the new One handles benchmarks, we probably wouldn't have bothered with this article at all, for fear of leading you astray. Fortunately though, that change has been made.\n\nHTC has acknowledged to us that, in the past, it has forced its devices to run in a so-called High Performance Mode (HPM) whenever a well-known benchmarking app was launched. This mode boosted the processor's clock speeds to levels that weren't available to other apps, causing excessive battery drain and temperature increases solely for the purpose of achieving unrealistically high benchmark scores. The company could (and probably should) have put an end to this practice, but instead it has gone the other way: High Performance Mode on the new One is available to anyone who wants it, in any app they like, by means of a tickbox in the Developer Options screen.\n\nHigh Performance Mode on the new One is available to anyone who wants it\n\nLet's be clear: There's still some cheating going on here because you cannot disable High Performance Mode in a benchmarking app in order to measure the One's regular, non-accelerated behavior. That's why the numbers in the HPM column below mostly look the same as the non-HPM column. But by making HPM available to everyone, HTC has at least sidestepped the worst allegations against it and made things a little more open.\n\nGeneral performance\n\nHTC One (2014) HTC One (2014) HPM HTC One (2013) Galaxy Note 3 Quadrant 2.0 25,548 23,555 11,952 23,278 Vellamo 2.0 1,804 1,668 1,435 2,501 Vellamo 2.0 Metal 1,280 1,269 749 1,194 AnTuTu 3.2 30,100 30,613 26,081 35,340 SunSpider 1.0, stock browser 570 577 940 537 Geekbench 3 single-core 941 989 626 934 Geekbench 3 multi-core 2,595 2,990 1,968 2,928 CF-Bench 38,526 38,489 27,601 33,785\n\nIf the table above tells us anything, it's that a person upgrading to the new One from an old One, or from a 2012 phone like the One X or One X+, should see a solid and noticeable jump in general performance. SunSpider reveals that browser page rendering is almost twice as quick, whether you use the stock browser or Chrome. Benchmarks that test the CPU, memory and a range of other components, such as CF-Bench and AnTuTu, show improvements of between 10 and 50 percent, with Quadrant's score being around double.\n\nOn the other hand, there's much less to shout about when we stack the HTC phone up against last year's Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which was one of the most popular implementations of the Snapdragon 800. Here we see only marginal gains in the region of 5 to 20 percent, with a couple of tests still putting the older device in the lead. This tallies with the fact that HTC has opted for a 2.3GHz version of the 801, which matches the CPU clock speed of the 800 and only offers a slight boost in memory and GPU speeds.\n\nGraphics and gaming tests\n\nHTC One (2014) HTC One (2014) HPM HTC One (2013) Galaxy Note 3 GFX Bench TRex Offscreen 28.2 28.3 N/A 26.3 GFX Bench Manhattan Offscreen 11.1 11.1 N/A 9.3 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited 20,440 20,433 10,238 18,828 GameBench fps (Minion Rush)* 28 29 27 28 GameBench % drain per hour (Minion Rush)* 22 25 32 20 *Scores achieved using GameBench beta app, not certified by GameBench itself.\n\nIn terms of graphics, based on GFXBench and 3DMark, we're looking at even bigger gains compared to the old One, as well as a significant step up from the Note 3. The only real-world test in our arsenal, GameBench, shows a small gain of 1 fps in regular mode, or 2 fps in High Performance Mode, which doesn't seem so impressive. However, this test involves measuring a phone's performance while an Android game is being played, and in this instance it probably tells us more about the game (Despicable Me: Minion Rush) than it does about the phone. After all, most mainstream Android games are designed to run on a wide range of devices, rather than to exploit the extra power offered by top-end phones.\n\nEven if GameBench doesn't reveal much change in terms of frame rates, it does show a very healthy improvement in the new One's gaming stamina. Whereas the Snapdragon 600 was constantly under pressure in Minion Rush, draining a third of its battery each hour, the Snapdragon 801 proved to be capable of delivering slightly smoother graphics alongside a much lower drain rate. This drain rate was almost as low as the Note 3's, despite the fact that Samsung's phablet contains a much larger battery (3,200mAh vs. 2,600mAh).\n\nFor reference, the new One also produced a great result in the standard battery rundown test for our main review, lasting 11.5 hours (vs. 6.5 hours on the old One and 9.5 hours on the Note 3). So, we can safely say that this phone is very efficient, regardless of whether it's being stressed or doing something less taxing, like playing a video.\n\nWrap-up\n\nThe conclusion here is simple: The HTC One has a very solid processor, and if you compare it to the old One, then you should see major improvements in both speed and battery life -- which is exactly what we all want. But if you stack it up against current Snapdragon 800 phones, the One is only a small step forward -- it's better in a lot of tests, but if you own something like a Galaxy Note 3, then you probably wouldn't notice much difference. When the Galaxy S5 and Xperia Z2 arrive, both with bigger batteries and, in Samsung's case, with even higher clock speeds, the One will likely be edged out of the top spot on any benchmarking table. Nevertheless, so long as we don't pay too much attention to what else lies on the horizon, we reckon HTC has given its latest phone more than enough grunt to satisfy even the most demanding of power users in 2014 and beyond."", ""Honest cheatingThere's no room here to go back over the whole cheating controversy, but let's just say it's been a pretty depressing affair.\nHTC has acknowledged to us that, in the past, it has forced its devices to run in a so-called High Performance Mode (HPM) whenever a well-known benchmarking app was launched.\nHigh Performance Mode on the new One is available to anyone who wants itLet's be clear: There's still some cheating going on here because you cannot disable High Performance Mode in a benchmarking app in order to measure the One's regular, non-accelerated behavior.\nOn the other hand, there's much less to shout about when we stack the HTC phone up against last year's Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which was one of the most popular implementations of the Snapdragon 800.\nThe only real-world test in our arsenal, GameBench, shows a small gain of 1 fps in regular mode, or 2 fps in High Performance Mode, which doesn't seem so impressive.""]"

HTC also says the two sensor will make for better performance in both low lighting and bright settings.\n\nSome industry experts are calling the One M8 a ‘make or break’ device for HTC, which has had a tough time over the past few years.\n\n“Despite the fact that last year’s HTC One was widely considered the best smartphone of 2013, the company failed to capitalise on the positive reviews and convert this to strong sales numbers,” commented mobile and telecoms analysts CCS Insight.\n\n“A key goal for HTC will be to capture consumers upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy S3. Launching the HTC One (M8) with immediate availability means it hits the shops ahead of new devices from arch rivals including Samsung and Sony. Luring only a small proportion of these customers would be a significant step in the right direction.”\n\nAlong with the smartphone, HTC also unveiled some new accessories, most notably the Dot View case.\n\nThe flip cover case has hundreds of holes perforating the front. Through these holes, the phone can display the time, weather, incoming caller ID and notifications.\n\nAs well as the visible information, users can also double-tap the cover to wake the One M8.\n\nExpected to cost around £25, the Dot View case will be available in black, blue, green, maroon and orange.\n\nOther official HTC accessories include a new battery pack featuring a 9,000mAh battery. The HTC Boombase speaker along with a new car kit was also demonstrated.\n\nFor those that are looking for something a bit tougher than the Dot View case, Tech21 has been one of the first firms to unveil its own range of cases for the One M8.\n\nTech21’s Impactology cases feature military-grade materials that lock together to absorb and dissipate the force of an impact.\n\nThe range features the Impact Tactical, which surrounds the back and sides of the device, and a slimmer profile version called the Impact Shell.

The smartphone company is well-known for its design and media features, and the new HTC One M8 shows both obsessions admirably. With its metal-and-glass body, it\'s likely to be the most beautiful Android smartphone of the year.\n\nThe One veers in some directions that LG and Samsung phones don\'t, even beyond the body design. HTC is less obsessed with huge screens: This One has a 5in screen, not pushing it to 5.1in or 5.2in. Megapixels have been discarded for ""ultrapixels"" on a 4-megapixel main camera with a new depth sensor above it for tricky photo effects. HTC\'s front-facing Boomsound speakers make another appearance here, as well.\n\nLast year\'s HTC One won the best smartphone of the year award at Mobile World Congress. Will HTC be able to make it two in a row? If it does, these 10 features will be why.\n\nMetal body\n\nThe HTC One M8 is the smartphone least likely to wear a case. This year, HTC increased the percentage of metal in the body to 90 per cent and went for a smooth, brushed-metal feel on the back, with tough Gorilla Glass 3 on the front. It looks far more expensive than the Samsung Galaxy S5, and arguably even more so than the iPhone.\n\nBoomsound\n\nFront-facing speakers are such a simple idea, you wonder why more mobile phone companies don\'t install them. HTC\'s front-facing Boomsound speakers offer the clearest speakerphone experience of any smartphone on the market, for one very simple reason: They actually aim the sound at your face, not away from it.\n\nKiller bass\n\nHTC doesn\'t have an association with Beats anymore, but the bass-heavy Beats sound lives on. The powerful headphone amp in the HTC One M8 delivers tons of bass when paired with the right headphones. HTC\'s included earbuds aren\'t bad, but they\'re only the beginning here.\n\nExtreme Power Saving Mode\n\nWhen your battery runs low, Extreme Power Saving Mode kicks in, restricting the phone\'s features to calls, texts, mail, calendar and calculator. That gives you 30 hours of standby on your last 10 per cent of battery.\n\nDuo camera\n\nThe small second camera above the HTC One\'s main camera captures depth information. This lets you pull off a bunch of cool photo tricks, including focusing your photos after the fact and cutting-and-pasting people from one photo into another. For more on the camera, see our battle of the smartphone cameras, which pits the HTC One M8 against the iPhone 5S and Moto X\'s snappers.\n\n5-megapixel selfies\n\nThe HTC One has the best front-facing camera out there right now, a 5-megapixel unit devoted to self-shots. The camera is wider-angle than most other front-facing cameras, too, so you can fit more people into your crowd.\n\nGallery highlights\n\nHTC\'s Gallery app collects your photos by time and place, and even creates automatic custom highlight videos from your photo collection. It\'s a great way to show off the pictures you\'ve taken without worrying about how to put them together.\n\nShared Zoes\n\nIf several people in a room have HTC Ones, they can collaborate on a video about the event they\'re at, all contributing stills and short videos to an automatically generated group highlight reel.\n\nBetter Blinkfeed\n\nBlinkfeed, HTC\'s Flipboard replacement, was made much more usable this year. It doesn\'t have to be your default home screen, and you can create custom feeds by searching for specific keywords you\'re interested in. It\'s a better way of skimming the news.\n\nDot View Case\n\nThe most stylish mobile phone case we\'ve seen yet, HTC\'s Dot View Case has a sensor which switches the phone into a mode that shows bold, coloured graphics through the holes in the case. That way, you can receive calls and see alerts without ever opening the case.\n\nFor more on HTC\'s new flagship offering, see our hands-on with the HTC One M8. We also have a raft of spec comparisons pitting the freshly launched handset against the Sony Xperia Z2, Samsung Galaxy S5, Google Nexus 5, Apple iPhone 5S, and of course its predecessor the HTC One from last year.\n\nImage Credit: Chris Sewell', ""The smartphone company is well-known for its design and media features, and the new HTC One M8 shows both obsessions admirably.\nHTC's front-facing Boomsound speakers make another appearance here, as well.\nThe powerful headphone amp in the HTC One M8 delivers tons of bass when paired with the right headphones.\n5-megapixel selfiesThe HTC One has the best front-facing camera out there right now, a 5-megapixel unit devoted to self-shots.\nFor more on HTC's new flagship offering, see our hands-on with the HTC One M8.""]"

This time the company has gone a step further, and made the smartphone available the same day it was announced. Apart from the gorgeous looks and metallic chassis, many Android enthusiasts would like to know what lies under the hood such as detailed tech specs and the repairability score by the ever-popular folks at iFixit.\n\nThe new HTC One may at first look a lot like its predecessor, but on closer inspection, we can find a redesigned housing, larger display, powerful tech specs and a brand new Sense UI giving a modern look to the smartphone.\n\nHTC One M8 Teardown\n\nAs always, the folks over at iFixit took the HTC One M8 and ripped it apart to find out details on its internal components, and also to see how much of the smartphone is repairable in case it gets damaged. The first step to get started was by opening the case of the smartphone.\n\nAs per iFixit, removing the rear case was easy, compared to last year. Adhesive and clips from last year was replaced with screws and that’s certainly a good point. Messy cables have been replaced with spring contacts, which makes it easy to remove the phone’s assembly.\n\nDelving deeper, the team found that the motherboard is glued to the base which definitely hurts the reparability score of the phone. If you want to remove or replace the battery, then you’ll first need to remove the motherboard, but the worst part is that the battery too is glued to the LCD. This means that if your phone’s display is damaged, then you’ll need to undertake the pretty challenging task of removing the motherboard and the battery, and only then you’ll be able to get access to the display.\n\nThe display assembly cannot be replaced without tunneling through the entire phone. This makes one of most common repairs, a damaged screen, very difficult to accomplish.\n\nApart from the regular difficulties when taking it apart, the team says that “Copious amounts of tape, adhesive, and copper shielding make many components difficult to remove and replace” and that again does not comes in favor of the smartphone.\n\nOverall the new HTC One 2014 gets a mere 2 out of 10 repairability score, with 10 being the most repairable. The original HTC One of last year got a score of 1, and now this new HTC One gets a 2, but this small improvement is not enough to call this phone a very “repairable” one.', 'After numerous rumors and leaks, the HTC One M8 is finally out, and will be available starting today.\nThis time the company has gone a step further, and made the smartphone available the same day it was announced.\nHTC One M8 TeardownAs always, the folks over at iFixit took the HTC One M8 and ripped it apart to find out details on its internal components, and also to see how much of the smartphone is repairable in case it gets damaged.\nOverall the new HTC One 2014 gets a mere 2 out of 10 repairability score, with 10 being the most repairable.\nThe original HTC One of last year got a score of 1, and now this new HTC One gets a 2, but this small improvement is not enough to call this phone a very “repairable” one.']"

However, it has subsequently moved into manufacturing its own range of powerful mobile phones, powered by Android and Windows Phone.\n\nIn its short history, the company has introduced a range of innovations to the market, including the first intuitive touchscreen to allow fingertip navigation, as well as the first ever Microsoft Smart Music Phone.\n\nIt was also responsible in October 2008 for the release of the first smartphone to employ Google’s Android software (the G1) and has been among the platform's key supporters ever since, with tablets such as the HTC Flyer and a steady stream of new smartphones. The close ties between the companies were born out when Google chose HTC to manufacture the joint-branded HTC-Google Nexus One.\n\nHTC subsequently did much to break Android as a mass-market smartphone operating system with its huge-selling Desire phones. Its handset product line is now led by the One series, with the Desire brand reserved for mid-range and entry-level handsets.\n\nLatest HTC phones"", ""Its reputation rides principally on the HTC One range, in particular the HTC One M9 which picked up a string of awards from gadget sites.\nAlongside its top-end One smartphones, HTC caters for the 'value' end of the market with its Desire handsets.\nThese are powered by the same Android/HTC Sense software and offer many of the same things that have won over reviewers and users.\nHTC subsequently did much to break Android as a mass-market smartphone operating system with its huge-selling Desire phones.\nLatest HTC phones""]"

Known as the HTC One (M8) this smartphone looks great right from the first glance and sports a new Duo Camera feature on the back and has a 5 megapixel front facing camera.\n\nThe HTC One (M8) is also the first HTC smartphone to support TD-LTE networks in Band 40, this means that the smartphone will work on Airtel’s 4G network in India. This might also mean that HTC may tie-up with Airtel to bring this smartphone in the Indian market and offer some nifty 4G data plans.\n\nAlmost every specification and detail of this smartphone has been leaked previously. The One (M8) sports an all-metal body with rounded edges instead of the rectangular ones from the previous generation One series smartphones. It sports a 5-inch 1080p Full HD resolution display with a pixel density of 441ppi which has Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 protection.\n\nThis HTC flagship smartphone is powered by a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 801 quad-core processor which is further coupled with an Adreno 330 GPU and 2GB of RAM. The device will come in 16GB and 32GB storage capacity variants. It also includes a microSD card slot for expandable storage with support for up to 128GB. In addition to this users also get 50GB of additional cloud storage on Google Drive. One thing is certain, storage space on this smartphone is in abundance.\n\nThe key feature of this smartphone is what HTC calls the Duo Camera on the rear, this includes a 4 UltraPixel primary camera with dual-LED flash and another camera module which works as a depth sensor. This sensor saves metadata related to the distance between objects/subjects in the frame. This allows the user to change the focus in the photo later by editing it on the smartphone.\n\nAnother neat feature on this phone is its 5 megapixel front facing camera with a BSI sensor and f/2.0 aperture for an ‘advanced self-portraiture expirience’ the likes of which are unparallel in quality when compared with front facing camera results on other smartphones. To cut it short this phone can help capture some great selfies. In addition to this awesomeness HTC has also added a number of new editing features including the fun editing mode on the smartphone.\n\nIn terms of the connectivity, it supports 4G network (on 2,300MHz band in India), 3G, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and GPS capabilities. It will come pre-loaded with Android 4.4 Kit Kat skinned with HTC’s own user interface. Whats interesting is that the smartphone supports both TD-LTE and FDD-LTE networks. This will allow users in India to get access to 4G networks even while on international roaming in many other countries.', 'Finally, HTC has unveiled its much awaited and all new One (M8) smartphone globally.\nKnown as the HTC One (M8) this smartphone looks great right from the first glance and sports a new Duo Camera feature on the back and has a 5 megapixel front facing camera.\nThe HTC One (M8) is also the first HTC smartphone to support TD-LTE networks in Band 40, this means that the smartphone will work on Airtel’s 4G network in India.\nThe key feature of this smartphone is what HTC calls the Duo Camera on the rear, this includes a 4 UltraPixel primary camera with dual-LED flash and another camera module which works as a depth sensor.\nThis will allow users in India to get access to 4G networks even while on international roaming in many other countries.']"

HTC, in Sense 6 on the new One (M8), has finally realized that changing the wallpaper on your phone, shouldn’t make you want to stab your eye out. I know this probably seems like such a non-story to many, but if you have ever used an HTC product for more than a couple of minutes at a time, you’ll know what I mean.\n\nTheir Sense skin, while good in some ways, has removed far too many standard Android actions over the years. I’m not saying that changing it up is always a bad thing, but HTC, for no apparent reason that any reasonable person can understand, likes to do things to Android that go against standards that have been there since the beginning of time. Take for example how HTC decided to ruin the simple task of moving an app from the app drawer to the home screen to the dock in Sense 5, when initially launched on the original One. They have fixed it for the most part through updates, but man, was that painful for months.\n\nAnd then you have the point of this post, which comes down to making wallpaper changing harder than it should have ever been. Let me just ask you – how do you change the wallpaper on your non-HTC phone? I’ll give you a minute. You long press the home screen, then choose “change wallpaper” from the pop-up, right? It’s that way on every phone. It’s a standard action.\n\nBefore Sense 6, HTC asked that you pull down your notification bar, tap a Settings icon, scroll to find the “Personalize” section in Settings, tap it, then tap “Wallpaper,” and then choose the wallpaper source before setting the size you’d like. A long press on a home screen in Sense 5 would only open up your widgets adding menu. Don’t believe me? HTC’s own support page for changing wallpapers has those exact steps listed out.\n\nIn Sense 6 on the new One (M8), they finally made the long-press give you a menu with options, one of which is a “Home screen wallpaper” selector. Good job, HTC.\n\n/end personal random story-rant.', 'HTC, in Sense 6 on the new One (M8), has finally realized that changing the wallpaper on your phone, shouldn’t make you want to stab your eye out.\nTheir Sense skin, while good in some ways, has removed far too many standard Android actions over the years.\nAnd then you have the point of this post, which comes down to making wallpaper changing harder than it should have ever been.\nA long press on a home screen in Sense 5 would only open up your widgets adding menu.\nIn Sense 6 on the new One (M8), they finally made the long-press give you a menu with options, one of which is a “Home screen wallpaper” selector.']"

48348,http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/htc-one-m8-launch/,technology,"['I am willing to go out on a limb and call what I saw today one of the best Android smartphones to be launched in a while. This phone has a few features that will, in my books, justify what I am saying. You might differ, even I might differ after I actually get to use the phone for a few days. But till then, I have high hopes for the new HTC One (M8). Here is why:\n\nAdvertising\n\nDesign: I have always loved good design. We were all pretty much unanimous that the HTC One (M7) was the best looking, best built, Android phone of last year. This year, they have gone a step further and given the device an all-metal finish. It still has a unibody design, but now you have a micro-SD card slot with 128GB support. The phone looks, feels robust and has what Darren Sng, HTC’s senior director for Asia product marketing, calls “jewellery grade finish”. It will be available in three colours, including one with a gold finish.\n\nCamera: For me, this is the killer feature of the phone. It has two lenses at the back, but the second lens is not exactly a camera, but a depth sensor that adds a new layer of data and detail to photographs shot with HTC’s popular Ultra Pixel camera. You can do a lot of Photoshop-like tricks within the phone as it recognises depth. For instance, you can focus on anything and blur anything out. Use this feature to also add a lot of effects and create cutouts of people with a single click. Just for the record, HTC claims this camera has a “faster launch, faster focus and faster burst”. Plus, there is a dual colour LED flash with both white and yellow light to balance out the image and make it look more natural. The 5MP front camera is also better, so you can click better selfies.\n\nSense 6: We couldn’t play around for it for long, but the Sense 6 seems to be making more sense now as the UI understands what you are trying to do and reacts accordingly. The entire interface is colour-coded, so you know where you are by just looking at the colours. The phone wakes up with a double tap, one swipe and you are in the home screen. It also aggregates feeds from different sources and HTC will open up the SDK to get more partners in. If this works, it could end up killing apps like Flipboard, at least on this phone.\n\nAdvertising\n\nDot view: This simple thing is the sort of stuff innovation is all about. The perforated front panel of the regular flap cover lets users interact with the phone in the simplest of ways. It shows call alerts and other notifications without even opening the flap. And this is done with no extra power, for the flap is all plastic. This is what good design and sane thinking is all about.\n\nExtreme power saving mode: This could be the next big feature, again if it works. In this mode, the phone gives just basic features, but promises battery life of up to two weeks. If you switch on the mode in the last 10 per cent, HTC says it will be able to run the phone in basic mode for 30 hours. Now, tell me who wouldn’t kill for that feature. But we were, obviously, not able to test this in the hour or so we spent at the pre-launch demo session.\n\nWhat else? The 5-inch Full HD display phone will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and will run Android 4.4.2 KitKat. It will be available in 16 and 32GB versions.\n\nThe phone will be available in India from April, but will run only on 4G networks only. There is no word yet on the price, but we guess HTC might go for a competitive mid-segment price to win back its market share. In UK, the phone will sell for £530. Expect more updates in this space.', 'But till then, I have high hopes for the new HTC One (M8).\nWe were all pretty much unanimous that the HTC One (M7) was the best looking, best built, Android phone of last year.\nIt still has a unibody design, but now you have a micro-SD card slot with 128GB support.\nJust for the record, HTC claims this camera has a “faster launch, faster focus and faster burst”.\nIn this mode, the phone gives just basic features, but promises battery life of up to two weeks.']"

The former is available now on Google Play with an estimated shipping timeframe of 2-3 weeks, while the latter can be yours right directly from HTC’s web store.\n\nSo what’s the difference between the two handsets? While both the GPe and Developer Edition are relatively developer friendly, the M8 Developer Edition doesn’t run stock Android and instead favors Sense 6.0 — complete with an unlockable bootloader and without all the carrier bloat you’d get from ‘regular’ versions of the handset.\n\nThe handset will set you back $649.99 and is offered in two colors, Amber Gold or Gunmetal Gray. The HTC One M8 Developer Edition is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile for those in the United States, and it should also play nicely with GSM and HSPA+ networks across the globe.\n\nBottom-line, if you want Sense 6.0 in a developer friendly package, this is probably the handset for you. On the downside, HTC notes that the unlocked bootloader means that certain special offers like their Google Drive promotion may not work with the handset due to “invalid DRM security keys”. For those that simply are looking for a device that is SIM unlocked and free from carrier meddling, HTC is also offering the One M8 in unlocked form in all three color choices.\n\nFor more details on the HTC One (M8) Developer Edition, or to pick one up now, you’ll want to head on over to HTC’s website.

The pair of sensors on the back allow the M8\'s Ultrapixel camera to add a ton of extra data to the photos that are taken, which in turn allows them to be manipulated in new and exciting ways. While the ability to adjust these photos on the HTC One M8 is a real treat, at the end of the day you still need to know how the photos compare to those taken by the other smartphones out there. We took an iPhone 5S and a Moto X along for a trip through a few indoor photo layouts to see what the M8\'s camera is capable of.\n\nIn-depth: Hands on with the HTC One M8\n\nThe photos in this collection were taken with the default settings provided by the manufacturer. This means that the HTC One M8 and the Moto X photos are 16:9 and the iPhone 5S is 4:3, so you\'ll notice that two of the photos are noticeably wider than the others. Additionally, Motorola uses ""Auto HDR"" by default on its camera. This feature allows the camera to determine whether or not HDR is necessary, so you will see some photos where this function has been deployed and others where it has not. Unfortunately for the Moto X, all that really did was create some situations where the camera was on par with what the other two cameras were taking by default.\n\nIn these pictures, the HTC One M8 is on the left, the Moto X in the middle, and the iPhone 5S is on the right. Click on the images to see bigger versions for a proper look at the shots.\n\nHTC\'s camera is all about ""bigger"" pixels instead of more pixels. The 4.1-megapixel shooter is of a unique construction when compared to most smartphone cameras because their sensors gather more information per pixel than the rest.\n\nThis is part of why the original HTC One did such an amazing job in low light. The 8-megapixel sensors of the iPhone 5S and the Moto X capture a physically larger photo, but there\'s less information in each pixel for the camera to process and ultimately adjust to what the software thinks is best.\n\nThe end result is a photo that looks great on screens but probably wouldn\'t be something you\'ll ever be able to print out and hang on a wall.\n\nSince most people aren\'t in the habit of printing the photos from their smartphones, this is widely seen as a non-issue and one of the big reasons users should avoid looking at just the number of megapixels a smartphone camera has when determining superiority.\n\nAs you can see in these photos, the HTC One M8 (on the left) has no trouble at all keeping up with the iPhone 5S (middle) when it comes to sharpness (remember – click on the image to see a larger version).\n\nWhat really matters in these photos is how well the cameras represent colours, and that\'s something that HTC demonstrates a surprisingly powerful grasp on.\n\nHTC cameras have a history of looking overproduced, showing colours that are unrealistic but beautiful. The HTC One M8 is surprisingly colour-accurate in these photos, especially when it comes to the flat white background these images are taken against. The iPhone 5S shows a number of white balance issues, while the Moto X struggles to capture enough light to make the colours accurate enough to matter.\n\nThis environment clearly demonstrates the HTC One M8\'s real strengths, and will be a huge deal for someone looking to grab that casual photo.\n\nThe HTC One M8 did occasionally demonstrate some issues with too much light in the background, making the items behind the primary object in the photo appear washed out. It\'s clear that the One focused quickly on the foreground and the depth of field effect caused by the f/2.0 aperture on the phone. The Moto X demonstrates the best control of the background, but that\'s somewhat artificial due to the Auto HDR mode on the camera by default. The iPhone 5S demonstrates the best middle ground here, and while the differences between the two photos in the background are significant you can see the same difference in quality in the foreground where HTC has demonstrated more control and a sharper image.\n\nThere\'s one more major difference between the HTC One M8 in these photos that can\'t be demonstrated with an image. The added 2-megapixel sensor on the back of the camera allows the Duo Camera to collect more information about most photos that are taken. The position of this second camera makes it so less information is offered when you take a photo of something up close, which is why a Macro option is available, but more than that you\'ll notice that the file sizes for these photos are wildly different. There\'s an expected variance in file size when taking photos with any camera, since the data gathered in the photo is going to be different each time. The depth information provided by the added sensor can make some photos in the 800KB range and others around 2.5MB. In these photos here, size difference was unusually dramatic when compared to the iPhone 5S and Moto X.\n\nHTC has produced another phone with a crazy good camera on it that encourages users to rethink how they look at what makes a smartphone camera great. The iPhone 5S is an impressive camera on its own, and it\'s still one of the best point-and-shoot smartphone cameras out there, but the HTC One M8 has clearly demonstrated that it boasts some unique qualities that deserve special recognition.\n\nFor more on HTC\'s new flagship offering, see our hands-on with the HTC One M8. We also have a raft of spec comparisons pitting the freshly launched handset against the Sony Xperia Z2, Samsung Galaxy S5, Google Nexus 5, Apple iPhone 5S, and of course its predecessor the HTC One from last year.\n\nPhotography by Chris Sewell.', ""We took an iPhone 5S and a Moto X along for a trip through a few indoor photo layouts to see what the M8's camera is capable of.\nThis means that the HTC One M8 and the Moto X photos are 16:9 and the iPhone 5S is 4:3, so you'll notice that two of the photos are noticeably wider than the others.\nUnfortunately for the Moto X, all that really did was create some situations where the camera was on par with what the other two cameras were taking by default.\nIn these pictures, the HTC One M8 is on the left, the Moto X in the middle, and the iPhone 5S is on the right.\nThe iPhone 5S shows a number of white balance issues, while the Moto X struggles to capture enough light to make the colours accurate enough to matter.""]"

It has a 20.7MP sensor that’s physically large (1/2.3in in size), giving it excellent light-gathering capabilities, and the camera also features a Background Defocus mode, which takes two shots and merges them together to give the impression of a short depth of field.\n\nOn the video front, it can record 4K footage (at a resolution of 3840 x 2160) or 120fps 720p footage for super slo-mo playback. Plus, SteadyShot image stabilisation helps videos look rock solid even when your hands aren’t.\n\nThe results are often incredible, rivalling those you’d get from decent compact cameras; only Nokia’s Lumia 1020 gives it any real competition as far as smartphones go. Admittedly, it’s not the easiest camera for a novice to use, and the Superior Auto mode doesn’t always give you perfect results. But learn to get the best from it and you’ll reap the rewards.\n\nHTC has also put a lot of effort into the One (M8)’s photo and video skills, but it’s taken an entirely different approach to the Sony. As with the original One, the rear camera uses a sensor with bigger ‘UltraPixel’ sites, but fewer megapixels - a mere 4MP, like the original One. What it means is that low light images are less noisy and sharper, but also that you can’t zoom in to crop your shots without them looking blocky.\n\nStill, an iPhone 5s-style dual LED flash helps deliver more natural-looking skin tones and, most interestingly, there’s a second rear camera that captures ‘depth information’; this essentially allows you to refocus shots after you’ve taken them (a little like the Lytro camera). As far as video goes, there’s 1080p but no 4K.\n\nOn the front-facing camera, er, front, the One (M8)’s has a 5MP sensor and 1080p video capabilities, while the Xperia Z2’s has a 2.2MP sensor, also compatible with 1080p. So if you’re a selfie addict, the M8 has an advantage here.\n\nOverall though, the Z2 is the clear winner here.

Looking at the specs of both the 2013 and the 2014 models of the HTC One, here's a comprehensive comparison of the most notable aspects.\n\nDisplay\n\nThe new HTC One M8 sports a slightly larger 5-inch display, compared to the original HTC One's 4.7-inch screen. Both models have the same S-LCD 3 screen type and both have a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, but the HTC One M8 has a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch (ppi), while last year's model has a higher pixel count of 468 ppi. The difference is understandable, however, considering that the new model has a larger screen.\n\nUnder the Hood - Processor, Graphics & RAM\n\nThe HTC One M8 boasts a powerful quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor clocked at 2.3GHz (or 2.5GHz in Asia), arguably better than the original HTC One's Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 CPU clocked at 1.7GHz. Both models come with 2GB of RAM, but the new HTC One M8 has Adreno 330 graphics, while last year's model comes with an Adreno 320 GPU.\n\nStorage\n\nWhile the HTC One 2013 came in 32GB or 64GB internal storage configurations, the new HTC One M8 is available in either 16GB or 64GB. The greatest improvement in this department, however, is that the new model finally has a microSD card slot, allowing for additional memory of up to 128GB. The original HTC One does not have microSD support, which is a drawback for many.\n\nCameras\n\nAs expected, the new HTC One M8 boasts a dual rear camera setup with the company's UltraPixel technology. One UltraPixel sensor will gather depth information, while the other 4-megapixel camera captures the shot, aiming to deliver a superior camera experience. The HTC One M8 also comes with a dual LED Smart Flash, BSI sensor, and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nThe original HTC One, meanwhile, comes with a 4-megapixel UltraPixel rear camera with LED flash and optical image stabilization (OIS), as well as a 2.1-megapixel front shooter. Both the 2013 and the 2014 models of the HTC One can shoot video in 1080p.\n\nConnectivity Options\n\nIn terms of connectivity, there are no big changes with the latest model. Both the HTC One M8 and the original HTC One support NFC, Bluetooth 4.0, and dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac.\n\nBattery\n\nThe HTC One M8 packs a large 2,600 mAh non-removable battery that will provide a better performance compared to the original HTC One's 2,300 mAh battery, also non-removable. Moreover, HTC has introduced a new Extreme Power Saving Mode with its latest flagship, aiming to dramatically extend battery life. According to the company, enabling this mode will allow a smartphone with only 5% battery life to keep going for another 15 hours, while still having access to voice calls, text, and email.\n\nSize and Weight\n\nWhen it comes to dimensions, the new HTC One M8 measures 5.76 x 2.78 x 0.37 inches, while the 2013 model comes in at 5.41 x 2.69 x 0.37 inches. The new model is also slightly heavier at 5.64 oz. compared to 5.04 oz. for last year's model, but the difference will likely go unnoticed.\n\nKey Software Features\n\nFor the HTC One M8, standout features include the innovative Duo Camera with UltraPixel technology, the Extreme Power Saving Mode, the latest HTC Sense 6.0, as well as BoomSound, Zoe, and an enhanced BlinkFeed, among others. The original HTC One comes with UltraPixel technology, BoomSound, Zoe, and BlinkFeed as well, while in terms of UI it came with HTC Sense 5 at launch. Android 4.4 KitKat powers both models.\n\nPrice\n\nThe new HTC One M8 is already available for purchase immediately after its unveiling on Tuesday, March 25, selling for a $199 starting price on-contract with Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint. The Google Play Edition (GPE) HTC One M8 is available on Google Play for $699. Meanwhile, the original HTC One is now available for free on-contract, while the GPE model costs $599.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe original HTC One (2013 model) is by all means a powerful handset with high-end specs and features, but the new HTC One M8 is better in virtually every aspect. The new flagship is faster, sleeker, smoother, boasting notable improvements in all departments.\n\nSign Up for the ITECHPOST Newsletter Get the Most Popular iTechPost Stories in a Weekly Newsletter\n\n© 2019 ITECHPOST, All rights reserved.

The design is stunning,” Current Analysis analyst Avi Greengart said at the HTC launch event on Tuesday in New York.\n\n“It should sell well to early adopters who are looking for premium design, but HTC will need effective marketing to break through to mainstream consumers who are starting, and usually ending, their buying process with Apple [Inc] or Samsung [Electronics Co],” he added.\n\nLast year, HTC’s revenue declined 29.62 percent from 2012. It also slid into the red, posting a net loss of NT$1.33 billion (US$435 million) from a profit of NT$16.78 billion in 2012.\n\nCEO Peter Chou (周永明) told reporters in New York that gaining market share is “a critical issue” to HTC, with the company shifting to focus its resources in key markets, especially the US, Europe and China.\n\nHe added that the company has set a goal of gaining a global market share of 8 to 10 percent over the long term.\n\nHTC had a market share of less than 5 percent of the global smartphone market last year, far behind Samsung’s 31 percent and Apple’s 16 percent, market researcher Gartner Inc said.\n\nHTC shares closed up 1.64 percent at NT$155 in Taipei trading yesterday, outpacing the TAIEX, which edged up 0.55 percent.\n\nYuanta Securities Corp (元大證券) analyst Dennis Chan (詹宗勳) yesterday said he remained downbeat on HTC and does not believe the company’s new product would be a game-changer.\n\n“As most spec upgrades have been anticipated by the market, we believe the phone lacks the ‘wow’ factor, and we are skeptical that the new model’s [sales] momentum will be sustainable,” said Chan, who rates HTC shares a “sell,” said in a research note to client.\n\nHTC plans to partner with more than 230 telecom operators globally to sell its new flagship model this year. It started taking pre-orders yesterday in the US through major carriers such as AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Sprint Corp, with the phone costing US$199.99 for a two-year contract.\n\nThe company is to start selling the M8 in Taiwan tomorrow, with the retail price for a 16-gigabyte model set at NT$21,900.', 'The HTC One M8 runs Google Inc’s Android 4.4 mobile operating system and supports 4G long-term evolution (LTE) technology.\nThe design is stunning,” Current Analysis analyst Avi Greengart said at the HTC launch event on Tuesday in New York.\nHe added that the company has set a goal of gaining a global market share of 8 to 10 percent over the long term.\nHTC had a market share of less than 5 percent of the global smartphone market last year, far behind Samsung’s 31 percent and Apple’s 16 percent, market researcher Gartner Inc said.\nHTC shares closed up 1.64 percent at NT$155 in Taipei trading yesterday, outpacing the TAIEX, which edged up 0.55 percent.']"

The pair of sensor on the back allow the M8’s Ultrapixel camera to add a ton of extra data to the photos that are taken, which in turn allows them to be manipulated in new and exciting ways. While the ability to adjust these photos on the HTC One M8 is a real treat, at the end of the day you still need to know how the photos compare to those taken by the other smartphones out there. We took an iPhone 5S and a Moto X along for a trip through a few indoor photo layouts to see what the M8’s camera is capable of.\n\nThe photos in this collection were taken with the default settings provided by the manufacturer. This means that the HTC One M8 and the Moto X photos are 16:9 and the iPhone 5S is 4:3, so you’ll notice that two of the photos are noticeably wider than the others. Additionally, Motorola uses “Auto HDR” by default on its camera. This feature allows the camera to determine whether or not HDR is necessary, so you will see some photos where this function has been deployed and others where it has not. Unfortunately for the Moto X, all that really did was create some situations where the camera was on par with what the other two cameras were taking by default.\n\nThe HTC One M8 is on the left, the Moto X in the middle, and the iPhone 5S is on the right.\n\nHTC’s camera is all about “bigger” pixels instead of more pixels. The 4.1MP shooter is of a unique construction when compared to most smartphone cameras because their sensors gather more information per pixel than the rest. This is part of why the original HTC One did such an amazing job in low light. [Read our low light shooting shootout for more on that.] The 8MP sensors iPhone 5S and the Moto X capture a physically larger photo, but there’s less information in each pixel for the camera to process and ultimately adjust to what the software thinks is best.\n\nThe end result is a photo that looks great on screens but probably wouldn’t be something you’ll ever be able to print out and hang on a wall. Since most people aren’t in the habit of printing the photos from their smartphones, this is widely seen as a non-issue and one of the big reasons users should avoid looking at just the number of megapixels a smartphone camera has when determining superiority. (In the images below you’ll see that the HTC One’s photos are the smallest, but the larger sizes are available at gallery at the top of the article.)\n\nAs you can see in these photos, the HTC One M8 (on the left) has no trouble at all keeping up with the iPhone 5S (right) when it comes to the sharpness. What really matters in these photos is how well the cameras represent colors, and that’s something that HTC demonstrates a surprisingly powerful grasp on. HTC cameras have a history of looking overproduced, showing colors that are unrealistic but beautiful. The HTC One M8 is surprisingly color accurate in these photos, especially when it comes to the flat white background these images are taken against. The iPhone 5S shows a number of white balance issues, while the Moto X struggles to capture enough light to make the colors accurate enough to matter.\n\nThis environment clearly demonstrates the HTC One M8’s real strengths, and will be a huge deal for someone looking to grab that casual photo.\n\nNext page: HTC One M8 vs iPhone 5S vs Moto X camera comparison continued…', 'We took an iPhone 5S and a Moto X along for a trip through a few indoor photo layouts to see what the M8’s camera is capable of.\nThis means that the HTC One M8 and the Moto X photos are 16:9 and the iPhone 5S is 4:3, so you’ll notice that two of the photos are noticeably wider than the others.\nThe HTC One M8 is on the left, the Moto X in the middle, and the iPhone 5S is on the right.\nThe iPhone 5S shows a number of white balance issues, while the Moto X struggles to capture enough light to make the colors accurate enough to matter.\nNext page: HTC One M8 vs iPhone 5S vs Moto X camera comparison continued…']"

We were stating all day long that pre-orders were open for T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T. They were only open for AT&T and Sprint. T-Mobile has been quiet until now. It appears that they aren't doing pre-orders at all though.\n\nOn April 11th, T-Mobile will begin selling the HTC One M8. It'll be available for $0 down and $26.50 per month, which equates to about $636. Which is about what we've seen as full price at other carriers, and it's still a lot cheaper than the Google Play Edition which is $699. Obviously the $0 down is for those with good credit, but you can also buy the HTC One M8 for full retail from T-Mobile if you're interested, and choose one of their Simple Choice plans and be completely contract free.\n\nBy now, I'm sure you're aware of their Simple Choice Plans. Which start at $50 and go up to $80. They all include unlimited minutes and texts as well as international roaming data on 2G/EDGE networks. Additionally the $50 plan includes 1GB of high-speed data, $60 gets you 3GB of high-speed data and $70 gets you 5GB of high-speed data. After that you are throttled down to 2G speeds, which are not fun. Now the $80 plan – which is what I have – is unlimited everything no throttling at all. And I can attest to them not throttling on the $80 plan because I've used 16GB so far this month and still getting great speeds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo now we have pricing and release details for all of the US carriers for the HTC One M8. How many of you out there are planning on picking up the HTC One M8 from T-Mobile? Or another carrier?

It's never a pleasant sight, seeing a hot new device torn asunder, but at least it's not as heart-wrenching as the inevitable Drop Test videos that will be showing up in the near future. It's probably just me, but I always feel that the Drop Tests show a remarkable lack of respect for a device, and all the respective work put into producing the handset. Whereas the iFixit guys take care unwrapping the device, all the way to its inner-core. Sure, sometimes accidents happen (as per the next paragraph), but it just feels different, you feel like the device has died with honor, although I might well be getting carried away. Back to the real story, and it's not really good news. Much like the HTC One M7 that scored a miserly 1 out of a possible 10 in terms of repairability, the M8 is not a user-friendly device. Theres virtually no possibility of a layman repairing this device.\n\nWhy? I hear you ask? Well, for starters, the HTC One M8's motherboard is glued down. And to repair the display, you have to remove everything from the rear in order to get to the display. There is no plying the screen out of the front of the device. You even have to remove the motherboard to get at the battery. Thats not good folks. The iFixit guys were unfortunate that applying heat to loosen up the adhesive, whilst separating the display from the chassis, they inadvertently snipped the digitizer cable with the guitar pic they were using. And that means the device died a tragic death. After some deliberation (and a beer), the HTC One M8 received a score of 2/10. They praised the solid external construction, and although the device is no longer impossible to open up without damaging the rear of the case, it's still extremely difficult. Luckily for people in the US, HTC offer the Advantage service that provides one free replacement screen within the first 6 months of the handset's life. It's best to be a lot more careful with your HTC One M8 after the six first six months has passed. For the rest of the world, it's definitely best to take good care of your new device from the very beginning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes the repairability of a device affect your decision when purchasing a new handset? Will the low score of the HTC One M8 perhaps turn your attention to more easily repairable smart phones? Let us know in the comments or via our Google Plus page."", ""Whereas the iFixit guys take care unwrapping the device, all the way to its inner-core.\nAnd to repair the display, you have to remove everything from the rear in order to get to the display.\nAfter some deliberation (and a beer), the HTC One M8 received a score of 2/10.\nIt's best to be a lot more careful with your HTC One M8 after the six first six months has passed.\nWill the low score of the HTC One M8 perhaps turn your attention to more easily repairable smart phones?""]"

It’s the successor of the 2013’s best android phone, with several new features including improved design, a dual camera on the back, high-performance Snapdragon 801 processor and the revamped Sense 6 interface along with Zoe and Sense TV.\n\nNumerous rumors, in recent months, have widely revealed so much about the device that the Taiwanese giant also choose the code name M8 for the flagship. HTC One (M8) is characterized by a particular elegant design, boasting same aluminum unibody like its predecessor with more pronounced edges and a darker shade of gray. However, HTC One (M8) has 90% metal body compared to 70% of the original model.

This time HTC has paid full attention to their customers’ feedback and introduced expandable memory via microSD cards (up to 128GB) along with 16GB or 32GB of internal storage. It boasts 2600mAh battery to ensure 20 hours autonomy with a new power saving mode. The smartphone features Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 4.0 with aptX enabled, 4G LTE and integrates a number of sensors including accelerometer, gyroscope and barometer.\n\nThe 2014 model has brought two major changes: BoomSound front facing speakers and Dual camera at the back, both have received several improvements; the sound will be more powerful thanks to a new DSP chip. Apart from a 5-megapixel front camera, ideal for selfie, HTC One (M8) has a Duo Camera, or a dual camera on the back with dual LED flash. The sensor is supported by 4 UltraPixel, but there’s a new image processor, while the Taiwanese House chose to abandon the optical image stabilization system used in the predecessor. Actually, the second rear camera isn’t a real camera in the traditional sense, but rather a depth sensor that will allow the user to customize and enrich the shots especially in post-processing. It’ll also be possible to change the focus after taking a picture.\n\nThe new HTC One is available in three colors: glacial silver, amber gold and our gunmetal gray with a gorgeous brushed finish. On software front, the new smartphone from HTC is loaded with Android 4.4.2 KitKat with revamped HTC Sense 6, which is now more modern and open, not only for users but also for developers and more intuitive and customizable BlinkFeed.\n\nThe HTC One (M8) is available in Canada and America starting today offering around $229 on a two-year agreement, or $700 without agreement in Canada and for $199 with new two-year contract or $649 outright with American carriers.\n\nFurther, Google Play edition will be available very soon assuming the expected $699 price tag.', 'The HTC One (M8) is new flagship smartphone by HTC, and it’s publicly showcased at the company’s stand-alone event held in London.\nHTC One (M8) is characterized by a particular elegant design, boasting same aluminum unibody like its predecessor with more pronounced edges and a darker shade of gray.\nHowever, HTC One (M8) has 90% metal body compared to 70% of the original model.\nThe 2014 model has brought two major changes: BoomSound front facing speakers and Dual camera at the back, both have received several improvements; the sound will be more powerful thanks to a new DSP chip.\nApart from a 5-megapixel front camera, ideal for selfie, HTC One (M8) has a Duo Camera, or a dual camera on the back with dual LED flash.']"

Sound like a familiar formula? Yes, that's been Apple's M.O. for years now, and has worked with aplomb if you judge by the success of the iPhone 5s. It's only fitting then that we compare these two design titans to see how they stack up.\n\nThe iPhone 5s and the One (M8) are easily the two best-looking devices on the market right now. And it's not just outward appearances—both of these devices share that airtight build quality that evokes awe and wonder. If you've been following along at all, you should already know that the One is nearly an inch taller, a half-inch wider, and over 50 percent heavier than the iPhone 5s. Fans of big-screen phones probably won't bat an eye, but if you're looking for a device that's comfortable to use with one hand, the One is probably not for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY\n\nThat big body accommodates the 5-inch, 1080p LCD that truly dwarfs the iPhone 5s's 4-inch display. HTC's panel is sharper, too, packing in 441 pixels per inch to the iPhone 5s's 326 ppi. All that extra room also helps fit in HTC's unrivaled front-facing BoomSound speakers. They're easily the loudest and best sounding speakers on any smartphone. The big, sharp screen and outrageously loud speakers make the new One a media powerhouse. If you're planning on using your phone for your next Netflix binge, it's hard to argue with HTC's new flagship.\n\nName HTC One (M8) (Unlocked) Apple iPhone 5S Lowest Price $199.00 MSRP Editors' Rating Dimensions 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.37 (HWD) inches 4.87 x 2.31 x 0.3 inches Weight 5.6 oz 3.95 oz Operating System as Tested Android 4.4 iOS 8 Total Integrated Storage 16 GB 16 GB CPU Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 Quad-Core Apple A7 Processor Speed 2.3 GHz 1.3 GHz Screen Size 5 inches 4 inches Screen Type IPS LCD Retina Screen Resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels 1136 x 640 pixels Screen Pixels Per Inch 441 ppi 326 ppi Camera Resolution 4 MP Rear; 5 MP Front-Facing 8 MP Rear; 1.2 MP Front-Facing Video Camera Resolution 1080P 1080p Wireless Specification 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac 802.11 a/b/g/n Bluetooth Version 4.0 4.0 GPS Yes Yes NFC microSD Slot Yes No Colors Available Silver, Gray, Gold Space Gray, Gold, Silver Read the Review Read the Review\n\nIt's more difficult to compare performance between these two devices, as Android and iOS are completely different ecosystems. Both of these phones absolutely fly, though, so you shouldn't have any concerns there.\n\nOne of the biggest differences will be the cameras on either device. HTC stuck with its 4-megapixel, or Ultrapixel, sensor, which wasn't exactly an industry leader even last year. The new depth-sensing Duo Camera lets you add Lytro-like refocusing ability to your pics, but quality still isn't top-notch, from what we've seen. The iPhone 5s still produces more consistently with its 8-megapixel camera. But that's just rear-facing imaging—once you turn the digital eye on yourself, HTC pulls way ahead. The 5-megapixel front-facing camera on the One (M8) is hands down the best for selfies.\n\nBeyond that, there are a few unique features to each device. HTC has its IR-blaster while Apple has its Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The One also comes equipped with a microSD card slot, so you can add even more internal storage for a fraction of the price that Apple charges for its memory upgrades.\n\nThese two devices trade blows when it comes to design, and comparing Android to Apple, well, I'll just leave that up to you.

Jack Wallen takes an early look at the HTC One M8 and suffers phone envy for the first time ever.\n\nIt was my pleasure to step inside a Verizon store yesterday and get a first-hand look at the HTC One M8 before the device went on sale. It took about 30 seconds before I experienced some serious phone envy. Honestly, when you hold the M8 in your hands, it quickly becomes clear that you're holding the future of mobile devices in your hands. From the clean and modern case (carved from a single block of aluminum), to the amazing display, to the silky smoothness of Sense 6 — it all comes together to form one of the slickest device to date.\n\nThe specs of the M8 aren't shabby, but they're not particularly phenomenal:\n\nQuad-core CPU at 2.3 GHz\n\n32 GB onboard memory\n\n2 GB RAM\n\nSupport for up to 128 GB microSD card\n\n2600 mAh battery\n\nUsage up to 12 hours\n\nStandby up 12.2 days\n\nAs you can see, there's nothing truly special there. So, what is it that makes this such a game changer? What about the impeccable, clean lines (Figure A)?\n\nFigure A\n\nThe Verizon-branded HTC One M8.\n\nOr how about the amazingly clear five inches of full HD screen (Figure B)?\n\nFigure B\n\nThe HTC One M8 has a gorgeous display.\n\nAs for multimedia, no other phone can best the M8 when it comes to camera and sound. Let's take a close look at these two stellar features.\n\nCamera\n\nThe first thing I did when I had the M8 in my hand was fire up the camera app and see what was so special. After I picked myself up off the floor, I continued on with my exploration. Instead of boring you with the specs of the camera, let me just explain what it can do:\n\nUFocus: Bring photos into focus after they've been taken\n\nZoe highlights: Capture stills and video with one click\n\nDual capture: Take single picture using both cameras (rear-facing camera adds a picture in picture)\n\nPan 360 photos: Take amazing panoramic photos with ease\n\nEach of the above features not only work, but they work astoundingly well. This is the first smartphone camera that delivers 100% on the promises it made.\n\nSound\n\nI consider myself an audiophile. No smartphone sound can compare to the rich quality of wood cabinet speakers — like the difference between analog and digital (if you understand the difference, there’s no comparison). So, reading that the M8 sound is heads above the competition had me skeptical. For a simple test, I fired up a YouTube Iron Man premiere video.\n\nWords cannot actually described how surprised I was at the quality of sound this device pumped out. Using what HTC calls Boomsound and two front-facing speakers, you won't find another mobile device with audio nearly as good.\n\nThe sound is delivered with the help of a .85cc top speaker chamber, a .80cc bottom speaker chamber, and a special speaker membrane capable of boosting bass without distortion. The end result is a rich sound that in no way can be described with the usual descriptors for smartphones (tinny, hollow, or thin).\n\nBlinkfeed and Sense 6\n\nIf you’re looking for an alternative to Google Now’s Card system, Blinkfeed might be it. It’s a proprietary app that brings together your social feeds, sports scores, breaking news, and much more. There are over 10,000 sources that can be added to your Blinkfeed.\n\nHTC Sense 5 was already an impressive interface. The biggest improvement with Sense 6 and the M8 is the inclusion of the iR Blaster remote that works with Sense to create Sense TV. This is a graphic UI you use as a television/DVR remote and a program recommendation solution.\n\nHTC Advantage\n\nHere’s where things get really interesting, especially for those who intend on using the HTC One M8 as their business phone. Any new HTC One M8 phone that's purchased now will be automatically enrolled in the HTC Advantage program. With this, you get:\n\nFree cracked screen replacement\n\nFree 25 GB additional Google Drive space for two years\n\nSettings backed up in the cloud (in the event anything should happen to your phone)\n\nHands-on help via live chat or phone\n\nThat alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nWho needs such a device?\n\nOutside of anyone who wants the sexiest mobile device around, if you’re looking for a smartphone that will deliver the richest multimedia experience and has the most flexible mobile camera system on the market, the HTC One M8 is for you.\n\nThe HTC One M8 is now available for purchase.

Google is now offering pre-orders on the stock Android HTC ONE M8 Google Play Edition.\n\nAndroid skins like Samsung's TouchWiz, HTC's Sense and Amazon's Kindle Fire OS all try and make Android easier for people to use and also add some great proprietary features. There are some people who really like the design of these devices but prefer to run stock Android because of its quicker and straight to the point approach. Many Android smartphone owners go to great lengths to free their handsets from TouchWiz, HTC Sense and Amazon Fire by rooting their devices.\n\nRooting allows users to gain root access to give the user privileged control, what this does is it allows you to completely customize the software your smartphone runs, but is one way many people dump TouchWiz, HTC Sense, and Amazon Fire and run a stock version of Android. Last year, Google made the process easier for anyone who doesn't want to go through with hacking their handset's OS. Google introduced both a Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One Google Play Edition smartphones. It sells the smartphones unlocked and running the latest version of Android 4.4KitKat and like its Nexus smartphone and tablets, Google Play Edition devices come with a guarantee of receiving Android updates soon after Google releases them.\n\nGoogle has just added HTC's brand new HTC One M8 to its Google Play Edition lineup. The unlocked smartphone runs a stock version of Android 4.4.2 KitKat and is priced at $699.99 and has an expected shipping date of 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nGoogle highlights that the HTC One M8 Google Play Edition combines the best of HTC and the best of Google Play.

It also has HTC's dual front-facing stereo speakers that many reviewers have said are the best sounding smartphone speakers.\n\nThe true reason to buy this device over HTC's version with HTC Sense is the fact that you won't need to root the device to run the latest and greatest version of stock Android right out of the box.

48404,http://www.thestreet.com/story/12549024/1/review-htcs-one-m8-flagship-smartphone.html,technology,"['NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- It doesn\'t take long to know when you\'re in the presence of greatness. Which is why I can say that after living with and using the new HTC One M8 for a short period of time this is one heckuva great Android smartphone.\n\nI will tell you right off the bat that the new One isn\'t perfect. It\'s larger and slightly (0.6 oz) heavier than last year\'s One. And there are some things that have been left unsaid, such as the exact megapixel count for the new, dual-lens rear camera. But harping on those early observations would be nitpicking. Early on, I\'m learning the One is much, much more.\n\nThe One M8 has a super-fast (2.3 GHz) Qualcomm (QCOM - Get Report) Snapdragon 801 quad-core CPU, 2 GB of RAM and a beautiful 5-inch HD touchscreen. The phone will come with either 16 GB or 32 GB of internal storage and there\'s now a microSD card expansion slot for when you need to carry around more of everything.\n\nThe M8 runs on the latest version of Google\'s (GOOG - Get Report) Android OS - 4.4.2/Kit Kat - and uses what HTC jokingly described as its ""Sixth Sense"". It\'s really the sixth (and best so far) version of HTC\'s Sense screen layout app, which mines your personal Facebook (FB - Get Report), Twitter (TWTR - Get Report), email, SMS messages and a lot more, laying out everything in a separate information information stream on the phone\'s home screen. It is quite useful for quick checks and very addictive.\n\nThere\'s a large 5MP camera up-front and that twin-lens deal on the back. HTC doesn\'t specify the megapixel of the rear camera system. It\'s called the HTC UltraPixel and is said to sport a new ""ImageChip 2"" capable of producing large pixels though its large sensor and the primary 28 mm, f2.0 lens. It\'s capable of producing full 1080p videos. The second rear lens is for capturing ""depth information"" for each photo to help make future editing decisions a snap.\n\nWe\'re guessing the camera still measures 4 MP (same as last year\'s model) but those two lenses make a difference. In our early testing the back camera system seemed to produce even more terrific photos. There are so many new controls and features we\'ll happily be learning about/playing with them all over the next few months.\n\nFor the record, the 2013 HTC One (M7) had a 4.7-inch screen, that 4 megapixel rear camera, a Qualcomm (QCOM - Get Report) 600 processor, either 32 or 64 GB of internal storage (no SD card expansion was offered) and it ran on Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean). HTC also introduced a One Mini (4.3-inch screen) and One Max (5.9-inch display) in the months following.\n\nJust like with last year\'s model, if you hold the phone in the landscape (horizontal) position you realize that there are stereo speakers on the front of the phone. Two audio channels separated by the screen. As an extra bonus those speakers actually sound great - some of the best smartphone sound ever. HTC calls the system ""Boom Sound"". And boy can it play loud. It\'s like the volume control can go to ""11"". I never felt I had to max-out the volume control to ""rock out to the sounds"".\n\nThe One M8\'s performance has been stellar so far. Everything works smoothly and quickly. Very quickly, as a matter of fact. The M8 also stays cool to the touch even after taxing requests like streaming video for an hour or two. Last year\'s One sometime got a little warm to the touch under the same test conditions.\n\nAs for reserve power, we found the new 2600mAh battery should be able to last through an average full day\'s use, including set-up, playing, streaming, downloading, reading, talking, shooting/editing photos/videos. In short, everything you might want to do with a modern-day smartphone.\n\nAs with any new smartphone, the One M8 also has a slew of new accessories. There is one in particular you need to know about. It\'s called the ""Dot View"". It is a rubberized-plastic cover - front and back - which protects the phone. But the front is a grid of see-through dots and it uses the phone\'s internal proximity sensors to present the user with a rudimentary but incredibly useful view of the current time and message icon. It is a very clever idea which can be initiated by double-tapping the front cover.\n\nOverall, the phone is a winner. And, HTC\'s decision to make the handset available immediately after the announcement (U.S. and UK.) was a brilliant marketing ploy. A quick jump start in two of the world\'s most competitive, high-end smartphone markets is something other manufacturers will probably want to emulate in the very near future.\n\nAnd, those other manufacturers aren\'t standing still. There are new flagship phones coming in the next few months from Samsung (Galaxy S5), LG (G3) and Apple (AAPL - Get Report) (iPhone 6) just to name a few. HTC needs this M8 to be a success and if our testing is any indication, the new One could put up a good fight.\n\nVerizon (VZ - Get Report) has the One M8 in its stores right now. And you can order it from AT&T (T - Get Report), Sprint (S - Get Report) and T-Mobile (TMUS - Get Report) immediately or wait until April 11 to buy one in person at their retail shops. Expect to pay somewhere in the $200-$250 range with a contract or $650 or so without contract. There are also special Google Play and HTC Developer editions of the M8 available on those companies\' respective Web sites.\n\nWritten by Gary Krakow in New York.\n\nTo submit a news tip, send an email to tips@thestreet.com.', ""Which is why I can say that after living with and using the new HTC One M8 for a short period of time this is one heckuva great Android smartphone.\nAnd there are some things that have been left unsaid, such as the exact megapixel count for the new, dual-lens rear camera.\nHTC doesn't specify the megapixel of the rear camera system.\nIn our early testing the back camera system seemed to produce even more terrific photos.\nThere are also special Google Play and HTC Developer editions of the M8 available on those companies' respective Web sites.""]"

The screen size increases to from 4.7 to 5 inches, the new model has a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor running Android 4.4 'KitKat' along with 2GB of RAM. The phone will also feature the all-new HTC Sense 6, available on the device and as an upgrade from the Google Play store. Storage can be 16 or 32GB, but owners can increase the space with a microSD card. The software upgrade that comes with HTC Sense 6 includes a striking visual style, new cusomisable colour themes, and more personal user experience.\n\nThe exterior design remains somewhat the same, with the exception of the edges getting a metal finish.\n\nPeter Chou, CEO, HTC said: “In 2013 we introduced the best smartphone in the world, but we never stopped challenging ourselves and the status quo in this category. As pioneers in mobile innovation, we continue to design and build devices that will dazzle, inspire and transform the smartphone industry. Today I’m proud to launch the most stunning, intuitive and advanced handset that the industry has seen to date, the new HTC One (M8).”\n\nThe HTC One (M8) combines various features of mobile imaging by being the world’s first smartphone with a Duo Camera that features HTC’s innovative HTC UltraPixel module, a dual colour flash and full 1080p HD video recording. These features produce images that work well in all lighting conditions as well as high-quality video. A 5-MP wide-angle front facing camera would also capture great images, apt for people who love taking selfies.\n\nThe camera also includes several modified and new features like Slow Motion mode, Gallery Organisation, intelligent LED Dual Flash, and the HTC UltraPixel module.\n\nIn addition to having the advanced touch feature technology that HTC has been running on, the phone also will have HTC Dot View - a sixth sense functionality. It works on the Motion Launch technology by which you double tap the dot view case, which allows you to check the time, weather, new texts, emails and calls - without touching or revealing the screen.\n\nThe phone will also have new advanced features in the layout, audio output and has a better power saving mode than past models. It delivers 60 hours of extra standby time at 20% power, 30 hours at 10% power and 15 hours at 5% power.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the M8 is the HTC Sense TV which provides an interactive second screen. The feature allows you to follow conversations about a particular program online with integrated Facebook and Twitter streams as well as the latest fan commentary from your social circles. HTC Sense TV also includes live sports statistics and updates for the 10 most popular sports in the world.\n\nAccording to HTC, The HTC One (M8) will be available globally in Gunmetal Gray, Glacial Silver and will be rolled out in the South Asia region in the coming weeks.\n\nThe price is still to be announced.\n\nAlso View HTC one M8 in photos"", 'The phone will also feature the all-new HTC Sense 6, available on the device and as an upgrade from the Google Play store.\nThe software upgrade that comes with HTC Sense 6 includes a striking visual style, new cusomisable colour themes, and more personal user experience.\nAnother interesting feature of the M8 is the HTC Sense TV which provides an interactive second screen.\nHTC Sense TV also includes live sports statistics and updates for the 10 most popular sports in the world.\nAlso View HTC one M8 in photos']"

And unlike the original One , the new version sports a microSD card slot. Good stuff, though if you\'re looking for an Achilles Heel, the folks at iFixIt have found one.Like its predecessor, the HTC One M8 isn\'t a repair-friendly device. Getting it open requires heating up the adhesive to soften the glue, and then prying off the speaker grill with a thin object like a guitar pick. There are screws underneath, and once removed, the handset separates into two parts.Unfortunately, that\'s where Easy St. comes to a dead end. Things quickly turn ""ugly"" when diving any deeper into the One M8, which is littered with tape, tape, and more tape. Your reward for getting past all that tape is a series of 10 cables that need to be disconnected so that you can focus on the glued down motherboard.Why would anyone need to gut a smartphone like that? To be fair, most people won\'t. However, it\'s the only way to get to the \'non-removable\' battery, which could come into play if the handset is out of its warranty period. Non-removable batteries aren\'t always easy to get to, but they\'re usually not buried underneath a glued-down motherboard, either.When all was said and done, iFixIt gave the HTC One M8 a 2 out of 10 Repairability Score, which is one point higher than the original One.

48418,http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/03/25/htc-updates-flagship-one-_n_5029131.html,technology,"['NEW YORK, N.Y. - HTC is updating its flagship HTC One smartphone by giving it a larger screen, better software and a camera that\'s easier to use.\n\nThe original HTC One received good reviews and was named the best smartphone of 2013 at the wireless industry\'s premier trade show in Barcelona, Spain, last month. But HTC has failed to translate that glowing praise into sales. According to Gartner, HTC had less than 5 per cent of the worldwide smartphone market in 2013.\n\nHTC executives acknowledge that the company made several operational mistakes in releasing last year\'s phone, including the fact that customers of the leading U.S. wireless carrier, Verizon Wireless, weren\'t able to buy it until months after its launch. This time, the phone will be available right away through all the major carriers. Online orders start Tuesday, while retail stores will get them on April 10. It will cost about $200 to $250 with a two-year service contract, or about $650 without a contract.\n\nHTC also plans aggressive marketing, including the heavy use of cable and broadcast television ads. The goal is to reach tech-savvy consumers and trend-setters who are likely to recommend the phone to friends. The company didn\'t specify how much it plans to spend, but executives said it won\'t try to match Samsung dollar for dollar.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co. currently dominates the global smartphone market. Last year, the Korean company had a 31 per cent market share compared with Apple Inc.\'s 16 per cent. Samsung, in particular, is notorious for its heavy marketing. The company spent nearly 4.6 trillion won ($4.3 billion) in advertising in the 12 months through September, about four times the $1.1 billion Apple spent in the same period, the latest for which figures were available. Although Samsung also makes TVs, refrigerators and other products, analysts believe much of the marketing is for newer products such as phones.\n\nTo break through, HTC plans to emphasize the One\'s all-metal design. Samsung\'s phones typically have a plastic back panel, while Apple\'s iPhones use glass. HTC\'s design chief, Scott Croyle, said about 90 per cent of the One\'s back and sides will be made of metal, but the phone\'s manufactured in a way that makes it tough to tell where the metal ends and where the composite strips begin. Croyle calls it ""zero-gap construction.""\n\nThe new phone will have a screen measuring 5 inches diagonally, up from 4.7 inches in last year\'s model. It will help software improvements designed to anticipate your needs, such as offering lunch recommendations when it\'s time for lunch. That will come through HTC\'s hub for personalized content, known as BlinkFeed. BlinkFeed itself will be more colorful and will continue to present news, social media updates and other items of interest.\n\nHTC continues its philosophy of steering people away from the megapixel count in cameras, saying that more isn\'t necessarily better. Like the original model, the new HTC One has a 4 megapixel rear camera, which is low for high-end smartphones. Instead, HTC focuses on making the individual pixel sensors larger, so that they can capture more light and offer better shots in low-light settings. The front camera, for selfies, is improved, though — at 5 megapixels, compared with 2.1 megapixels before.', ""NEW YORK, N.Y. - HTC is updating its flagship HTC One smartphone by giving it a larger screen, better software and a camera that's easier to use.\nAccording to Gartner, HTC had less than 5 per cent of the worldwide smartphone market in 2013.\nHTC also plans aggressive marketing, including the heavy use of cable and broadcast television ads.\nLast year, the Korean company had a 31 per cent market share compared with Apple Inc.'s 16 per cent.\nTo break through, HTC plans to emphasize the One's all-metal design.""]"
48419,http://www.businessinsider.in/The-Best-Android-Phone-You-Can-Buy-Just-Got-Better/articleshow/32678028.cms,technology,"['HTC hit a critical home run last year with its flagship phone called the One.\n\nIt was the first mainstream Android device that felt like a premium product thanks to its metal body, big screen, and gorgeous design. Until the One came along, most Android phones felt like cheap plastic slates desperate to catch up to the iPhone\'s lead in design and build quality.\n\nAnd reviewers went nuts for the One. Simply put, it was the best Android phone you could buy.\n\nToday, HTC announced its new model of the One, which keeps the same name and improves just about everything that was great about the original. It has a slightly bigger screen (5 inches), two rear cameras (more on that in a bit), and a cleaner software interface. It\'s just as beautiful and well constructed as the original.\n\nThere\'s a lot to go over, so here are the most important new features:\n\nThe HTC One runs the latest version of Android called KitKat. That means you get all the best Android features and services from Google like the great voice assistant Google Now.\n\nIt comes in three colors: silver, dark gray, and gold.\n\nBlinkFeed, an app that pulls in news from social networks like Twitter and Facebook plus a variety of other established news sources, has a cleaner design. You can also create your own custom feeds for news around a certain topic, like the missing Malaysian Airlines flight.\n\nThere are two cameras on the back. The primary camera is for snapping photos. The smaller one is a depth sensor that lets you edit photos and change the focus later. It results in some really cool effects.\n\nHTC added a microSD card slot that will let you add up to an extra 128 GB of storage. You can buy the One with 16 GB or 32 GB of internal storage.\n\nLike the original model, the new One has two front-facing speakers, which HTC calls ""Boomsound."" This time, HTC added some more amplifiers so you get a deeper sound.\n\nThe new One has a bunch of features that you can activate even when the screen is off. For example, you can wake up the phone just by double tapping on the screen. If you swipe in certain directions when the screen is off, you can launch straight to your home screen, BlinkFeed, the phone dialer, or your widgets. If you turn the phone horizontally and press the volume down button when the phone is off, the camera app automatically launches.\n\nYou can buy an optional case called Dot View for an extra $49. Dot View flips over the phone\'s screen and displays stuff like the time, weather, and incoming calls with lights that shine through dozens of little holes in the case. It\'s really clever.\n\nHTC let me get an early look at the new One. I\'ve only spent about 24 hours with the device, so I won\'t have a full, in-depth review for you until later this week. In the meantime, here are a few first impressions.\n\nIn short, the new One is gorgeous, possibly better looking than the iPhone 5S, which is starting to feel stale after keeping the same design for two years.\n\nThe dual cameras don\'t seem too useful to me. You can get some nifty effects thanks to the secondary depth sensor, but I imagine most people won\'t want to go back and edit photos they\'ve already taken. Still, it takes great regular shots just like the original One phone and the front-facing camera is five megapixels, which is much higher than front-facing cameras on competing devices. Your selfies will look great.\n\nOther than that, it doesn\'t look like anything major has changed with the new One. HTC made incremental improvements to the important stuff like screen size, design, and camera.\n\nIt feels like we have another winner.', 'It was the first mainstream Android device that felt like a premium product thanks to its metal body, big screen, and gorgeous design.\nSimply put, it was the best Android phone you could buy.\nThat means you get all the best Android features and services from Google like the great voice assistant Google Now.\nIf you turn the phone horizontally and press the volume down button when the phone is off, the camera app automatically launches.\nYour selfies will look great.']"

The HTC One M8 is available in both standard and Google Play Edition models.\n\nIn terms of design, the brand new HTC One looks very similar to its predecessor, rocking a sleek and elegant aluminum unibody design that looks and feels more premium than many other flagship handsets on the market. The new iteration, however, boasts a larger display, more advanced internals, better software, and is faster, smoother, and better in every way compared to the 2013 HTC One.\n\nHTC One M8 Specs\n\nCore specifications of the new HTC One M8 include a larger 5-inch Super LCD3 display with a full HD resolution of 1920 x 1080 and a pixel density of 441 pixels per inch (ppi), as well as Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Under the hood, the new powerhouse packs the latest quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor clocked at 2.3GHz (2.5GHz in Asia), 2GB of RAM, and Adreno 330 graphics. The handset comes in 16GB or 32GB internal storage configurations, but this time it sports a microSD card (something the original HTC One lacks) for additional memory of up to 128GB.\n\nIn terms of connectivity, the HTC One M8 will work on any 2G, 3G, or 4G network, and it supports dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0, and NFC. On the camera side, the smartphone boasts a dual camera setup on its rear, with dual-lens ""Duo Camera"" with UltraPixel technology, dual LED Smart Flash and BSI sensor, and a 5-megapixel front-facing shooter.\n\nThe HTC One M8 rocks Android 4.4 KitKat out of the box with HTC\'s latest Sense 6.0 UI on top, and is powered by a large 2,600 mAh non-removable battery.\n\nStandout Features\n\nStandout features include a revamped BoomSound that comes with better speakers, louder and clearer sound, and improved tuning. HTC Sense 6.0 also boasts a complete redesign with a neat new modern look, new colors, and flatter icons. HTC has tweaked colors, textures, and fonts to make everything look sleeker and better.\n\nThe company has also improved the popular BlinkFeed, HTC TV, and other apps, adding new features for a superior user experience.\n\nAs for the innovative Duo Camera setup on the rear of the new HTC One M8, the whole system sounds quite interesting. The second rear camera lens is designed to record depth information while the main lens takes a photo, which should result in a better camera performance that takes full advantage of HTC\'s UltraPixel technology.\n\nMoreover, HTC has also added a new ""Sensor Hub"" that tracks the user\'s movements to count steps and enable several motion, tap, and swipe gestures for when the display is off. Double-tapping on the phone\'s screen, for instance, will wake the HTC One M8 from sleep, while swiping to the right from sleep mode will unlock the phone straight into the BlinkFeed screen.\n\nThe new ""extreme power saving mode"" is also worth mentioning, as it aims to considerably extend the phone\'s battery life. To do so, this mode will disable background data, allowing access only to voice calling, text messaging, and email. HTC touts that its new extreme power saving mode will keep a phone with only 5% battery left up and running for another 15 hours. A fully charged HTC One M8 will reportedly last for two weeks with this mode enabled.\n\nLastly, it\'s also exciting to have the HTC One M8 available immediately after its announcement, in both the standard version and the Google Play Edition. The regular HTC One M8 model is available from HTC on Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon Wireless, starting at $199.99, while the GPE model is on sale for $699 on the Google Play store.\n\n© Copyright 2018 Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.

Hanson and Scatterbrain. And of course our HTC-loving ""employee of Apple"". The one feature we haven\'t seen on a smartphone before is UFocus - that\'s the ability to refocus photos after you\'ve taken them, so you can change the subject of your image after you\'ve taken it. We\'re impressed that the One (M8) has bottled the Lytro camera\'s superpowers in its depth sensor camera. Lytro was an excellent idea but it was an expensive standalone camera with a tiny screen and limited appeal.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 boasts a similar feature, albeit thanks to software trickery, so we\'ll be putting the two head to head when we get an S5 to test - based on our S4 and HTC One comparisons, the Samsung should have the stronger camera overall with more detail than One (M8)\'s four UltraPixels can offer.\n\nElsewhere, the microSD support, tweaks to BlinkFeed and Extreme Power Saving mode are all useful additions to the original HTC One.

The phone is already available to order from AT&T(s t), Sprint(s s) and Verizon(s vz), or you can even stop by a Verizon store and pick one up right now. And as befits such a quick turnaround, the reviews have already started to appear as well.\n\nIn general, it looks like the new HTC One is a winner. The praise is nearly unanimous for the phone’s sleek, compelling design, and beautiful 5-inch display. But opinions are mixed on the M8’s camera, which comes with a wealth of interesting features, but doesn’t actually snap the best photos.\n\nBelow are some highlights to give you a sense of what everyone is saying.\n\nBGR’s Zach Epstein was impressed by pretty much everything about the M8, naming it the best Android smartphone yet.\n\nIt is considered poor form to begin a review with the conclusion, but there’s really no reason to drag this out: the HTC One (M8) is the best Android phone the world has ever seen. Period. Full stop. Of this, there is no doubt. In many ways, in fact, it is the best smartphone the world has ever seen. From the design of the device to the power of its components and everything in between, HTC’s new One better than its predecessor.\n\nBrian Bennett at CNET was taken by the phone’s design, comparing if favorably even against the ultra-sleek Sony Xperiz Z2.\n\nDesign-wise, this certainly sets the bar high for any subsequent smartphone, let alone an HTC One follow-up. I can confirm though the new HTC One M8 is one heck of a handsome device, the sexiest smartphone I’ve seen all year in fact (including the Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z2). While HTC’s latest creation is more conservatively-styled than the previous One, its has a look that’s just as premium.\n\nHTC didn’t skimp on performance, according to Laptop’s Dan Howley. The phone had no trouble handling any task that was thrown its way.\n\nHTC packed the One M8 with Qualcomm’s powerful quad-core 2.3-GHz Snapdragon 801 processor, 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. And unlike the original One, the new One also includes a 64GB microSD card slot, so you’ll have plenty of storage space for all your favorite movies, music and photos. During our time with the One, we were impressed by its powerful performance. Resource-intensive games such as “N.O.V.A. 3” were buttery smooth and looked better than we’ve seen on most other smartphones. Apps opened and closed in the blink of an eye, and the camera fired off photos instantaneously.\n\nOver at PCMag, Sascha Segan wasn’t too happy with the phone’s camera performance. When it comes to phone’s 4-megapixel “UltraPixel” camera, it appears that less megapixels is less.\n\nHTC’s main UltraPixel camera, on the other hand, may be an idea that should have been left behind. The concept is to use larger pixels to get less noise in a 4-megapixel image. The photos I took weren’t impressive: I saw tons of visible compression artifacting and weak, unsaturated colors. The camera had some trouble with dynamic range, washing out objects near a bright sky, and HDR mode didn’t help much.\n\nThe Verge’s David Pierce thinks the phone has an even better display than the previous model, even though the pixel density isn’t as high.\n\nThe 5-inch screen that covers the device’s front is a gorgeous 1080p panel, with nearly perfect color representation and a measure of brightness and pop that even last year’s model can’t match. It’s actually slightly less pixel-dense than last year’s model, but I can’t tell the difference — this display is lovely to look at.\n\nWe plan to follow up with our own thoughts after spending time with the new HTC One, but so far it looks like HTC has given Samsung something to worry about.', 'After months of rumors and speculation, HTC finally unveiled the HTC One M8 on Tuesday.\nBut opinions are mixed on the M8’s camera, which comes with a wealth of interesting features, but doesn’t actually snap the best photos.\nBGR’s Zach Epstein was impressed by pretty much everything about the M8, naming it the best Android smartphone yet.\nHTC packed the One M8 with Qualcomm’s powerful quad-core 2.3-GHz Snapdragon 801 processor, 2GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage.\nOver at PCMag, Sascha Segan wasn’t too happy with the phone’s camera performance.']"

It also doesn’t help that the “mini” versions of these phones are still often quite large (we could barely tell the difference between the original HTC One and HTC One Mini ).\n\nWe long for the moment when one of these OEMs break the status quo and bring us a mini device that’s as powerful as the flagship. Sony was one of the first to do this with the Xperia Z1 Compact, and Motorola’s DROID Mini wasn’t terrible alongside the rest of the devices in that family, but that’s not nearly enough to satiate us.\n\nThe spin-off train might not stop there, though, with the same leakster teasing an “HTC One M8 Ace,” as well. There’s no telling what this device would be in terms of specs or size, but the last time a company brought out a device with “Ace” in its name we wanted nothing to do with it. Take that for what you will.', 'We’d be lying if we said we didn’t think HTC would create a couple of spin-off devices based on the newly-announced HTC One M8.\nRumors are already getting started, though, with @evleaks suggesting the HTC One M8 Mini is already in the works.\nIt also doesn’t help that the “mini” versions of these phones are still often quite large (we could barely tell the difference between the original HTC One and HTC One Mini ).\nWe long for the moment when one of these OEMs break the status quo and bring us a mini device that’s as powerful as the flagship.\nThe spin-off train might not stop there, though, with the same leakster teasing an “HTC One M8 Ace,” as well.']"

The local roll out of Samsung\'s latest Galaxy will take place a whole 10 days after HTC\'s One M8 is released.\n\nSamsung has revealed the Australian version of the Galaxy S5 will come with a quad-core 2.5GHz CPU--and not the eight-core Exynos 5 CPU--at its Australian launch event held at the Museum of Contemporary Arts.\n\nWhat\'s new, Galaxy?\n\nSeveral innovations separate the next generation Galaxy S5 from its predecessor, including IP67 certification, a higher resolution camera and biometric features.\n\nSamsung has taken a page from Sony\'s books by giving the S5 tough credentials. The Galaxy S5 can be plunged into water one metre deep for thirty minutes, and it is protected from the ingression of dust. Customers would traditionally have to settle for the less capable (and less attractive) Galaxy Active for such ruggedness.\n\nPhotos will be captured at twice the resolution with a new 16MP camera. The improved S5 camera can autofocus in 0.3 of a second, benefits from phase detection and has advanced shooting modes such as high dynamic range (HDR).\n\nVideos captured with the Galaxy S5 can be recorded in the upcoming Ultra high-definition (UHD, aka 4K) standard. Ultra high-definition videos capture four times the detail of the current Full HD standard.\n\nBiometrics is a strong focus of the Galaxy S5. A finger scanner safeguards data housed on the smartphone in a fashion similar to that of Apple\'s TouchID. However, Samsung has taken it one step further by allowing S5 owners to make payments with the swipe of a finger.\n\nSamsung has continually innovated the connectivity repertoire of its Galaxy range. The Galaxy S5 continues this tradition by bonding the latest Wi-Fi ac standard with cellular 4G LTE technology in a new a feature called \'Download Booster\'. The result is the downloading of a gigabyte movie in just thirty seconds, Samsung claims.\n\n5.1in screen, Australia\'s Quad-core CPU\n\nSamsung has made little changes to the display used on the Galaxy S5. The Super AMOLED panel supports a 1920x1080 (Full HD resolution) over a marginally larger 5.1-inches. This gives the smartphone a density of 432 pixels-per-inch.\n\nAndroid\'s latest version 4.4 KitKat will be used on the device, along with a less cluttered version of Samsung\'s proprietary TouchWiz overly. Simplifying the user interface of the Galaxy S5 is one way Samsung is going ""back to basics"".\n\nPowering the Galaxy S5 in Australia will be a quad-core 2.5GHz CPU, 2GB of RAM and up to 32GB of internal storage. Support for microSDXC memory cards make it possible to expand storage by an additional 64GB.\n\nInterestingly, Samsung has not increased the RAM in its Galaxy S5. This is contrary to flagships from Sony and LG opting for 3GB of RAM.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 has a new perforated back cover that can be removed. Under it is a 2800 milliamp-hour battery that, when in \'ultra power saving mode\', can deliver 24 hours of standby battery from just 10 per cent charge. The new mode achieves this by deactivating superfluous features and reverting to a black-and-white only display.\n\nSamsung will be offering its Galaxy S5 in four colours locally: Electric Blue, Copper Gold, Shimmer White and Charcoal Black.\n\nAustralian availability\n\nAustralians will be able to walk into a store empty handed and walk out with a pristine Galaxy S5 on the 11 April. Australia\'s big four carriers have already announced they will be ranging the smartphone.

Here are their final thoughts:\n\nIt’s very difficult—although no longer impossible—to open the device without damaging the rear case.

If you’re still craving a more intimate look at HTC’s new flagship, you’re in luck.\n\nAs usual, the crew at iFixit have gotten their hands on the new hotness and torn it down with glee. Well, glee, spudgers, screwdrivers, and liberal applications of heat. Things were slightly better this time around, but the bar was set pretty low by the original HTC One. iFixit awarded it the worst repairability score of all time.\n\nThe teardown looked promising at the start. After softening the glue that holds the One’s brushed metal back in place, iFixit was thrilled to discover a few screws inside. Screws are always a welcome sight, and they tend to boost repairability marks significantly. Unfortunately, HTC went right back to its old tricks.\n\nBuried beneath ten ribbon cables and what iFixit refers jokingly to as “the entire Earth’s supply of tape,” is the new HTC One’s main board. It’s equipped with that beastly Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 quad-core chip, 2GB of Elpida RAM, and 32GB of NAND flash from SanDisk. It’s also glued to the battery, which underscores how unlikely it is that you’re ever going to replace it on your own.\n\nGetting the battery out also means loosening adhesive from its other side, as it has been glued to the back of the display shield.

In the process of popping it out, however, iFixit happened to shove their guitar pick in an unfortunate spot and wound up severing the ribbon cable. It proved to be quite a difficult removal, so let’s hope that the men and women who will be doing all those free one-time screen replacements are being rewarded handsomely for their toil.', 'The HTC One M8 launched yesterday, and you may have already read some initial impressions about it and seen the cool Lite-Brite style case HTC whipped up.\nThings were slightly better this time around, but the bar was set pretty low by the original HTC One.\nAfter softening the glue that holds the One’s brushed metal back in place, iFixit was thrilled to discover a few screws inside.\nBuried beneath ten ribbon cables and what iFixit refers jokingly to as “the entire Earth’s supply of tape,” is the new HTC One’s main board.\nAs for the daughter board that holds the One’s UltraPixel camera, vibration motor, and other top-mounted tech… it’s glued in place, too.']"

48445,http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/round-table-is-htc-one-m8-a-worthy-opponent-against-samsung-and-sony-flagships-220478.html,technology,"[""tech2 News Staff\n\nThe HTC One M8 is finally here and immediately, the inevitable comparisons ensue. The One M8 will go on to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Sony Xperia Z2 so far. LG has yet to unveil the successor to the G2, which will be the fourth contender in the group. The M8 is an evolutionary upgrade to HTC's previous flagship and the focus seems to be heavily centered around the design. But in doing so, HTC seems to have neglected other key aspects of what makes flagship smartphone in today's day and age. Could this neglect cost them a spot amongst the top three smartphones of 2014?\n\nRoydon Cerejo\n\nThere's no denying the fact that the One M8 will go down in history as one of the most beautifully crafted smartphones of all time. In fact, HTC has consistently churned out stunner after stunner in their One series. Design is one of the pivotal aspects of the phone and I don't think the other flagships even come close to what HTC has achieved. But that seems to be the whole and soul of the phone as there really isn't much else that's substantial enough for you to sit up and take notice. They've increased the screen a bit, dropped in a faster chipset and tweaked around with the skin a bit. Yes, battery life has gotten better but that's to be expected when you use a more efficient CPU and a larger battery. The depth sensing camera also sounds a bit gimmicky to be honest.\n\nI'm all for a superbly designed phone, I really am. But when I'm paying upwards of Rs 40,000 on a phone, I expect to get the best of everything. One of the biggest drawbacks of the M8 in my eyes is that HTC went ahead with the same Ultrapixel camera from last year's model. Behind the whole marketing spiel that is Ultrapixel, it does snap pictures at just 4MP and that's not good enough for a flagship device. Compare this to Samsung's 16MP and Sony's 20.7MP sensor and suddenly the chinks give way to deep gashes in the M8's armor. The One M8 will definitely sweep the title of the 'best looking' phone of 2014 but sadly, it already feels like a tough sell when you consider the whole package.\n\nShruti Dhapola\n\nHTC's new smartphone, the HTC One M8 looks pretty much like its predecessor and the Taiwanese company seems to have stuck with the same design and look. Dual speakers on the front, Snapdragon quad-core processor, a slightly bigger screen (from 4.7-inches to 5-inches). As far as its rivals go, it would be unfair to say that HTC hasn't done enough. New premium smartphones don't have much to offer nowadays other than a bigger screen, more megapixels in the camera and a better processor.\n\nThe only problem for HTC is that it has stuck to the 4 megapixel camera, when in consumer perception, more megapixels mean a better smartphone camera. A lot of users might not be comfortable paying a high price for a premium smartphone with a 4 megapixel camera. HTC has tried to stand out in the market by talking about Ultrapixels, but given the response that the HTC One got in 2013, it should be clear, that this marketing strategy hasn't paid off and is unlikely to work in 2014 either.\n\nNikhil Subramaniam\n\nYear after year, we wait for the next HTC flagship to see how the Taiwanese manufacturer will finally challenge Samsung's monopoly on the Android smartphone market. Year after year, HTC brings the fight right to Samsung's doorstep, but loses steam just when it needs to punch.\n\nSadly, that's the case this year too. The HTC One M8 looks great. The hardware is great, the design typically stellar, surpassing even the iPhone 5s in my opinion, and there are a ton of innovative software features too which should make it a pleasure to use. Everything seems to be just perfect.\n\nEverything but the camera. One would have thought that HTC would have improved the one glaring disadvantage in the 2013 One after the underwhelming reviews. The Ultrapixel camera on the One was its major pitfall and it's making a reappearance, with tweaked imaging software, to improve some of the picture quality. Nevertheless early reviews state that it's not that much of an improvement, if at all.\n\nYes, there's the so-called Duo Camera, but how many of us want to tinker with the focus of an image after it's taken? How many even venture into the picture editor to resharpen an image right now or to make the colours pop more?\n\nHTC should have instead built on the Ultrapixel technology and blown our minds with an 8-megapixel camera or thereabouts with larger pixel size, so that detail and colour reproduction are at par with the competition. Some may say it's just a camera, and it doesn't matter because phones are not supposed to be cameras. But at a time, when point-and-shoots are becoming increasingly irrelevant in the light of superb camera phones, HTC has missed a huge beat.\n\nInstead what we have is an hamstrung flagship, one which could have been a sellout; it could have been a blockbuster and given Samsung real cause for concern.

In conclusion, I would say HTC has done a lot to make the M8 a worthy challenger, but it seems to have fallen short again."", ""The One M8 will go on to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Sony Xperia Z2 so far.\nBut in doing so, HTC seems to have neglected other key aspects of what makes flagship smartphone in today's day and age.\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of the M8 in my eyes is that HTC went ahead with the same Ultrapixel camera from last year's model.\nThe only problem for HTC is that it has stuck to the 4 megapixel camera, when in consumer perception, more megapixels mean a better smartphone camera.\nThe Ultrapixel camera on the One was its major pitfall and it's making a reappearance, with tweaked imaging software, to improve some of the picture quality.""]"

Christened HTC One (M8), the smartphone comes with a larger screen, 4G LTE support for India, and a host of other feature and specification changes. Here is a low-down on everything you need to know about the device, from its specifications, a comparison with its predecessor, to its tentative launch date for the country.\n\nSpecifications\n\nThe smartphone features a 5 inch full HD Super LCD3 capacitive touchscreen display (1920Ã—1080 pixel resolution) with 441 pixels per inch pixel density and runs on the latest Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) operating system with HTC Sense. It is powered by a 2.3 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and has 2 GB RAM. In terms of internal memory, users can choose between 16 and 32 GB models, which can be further expanded up to 128GB with a microSD card.\n\nHTC One (M8) has a 4 megapixel HTC UltraPixel rear camera (has BSI sensor and an HTC ImageChip 2) with duo camera setup and dual-LED Flash. The rear camera can also record full high definition videos (1080p) at 30 frames per second and slow motion HD videos (720p) at 60 fps. Plus, it has a 5 MP secondary front-facing camera that can record full HD videos as well.\n\nWhy the Duo camera?\n\nThe Duo Camera boasts a depth sensor in addition to the main HTC UltraPixel module, capturing detailed depth information from a scene and enabling a range of effects that allow you to do more with your images. The advanced camera technology also works behind-the-scenes capturing images right from launch, so that when the shutter is activated, the sharpest possible image is instantly displayed. Also, when the flash is required, the LED Dual Flash automatically selects the exact colour tone and light intensity for more natural skin tones and a professional-looking shot.\n\nOn the connectivity front, the device has Infrared, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, 3G, Near Field Communication (NFC) and 4G LTE. It also has a microUSB port and a microSD card slot. HTC has provided a 2,600 mAh battery in the device, which it claims will provide up to 20 hours of talk time and 496 hours of standby time on 3G. The dimensions of the device are 146.36 mm x 70.6 mm x 9.35 mm and its weight is 160 gm. It has GPS (with A-GPS support) and a stereo FM radio with RDS. It has a high quality metal unibody and will be available in gunmetal gray, glacial silver, and amber gold colours.\n\nAdditional features\n\nAll-new HTC Sense 6: Has been completely redesigned with a cleaner, more striking visual style. Also comes with 'Motion Launch' feature, which is immediately able to detect the smartphones' position and movement, thanks to built-in motion sensors that allow you to interact with the phone without turning on the screen. A simple swipe will activate the device, Auto Answer allows you to answer a call by putting the phone to your ear without touching the screen, and a double tap turns the lock screen on and off.\n\nHTC BoomSound gets bigger: Delivering sound that is 25 per cent louder than the HTC One (M7), without compromising quality, the new HTC One (M8) has dual frontal stereo speakers with a new amplifier, redesigned speaker chambers and a tailored audio profile.\n\nThe smartphone comes with HTC BlinkFeed, which is basically a live stream of relevant information such as social updates, entertainment and lifestyle updates, news and photos on the home screen itself. It aggregates the latest content in one place, without the need to jump between multiple apps. The device also comes with normal and extreme power saving modes, which when activated (either manually or automatically), delivers 60 hours of extra standby time at 20 per cent power, 30 hours at 10 per cent power and 15 hours at 5 per cent power.\n\nHTC One (M8) Vs HTC One (M7)\n\nIn comparison, the original HTC One (M7) has a 4.7 inch full HD Super LCD3 capacitive touchscreen display (1920Ã—1080 pixel resolution) with 468 ppi pixel density. It is powered by a Qualcomm 1.7 GHz quad-core processor, has 2 GB RAM and in terms of internal memory, users can choose between 32 and 64 GB models.\n\nThe smartphone has a 4 megapixel HTC UltraPixel camera (with BSI sensor and an HTC ImageChip 2) with 'smart flash' that can record full high definition videos (1080p) at 30 frames per second, and a 2 MP front-facing camera that can also record full HD videos. On the connectivity front, the device has Infrared, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, 3G and a microUSB port. It has a 2,300 mAh battery and comes with A-GPS support and NFC. HTC One measures 137.4mm x 68.2mm x 9.3mm and weighs 143 gm.\n\nHere is an introductory video of the HTC One M8\n\nPricing & India launch date\n\nWhile the original HTC One was launched in India last April for Rs 42,900, it is currently available for as low as Rs 38,700 on a number of e-commerce stores. Considering the specifications of its successor, we are expecting a close to Rs 50,000 pricing in India. According to HTC, the smartphone will hit Indian shores by the third week of April.\n\nIn terms of competition, it will face of against the likes of Apple's iPhone 5S (starting at Rs 48,300 for the 16GB model), Sony Xperia Z2, Nokia Lumia 1020 (Rs 40,650), LG G2 (Rs 38,999), and the recently launched Samsung Galaxy S5 (price not available as of now), among others."", 'After a long series of rumours, speculations and leaks about the same, HTC has finally launched the successor to its flagship device HTC One.\nChristened HTC One (M8), the smartphone comes with a larger screen, 4G LTE support for India, and a host of other feature and specification changes.\nHTC One (M8) has a 4 megapixel HTC UltraPixel rear camera (has BSI sensor and an HTC ImageChip 2) with duo camera setup and dual-LED Flash.\nThe rear camera can also record full high definition videos (1080p) at 30 frames per second and slow motion HD videos (720p) at 60 fps.\nPlus, it has a 5 MP secondary front-facing camera that can record full HD videos as well.']"

Duo Camera\n\nThe highlight of the HTC One (M8) of course is dual rear camera setup with depth perception. While the main camera is the same 4-UltraPixel resolution as before, HTC is claiming improved performance. The second rear camera captures depth information, given the phone the ability to do things like refocussing images, background detection in a much better fashion.\n\n( Also see: HTC One (M8) India launch in April; compatible with country's 4G LTE networks )\n\n2. Extreme Power Savings Mode\n\nHTC One (M8) comes with a 2600mAh battery. Include is a 'Extreme Power Saving Mode' that basically turns into a touchscreen feature phone, as users only have access to calls, messaging, calendar data and calculator app. There are no notifications, data connectivity, or access to any other apps.\n\n( Also see: HTC One (M8) review: A worthy upgrade )\n\nThis 'extreme' mode is designed for situations when you expect to be away from a power source for long durations (say when you go camping) or when you are expecting an important call, only to realise you are on the road and almost out of battery. We can see this coming in handy, if it extends the battery life as advertised.\n\n3. Dot Case\n\nHTC also showed off a few interesting accessories, out of which the flip case with Dot View caught our eye. The case provides access to vital information like email notifications and weather updates by letting the phone's display be seen through the dot pattern of the case even when the cover is closed.\n\n( Also see: HTC One (M8) price roundup )\n\nIncoming call notifications will be displayed on the cover and you can even answer a call without flipping by simply swiping up on the surface of the cover.

With all of the features a lot of you came to love about last year\'s model present and even better, the One (M8) took hardware design to a new level. On stage, Jason Mackenzie spoke about last year\'s One, One Mini and One Max as being the One Family. So, it would stand to reason that this year, we\'re going to see a smaller, and a larger M8, right? Well, that\'s just what @evleaks is saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe enterprising leakster is once again being a thorn in HTC\'s side and has stated in a tweet that a mini version of the HTC One (M8) is definitely on its way to market, and that another device named M8 Ace is under question. The Ace could end up being the One (M8) Max which would hardly be surprising, but those looking for a larger device would welcome it. While the One Mini was only available on AT&T here in the states, the One Max was more widely available and it\'d make a lot of sense if the (M8) Mini were to be available on more than one carrier as well, especially when you consider the precedent HTC set for a device launch yesterday afternoon.\n\nThis year however, HTC might want to adjust the ""mini"" side of things for an M8 mini. Last year\'s One Mini featured a great 4.3-inch display, but thanks to those BoomSound speakers, it was hardly all that ""mini"" at all. The One Max was a good device that was launched at a bad time as well, so we\'re hoping that HTC have thought things through a little better this time around. What did you guys think to the One Mini and One Max last year? Let us know if you think that HTC should do the same again this year.', 'On stage, Jason Mackenzie spoke about last year\'s One, One Mini and One Max as being the One Family.\nThe Ace could end up being the One (M8) Max which would hardly be surprising, but those looking for a larger device would welcome it.\nThis year however, HTC might want to adjust the ""mini"" side of things for an M8 mini.\nLast year\'s One Mini featured a great 4.3-inch display, but thanks to those BoomSound speakers, it was hardly all that ""mini"" at all.\nWhat did you guys think to the One Mini and One Max last year?']"

The company hopes to make a huge comeback and restore its profitability in the quarter ending June 30th, while trying to become a worthy competitor to Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.\n\nThe company revealed that the updated version of its One smartphone – HTC One M8 – features a 5-inch high-definition screen, Snapdragon 801 processor of Qualcomm Inc. and a micro SD slot. The smartphone’s design is quite similar to the One model released by the company in 2013.\n\nThe Chairman of the company Cher Wang shared, cited by the Financial Times: “We’re very excited. 2014 will be HTC’s comeback year. It will be a good year.”\n\nOnly three years ago, HTC Corp. was considered as the leading smartphone company by shipments in the world. In 2013, however, the company dropped from the world’s top 10 rankings.\n\nOne of the analysts who work for Current Analysis – Avi Greengart commented on the new One M8 release for Bloomberg: “The new HTC One is certainly an impressive device — the design is stunning. It should sell well to early adopters who are looking for premium design, but HTC will need effective marketing to break through to mainstream consumers who are starting, and usually ending, their buying process with Apple or Samsung.”\n\nThe new version of HTC One is the first flagship phone after Ms. Wang took over the helm after the departure of Peter Chou. Chief Executive Officer Wang explained that HTC continues to be focused on manufacturing devices, which are based on the Android and Windows operating systems, but she could not say for sure if the new products of the company will be launched on China Operating System.\n\nMs. Wang said, cited by the Wall Street Journal: “For sure the Chinese government will ask us to cooperate with them… we are still deciding if we are going to be involved or not.”\n\nHTC Corp. rose by 1.64% on Wednesday in Taiwan to close the session at TWD 155.00, marking a one-year change of -37.12%. The smartphone maker is valued at TWD 128.15 billion. According to the Financial Times, the 23 analysts offering 12-month price targets for HTC Corp. have a median target of TWD 97.00, with a high estimate of TWD 320.00 and a low estimate of TWD 72.00.

While the HTC M9 was steady-as-she-goes, the HTC 10 was a great handset, and the U11 Plus was even better.

Both phones have the same 1,920 x 1,080 resolution, which means pixel density has dropped from 469ppi on the 4.7in original to 441ppi here, but in practice, it's still impossible to see individual pixels.\n\nThe M8 looks incredibly sharp; even the tiniest of fonts are still legible and images are incredibly detailed.

48479,http://www.itproportal.com/2014/03/26/htc-one-m8-or-google-nexus-5-which-should-i-buy/,technology,"[""After more leaks than anyone could have expected, HTC has finally announced the HTC One M8. There were no big surprises thanks to all those leaks, but seeing the device officially unveiled makes it a bit more real. This is HTC's big play to remain relevant in the smartphone market. Last year's One was a hit with owners and reviewers, but it didn't have the same broad appeal other devices did.\n\nRead more: HTC One M8 vs Google Nexus 5: Full spec comparison\n\nThe new HTC One M8 is packing very high-end specs and comes with the newest version of Android – just like the Nexus 5. These two phones have a lot in common, so let's see how they stack up.\n\nLike last year, the HTC One is clad in a unibody aluminium shell that puts most other devices to shame with its superb build quality. The new One is a bit more rounded on the edges than most devices with a metal frame, which should make it easier to hold on to. HTC has finally got on board with on-screen buttons, just like the Nexus 5. Google's flagship doesn't have the same super-premium construction as the HTC One, but the soft-touch plastic casing is actually very nice for a Nexus device. It feels good in the hand and has a clean, understated look.\n\nAs is the case with almost all flagship devices in recent memory, the new HTC One and Nexus 5 have speedy Qualcomm Snapdragon ARM-based chips. The Nexus 5 came out late last year, so it shipped with the Snapdragon 800 – definitely the top-of-the-line when it launched. This is a quad-core chip clocked to 2.3GHz paired with an Adreno 330 GPU. It's more than fast enough to handle anything Android can throw at it.\n\nThe new HTC One is taking a little step up with the Snapdragon 801. This chip is still quad-core and clocked at 2.3GHz, but is a little more efficient than the 800. It also has a slightly faster version of the Adreno 330 GPU. The difference in performance between the two in raw numbers will be negligible, so any real-world advantages will come thanks to software optimisations.\n\nThe Nexus 5 uses only internal storage, but the HTC One offers a microSD card slot. That's a big deal to some people. Many of the potential buyers who place emphasis on having an SD card are also fans of removable batteries, which neither phone has. Although, the HTC One has a slightly larger li-ion cell at 2600mAh versus the 2300mAh battery in the Nexus.\n\nHTC bumped the screen size up to 5in to match the Nexus 5 and other flagship smartphones – so you're looking at two 1080p LCD displays. Any differences will be minor, but HTC has a reputation for using very high quality display panels. Ultimately, this point shouldn't sway you one way or the other.\n\nIf audio is important to you, the One M8 blows the Nexus 5 out of the water. The front-facing BoomSound speakers are 25 per cent louder, which is almost hard to fathom. Sound is clear without distortion even when cranked up thanks to the high quality drivers HTC is using in the One, along with a new multi-band amplifier. The Nexus 5 has a regular mono speaker on the bottom that sounds okay, if a little on the quiet side.\n\nAs for the cameras, HTC is again doing something new. Last year it introduced the Ultrapixel camera – a lower resolution sensor with larger pixels for better low-light performance. The new One builds on that with the Duo Camera. Again, it's great for dim environments, but there is a second camera that allows you to tweak the focus after you've taken a picture. It's sort of like a Lytro in your phone, but it's doing this in software instead of hardware. This goes along with all of HTC's Zoe camera goodies that can make it easier to capture moving targets, and includes some cool photo effects.\n\nThe Nexus 5 is a good device, but the camera is probably the weakest aspect. It's a fairly average 8-megapixel sensor that doesn't do anything cool – unless you consider Photospheres to be of use. The low-light performance is a bit below average, and it pales in comparison to the M8. In good light, the Nexus 5 can probably best the One simply by virtue of having more pixels. Still, how often are you taking pictures in ideal lighting?\n\nOn the software side, the new HTC One is shipping with Android 4.4.2 KitKat, which is the current version (at least for the moment). HTC's Sense overlay used to be a bit of a disaster, but it was dramatically cleaned up starting with last year's One. Sense 6.0 includes a number of cool features like an extreme power saving mode, improved BlinkFeed, and all those camera features mentioned above.\n\nThe Nexus 5's software experience comes with two main selling points – it's completely free of OEM skins, and it gets updates right from Google as soon as they are available. Sense 6.0 is about as good as an OEM skin gets, but many Android fans will still prefer the pure experience with its cleaner UI, and you can't overstate the value of frequent updates. Google is probably going to roll out a new version of Android this summer, and the Nexus 5 will have it right away. The HTC One will have to wait at least a few months.\n\nThe final difference is price – Google sells the Nexus 5 for an obscenely low price. You can get the 16GB Nexus 5 for a mere £299 in the Play Store. The new HTC One can be had for around £530, so if you're not getting your phone on a contract, that's obviously a lot more dough to cough up.\n\nFor more on the new flagship smartphone from HTC, see our hands-on with the HTC One M8.

According to a report by The Times of India, the One M8 will reach some markets as early as April 1. However, there is no word on the pricing or specific launch or availability details. In our first look at the device, we found there’s a lot to like in the One M8. So HTC could nail it, if the device is priced right.\n\nThe HTC One M8 sports a slightly larger 5-inch display with Full HD resolution, offering a pixel count of 440ppi. Under the hood, the smartphone is powered by the Snapdragon 801 SoC, just like the S5 and the Z2. The phone will continue to have dual-front speakers, the two camera setup that HTC calls ‘Duo Camera’, something called ‘Motion Launch’, Extreme power saving mode and the brand new Sense 6.\n\nThe new HTC One M8 gets rid of any polycarbonate or plastic for the sides as the chassis is almost completely metal. It comes with a gunmetal gray hairline finish. The phone also debuts HTC’s latest version of Sense which features an enhanced BlinkFeed experience. It’s been opened up to developers so Foursquare and Fitbit updates can be pushed through BlinkFeed now.\n\nBattery life was one of the pain points of the M7 or the old HTC One. The M8 is said to have 40 percent better battery life. What’s more, other than the standard power saver mode, ‘Extreme power saver’ mode will shut down all communications except calls, text and emails. HTC has added a bunch of gestures to the One M8. You can now double tap the phone to wake it, bring a ringing phone to your ear to answer it, etc.\n\nOn the camera front, HTC is sticking to their Ultrapixel shooter. Unlike the previous version however, the M8 will feature a whole bunch of manual settings for you to tinker around with. The second camera around the back will be used to capture depth information. Rather than doing this at the software level like Nokia, which basically takes a bunch of stills at different focus points for you to manipulate later, the M8 will do this at the hardware level. Zoe mode also makes a comeback.\n\nHTC will reportedly sell the TDD LTE version of the One M8 in India that supports 4G LTE bands, after a software update.

The smartphone landed in stores the same day it was announced and can be purchased right now. If you want to know more about the new One, check out our review of the M8.\n\nOne of the things that we like to see is what exactly the new smartphone look like under the pretty skin. iFixit has taken the new HTC One (M8) and ripped it apart in an effort to see how repairable the smartphone is if it gets damaged. The first step of the tear down was to open the case of the smartphone.\n\nRemoving the rear case was easy to do according to iFixit. The last version of the One that iFixit tore apart landed one of the worst scores they have ever given. The good news is that the M8 has a more repairable design with spring contacts between the sections of the case rather than cables.\n\nDeeper into the teardown, the mainboard was found to use glue, which hurts the reparability of the smartphone. After getting the board out of the smartphone, you can see how all the chips and hardware are packaged on the mainboard. The mainboard has to come out to get to the battery and the battery is glued to the LCD shield. When all was done, the new HTC One (M8) didn’t score that well. iFixit gave the smartphone a score of 2 out of 10 with 10 being the most repairable. That score was given in part because everything has to come out of the smartphone for the screen to be repaired.\n\nSOURCE: iFixit', 'HTC One (M8) iFixit teardown shows the juicy insidesOne of the most anticipated smartphone launches of the year has finally happened with the HTC One (M8) hitting stores yesterday.\niFixit has taken the new HTC One (M8) and ripped it apart in an effort to see how repairable the smartphone is if it gets damaged.\nDeeper into the teardown, the mainboard was found to use glue, which hurts the reparability of the smartphone.\nWhen all was done, the new HTC One (M8) didn’t score that well.\niFixit gave the smartphone a score of 2 out of 10 with 10 being the most repairable.']"

A kid named Roshan Jamketel got his hands on a new HTC One and posted a 12-minute video of the device showing everything we ever wanted to know about the new HTC One. The only problem was that this broke the NDA agreement that his father, a HTC employee had signed. Besides that video, just about everything there is to know about the new HTC One is already known, so much so, that the unveiling today, didn't really 'unveil' anything…it simply made it official.\n\nThis is a very important device for HTC and could well determine its fate in the smartphone wars. This new HTC One needs to come out and hit the ground running – hopefully the carriers will lend a hand in advertising and getting out the good news. HTC does not have the advertising budget of Samsung or Apple, but it really needs that type of hype to create a desire and certain 'awareness' of the new HTC One. HTC has made some solid devices over the years, but has never been able to capture the audience of the Samsung Galaxy S series or the LG or Nexus devices. Let's take a quick look at the HTC 'hits and misses' over the years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2008 when HTC launched its G1, it was one of the first Android smartphones to go on sale and if you remember back that far, Android 1.0 was far from polished – way behind iOS, BlackBerry, and even Windows Mobile. The device itself was awesome and gave us a glimpse into the future of what Android could become. Next, was the HTC Hero where HTC introduced its Sense UI skin on top of Android. With added pinch-zoom and standard 3.5mm audio jack, our source concluded it was the best Android phone.\n\nIn 2010, HTC launched its Desire with cutting edge specs for the day and later that year came the HTC Desire HD with a HUGE 4.3-inch display. In 2011, the HTC Sensation was well equipped to take on the Samsung S2, LG Optimus 2X and the iPhone 4, but never made any head way. The HTC One X launched in May 2012 and its IPS LCD display jumped to 4.7-inches. HTC's hopes were riding on the HTC One X, and though it was well received, with the stiff competition from the Galaxy S3 and Galaxy Nexus, HTC was unable to gain any ground.\n\nIn March 2013, we saw the launch of the HTC One…it was a beautifully executed smartphone – from the all-aluminum body to the dual stereo speakers to the camera, but once again, sales were below expectations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a market dominated by Apple and Samsung, HTC has just unveiled its next flagship, the New HTC One M8. It will have to do battle against the existing iPhone 5S, the Galaxy S5, and the LG G Pro 2 in the coming months. The New HTC One M8 is a well-designed and well-built device, certainly a tremendous evolutionary device – better-designed metal case, better stereo speakers, better camera, and top-of-the-line Snapdragon 801 and improved Sense 6.0 and software in general. The launch is going without a hitch, but if history has taught us anything about HTC, it will be that the new HTC One M8 will sell well, but not be that savior that HTC is expecting. We will watch closely over the next few months to see how it sells and hopefully HTC will reap some of the benefits from its well-designed devices…finally."", ""The newest HTC flagship, the 'New HTC One,' was officially unveiled today and the drama leading up to it was something of a spy thriller.\nThis is a very important device for HTC and could well determine its fate in the smartphone wars.\nIn 2010, HTC launched its Desire with cutting edge specs for the day and later that year came the HTC Desire HD with a HUGE 4.3-inch display.\nThe HTC One X launched in May 2012 and its IPS LCD display jumped to 4.7-inches.\nAdvertisementIn a market dominated by Apple and Samsung, HTC has just unveiled its next flagship, the New HTC One M8.""]"

Even though it’s a larger than its predecessor, it still feels inexplicably lighter.

(The last One used a bit of plastic to bridge the sides of the phone.)\n\nThough I knew the phone would have a metal case, I was surprised at just how polished it was.

For the first time, rings have been found around an asteroid, a study published on Wednesday shows.\n\nThe asteroid, known as Chariklo, is more than 621 million miles (1 billion km) from Earth, circling the sun in an orbit between Saturn and Uranus.\n\nOn June 3, 2013, astronomers at seven different locations in Chile, Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina were standing by to observe the asteroid as it passed in front of star, relative to the telescopes’ lines of sight. They hoped the dips in starlight, caused by the asteroid passing in front of the star, would reveal details of the 154-mile (248-km) asteroid’s size and shape.\n\nThey ended up with much more. Analyzing flickers of light during the occultation revealed two dense rings circling Chariklo.\n\nPreviously, only the giant planets Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune were known to have rings.\n\n“We weren’t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all,” lead astronomer Felipe Braga-Ribas, with Brazil’s National Observatory in Rio de Janeiro, said in a statement. “The discovery ... came as a complete surprise.”\n\nChariklo’s rings have crisp edges, a feature typically caused by the gravitational effects of a small embedded moon or moons.\n\n“It’s likely that Chariklo has at least one small moon still waiting to be discovered,” Braga-Ribas said.\n\nChariklo’s inner ring is 4.3 miles (7 km) wide and the outer ring is 1.9 miles (3 km) wide.

Such events are known as occultations and happen remarkably often. Several asteroid occultations will be visible from different parts of Australia tonight.\n\nAstronomers can use multiple telescopes scattered across hundreds of kilometres to map the size and shape of an asteroid during an occultation.\n\nA coordinated effort\n\nLast June Chariklo was to pass in front of an obscure star (UCAC4 248-108672). But the occultation could only be seen from South America so an observing campaign was coordinated across seven observatories including two telescopes operated by the European Southern Observatory in Chile.\n\nUsually the star just fades for a few seconds as the asteroid passes by. Astronomers were expecting the star to fade for about five seconds while Chariklo blocked its light.\n\nBut surprisingly, a few seconds before and after the asteroid moved by, there was additional dimming of the starlight. Rings surrounding Chariklo were blocking star light too.\n\nPreviously, only the gas giant planets in our Solar System – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune – were known to have ring systems.\n\nThe terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars – clearly don’t have rings and careful searches around smaller objects in the Solar System had been unsuccessful. It was beginning to seem that rings might only exist around large objects, until now.\n\nWhy the rings?\n\nThe rings of Chariklo are dense but narrow, just three and seven kilometres wide, and are separated by a clear gap of nine kilometres.\n\nLucie Maquet\n\nIf you were standing on the frigid surface of Chariklo, the rings would appear as wide as our Full Moon and stretch from horizon to horizon.\n\nAstronomers still have much to learn about ring systems – both for Chariklo and the gas giant planets.\n\nIt’s highly likely that the gap between Chariklo’s rings is caused by one or more small moons. Known as shepherd moons, they have been found to keep the rings of the gas giants tightly confined.\n\nThe rings themselves are most likely the result of a collision and there’s a possibility that the tiny pieces might eventually join together to form a new small moon.\n\nSuch a scenario, but on a much grander scale, is thought to have formed Earth’s moon.\n\nHow many more ring systems?\n\nThere’s a saying in astronomy – find one and its unique, find a second and they’re everywhere.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of small objects in the Solar System, collectively known as small Solar System bodies. They include all objects orbiting the Sun that are not massive enough to be called a planet or dwarf planet.\n\nMost Centaurs are small Solar System bodies, as are most of the asteroids within the Asteroid Belt, the near-Earth objects (NEOs), the Trojan asteroids that orbit with Mars and Jupiter, the Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and the comets.\n\nWith all of those objects to choose from, it’s quite likely there are more small objects in our Solar System with ring systems. The challenge now is to find them.', 'In a surprise discovery two rings have been found around the remote asteroid Chariklo, which lies more than a billion kilometres from Earth.\nThis is the first time rings have been discovered around an asteroid and makes it only the fifth object in our solar system to have rings – after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\nThe terrestrial planets – Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars – clearly don’t have rings and careful searches around smaller objects in the Solar System had been unsuccessful.\nThere are hundreds of thousands of small objects in the Solar System, collectively known as small Solar System bodies.\nWith all of those objects to choose from, it’s quite likely there are more small objects in our Solar System with ring systems.']"

Astronomers first found Chariklo over 17 years ago, but recent observations turned up something really unexpected.\n\n""We weren’t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery — and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system — came as a complete surprise!"" said Felipe Braga-Ribas an astronomer at the National Observatory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who led the campaign to observe Chariklo and write up this amazing discovery.\n\nThis video shows an artist\'s impression of the centaur and its rings, revealing how there is one thicker inner ring and a very thin outer ring beyond it.\n\n\n\nAccording to the team that discovered them, the inner ring is roughly seven kilometres across, while the outer ring is just three kilometres across, and they\'re separated by a nine-kilometre-wide gap.\n\nThey found these rings on June 3, 2013, by observing Chariklo directly as it passed in front of (occulted) a star known as UCAC4 248-108672. Chariklo completely blocked the light from the star, as expected, but they also spotted a very brief dip in the star\'s light both before the occultation and after, as seen in this video:\n\n\n\nSince numerous telescopes across South America were trained on Chariklo at the time, the team was able to capture the event from many different angles. Even though the differences in angle were very small (since South America is quite small compared to the distance between Earth and Chariklo), it was still enough to allow them to figure out exactly how big the rings are.\n\n[ More Geekquinox: Spitzer Telescope gives us awesome 360-degree view of the galaxy ]\n\nAlthough the description of Chariklo flips back and forth between asteroid and centaur, both here and in the European Southern Observatory news release, it is valid to use both titles for this object. If a centaur was flung into the inner solar system by venturing too close to one of the outer planets, it would likely act like a comet as it approached the sun. However, at that distance out, it\'s so cold that Chariklo is completely inert and it behaves like an asteroid.\n\nAlso, you may have noticed something from the first video above ... it shows a small moon orbiting Chariklo. That\'s no mistake, and it\'s not an artist\'s embellishment. The discovery of these rings points to a collision with another object at some point in Chariklo\'s past, but for the debris from that impact to form these two distinct rings is an indication that there\'s possibly some other object there to \'shepherd\' it all into that formation, as we\'ve seen with some of the moons of Saturn. Further observations will be needed to confirm if there\'s a moon there or not, but for the time being, the astronomers have nicknamed the rings Oiapoque and Chuí, after two rivers in Brazil.\n\n(Image courtesy: ESO/L.

This is the smallest object by far found to have rings and only the fifth body in the Solar System - after the much larger planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - to have this feature.

The origin of these rings remains a mystery, but they may be the result of a collision that created a disc of debris. The new results are published online in the journal Nature on 26 March 2014.\n\nThe rings of Saturn are one of the most spectacular sights in the sky, and less prominent rings have also been found around the other giant planets. Despite many careful searches, no rings had been found around smaller objects orbiting the Sun in the Solar System. Now observations of the distant minor planet (10199) Chariklo as it passed in front of a star have shown that this object too is surrounded by two fine rings.\n\n""We weren\'t looking for a ring and didn\'t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery - and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system - came as a complete surprise!"" says Felipe Braga-Ribas (Observatorio Nacional/MCTI, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) who planned the observation campaign and is lead author on the new paper.\n\nChariklo is the largest member of a class known as the Centaurs and it orbits between Saturn and Uranus in the outer Solar System. Predictions had shown that it would pass in front of the star UCAC4 248-108672 on 3 June 2013, as seen from South America. Astronomers using telescopes at seven different locations, including the 1.54-metre Danish and TRAPPIST telescopes at ESO\'s La Silla Observatory in Chile, were able to watch the star apparently vanish for a few seconds as its light was blocked by Chariklo - an occultation.\n\nBut they found much more than they were expecting. A few seconds before, and again a few seconds after the main occultation there were two further very short dips in the star\'s apparent brightness. Something around Chariklo was blocking the light! By comparing what was seen from different sites the team could reconstruct not only the shape and size of the object itself but also the shape, width, orientation and other properties of the newly discovered rings.\n\nThe team found that the ring system consists of two sharply confined rings only seven and three kilometres wide, separated by a clear gap of nine kilometres - around a small 250-kilometre diameter object orbiting beyond Saturn.\n\n""For me, it was quite amazing to realise that we were able not only to detect a ring system, but also pinpoint that it consists of two clearly distinct rings,"" adds Uffe Grae Jorgensen (Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark), one of the team. ""I try to imagine how it would be to stand on the surface of this icy object - small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space - and stare up at a 20-kilometre wide ring system 1000 times closer than the Moon.""\n\nAlthough many questions remain unanswered, astronomers think that this sort of ring is likely to be formed from debris left over after a collision. It must be confined into the two narrow rings by the presence of small putative satellites.\n\n""So, as well as the rings, it\'s likely that Chariklo has at least one small moon still waiting to be discovered,"" adds Felipe Braga Ribas.\n\nThe rings may prove to be a phenomenon that might in turn later lead to the formation of a small moon. Such a sequence of events, on a much larger scale, may explain the birth of our own Moon in the early days of the Solar System, as well as the origin of many other satellites around planets and asteroids.\n\nThe leaders of this project are provisionally calling the rings by the nicknames Oiapoque and Chui, two rivers near the northern and southern extremes of Brazil.\n\nThis research was presented in a paper entitled ""A ring system detected around the Centaur (10199) Chariklo"", by F.

The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\n\n“It was a very exciting experience,” Jose L. Ortiz told the Los Angeles Times by email. Ortiz, of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Adalucia, is one of the authors of the paper. “I almost jumped out of my seat!”\n\nObservations made with seven different telescopes in June 2013 suggest that the two rings are dense and thin. One is about 2 miles wide. The other is about 4 miles wide. They are separated by a gap of about 5.5 miles, and they are likely made of water ice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two rings circle a large asteroid known as Chariklo that is 155 miles across.\n\n“It is amazingly cool — until now, we had no idea that anything but the giant planets could have rings,” said Amy Mainzer, an astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved in the study.\n\nChariklo is a type of asteroid known as a centaur — a class of objects that orbit the sun between Jupiter and Neptune. It is shaped like an M&M, and its surface is darker than asphalt.\n\nBecause Chariklo is so far away and so dark, it is very difficult to image from ground-based telescopes. The discovery of the rings was made when the asteroid was observed passing in front of a distant star. By taking careful measurements of how long the light of the star was blocked by the asteroid, an international team of scientists led by Felipe Braga-Ribas of the Observatorio Nacional in Rio de Janeiro was hoping to get a more precise idea of Chariklo’s size.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut something unexpected happened. The star’s light went out briefly twice, and then for a long time, and then briefly twice again. Something around Chariklo was clearly blocking the light too. The only explanation for the symmetry? Rings!\n\n“It is a similar technique to how the rings of Uranus were discovered and the ring arc of Neptune,” said James Bauer, a planetary astronomer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved in the study. “This is a great technique for finding faint rings, and the evidence is very credible.”\n\nNobody knows exactly how these rings formed, but the authors of the Nature paper suggest their origin is likely tied to some sort of collision. One possibility is that another asteroid slammed into Chariklo, knocking ice off its surface that reformed as rings. Another possibility is that the rings are made of the remains of that other body, blown to smithereens by the impact. Or perhaps two small moons of Chariklo collided, forming the rings.\n\n“We observe asteroids impacting other asteroids in the Main Belt, so perhaps it stands to reason that the phenomenon occurs in the more distant parts of the solar system as well,” said Mainzer.\n\nNow that scientists know there are rings around Chariklo, Bauer said, he expects the next step is to get some images of them.\n\n“Now that we know the faintness and the distance, there may be ways of trying to image this object either from space or from ground base using enhanced imaging techniques,” he said.\n\nHear that, rings?

Chariklo was located in the Kuiper Belt, a collection of thousands of dwarf planets and comets in orbit beyond Neptune on the edge of our solar system, but at some point it must have been thrown out of this belt and is now between Saturn and Uranus, where there is a collection of small objects, called Centaur.\n\nChariklo is the largest of these objects with a diameter of 250 km. This comet like object has been known for many years, but despite careful study, its rings have never been observed before now. This has happened because a new camera is now being used on the Danish telescope at ESO\'s La Silla Observatory in Chile.\n\nSurprising discovery of rings\n\nWhen an object passes in front of a star there is a small dip in the star\'s brightness and they could see that there was also a dip in the brightness outside the object. This showed that there was a ring of material in a disc around the little object, Chariklo.\n\n""We were not even looking for rings, because they had never been observed around small objects like Chariklo, so it is a totally surprising discovery. The entire passage only lasted 5 seconds, but we could even determine incredible details about the rings. There are two separate thin rings, which are comprised of ice particles and pebbles. The two rings are only 3 and 7 km wide and no more than a few hundred meters thick. There are 14 km between the centers of the two rings and there is a 9 km wide gap between them. They have been measured at a distance of two billion kilometers with an accuracy of plus/minus a few hundred meters. It is really impressive,"" says Uffe Gråe Jørgensen, an astronomer in Astrophysics and Planetary Science at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nPerhaps formed by collision\n\n""The camera was specially developed at the Niels Bohr Institute and has a stunningly high resolution, which we especially exploit to look for exoplanets. But when the area where we are looking for exoplanets isn\'t \'up\' in the sky, we use our observation time for other projects and so we followed Chariklo, which just passed in front of a star,"" explains Jørgensen.\n\nHow the rings were formed is a mystery, but Uffe Gråe has a hypothesis.\n\n""What we are witnessing is perhaps the unveiling of an object that is in the middle of the same stage of development as the Earth and the Moon 4.5 billion years ago, when there was a giant collision between Earth and another planet. In the collision, material hurled out in all directions, forming a circular disc around the Earth, which gradually condensed and formed the Moon. Similarly, we believe that another celestial body crashed into Chariklo and a good deal of material was cast out and formed rings. If the two discs around Chariklo gathers and forms a moon, it will be approximately 2 km in diameter,"" explains Uffe Gråe.\n\nIn addition to the observations with the Danish telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, Chariklo was also followed in lower time resolution from six other observatories in South America, which together made it possible to determine Chariklo\'s shape and size.

48528,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/first-asteroid-ring-system-chariklo-video_n_5037365.html,technology,"[""Astronomers have discovered rings around an asteroid-like body whose orbit is between those of Saturn and Uranus. At just 250 kilometres across, Chariklo is the smallest body so far found to have rings. Previously, only the giant planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — have been seen sporting them.\n\nPublished online today in Nature, the finding indicates that rings may be a more common feature than previously thought. The discovery was an accident and a surprise, says lead author Felipe Braga-Ribas, an astronomer at the National Observatory in Rio de Janeiro. Rings are interesting celestial features, as they are often a first step in the formation of planets and moons. But matter would typically struggle to stay stable around a body with only a tiny gravitational pull. “We thought that maybe having rings was linked with the mass of the object. So finding them on a small object was very unexpected,” he says.\n\nArtist's impression of Chariklo's rings\n\nChariklo belongs to a class of objects called Centaurs, which traverse the outer Solar System in unstable orbits and can share characteristics with both asteroids and comets. Because they are small, dark and far away, studying them is a challenge, Braga-Ribas says. His team discovered the rings while observing the way in that the asteroid blocked out light from a distant star as it passed between the star and Earth on 3 June 2013.\n\nThe researchers found a dip in brightness, as expected, when the asteroid traversed the star. But they also detected two much smaller dips, both before Chariklo passed in front of the star, and after. Piecing together results from telescopes at seven sites across South America, the team deduced that the blips were caused by two distinct, narrow rings that were respectively 7 and 3 kilometres wide. The same technique was used to discover the rings around Uranus in 1977.\n\nCircular origins\n\nFinding rings around Chariklo solves a puzzle about the object, says Braga-Ribas. Analysis of the light coming from the asteroid had previously shown its composition changing over time. A ring system made of ice, which is sometimes seen head-on but at other times shrinks to just a thin line when viewed side-on, would neatly explain the changes, he says.\n\nFrancesca DeMeo, a planetary scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says the results are very convincing. “It would be really hard to explain the measurements in any other way,” she says. But how the rings formed remains a puzzle. The authors suggest that another small body could have hit Chariklo, sending debris from both bodies into a disk. Other possibilities are that a disk formed from material that was spun off from Chariklo as it rotated, or that the body released dust or ice as it travelled, much like a comet. All are plausible, says DeMeo.\n\nA big question is how the rings can be stable, given the asteroid’s tiny mass. If an impact caused them, it would have to have occurred at very low speed for the particles to remain in the Centaur's orbit. But however they formed, kilometre-sized moons are likely to be ‘shepherding’, or constraining, the rings, and preventing the debris from dissipating, says Braga-Ribas.\n\nJames Bauer, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, says that studies of the rings’ composition will hint at their origins. Chariklo is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of small bodies in the outer Solar System that have so far been little studied. Although Chariklo could be alone in having rings, Bauer adds that this is unlikely.\n\n“I think there is a good chance we’ll see another ring system around a small body, somewhere in the outer Solar System,” he says. “If you start birdwatching and see a bird for the first time, the chances are it’s going to be a common bird.”"", ""Astronomers have discovered rings around an asteroid-like body whose orbit is between those of Saturn and Uranus.\nArtist's impression of Chariklo's ringsChariklo belongs to a class of objects called Centaurs, which traverse the outer Solar System in unstable orbits and can share characteristics with both asteroids and comets.\nThe authors suggest that another small body could have hit Chariklo, sending debris from both bodies into a disk.\nChariklo is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of small bodies in the outer Solar System that have so far been little studied.\n“I think there is a good chance we’ll see another ring system around a small body, somewhere in the outer Solar System,” he says.""]"

48539,http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2014/03/asteroid-ring-system/,technology,"[""For the first time ever, astronomers have discovered a ring system surrounding an asteroid. The finding is a complete surprise to planetary scientists, who are yet unsure exactly how such rings could have formed.\n\nThe cosmic bling was found around an object named Chariklo, which orbits in a region between Saturn and Uranus. At 155 miles across, or about the length of Massachusetts, Chariklo is the largest known asteroid in its neighborhood. Looking to get a better idea of its exact size and shape, astronomers trained their telescopes on the giant space rock as it passed in front on a distant star in June 2013. As Chariklo performed its eclipse, researchers noticed something odd: The star's light flickered just a bit immediately before and after Chariklo's pass.\n\nThe reason for this darkening was the asteroid's two dense rings, which had briefly blocked the starlight. The thicker inner ring is about four miles wide, while the thinner outer ring is a little less than two miles. Spectroscopic analysis of the starlight also revealed that the rings are composed partially of water ice.\n\nThe ice rings reflect light like a mirror, a property that helps explain an earlier anomalous finding regarding Chariklo. After the asteroid was discovered in 1997, its brightness mysteriously dropped off and only came back again in 2008. What apparently happened was that, as Chariklo moved through its orbit, its ring system turned edge-on when viewed from Earth. As they turned back to face us with their flat side, they reflected light toward our planet and Chariklo's brightness grew by 40 percent.\n\nThere are only four other known ring systems in our solar system — around Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune and, most dramatically, Saturn — and all the other ones have formed around planets. Astronomers aren't yet sure if Chariklo's ring system makes it unique among asteroids. In recent decades, more than 10 other objects in its neighborhood have been searched using a technique similar to Chariklo's stellar eclipse but have not shown any rings.\n\nThe asteroid's rings might have formed when another slightly smaller object slammed into its surface, kicking up a huge amount of debris that settled into rings held in place by gravity. Alternatively, Chariklo could have a tiny companion asteroid orbiting around it. Micrometeorite impacts on the tiny companion's surface might dislodge fragments that turned into a ring around Chariklo.\n\nThin rings around an object will tend to spread out, making their edges fuzzy. Chariklo's rings appear to have very sharp edges, which might indicate that they contain itty-bitty shepherd moons — just a few miles wide — whose gravitational influence pries open the lane between the two rings and confines their edges. Such shepherd moon are how planets like Uranus keep their thin rings so sharp. But many-ringed Saturn also has a few very thin rings that aren't maintained by shepherd moons, suggesting that this explanation could turn out to be wrong. Perhaps studying Chariklo's simple ring system further could help astronomers understand the behavior of larger rings in the solar system.\n\nVideo: Lucie Maquet"", ""For the first time ever, astronomers have discovered a ring system surrounding an asteroid.\nAt 155 miles across, or about the length of Massachusetts, Chariklo is the largest known asteroid in its neighborhood.\nWhat apparently happened was that, as Chariklo moved through its orbit, its ring system turned edge-on when viewed from Earth.\nAstronomers aren't yet sure if Chariklo's ring system makes it unique among asteroids.\nPerhaps studying Chariklo's simple ring system further could help astronomers understand the behavior of larger rings in the solar system.""]"

The asteroid is the first non-planetary body in the solar system discovered to have its own ring system. Image released March 26,\n\nScientists have made a stunning discovery in the outer realm of the solar system — an asteroid with its own set of rings that orbits the sun between Saturn and Uranus. The space rock is the first non-planetary object ever found to have its own ring system, researchers say.\n\nThe pair of space rock rings encircle the asteroid Chariklo. They were most likely formed after a collision scattered debris around the asteroid, according to a new study unveiled today (March 27). The asteroid rings also suggests the presence of a still-undiscovered moon around Chariklo that\'s keeping them stable, researchers said.\n\n""We weren’t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery — and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system — came as a complete surprise!"" study leader Felipe Braga-Ribas, of the National Observatory in Brazil said in a statement today. [Asteroid with Rings: Artist Views of Space Rock Chariklo (Photos)]\n\nAstronomers used seven telescopes, but just one revealed the pair of rings orbiting the rocky Chariklo. The asteroid\'s 155-mile diameter (250 kilometers) is dwarfed by the giant gas planets, the only other bodies known to have rings.\n\n""This discovery shows that size is not important in order to have — or not have — rings,"" Felipe Braga-Ribas, of the National Observatory in Brazil, told Space.com by email.\n\nAn asteroid among giants\n\nOn June 3, 2013, Braga-Ribas led a team of astronomers in observing Chariklo as it passed in front of a distant star — a process known as an occultation. As the asteroid traveled, it blocked light from the star, enabling scientists to learn more about it. [The Strangest Asteroids in the Solar System]\n\nThe astronomers were surprised to discover that a few seconds before and after the main occultation, the light dimmed slightly, indicating that something circled the rocky asteroid. By comparing the data gathered from seven different telescopes, the team was able to identify the shape, size and orientation of the rings.\n\nThe system consists of a dense, 4-mile-wide (7 km) ring near the planet, and a smaller 2-mile-wide (3 km) ring farther out.\n\nFrom the surface of the asteroid, ""they would be two spectacular sharp and really bright rings, crossing all the sky,"" Braga-Ribas said. ""They would be noticeably close, as they are at about 1/1,000 of the moon\'s distance from us,"" he added.\n\nHe went on to say that the larger, inner ring would block the view of the outer ring from the ground. The rings are similar to those around Saturn, in that both are very dense, bright and possibly formed by rock and water ice. But their scales are quite different.\n\n""The whole Chariklo system would fit about 12 times in the Cassini Division,"" Braga-Ribas said, referring to the largest gap in Saturn\'s rings.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticles orbiting Chariklo also travel more slowly — only tens of meters per second, compared with tens of kilometers per second in the rings of Saturn.\n\nWhile Saturn is the most well-known ringed body in the solar system, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus also have their own, fainter rings. These gas giants significantly dwarf the smaller asteroid. [See Saturn\'s Glorious Rings Up Close (Photos)]\n\nAstronomers utilized seven telescopes, most of which were located in South America. Of them, only the European Southern Observatory\'s La Silla telescope in Chile was able to capture the small gap between the rings.\n\n""This was possible due to the use of the \'Lucky Imager,\' a fast and sensible camera that obtained a sequence of images like a video at a rate of 10 images per second,"" Braga-Ribas said. ""As the stellar occultation by both rings lasted for 0.6 seconds in total, it was able to \'see\' the rings in detail.""\n\nThe other telescopes had exposure times greater than 0.7 seconds, so they were only able to observe a single gap in the light.\n\nWhat\'s so special about this asteroid to make it have rings?\n\n""Chariklo seems to be nothing special, otherwise,"" Joseph Burns, of Cornell University, told Space.com by email. Burns was not a member of Braga-Ribas\' team, but he studies planetary rings and the small bodies of the solar system. He authored a perspective article that appeared alongside the new findings.\n\n\n\nChariklo may not be the only nonplanetary body to have rings, Braga-Ribas said.

This is the smallest object by far found to have rings and only the fifth body in the solar system — after the much larger planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — to have this feature. The origin of these rings remains a mystery, but they may be the result of a collision that created a disk of debris.\n\n\n\nThe rings of Saturn are one of the most spectacular sights in the sky, and less prominent rings also have been found around the other giant planets. Despite many careful searches, no rings had been found around smaller objects orbiting the Sun in the solar system. Now observations of the distant minor planet Chariklo as it passed in front of a star have shown that this object too is surrounded by two fine rings.\n\n\n\n“We weren’t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery — and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system — came as a complete surprise!” said Felipe Braga-Ribas from Observatório Nacional/MCTI in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n\n\nChariklo is the largest member of a class known as centaurs, and it orbits between Saturn and Uranus in the outer solar system. Predictions had shown that it would pass in front of the star UCAC4 248-108672 on June 3, 2013, as seen from South America. Astronomers using telescopes at seven different locations, including the 1.54-meter Danish and TRAPPIST telescopes at ESO’s La Silla Observatory, were able to watch the star apparently vanish for a few seconds as its light was blocked by Chariklo — an occultation.\n\n\n\nBut they found much more than they were expecting.

The new results are published online in the journal Nature on 26 March 2014. The rings of Saturn are one of the most spectacular sights in the sky, and less prominent rings have also been found around the other giant planets. Despite many careful searches, no rings had been found around smaller objects orbiting the Sun in the Solar System. Now observations of the distant minor planet (10199) Chariklo as it passed in front of a star have shown that this object too is surrounded by two fine rings. ""We weren\'t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery - and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system - came as a complete surprise!"" says Felipe Braga-Ribas (Observatório Nacional/MCTI, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) who planned the observation campaign and is lead author on the new paper. Chariklo is the largest member of a class known as the Centaurs and it orbits between Saturn and Uranus in the outer Solar System. Predictions had shown that it would pass in front of the star UCAC4 248-108672 on 3 June 2013, as seen from South America. Astronomers using telescopes at seven different locations, including the 1.54-metre Danish and TRAPPIST telescopes at ESO\'s La Silla Observatory in Chile, were able to watch the star apparently vanish for a few seconds as its light was blocked by Chariklo - an occultation. But they found much more than they were expecting. A few seconds before, and again a few seconds after the main occultation there were two further very short dips in the star\'s apparent brightness.

Now astronomers from the Niels Bohr Institute, among others, have observed the first miniature planet with two rings of ice and pebbles. It is a smaller celestial body, called Chariklo, located two billion kilometers out in the solar system between Saturn and Uranus. The results are published in the prestigious scientific journal, Nature.\n\nChariklo was located in the Kuiper Belt, a collection of thousands of dwarf planets and comets in orbit beyond Neptune on the edge of our solar system. But at some point it was thrown out of this belt and is now between Saturn and Uranus, where there is a collection of small objects, called Centaur. Chariklo is the largest of these objects with a diameter of 250 km. This comet like object has been known for many years, but despite careful study, its rings have never been observed before now. This has happened because a new camera is now being used on the Danish telescope at ESO\'s La Silla Observatory in Chile.\n\nSurprising discovery of rings\n\n""The camera was specially developed at the Niels Bohr Institute and has a stunningly high resolution, which we especially exploit to look for exoplanets. But when the area where we are looking for exoplanets isn\'t \'up\' in the sky, we use our observation time for other projects and so we followed Chariklo, which just passed in front of a star,"" explains Uffe Gråe Jørgensen, an astronomer in Astrophysics and Planetary Science at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nHe explains that when an object passes in front of a star there is a small dip in the star\'s brightness and they could see that there was also a dip in the brightness outside the object. This showed that there was a ring of material in a disc around the little object, Chariklo.\n\n""We were not even looking for rings, because they had never been observed around small objects like Chariklo, so it is a totally surprising discovery. The entire passage only lasted 5 seconds, but we could even determine incredible details about the rings. There are two separate thin rings, which are comprised of ice particles and pebbles. The two rings are only 3 and 7 km wide and no more than a few hundred meters thick. There are 14 km between the centers of the two rings and there is a 9 km wide gap between them. They have been measured at a distance of two billion kilometers with an accuracy of plus/minus a few hundred meters. It is really impressive,"" says Uffe Gråe Jørgensen.\n\nChariklo is a comet-like miniature planet located between Saturn and Uranus. It has a diameter of 250 km and new observations show that there are two rings of ice particles and pebbles. This is the first time such a small celestial body with rings has been observed.\n\n(Photo Credit: Lucie Maquet)\n\nPerhaps formed by collision\n\nHow the rings were formed is a mystery, but Uffe Gråe has a clear theory.\n\n""What we are witnessing is perhaps the unveiling of an object that is in the middle of the same stage of development as the Earth and the Moon 4.5 billion years ago, when there was a giant collision between Earth and another planet. In the collision, material hurled out in all directions, forming a circular disc around the Earth, which gradually condensed and formed the Moon. Similarly, we believe that another celestial body crashed into Chariklo and a good deal of material was cast out and formed rings. If the two discs around Chariklo gathers and forms a moon, it will be approximately 2 km in diameter,"" explains Uffe Gråe.\n\nIn addition to the observations with the Danish telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, Chariklo was also followed in lower time resolution from six other observatories in South America, which together made it possible to determine Chariklo\'s shape and size. There were only a few minutes of observations in total, but the result was the breakthrough revelation of the comet like miniature planet Chariklo with the two rings.\n\nThe special camera is Irish, and the software programs were specially developed over five years at the Niels Bohr Institute by three astronomers and two Ph.D. students. It takes 40 images per second and the resolution is just as fantastic as if it was out in space. It is now sitting on the Danish telescope at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The main purpose of the camera is to observe exoplanets, which are planets orbiting a star other than the Sun, but the sensitive camera has also shown its strength for making extremely precise observations of other objects.\n\n(Photo Credit: Jesper Skottfelt, Niels Bohr Institute)\n\nSource: University of Copenhagen - Niels Bohr Institute', 'Now astronomers from the Niels Bohr Institute, among others, have observed the first miniature planet with two rings of ice and pebbles.\nSurprising discovery of rings""The camera was specially developed at the Niels Bohr Institute and has a stunningly high resolution, which we especially exploit to look for exoplanets.\nThis showed that there was a ring of material in a disc around the little object, Chariklo.\nThe special camera is Irish, and the software programs were specially developed over five years at the Niels Bohr Institute by three astronomers and two Ph.D. students.\n(Photo Credit: Jesper Skottfelt, Niels Bohr Institute)Source: University of Copenhagen - Niels Bohr Institute']"
48550,http://news.sciencemag.org/space/2014/03/saturn-rings-spotted-around-asteroid,technology,"[""Even before astronomers pointed their telescopes at a dim star over Chile last June, they knew it would darken for a few seconds as an asteroid passed in front of it. What they didn’t expect were two brief flickers a few seconds beforehand and afterward, suggesting that the asteroid was encircled by Saturn-like rings. The find is the first evidence for such rings around anything in our solar system other than a giant planet.\n\nLike other teams positioned in a 1500-kilometer-wide swath across South America, the astronomers had started out the night with one mission: They intended to measure the size of Chariklo, an icy body that circles the sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Knowing Chariklo’s speed across the sky, they could use the duration of the mini-eclipse to estimate the distant asteroid’s size, says Felipe Braga-Ribas, an astronomer at the National Observatory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n“But then we saw the flickers,” he says. Because the team members weren't looking for a ring, the discovery came as a complete surprise, he notes.\n\nBraga-Ribas and his colleagues were measuring the brightness of the target star—one in the constellation Scorpio that's too dim to see with the naked eye—every 0.1 seconds. That sampling rate was fast enough to discern that there were two flickers before and after the main occultation, or blockage of light—evidence of two dense, narrow rings with a small but distinct gap between them. (Other groups also recorded dips in light caused by the rings, but couldn’t discern the gap between them because their sensors weren’t taking data samples often enough.)\n\nUsing data gathered at six other sites along the mini-eclipse’s path, the researchers estimate that Chariklo has a radius of about 124 kilometers. The same data sets suggest that material in the rings orbit the asteroid at radii of about 391 and 405 km, the researchers report online today in Nature. If all the material in each ring were gathered together, the inner ring would measure about 2 km across and the outer ring would be about half that diameter, Braga-Ribas says.\n\nThe newly discovered ring system answers a couple of mysteries, says Joseph Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell University. After Chariklo was discovered in 1997, he notes, its brightness gradually dropped by about 40%, reaching a low in 2008. Over the same period, signs of water ice—certain wavelengths missing from the light reflected back toward Earth—faded. Since 2008, though, Chariklo has regained its brightness and its watery signature.\n\nBurns says those trends can be explained by the shifting view of the rings as seen from our planet: Six years ago, when Chariklo was in a different part of its orbit, the rings would have been seen edgewise from Earth, an invisible sliver that reflected little or no light in our direction. Data suggest that although the ice-rich rings have only 15% of Chariklo’s surface area, they reflect almost three times as much light on an area-to-area comparison. Particles in the rings are on average much brighter than Chariklo’s surface because they often collide, exposing fresh, bright ice; meanwhile, Chariklo itself continues to accumulate dust, he suggests.\n\nAt present, it’s not clear how Chariklo’s ring system formed. One possibility is that a slow-motion collision with a smaller asteroid or comet once blasted debris into orbit, and the gravitational pull of the largest bits of debris have shepherded the smaller bits into a sharply defined ring. (The presence of such “shepherd moons” could help explain the distinct, 9-kilometer-wide gap between Chariklo’s two rings as well, Braga-Ribas notes.)\n\nIn another scenario, a loosely consolidated object (possibly a comet) passing near Chariklo was captured to become a satellite but subsequently was ripped apart by gravitational interactions with its new parent.\n\nRegardless of its origin, analyses of the new ring system—which is much smaller and simpler than those circling Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—may help scientists develop better computer models of how rings behave and evolve, Burns says. The particles in Chariklo’s rings take about 10 hours to orbit the asteroid, he estimates, about the same time the small bits of material near the middle of Saturn’s broad ring system take to circle that planet."", 'What they didn’t expect were two brief flickers a few seconds beforehand and afterward, suggesting that the asteroid was encircled by Saturn-like rings.\nThe find is the first evidence for such rings around anything in our solar system other than a giant planet.\nThe same data sets suggest that material in the rings orbit the asteroid at radii of about 391 and 405 km, the researchers report online today in Nature.\nThe newly discovered ring system answers a couple of mysteries, says Joseph Burns, a planetary scientist at Cornell University.\nAt present, it’s not clear how Chariklo’s ring system formed.']"

The team of astronomers, based at various South American observatories, including the European Space Organization’s La Silla Observatory, says the rings are made of ice and pebbles.\n\nIt is the first time astronomers have found rings around any of the smaller celestial objects orbiting the Sun.\n\nThe mini-planet is actually a giant asteroid called Chariklo, a celestial body known as a centaur or minor planet. It is believed to have originated in the Kuiper belt, a vast collection of icy celestial objects, but at some point was thrown out. Chariklo, which is about 250 kilometers in diameter, is currently located about 2 billion kilometers away from Earth, between Saturn and Uranus.\n\nThe astronomers were able to detect Chariklo’s rings as it passed in front of a star identified as UCAC4 248-108672 on June 3, 2013.\n\nThe star seemed to disappear for a few moments as Chariklo blocked its light by passing in front of it, an event known as occultation. The astronomers also noted two very short dips in the star’s apparent brightness: First, a few seconds before, and then again a few seconds after, the star’s light was blocked by the centaur.\n\nThese observations led the astronomers to believe that something surrounding the small celestial object was blocking the light.\n\nAfter comparing notes from different observational sites, the team was able to recreate not only the shape and size of Chariklo itself, but also the shape, width, orientation and other properties of its rings.\n\n“We weren’t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system came as a complete surprise,” said Felipe Braga-Ribas of Brazil’s National Observatory in Rio de Janeiro, who planned the observation campaign and is lead author on the paper published in Nature.\n\nThe two narrow rings surrounding Chariklo are about 7 kilometers wide for one ring and 3 kilometers wide for the other.

As late as 1977, astronomers thought that the only thing in the solar system with rings was the planet Saturn. Now, we can add the first asteroid to the list of ringed bodies nearby us. The asteroid 10199 Chariklo hosts two rings, perhaps due to a collision that caused a chain of debris circling its tiny surface.\n\nBesides the 250-kilometer (155-mile) Chariklo, the only other ringed bodies known to us so far are (in order of discovery) Saturn, Uranus, Jupiter and Neptune.\n\n“We weren’t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery — and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system — came as a complete surprise,” stated Felipe Braga-Ribas of the National Observatory (Observatório Nacional) in Brazil, who led the paper about the discovery.\n\nThe rings came to light, so to speak, when astronomers watched Chariklo passing in front of the star UCAC4 248-108672 on June 3, 2013 from seven locations in South America. While watching, they saw two dips in the star’s apparent brightness just before and after the occultation. Better yet, with seven sites watching, researchers could compare the timing to figure out more about the orientation, shape, width and more about the rings.\n\nThe observations revealed what is likely a 12.4-mile (20-kilometer)-wide ring system that is about 1,000 times closer to the asteroid than Earth is to the moon. What’s more, astronomers suspect there could be a moon lying amidst the asteroid’s ring debris.\n\nIf these rings are the leftovers of a collision as astronomers suspect, this would give fodder to the idea that moons (such as our own moon) come to be from collisions of smaller bits of material. This is also a theory for how planets came to be around stars.\n\nThe rings haven’t been named officially yet, but the astronomers are nicknaming them Oiapoque and Chuí after two rivers near the northern and southern ends of Brazil.\n\nBecause these occultation events are so rare and can show us more about asteroids, astronomers pay attention when they occur.

The asteroid Chariklo, 250 kilometers (around 155 miles) and located 1 billion kilometers from Earth, is the smallest object to have a ring system, and future observations could lead to the discovery of a small moon orbiting the asteroid, reports the European Southern Observatory.\n\nWhen researchers were observing Chariklo, using the European Southern Observatory’s La Silla Observatory, located in Chile, and other telescopes around the world on June 3, 2013, the astronomers led by Felipe Braga-Ribas, from Observatório Nacional/MCTI, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, knew the asteroid would occult, pass in front of and block the light from, the star UCAC4 248-108672.\n\nWithout any light from the star, the researchers could gain new insight into the size and shape of asteroid Chariklo but never expected to find out it had two rings surrounding it. Braga-Ribas said in a statement, “We weren’t looking for a ring and didn’t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery — and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system — came as a complete surprise!”\n\nPhoto: ESO/L. Calçada/Nick Risinger\n\nThe two rings are well defined and were discovered when researchers noticed a brief moment when the star\'s brightness dimmed, before and after asteroid Chariklo passed in front of the star, which meant something was blocking the star\'s light. Based on the different telescope observations, the researchers were able to determine the size, width and general orientation of the two rings. The rings of Uranus, in 1977, and Neptune, in 1984, were discovered during occultation, reports ESO.\n\nAccording to the astronomers, the rings are 7 kilometers and 3 kilometers wide and are 9 kilometers apart. The team has nicknamed the two rings Oiapoque and Chuí, after two rivers in Brazil.\n\nUffe Gråe Jørgensen, from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, said in a statement, ""I try to imagine how it would be to stand on the surface of this icy object — small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space — and stare up at a 20-kilometer-wide ring system 1000 times closer than the Moon.""\n\nAsteroid Chariklo is in orbit between Saturn and Uranus and is classified as a “centaur.” These objects were named as such as they can appear to have traits in common with asteroids and comets. Asteroids are usually found closer to the sun and have regular orbit whereas comets are formed farther away from the sun and also produce a temporary atmosphere, known as a coma, as it heats up while asteroids do not produce a coma.\n\nPhoto: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nThe researchers are not sure how the rings were formed but believe they were the result of a collision in its past and believe the asteroid may also contain a small moon. The rings could, one day, form into a moon, much like how moons orbiting planets formed as disks and gas and dust merged together to create a planetary satellite.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Nature.

A space rock called 10199 Chariklo is the first asteroid known to have a ring system, revealing an unexpected possibility for small bodies in the solar system. Until now, rings have been found only around giant planets.\n\nColin Snodgrass of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany, and his colleagues found the rings in June 2013 during an asteroid occultation. This is when a space rock crosses in front of a star as seen from Earth, causing the star to briefly wink out. Seen from sites across South America, the star’s brightness dipped in a distinctive pattern, indicating a set of sharply defined, thin rings.\n\n“We were amazed to see that the star didn’t just blink out and come back – there were very short blinks before and after the main dip, which could only be explained by rings,” says Snodgrass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHidden shepherds\n\nUsually the particles in rings would spread out, making them smoother at the edges. To look so sharp, the asteroid’s rings must be constantly shaped by something, most likely unseen “shepherd” satellites that move near the rings and keep their particles confined. “Shepherds have been observed around some of Uranus and Saturn’s narrow rings,” says team member Bruno Sicardy at Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University in Paris, France. “So even if their origins are very different, Chariklo’s rings seem to follow some common rules.”\n\nChariklo orbits between the paths of Saturn and Uranus, and the asteroid has shown mysterious behaviour in the past. The tiny body was seen dimming and brightening, and its spectrum held hints of water ice disappearing and reappearing. A pair of icy, reflective rings seen from different angles would account for this.\n\nThe authors think the rings could have formed in a number of ways, including impacts flinging up debris, or small moons colliding or being broken up by gravity if they spiralled too close to the asteroid.\n\n“This work is very consistent with all previous data, and provides an explanation which is quite unexpected,” says Aurelie Guilbert-Lepoutre of the European Space Research and Technology Centre in the Netherlands, who did not contribute to the study. “It opens a new and unique perspective on the processes dominating the history of small bodies.”\n\nJournal reference: Nature, DOI: 10.1038/nature13155', 'Video: See how the space rock’s shiny rings were foundAsteroid Chariklo’s bling ring has finally caught our eye (Artist’s impression: Lucie Maquet)Asteroids with Saturn-envy can deck themselves out with glittering rings.\nA space rock called 10199 Chariklo is the first asteroid known to have a ring system, revealing an unexpected possibility for small bodies in the solar system.\nColin Snodgrass of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Göttingen, Germany, and his colleagues found the rings in June 2013 during an asteroid occultation.\nSeen from sites across South America, the star’s brightness dipped in a distinctive pattern, indicating a set of sharply defined, thin rings.\nA pair of icy, reflective rings seen from different angles would account for this.']"

Mike Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, has listed Chariklo as a dwarf planet.\n\nLead author of the study Felipe Braga-Ribas, of the Ministry of Science and Technology in Rio de Janeiro, said: ""We weren\'t looking for a ring and didn\'t think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all, so the discovery - and the amazing amount of detail we saw in the system - came as a complete surprise.""\n\nAstronmers at seven locations in South America tracked Chariklo as it passed in front of the star UCAC4 248-108672 in June 2013.\n\nA few seconds before and a few seconds after the main occultation (when the star\'s light is blocked), there were two further very short dips in the star\'s apparent brightness, suggesting that something else was blocking the light. The team compared what they witnessed from different sites to reconstruct the shape and size of the object and its newly discovered rings.\n\nThe researchers found that the ring system consists of two sharply confined rings only 7km and 3km wide, separated by a clear gap of 9km — around a 250km-diameter object orbiting beyond Saturn.\n\nUffe Gråe Jørgensen, a member of the team from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, said: ""It was quite amazing to realise that we were able not only to detect a ring system, but also pinpoint that it consists of two clearly distinct rings.\n\n""I try to imagine how it would be to stand on ths surface of this icy object - small enough that a fast sports car could reach escape velocity and drive off into space - and stare up at a 20km-wide ring system 1,000 times closer than the moon.""\n\nIt is unknown exactly how the rings were created, but astronomers think they were likely to have been formed from debris left over from a collision.\n\nBraga-Ribas added: ""As well as the rings, it\'s likely that Chariklo has at least one small moon still waiting to be discovered.""\n\nThe rings may later lead to the formation of a small moon.

We have Apple with their horse iOS, we have Google and Android, and Microsoft with Windows Mobile. The thing is watching the mobile industry horse race, is like nothing else we have seen before. We have nothing to compare it to, not even desktop computers and that horse race.\n\nWhen it came to PC market, we saw Apple lose the ground beneath them thanks to Windows. So we turn our attention to today, with the mobile device industry exhibiting a somewhat different pattern. Windows wasn\'t able to hold up, so imagine Microsoft\'s horse falling out of the race for the time being with a hurt leg. No telling if Windows can stay in the race, but for the time being, things aren\'t looking good. So now we have iOS and Android still in the race. Android has taken a huge lead with over 78.1% of all smart phone users, and Apple is far behind with only 17.6% of smart phone users. So the question is, how is iOS even still in the race?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen we look back at the PC race, we see details that show exactly how Apple was taken by Windows. Developers seemed to be the driving force behind both horses, and as Windows began to gain speed, the developers pushed them further. See, little by little Windows gained users, and in doing so, draw more attention from developers. As developers started to develop more for Windows, more users were gained, it was a circle of tech life of sorts. Apple, during this whole circle, just didn\'t fit, and so they lost users. The Steve Jobs took over and things turned for the better for Apple. The mobile industry seems to be having a different effect on developers though.\n\nEven though Apple has fallen so far behind in the race, yes back to the horses, developers continue to develop for iOS. So the developers aren\'t going anywhere, but that still may not be the answer to why iOS is still a thing. We turn to analyst Benedict Evans from Andreessen Horowitz. Evans, during a podcast explained exactly why iOS is still in the race, even if they have already fallen victim to the same mistakes they made with PC\'s. Evans picks apart the numbers and uncovers some truths that we may not like to hear as Android fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe numbers are clear, Android will sell, according to Evans, 2-3 billion devices while Apple will sell 700-900 million devices. These numbers shouldn\'t be a shock to anyone, however it is the quality of those numbers Evans says is the reason. When someone goes into the store, they buy an Apple device, they are dropping closer to $1,000 for the device. According to the podcast, this shows that Apple users are wealthy and ready to spend money, on devices and possibly apps. Which is why developers aren\'t leaving iOS behind, why leave easy money on the table? Is money going to be the thing that keeps Apple alive? Maybe, but there is a small chance Apple could die out and become nothing more than a piece of history.\n\nEvans says, "" My Cambridge professor said, \'The only thing that history teaches you is that something will happen.\'"" The history he is referring to, is the PC war that was going on years ago. Evans continues to say, ""The dynamics of the PC industry were so different that it\'s quite unhelpful to draw a comparison."" To elaborate on that notion, for PC\'s the majority of the sales were made by corporate buyers. Mostly for their employees and offices, design was not the issue for them, it was apps. However, mobile devices are a completely different story. The majority of consumers are not corporate, instead, they are individual users.\n\nAs consumers we are looking for beauty in design, and capabilities, but the average consumer just wants a device that looks good, and specs usually fall under the unimportant category. This is where Apple exceeds, they have a market that is paying attention to them, and not concerned too much with what\'s on the inside. I mean lets face it, we all know that Apple hasn\'t released a new looking or heavily upgraded device in a couple of years. Instead, it is mostly a software update sold in $1000 package. The attention is there so developers aren\'t going anywhere. Let\'s get back to that race idea. iOS may be behind in the race, but that horse has a lot of money behind it, so the jockey will not get off that horse. Instead he will continue to race him, because he brings money to the race. Android is way in the lead, but they don\'t bring as much money to the race, so developers watch, but don\'t go all in on him. This is why Apple and iOS aren\'t going anywhere at least not yet. History may not repeat itself, but at least we know it is possible.', 'Watching technology grow and advance is like watching a horse race, and there are different horses in the form of OS providers.\nWe have Apple with their horse iOS, we have Google and Android, and Microsoft with Windows Mobile.\nThe thing is watching the mobile industry horse race, is like nothing else we have seen before.\nWe have nothing to compare it to, not even desktop computers and that horse race.\nAccording to the podcast, this shows that Apple users are wealthy and ready to spend money, on devices and possibly apps.']"

The panels for each page will reportedly be split up into Overview, Reviews, Details and Related sections rather than the Details, Reviews, Screenshots and Related tabs that are in use now.

Aside from the initial buzz of the mere announcement of the device, my fellow editor Evan made a valid point that a same-day launch of the product certainly helped bring HTC into people’s good graces, and hopefully other manufacturers can follow similar examples in the future.\n\nWhile my article will be further discussing the M8, it will be in a different light. As of right now, HTC’s M8 runs on the Android platform. However, Android isn’t HTC’s only focus. Although Android might be HTC’s main focus, HTC has also been known to dabble with Microsoft’s Windows Phone 8 platform, and rumor has it right now that HTC may be considering releasing a device that looks similar to the M8, but running on Windows Phone 8.1 instead. The question now is, would the M8 be able to sway people to buy into Windows Phone, or does it need more?\n\nOne of the most highly regarded aspects of the M8, or even the original One, is its aluminum unibody design - a needle in the haystack when it comes to Android phones. However, it seems foolish to think that something as simple as design would be enough to draw people in to Windows Phone platform. With Windows Phone’s huge 8.1 update coming sometime in April, there is some hope that perhaps the two combined could really garner some new interest in the platform if all goes smoothly.\n\nThe M8 has a really solid design in my opinion, and I think it could work to set itself apart from Nokia devices. Although Nokia devices are also well-designed (and are particularly tanky) they’ve never really had a particularly posh design. Adding a Windows Phone device that looks similar to an M8 could provide for some serious eye-candy, if nothing else.\n\nM8 or not, though, I think ultimately it does chalk up to whether Windows Phone 8.1 adds the necessary improvements that the platform needs in order to interest the masses. In my own experience with Windows Phone 8, there is a lot that needed to be changed; things that an HTC M8 wouldn’t be able to fix on its own. The lack of notification center really started to bug me after a while, as well as how unorganized the already bleak app store looked to be. However, with both of these issues allegedly being solved with the Windows Phone 8.1 update (among other features and tweaks) I’m finding that the idea of an M8-like design in a Windows Phone device could actually work out fairly well.\n\nOne thing that I do wonder is if the camera will be a big issue. Another positive about Nokia-made Windows Phones is that their cameras are widely regarded as some of the better ones out there. But the HTC One’s camera, both in the M7 and M8, has been criticized for it’s 4-megapixel “UltraPixel” technology. Even the Duo Camera that the M8 added is a feature that many people state they wish was swapped for a higher megapixel count. I think in order to directly compete with the Lumia, HTC would have to make an improvement to the megapixel count.\n\nIn the end, I do think that Windows Phone needs more variety, and more focus from other manufacturers who do make them. Both Samsung and HTC’s big focus has been on Android, while Nokia’s only focus has been on Windows Phone (which will likely be its only focus with the company now directly under Microsoft’s wing). Even before the acquisition, though, Nokia was pretty much the front-running manufacturer if you were considering getting a Windows Phone device for their tanky hardware, great cameras, and Lumia-specific apps. If the Windows Phone 8.1 update solves the issues that Microsoft says it is going to, then it would seem like a good time for HTC to get back in the Windows Phone game.\n\nReaders, what would you think of an HTC M8-like device running on Windows Phone 8.1?

As with with its Surface RT tablet line, Microsoft's Windows 8.1 automatically encrypts disk drives by default. This Windows 8 encryption is active when a Windows 8.1 device is first turned on, and a user would be hard-pressed to know anything was different.\n\nBut there is a difference, and it is that the recovery key, which you need to decrypt the files on the protected drive, is not protected until you go through the step of uploading the key either to a Microsoft Account (where it is stored on SkyDrive and is accessible to the device owner from wherever there is an Internet connection) or to Active Directory, which is the way traditional BitLocker encryption in Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8 has worked.\n\nHere are some details on looking at whether devices are encrypted, ways to manage that encryption, and which devices currently support it.\n\nHow to tell whether devices are encrypted In Windows 8.1, there are two places you can look to see device encryption status. In the Modern (formerly known as Metro ) user interface, you can check out Settings and drill down to PC and Devices, then PC Info. There will be a section in the right pane called Device encryption that will report the current status of Windows 8 encryption on the device itself and let you know of any steps you need to take to enable encryption if it is not already on. There is also a button to disable Windows device encryption, but doing this is not a best practice and isn't recommended.\n\n) user interface, you can check out Settings and drill down to PC and Devices, then PC Info.

There is also a button to disable Windows device encryption, but doing this is not a best practice and isn't recommended. In the old-fashioned Disk Management snap-in to the Microsoft Management Console, you can see in the bottom part of the window, where each physical disk is listed, the volumes that are on those disks. Encrypted volumes will display the words BitLocker Encrypted right beside the partition size and file system display. You can save recovery keys only to a Microsoft account through the Modern interface and the PC Settings screen. There is no Control Panel applet in the traditional desktop interface for managing the encryption.\n\nGroup Policy Objects used for BitLocker While BitLocker can now store recovery keys in SkyDrive as part of the device's Microsoft account integration, enterprises are much more likely to be interested in using Active Directory and Group Policy to manage recovery keys. The BitLocker Group Policy Objects (GPOs) that must be configured are located at Computer Configuration\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\BitLocker Drive Encryption. To have recovery keys stored in the directory, use the following Group Policies: Choose how users can recover BitLocker-protected drives (in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista)\n\nChoose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered\n\nChoose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered\n\nChoose how BitLocker-protected removable drives can be recovered Microsoft TechNet also provides advice on how to prepare Active Directory to receive protected recovery keys."", ""In Windows 8.1, Microsoft has jumped on the encryption bandwagon, if not quite in reaction to the National Security Agency.\nThis Windows 8 encryption is active when a Windows 8.1 device is first turned on, and a user would be hard-pressed to know anything was different.\nHow to tell whether devices are encrypted In Windows 8.1, there are two places you can look to see device encryption status.\nThere is also a button to disable Windows device encryption, but doing this is not a best practice and isn't recommended.)\nThere is also a button to disable Windows device encryption, but doing this is not a best practice and isn't recommended.""]"

Device encryption is more broadly available, data is encrypted upon entry to the device, and the ability to wipe a device enables business data to be remotely wiped. “Just because enterprises have to reckon with this trend, the IT guys don’t get a break”, he said, referring to increased mobility in business.\n\n8.1\n\nIn Windows 8.1, Microsoft has placed “huge investment in biometrics”. With Windows 8.1, users can “bio-enable every Windows prompt in the system so that a fingerprint can be used to authenticate.”\n\nA fingerprint can even be used to make purchases in the Windows store. “We want to make ecommerce easy but secure”, said Ingalls, explaining that the process is as user-friendly as click-to-buy but with the added bonus that children are unable to mistakenly buy anything.\n\n“The mistake that biometrics has made in the past is reliability”, Ingalls conceded, but adds that he is confident this is no longer an issue.\n\n“We consider the fingerprint as an authentic user gesture. It’s not what we use to authenticate you – all it says is that it matches. It’s a symmetric secret”, he said.\n\nWhen Things Go Wrong\n\nIngalls is the first to admit that a stolen fingerprint is indeed a lot harder to rectify than a stolen password. “However, the risk of someone ‘stealing’ your fingerprint is a lot lower than someone stealing your password”, he weighed up.\n\n“Cybercrime is an economic arms race and the time it would take to ‘steal’ a fingerprint and conduct the attack would not be worth the potential money”, he said. “We need to get people away from passwords. Smartcards are much better than passwords but [the industry] didn’t nail usability. Virtual smartcards, however, are awesome”.\n\nFinally, Ingalls advised that a two-step verification process was added to 8.1 “A Microsoft account is a gateway to all your data, and with that is a great responsibility. Two steps are needed to protect that. Now we allow you to choose the second step.”', 'Dustin Ingalls, partner group program manager for Windows Security & Identity, told Infosecurity that Windows 8 has three main focus points: Malware protection; data protection, and modern access controls.\n“We’ve invested in malware protection, and it’s paying off”, said Ingalls.\n“Windows 8 malware infection rates have dramatically improved.” Windows 8 computers are six times less likely to be infected than Windows 7, and 21 times less likely to be infected than Windows XP”.\n8.1In Windows 8.1, Microsoft has placed “huge investment in biometrics”.\nWith Windows 8.1, users can “bio-enable every Windows prompt in the system so that a fingerprint can be used to authenticate.”A fingerprint can even be used to make purchases in the Windows store.']"

Today’s story falls into the latter category, but it’s more about the aftermath. Long story short, a developer named Al Gihuni released a free app called ‘Free Market’. The app did something unique: it allowed you to find an app listed in a different region, perhaps at a lower price. The idea here is that some developers price their apps differently based on the market, or sometimes they run regional sales. ‘Free Market’ though took advantage of that by letting users find those price differences with a few clicks and the app tagline – “Download paid apps for free!” – was quite inflammatory. Developers were not pleased, to say the least.\n\nWe opted not to cover the app due to the somewhat controversial nature of the subject matter. Windows Phone already has enough issues in trying to convince developers to invest their time to make apps. And forget their time, it’s really about money, as it’s quite difficult to make a buck on such a small – but growing – ecosystem. Still, this is certainly a grey area app as giving consumers the power to search for cheaper prices does have a nice ring to it. Getting lower prices is more of an issue for emerging markets, where many people don’t have credit cards to make Store purchases. That means they can never buy an app, so they often rely on those temporary sales and discounts.\n\nRegardless of which side of the debate you fall on, Microsoft has evidently revoked the app from people’s phones. That’s a rare move – one of last resorts – reserved for apps that are malicious or are themselves pirated software. For example, way back in December 2011, we reported to Microsoft a popular paid navigation app had been re-uploaded as a free app to the Store. Sure, Microsoft could just remove the app from the Store, but they took the extra step of revoking it from those who had already downloaded it, essentially mitigating any damage to the original developer. In fairness, Gihuni did delist the app before Microsoft was able to do so. We asked him to comment on that issue and how it transpired:', 'Long story short, a developer named Al Gihuni released a free app called ‘Free Market’.\nThe idea here is that some developers price their apps differently based on the market, or sometimes they run regional sales.\nWindows Phone already has enough issues in trying to convince developers to invest their time to make apps.\nFor example, way back in December 2011, we reported to Microsoft a popular paid navigation app had been re-uploaded as a free app to the Store.\nIn fairness, Gihuni did delist the app before Microsoft was able to do so.']"

48593,http://www.medianama.com/2014/03/223-microsoft-windows-phone-free-license-india/,technology,"['In an unprecedented move, Microsoft has dropped licensing fees from at least two Indian manufacturers Lava and Karbonn for using its Windows Phone operating system, reports Times of India. The company had announced at Mobile World Congress, that it had signed a licensing agreement with these manufacturers to release dual-boot handsets running on Android and Windows Phone.\n\nMultiple sources told TOI that Microsoft has been negotiating with Indian phone companies to produce affordable Windows Phone devices since last year. The agreement however, was signed only after Microsoft waved off Windows Phone licence fee. The publication quotes a senior executive as saying that free Windows Phone is part of a strategic partnership. “For both Microsoft and us, it is an experiment. Windows Phone still doesn’t have lot of appeal in the market but now that it doesn’t have any licence fee, it becomes easier for us to experiment with it,” the executive said.\n\nThis is a major shift in policy for a company that had depended on licensing fees for revenue. Microsoft’s new CEO Satya Nadella had said that the company will focus on “mobile and cloud-first world” rather than the devices and services mantra adopted by former CEO Steve Ballmer.\n\nThe latest deal seems to be exclusive to these smaller manufacturers who have an increasing marketshare in India as of now. It is not clear if the company plans to expand such a deal to mobile manufacturers around the world depending on the response to this concept in India.\n\nNokia effect? Microsoft was charging licensing fees from Nokia, but it was deducted from the $250 million it paid to the Finnish mobile manufacturer to become a Windows Phone only smartphone manufacturer. However, ever since Microsoft announced the acquisition of Nokia, other manufacturers have pretty much stopped making Windows phones. By offering it for free, Microsoft has made it an option again for these OEMs who make Android devices only as of now. There are also reports of Microsoft asking HTC to put Windows Phone operating system as a secondary option on its Android handsets for a significantly reduced (or even zero) license fees.\n\nIt’s not clear if this dual-boot strategy will work, but this way, it’s easier for Microsoft to convince OEMs to put their OS on the devices. It is also easier for OEMs to sell these devices rather than trying to peddle phones that run only Microsoft’s mobile operating system.\n\nMonetisation: Microsoft can still make money when people purchases apps, or in-app products from Windows Store in these phones. Vineet Durani, Director, Windows Phone category at Microsoft had told Medianama in October last year that it is working with telcos for enabling carrier billing on this store. The company has unified billing payment system for PC, Mobile and Xbox platforms last year. This gateway however supports only credit card, which a lot of Indians don’t have. So carrier billing is an important part of the company’s strategy in India.\n\nMicrosoft reportedly also earns $2 billion from Android royalty payments and it’s not clear how that will be affected by this dual-os strategy. Will the company waive off these fees for phones that also run Windows Phone OS?', 'In an unprecedented move, Microsoft has dropped licensing fees from at least two Indian manufacturers Lava and Karbonn for using its Windows Phone operating system, reports Times of India.\nMultiple sources told TOI that Microsoft has been negotiating with Indian phone companies to produce affordable Windows Phone devices since last year.\nThe agreement however, was signed only after Microsoft waved off Windows Phone licence fee.\nThe publication quotes a senior executive as saying that free Windows Phone is part of a strategic partnership.\nWill the company waive off these fees for phones that also run Windows Phone OS?']"

You can get it from the download link here.\n\n6Tag\n\nYea you love Instagram, but if you’d rather have those same effects be applied to images that have a higher resolution than “crap,” then 6Tag is your best bet.

While most HDR apps out there take two exposures, one for shadows and one for highlights, HDR Photo Camera takes three shots, one each for shadows, highlights AND midtones. The extra frame being captured allows for more collective information, yielding a more pleasing and balanced HDR image.

Fortumo is so serious about getting Windows developers on-board that they’ve just launched a fund to pay advances to successful developers for integrating Fortumo payments into their apps. How successful does a developer need to be in order to get the funding? Read on to find out.\n\nIn-App Purchases are extremely common in mobile apps and games these days. As an AT&T customer, I have the option of paying for Windows Phone IAPs by credit card, carrier billing, or Microsoft account. People with different carriers or living in other countries might not have access to those same payment methods. And you normally couldn’t use carrier billing for Windows 8 purchases.\n\nIntegrate Fortumo, get paid early\n\nFortumo’s “Wintegration” campaign allows developers whose apps have reached a certain number of downloads on Windows Phone, Windows 8, iOS, or Android to receive an advance payment when those developers integrate the Fortumo SDK in the Windows Phone or Windows 8 version of those apps. In other words, your app needs to already be popular in order to qualify.\n\nAssuming your app meets the criteria, Fortumo will advance you anywhere between $1,000 and $25,000 towards the IAPs your users would make via Fortumo’s carrier billing. It’s a no-risk proposition for developers. If the app’s Fortumo IAPs don’t exceed the advance, you lose nothing. You already got the advance to keep. Fortumo doesn’t charge a monthly fee or require a minimum volume commitment.\n\nIntegrating Fortumo’s carrier billing into an app or game offers several benefits to users. For instance, it allows carrier billing in Windows 8 apps. Also, some carriers and regions that normally don’t support carrier billing with Windows Phone purchases DO support carrier billing through Fortumo.\n\nWindows Phone and Windows 8 developers can learn more and sign up for the promotion at fortumo.com/wintegration.', 'Mobile payment provider Fortumo allows app developers to easily integrate carrier billing for IAPs into both Windows Phone and Windows 8/RT apps and games.\nFortumo is so serious about getting Windows developers on-board that they’ve just launched a fund to pay advances to successful developers for integrating Fortumo payments into their apps.\nAs an AT&T customer, I have the option of paying for Windows Phone IAPs by credit card, carrier billing, or Microsoft account.\nAlso, some carriers and regions that normally don’t support carrier billing with Windows Phone purchases DO support carrier billing through Fortumo.\nWindows Phone and Windows 8 developers can learn more and sign up for the promotion at fortumo.com/wintegration.']"

The main button on the right side below is takes the shot, the one above that switches to the front-facing camera and the one at the bottom switches flash on and off.\n\nAnother of the new options is the ability to jump quickly to your ‘Blinks’. From the main Blink viewfinder, tap the arrow in the top-left corner to go to your stream of Blinks.\n\nAnd from there, you can tap the icon on the left to view the Gallery of your Blinks, where you can then go back and edit old images, should you wish.\n\nIf you’re looking to create a short moving Blink (as is really the point), all you need to do is take the photo and select how long you’d like the animation to be by selecting which frames you want to include (shown below). You can’t actually select, say, a frame at the start, a few from the middle and some at the end though – you only get to set the start and end points.\n\nAlthough the main aim is to create a sequence of images, if you’re just trying to pick out one individual shot, there’s now a single shot mode – it still takes a sequence of images, it just makes it easier to pick out an individual frame.\n\nTo access the option, you just tap the icon in the top-right corner (shown above) when reviewing your Blink.\n\nJust like when setting a Blink length, you can either tap or scroll through each until you find your favorite.\n\nThe actual functionality of the rest of the app remains largely unchanged, although there is now a focus lock option. Tapping anywhere on the screen will lock the focus on that area, regardless of how and where you move while the shot is being taken. In practice, this was hit-and-miss. Sometimes it kept focus when you moved mid-shot, sometimes it didn’t.\n\nThere’s also now a Live Tile that will update, showing your Blinks on your home screen.\n\nUltimately, Blink seems well suited for trying to capture fast-paced action. Perhaps more so than pigeons, anyway.\n\nSpace for Blink?\n\nOverall, Blink does what is sets out to do pretty well – it takes a fast (with very little delay at all) series of images that you can edit in a very basic way to share as a short Vine-like clip or as a still image.\n\nBut here’s the problem – is there really a need for another dedicated camera app for Windows Phone with Nokia already providing pretty much all you could need to get up-and-running? Its simplicity works in its favor – you’re not going to get lost in settings menus here, but remembering to actually use it in the first place might be a bigger problem.\n\nThere’s another issue here too. I don’t like the social aspect very much. You can share Blinks as animated images across Microsoft’s own So.cl network, Facebook, or Twitter. You also get the option to upload them to your OneDrive account for sharing however you wish.

It claims 25 million users. They can tap into the platform through Box\'s own software or integrate it with desktop and mobile applications using APIs (application programming interfaces). There are more than 35,000 developers building services on the Box platform, the company says.\n\nThe growth of cloud-fed mobile computing is a big part of the promise for Box\'s future, co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie said in a keynote address at the company\'s developer conference in San Francisco.\n\n""We go from a world where our addressable market was 650 million information workers around the world ... to a world now, because of mobile computing, where we\'re going to have 1.3 billion information workers by next year,"" Levie said.\n\nBox is sticking with its cloud story as it prepares for an upcoming IPO for which the company filed paperwork on Monday. But it\'s also exploring different ways to make money from its existing business and to expand beyond that foundation.\n\nOn Wednesday, the company introduced platform pricing, in which enterprises can pay a set price for Box\'s technology, infrastructure and services regardless how many users may take advantage of what they put together. Until now, the only defined way to pay has been per seat.\n\n""We look at the number of users that our customers have and then we project out the price for that company based on the number of users,"" said Chris Yeh, senior vice president for product and platform. ""This is not working for a lot of our customers, who want to consume Box on more of a usage basis.""\n\nFor example, customer Encore Capital Group, which buys debt and collects on it, loads millions of documents into Box and then shares them with a wide range of outside entities, Yeh said in an interview. Encore doesn\'t have a defined number of clients accessing its Box files, so per-user pricing doesn\'t make sense, he said.\n\nBox has set up platform pricing for some customers case by case, but now it has actual plans for companies to choose. The Build plan for customers who are just starting out with Box provides free access to the Box Content API and as many as 25,000 API actions per month. The Scale plan, for customers who want to build deeper hooks into Box\'s platform, costs $500 for every additional 25,000 API actions per month. The Transform plan is for the largest enterprise customers with unique needs. Its pricing is available upon request, Box said.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the company introduced Box View, the first service that\'s independent of its cloud storage platform. Box View converts Microsoft Office documents and PDFs to HTML5 for easy embedding in a website. The documents don\'t have to be stored with Box in order to be converted, Yeh said, so any developer can take advantage of the service.\n\nOnce a file is converted, Box\'s work is done and the HTML5 version can be delivered over the Web. Box View can deliver that document either in a standard Box-branded viewer or in raw HTML5, which users can put into customized views. To create those views, they can use Viewer.js, which Box is providing as a free and open-source tool. Viewer.js offers tricks such as letting users flip through the pages of a document as if in a virtual book. Developers can create their own views and share those as open source.\n\nBox View is based on technology from Crocodoc, a startup that Box acquired last year. It launched the service mostly to engage developers and is charging heavy users mostly just to cover its costs, Yeh said. Ultimately, an enterprise that uses Box View to display some documents may be more open to buying the Box cloud service in the future, he said.\n\nBox View is available in a free plan with up to 1,000 document conversions per month. The Box View Custom plan, for enterprises that use a custom viewer, costs $250 per month for up to 2,500 conversions. Another plan for large enterprise users allows for more than 10,000 conversions per month. Pricing for that is provided on request, Box said.\n\nAt the developer conference, the company also announced the ability to add metadata to files in Box. For example, doctors could attach a patient\'s name and birth date to an X-ray image, making it easier to find among other images. Certain metadata, such as expiration dates for contracts, could also be used to trigger notifications or other actions, Yeh said. Metadata was announced as a private beta last year and is now generally available.\n\nStephen Lawson covers mobile, storage and networking technologies for The IDG News Service.

He was right about mobile, and he’s created the world’s biggest online social network.\n\nSo, is he looney, or visionary?\n\n“Mobile is the platform of today and now we’re starting to also get ready for the platforms of tomorrow. To me, by far the most exciting future platform is around vision or modifying what you see to create augmented and immersive experiences,” Zuckerberg said on a conference call Tuesday discussing the deal. “Today’s acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing. I believe Oculus can be one of the platforms of this future.”\n\nFacebook’s investors seem to think Oculus’s promise is too far off. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based social networking company’s stock fell 7 percent on Wednesday to close at $60.38.\n\nBeyond sticker shock, the WhatsApp and Oculus deals — along with the Facebook’s spurned offer to buy SnapChat for $3 billion– have raised questions about Facebook’s ability to innovate on its own. Some of the company’s most high-profile products, such as the SnapChat-like Poke, the messaging service Facebook Messenger and Home, have flopped. The jury’s still out on Paper, a stand-alone app that lets users read news, Facebook feeds and more.\n\n“Facebook I don’t think has the best innovation strategy,” says Gartner analyst Brian Blau. “So far it’s been ‘move fast and break things.’ Move fast is good, but break thinks, may not be.”\n\nBlau calls the Oculus acquisition “kind of out of left field.”\n\n“We have always thought about experience as a focus of virtual reality,” he says. “Certainly it can be social, but we have not thought about it as a core social experience.”\n\nThat’s not to say it can’t work. There were questions about Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram back when it offered $1 billion for the photo-sharing app (the final purchase price was $715 million) in April 2012 –and Instagram “turned out fine,” Blau points out. Facebook said Tuesday that Instagram has 200 million users, up from 30 million at the time it agreed to buy the company.\n\nOculus is a horizontal acquisition for Facebook, which means it lets the company expand into a new space, rather than grow its core business. It’s a strategy employed by Amazon.com Inc., whose businesses range from online retail to video streaming to tablets, and Google, which recently bought high-tech thermostat and smoke-detector maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion.\n\nLike Facebook, Google is led by a CEO, Larry Page, who has vowed to make huge investments building or buying technology that might not pay off for years. Page can do pretty much as he pleases, too, as long as he gains the support of fellow co-founder Sergey Brin and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt. The trio collectively controls enough votes to overrule the rest of Google’s shareholders.\n\nGoogle has made more than 230 acquisitions since going public nearly a decade ago, but most of those deals have been relatively small for a company that now generates more than $50 billion in annual revenue.\n\nA few of the deals have been large enough for some investors to wonder whether Google’s brain trust had lost its senses.\n\nWhen Google bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.76 billion in stock, some analysts questioned whether the company had paid far too much for a video site with virtually no revenue and a huge stack of potentially expensive legal claims for copyright infringement. But that deal is now widely viewed as a brilliant move. YouTube has productive relationships with most movie and television studios and sells billions of dollars in video advertising while amassing a worldwide audience of more than 1 billion people.\n\nGoogle’s biggest acquisition, a $12.4 billion purchase of troubled cellphone maker Motorola Mobility, turned out to be a dud, just as many analysts predicted it would be when the deal was announced in 2011. Google wound up selling all of Motorola’s device divisions for a combined $5.25 billion, leaving the company with a portfolio of mobile patents that help ward off lawsuits against Google’s Android software.\n\nAndroid, meanwhile, now the world’s most popular mobile operating system, is among several smaller deals that have yielded huge dividends for Google.

He was right about mobile, and he\'s created the world\'s biggest online social network.\n\nSo, is he looney, or visionary?\n\n\n\n�\n\n""Mobile is the platform of today and now we\'re starting to also get ready for the platforms of tomorrow. To me, by far the most exciting future platform is around vision or modifying what you see to create augmented and immersive experiences,"" Zuckerberg said on a conference call Tuesday discussing the deal. ""Today\'s acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing. I believe Oculus can be one of the platforms of this future.""\n\nFacebook\'s investors seem to think Oculus\'s promise is too far off. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based social networking company\'s stock fell 7 percent on Wednesday to close at $60.38.\n\nBeyond sticker shock, the WhatsApp and Oculus deals � along with the Facebook\'s spurned offer to buy SnapChat for $3 billion� have raised questions about Facebook\'s ability to innovate on its own. Some of the company\'s most high-profile products, such as the SnapChat-like Poke, the messaging service Facebook Messenger and Home, have flopped. The jury\'s still out on Paper, a stand-alone app that lets users read news, Facebook feeds and more.\n\n""Facebook I don\'t think has the best innovation strategy,"" says Gartner analyst Brian Blau. ""So far it\'s been \'move fast and break things.\' Move fast is good, but break thinks, may not be.""\n\nBlau calls the Oculus acquisition ""kind of out of left field.""\n\n""We have always thought about experience as a focus of virtual reality,"" he says. ""Certainly it can be social, but we have not thought about it as a core social experience.""\n\nThat\'s not to say it can\'t work. There were questions about Facebook\'s acquisition of Instagram back when it offered $1 billion for the photo-sharing app (the final purchase price was $715 million) in April 2012 �and Instagram ""turned out fine,"" Blau points out. Facebook said Tuesday that Instagram has 200 million users, up from 30 million at the time it agreed to buy the company.\n\nOculus is a horizontal acquisition for Facebook, which means it lets the company expand into a new space, rather than grow its core business.

48648,http://www.cityam.com/article/1395881549/virtual-reality-here-almost,technology,"[""Late on Tuesday, Facebook announced their acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus VR for $2bn. Here, Alex Dymoke gives the low-down on what many predict is the future of gaming and home entertainment\n\nTHE HISTORY\n\nOculus VR started life in 2011 in the Californian garage belonging to the parents of 19-year-old virtual reality enthusiast and self-taught hardware engineer Palmer Luckey. It was there that Luckey built the Oculus Rift prototype out of discarded old bits of tech. The teen managed to get an early version into the hands of id Software co-founder John Carmack, who was impressed enough to conduct his own demonstration of the headset at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2012. Shortly after, Oculus Rift embarked on a Kickstarter that raised almost £2.5m. Then, in January 2013, Marc Andreesen’s venture capital firm invested $75m with a view to turning the Oculus Rift into a consumer product (the consumer version is expected early next year). This week, Luckey’s company was bought by Facebook for $2bn. Not bad for a school drop out.\n\nTHE EXPERIENCE\n\nAlmost everyone lucky enough to get their hands on a demo version of the Oculus Rift has been absolutely blown away by it. A video on the company’s YouTube channel shows a range of people trying the headset for the first time, and the squeals of excitement speak for themselves. With the headset strapped on, immersion is total. On a flight sim, the dashboard of the cockpit becomes more detailed when you lean forward for a closer look. Look above your head or round to the left and right and the field of vision is complete. Headlines from articles describing the Rift experience range from “Mere Words Can’t Do Justice to how Awesome it is Inside the Oculus Rift” to “It's amazing until it makes you want to hurl”. The folks at Oculus say they’ve dealt with the motion sickness problem by increasing resolution, lowering latency and removing the motion blur.\n\nVIRTUAL REALITY\n\nFrom Descartes’ fear that we all might be stuck in one to William Gibson’s sci-fi classic Neuromancer, virtual realities have intrigued humans for centuries. Among engineers and scientists, the virtual reality Holy Grail has been to create a machine that facilitates “presence”, a state in which the brain responds to a world as if it is real, even though it knows it isn’t. Early forays into virtual reality gaming were ill-fated. Nintendo’s Virtual Boy, released in 1994, also employed the use of a head-mounted display. It was cumbersome and clunky (90s graphics don’t lend themselves to a feeling of “presence”) and was shelved after less than a year. Oculus VR, however, is certain that with the Rift, presence is no longer a dream.\n\nTHE EQUIPMENT\n\nThe Oculus Rift is like a pair of goggles with a tiny cinema screen inside. The screen is split in half, with one image for each eye, and the lenses are layered in order to create a 3D image. Sensors in the goggles change the image according to the position of the wearer’s head. This month, Oculus introduced the second version of their development prototype. The Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 has 1080p resolution, a major improvement on the 720p Development Kit 1 that induced nausea in foolhardy gamers. Resolution in the consumer version is going to be even higher. Not only that, the consumer version is going to have a complete redesign (perhaps now with Facebook branding?) so we have no idea what the shop-ready product will look like. However, the development kit is available for $350.\n\nTHE GAMES\n\nGames must be specially designed to work on the Oculus Rift, and with the second development kit already out there developers are working round the clock to add to the already significant list of Oculus-ready games. Many existing games have been modified to incorporate Rift compatibility, including popular titles such as Half Life 2, Skyrim and Bioshock. However, the real excitement lies in titles built specifically for virtual reality. This is because many existing games have elements ill-suited to a head-mounted display format. Still, if you have a load of old games in which you want to get fully immersed, there are a variety of third party programmes including Tridef and VorpX that make previously incompatible Oculus-ready.\n\nTHE COMPETITION\n\nTechies and gamers had been whispering about it for quite some time and this month it was finally confirmed: Sony are working on Project Morpheus, an immersive gaming platform to rival the Oculus Rift. It works in a similar way to Rift, with a headset used in conjunction with a motion sensing camera. Also like Oculus, the hardware is likely to undergo significant changes before finally hitting the shops sometime in the next couple of years. It’s hard to make a comparison at the moment, as we know so little about Sony’s offering, but based on the relatively undetailed spec sheets we can see that the Rift just about outdoes Sony when it comes to visuals – both are 1080p but Oculus has an OLED display, which beats Sony’s LCD panel.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nThere has been more virtual reality software produced in the last year than in the past twenty years combined, and games are just the half of it. As Luckey is fond of reminding us, his machine can be beneficial to fields as diverse as architecture, psychotherapy and the training of public service personnel. People can use Rift to get a sense of a space before they invest in a home. It can also be used to train firemen and paramedics, simulating extreme situations without the threat of real harm. Virtual reality technology has been used in a similar way by the army for years. The key difference with Oculus, though, is affordability – previously head mounted displays have cost in the tens of thousands of pounds. The Rift, however, will cost under $400. One day it could be as commonplace as a PlayStation."", 'Late on Tuesday, Facebook announced their acquisition of virtual reality start-up Oculus VR for $2bn.\nEarly forays into virtual reality gaming were ill-fated.\nThe Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 has 1080p resolution, a major improvement on the 720p Development Kit 1 that induced nausea in foolhardy gamers.\nHowever, the real excitement lies in titles built specifically for virtual reality.\nVirtual reality technology has been used in a similar way by the army for years.']"

But at least it’s a future technology that will definitively be mass market at some point,” said Clavier, the founder and managing partner of Palo Alto-Calif-based SoftTech VC.\n\nInvestors seemed unsure about Zuckerberg’s crystal ball. Shares of Facebook were down more than 6 percent at $60.70 in late trading on Wednesday.\n\nThe deal, which comes less than two months after Facebook announced plans to acquire Whatsapp for $19 billion in cash and stock, raised fears about the beginnings of an unchecked spending spree.\n\n“I’d be surprised if a lot of people want to spend serious time with goggles that shut the world out entirely,” said industry analyst Roger Kay, who wrote a post on the Forbes website on Wednesday that began “Okay, I’ll come right out and say it: Mark Zuckerberg is nuts.”\n\nCRYSTAL BALL-GAZING\n\nDetractors warn that Zuckerberg is spending shareholders’ cash on a 2-year-old company that’s first prototype was infamous for inducing motion sickness, though Oculus says it has largely ironed out the kinks.

With Facebook’s stock up 25 percent over the past six months, some said it was not surprising that the company was choosing to use its stock to place some bets on the future.\n\nAs a percentage of Facebook’s nearly $160 billion market value, the Oculus acquisition is not a “bet the company” deal, said Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter.\n\nThe most surprising thing about the Oculus acquisition was that the buyer was Facebook, and not a hardware company like Apple Inc (AAPL.O), said Schachter.\n\n“It’s Facebook emphasizing a much broader ambition than people perhaps had realized,” he said.

48658,http://mashable.com/2014/03/26/facebook-oculus-sony-microsoft/,technology,"['If you believe what you may have read online in the past 24 hours, in about five to 10 years we\'ll all be donning high-tech goggles when we go online, interacting with people who may be on the other side of the planet in virtual shops, classrooms and city streets. This sci-fi future will have been brought to you by Facebook, thanks to its inspired and forward-looking acquisition of Oculus VR back in 2014.\n\nThat appears to be the dream of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who spoke about creating new kinds of social experiences, enabled by Oculus\' immersive technology. He even name-checked his competition on a conference call about the $2 billion deal, saying that Sony and Microsoft\'s current offerings in immersive technology will never be as far-reaching as Facebook\'s because they\'re strictly console plays.\n\n""[On mobile,] what we see is that about 40% of the time that people spend overall is in gaming,"" Zuckerberg said. ""And about 40% is also spent in social communications. About half of that is in Facebook. What we basically believe is that unlike the Microsoft or Sony pure-console strategies, if you want to make this a real computing platform, you need to fuse both of those things together.""\n\nConsidering Kinect (which isn\'t the same as Oculus, but is clearly Microsoft\'s first foray into immersive experiences) sold 24 million units before it got bundled with the Xbox, it\'s a little disingenuous to dismiss it as small potatoes, compared to a product that hasn\'t even shipped a consumer version yet.\n\nAnd from the start, it was clear Microsoft had bigger ambitions than just gaming. It\'s even beginning to see them through with Kinect for Windows and the budding IllumiRoom concept, which is more holodeck than virtual reality.\n\n""I don\'t think [Zuckerberg] did anyone any favors by propagating the hype,"" said Brian Blau, a research director at Gartner. ""It\'s the same mantra VR has had for 25 years. I believe the immersive experiences are compelling, but i think it\'s going to be years before the tech and apps catch up to people\'s expectations.""\n\nZuckerberg\'s half-right about Sony, though. The company\'s recently unveiled Project Morpheus headset is pretty much just a gaming play — but it\'s a good gaming play. Those who got the demo (like my colleague Chelsea Stark) came away impressed, and its future looks promising. If there\'s been any success story at Sony in the past 20 years, it\'s PlayStation.\n\nYes, Oculus had a lot of good buzz well before Facebook came calling. Everyone who tries it, raves about it, and it\'s no coincidence that the headset was one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns ever.\n\nBut the response to the Oculus Rift has more to do with what it promises than what it actually delivers. An enveloping virtual environment has clear appeal as a concept, and it\'s certainly fueled plenty of compelling science-fiction scenarios over the past 30 years. But when you start to break the idea down to specific virtual experiences, it quickly runs into the all-too-real problems of hardware limitations, software availability and even user disorientation.\n\nMore to the point: There isn\'t a killer app for VR yet, and I\'m pretty sure Facebook wasn\'t at the top of any VR developer\'s to-do list.\n\n""We\'re really at the point where it\'s up to application developers to start building content for this platform,"" said Eric Mizufuka, product manager for new markets at Epson, which makes augmented-reality headsets. ""Identifying killer apps is the next hurdle. For VR, it\'ll be games.""\n\nOn that score, Sony may have an advantage over Oculus. While the Oculus Rift will probably attract more developers than Morpheus due to its open-source nature, that could end up diluting the experience as lousy apps get on the same virtual shelves as good ones. That\'s almost guaranteed not to happen with Morpheus.\n\n""PlayStation isn\'t open,"" Blau said. ""They make sure the games are quality. They\'re not going to attract the large amounts of developers that Oculus will, but those apps are going to be better.""\n\nUltimately, though, no one (apart from maybe the military) has yet created a compelling virtual-reality experience with mass appeal. Plenty have tried; all have failed. The backing of a company like Facebook can certainly help, but it doesn\'t magically solve technical problems or instantly create a thriving platform. Microsoft and Sony, with their long gaming and graphical experience, may be better suited to solve them, anyway — at least for the initial wave of VR, which even Zuckerberg admitted would be focused on gaming.\n\n""There\'s certainly been a lot of talk about [virtual reality], a lot of hope for the tech and what it can do,"" Blau said. ""The harder leap is to build something that meets the expectation that people make in their mind. Nobody today has built a lot of good VR experiences. It\'s a level playing field right now.""\n\nMay the best avatar win.', 'This sci-fi future will have been brought to you by Facebook, thanks to its inspired and forward-looking acquisition of Oculus VR back in 2014.\n""[On mobile,] what we see is that about 40% of the time that people spend overall is in gaming,"" Zuckerberg said.\nI believe the immersive experiences are compelling, but i think it\'s going to be years before the tech and apps catch up to people\'s expectations.""\nBut when you start to break the idea down to specific virtual experiences, it quickly runs into the all-too-real problems of hardware limitations, software availability and even user disorientation.\nNobody today has built a lot of good VR experiences.']"

But here\'s the thing -- Gamasutra made a concerted effort to dig deeper into the topic last year as part of an Advanced I/O theme week, and ever since then we\'ve been steadily curating VR-focused articles on our VR hub What started out as a few notable stories from a week about VR, biofeedback and other neat advanced game I/O tech has blossomed into a decent repository of informative news stories, opinion pieces, feature reports and developer blogs about VR game development.With that in mind, we\'ve taken the liberty of highlighting a few stories that might be of use to anyone developing their own VR experience.- In this free GDC Vault video from GDC Europe 2013, Oculus VR co-founders Palmer Luckey and Nate Mitchell discuss considerations that developers should make in creating VR games and hurdles they will need to overcome.Some of those biggest hurdles, Mitchell explains, are user interface, simulator sickness, and latency. Additionally, Luckey remind developers that ""Pre-cut sequences [don\'t work], because that\'s going to remind the user that they\'re not really inside a virtual world.""- Gamasutra EIC Kris Graft\'s feature on full-body virtual world simulation tech includes some helpful advice from students building VR experiences as part of USC\'s Advanced Games Program.One of the best tips?

There\'s a lot of good information here on how to address latency, simulator sickness and the like.- Okay, this feature about the future of augmented reality and wearable tech covers ground above and beyond virtual reality, but it does include a bunch of interesting insight from developers who are working out how to create cool games for stuff you strap to your face.- Gamasutra member Sebastien Kuntz is the founder of VR middleware company I\'m in VR, and in this blog post he outlines his experiences testing various VR systems to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of VR experiences. He also advises VR developers to design simple, austere experiences to minimize the chance that players will be distracted or nauseated by visual inconsistencies in complex VR environments.- This Gamasutra blog post from E McNeill, developer of the upcoming cyberpunk hacking VR game, sums up some of what McNeill learned about VR development while attending Steam\'s Dev Days developer conference earlier this year.McNeill highlights the ongoing value of Oculus\' VR Best Practices dev guide and shares some VR development advice from Dev Day speakers like Michael Abrash and Palmer Luckey, including that VR is best suited to first-person games and those that revolve around small, highly-detailed handheld objects -- virtual board games, for example.', 'Additionally, Luckey remind developers that ""Pre-cut sequences [don\'t work], because that\'s going to remind the user that they\'re not really inside a virtual world.\n""- Gamasutra EIC Kris Graft\'s feature on full-body virtual world simulation tech includes some helpful advice from students building VR experiences as part of USC\'s Advanced Games Program.One of the best tips?\n""The closer an object is to a player\'s face, the greater the sensation of depth and parallax,"" producer James Iliff told Gamasutra.\n""Make weapons as juicy as possible, and assuming you are using motion controls, have players manually reload their guns with new clips.\n""- Oculus\' Peter Giokaris, who leads up its VR/Unity integration, shares the five most important things developers of VR games should keep in mind in this Gamasutra blog post.']"

It will buy Oculus VR for approximately $2 billion -- $400 million in cash, and the rest in stock. The agreement also arranged $300 million in incentives in the form of cash and stock for certain milestones.\n\nWhat does the company do? It designs virtual reality technology. While there are certainly potential synergies Facebook may achieve with Oculus, should investors be worried about Facebook\'s shameless approach to paying up billions on speculative acquisitions?\n\nZuckerberg\'s reasoning\n\nToday, Oculus is working on bringing to market its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. The goggles allow individuals to experience an immersive computer-generated environment.\n\nZuckerberg was apparently taken aback by how real the experience feels: ""The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you\'re actually present in another place with other people. People who try it say it\'s different from anything they\'ve ever experienced in their lives,"" he said in a post on Facebook.\n\nBut where are the potential synergies for the two companies? While the goggles are focused on gaming today, there are broader applications for Oculus\' virtual reality technology -- at least according to Zuckerberg.\n\nAfter games, we\'re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home. ... One day, we believe this kind of immersive, augmented reality will become a part of daily life for billions of people.\n\nMy imagination is failing me, Mark. Aren\'t we connected enough?\n\nDespite my personal objections, Zuckerberg says this kind of immersive, augmented reality will eventually ""become a part of daily life for billions of people."" In the company\'s press release detailing the acquisition, Zuckerberg even said virtual reality has the potential to emerge as the ""next social and communications platform.""\n\nToo speculative?\n\nI wouldn\'t be surprised if I\'m underestimating Oculus. But $2 billion is a big sum to pay, especially after the company just spent announced a deal valued at around $19 billion (about of tenth of its market capitalization) to buy WhatsApp, a messaging app with an estimated $20 million in revenue in 2013. Even Apple, with its $158.8 billion cash hoard, has never spent more than $500 million to acquire a company.\n\nSure, Oculus is already seeing some success with its Rift headset, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits. But, as Zuckerberg admits, much of the reason for the acquisition was based on some bold forward-looking predictions about the future. And no matter how smart Zuckerberg is, no one has a crystal ball. Even Zuckerberg is prone to misunderstanding the future.\n\nIf Facebook continues to spend so lavishly on speculative acquisitions, there could be risk for investors.', 'It will buy Oculus VR for approximately $2 billion -- $400 million in cash, and the rest in stock.\nIt designs virtual reality technology.\nZuckerberg\'s reasoningToday, Oculus is working on bringing to market its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset.\nWhile the goggles are focused on gaming today, there are broader applications for Oculus\' virtual reality technology -- at least according to Zuckerberg.\nIn the company\'s press release detailing the acquisition, Zuckerberg even said virtual reality has the potential to emerge as the ""next social and communications platform.""']"

We have even more freedom than we had under our investment partners because Facebook is making a long term play on the success of VR, not short-term returns.

We are not going to track you, flash ads at you, or do anything invasive. I am 100% certain that most people will see why this is good in the long term.""\n\n""We promise we won\'t change. If anything, our hardware and software will get even more open, and Facebook is onboard with that.""\n\n""We have not gotten into all the details yet, but a lot of the news is coming. The key points:\n\n1) We can make custom hardware, not rely on the scraps of the mobile phone industry. That is insanely expensive, think hundreds of millions of dollars. More news soon.\n\n2) We can afford to hire everyone we need, the best people that fit into our culture of excellence in all aspects.\n\n3) We can make huge investments in content. More news soon.""\n\n""This deal will definitely make things better. You are right, we have struggled to properly support indie devs because we had to focus our limited resources on our closest partners, that has been a failing that I want to fix. Indie developers are the ones driving this VR revolution more than anyone else, and one of my personal goals has been to support them in a much stronger way.

Tuesday for as much as $2.3 billion marked the fourth 10-digit deal this year of a venture-backed company. Just nine months ago, two-year-old Oculus raised money from Matrix Partners and Spark Capital at a $70 million valuation.\n\nThe quick sale comes a month after Facebook agreed to spend $19 billion on WhatsApp Inc. and seven weeks after Google Inc. completed its $3.2 billion purchase of Nest Labs Inc. Neither of those companies had raised venture financing before 2010. Such fast returns on capital keep venture firms from having to pump numerous rounds of financing into companies while waiting years for a potential IPO.\n\n“We’re early-stage investors, and it takes five to seven years for companies to mature,” Santo Politi, a venture capitalist at Boston-based Spark, said in an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg West. “We didn’t expect it to be this quick. It happens with amazing teams.”\n\nThe recent success of venture capital is bringing increased competition from hedge funds, private-equity firms and mutual funds, which are looking for ways to profit from the technology shifts under way in mobile, cloud computing and connected devices. In addition to the rush of IPOs and acquisitions, startups are raising $100 million private rounds at a record pace from asset managers like BlackRock Inc., T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and Tiger Global Management LLC.\n\nIndustry Rebound\n\nFor the venture industry, the acquisitions are fueling a rebound after returns lagged public markets for a decade, according to data published last year from Cambridge Associates LLC. Scores of startups failed in the dot-com crash from 2000 to 2003, and the IPO market screeched to a halt during the financial crisis starting in 2008.\n\nLast year, at least 10 venture firms generated returns of $1 billion or more from acquisitions and IPOs, of which Twitter Inc. was the biggest. Pension funds and endowments, which serve as limited partners in venture firms, are coming back, said Byron Deeter of Bessemer Venture Partners in Menlo Park, California.\n\n“A lot of portfolio managers fundamentally questioned the asset class,” Deeter said. “That has swung back to where industry averages are becoming nicely attractive again.”\n\nFaster Pace\n\nAfter WhatsApp, Nest and Oculus, the next biggest deal this year was VMware Inc.’s $1.54 billion purchase of AirWatch LLC, whose technology helps businesses protect and manage mobile devices. The four deals in the first three months of this year match the total number of billion-dollar acquisitions of venture-backed companies in 2012 and 2013 combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThere’s been almost no acquisition-related money to be made in the public technology market. Lenovo Group Ltd. is spending about $5 billion buying the Motorola Mobility handset business from Google and the low-end server unit from International Business Machines Corp. The only other big purchase so far this year was RF Micro Devices Inc.’s agreement in February to acquire TriQuint Semiconductor Inc. for $1.59 billion.\n\nOn the Oculus deal, Matrix and Spark made about 20 times their money, while Sequoia Capital parlayed an investment of $58 million in text messaging company WhatsApp into about $3.5 billion. Nest, a maker of Web-connected thermostats, provided more than 15-fold returns to backers Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Shasta Ventures.\n\nDiversity Risk\n\nOne potential risk in the current market is the lack of diversity among acquirers. Facebook and Google are spending on startups, though they have few rivals when it comes to seeking billion-dollar deals.\n\nYahoo! Inc. bought blogging company Tumblr Inc. last year for $1.1 billion and AirWatch was VMware’s second purchase in two years, after the $1.26 billion acquisition of software networking startup Nicira Inc. in 2012.\n\nThat doesn’t mean others aren’t looking. Oculus had plenty of interest in addition to Facebook, said Antonio Rodriguez, an Oculus board member and partner at Matrix in Boston.\n\n“This is not a company that has lacked for suitors along the way,” Rodriguez said. “Facebook just did a much better job talking to the team.”', 'Venture capital firms, already reveling in the most vibrant initial public offering market in more than half a decade, are being further propelled by a spate of billion-dollar acquisitions.\nThe quick sale comes a month after Facebook agreed to spend $19 billion on WhatsApp Inc. and seven weeks after Google Inc. completed its $3.2 billion purchase of Nest Labs Inc.\nSuch fast returns on capital keep venture firms from having to pump numerous rounds of financing into companies while waiting years for a potential IPO.\nLast year, at least 10 venture firms generated returns of $1 billion or more from acquisitions and IPOs, of which Twitter Inc. was the biggest.\nPension funds and endowments, which serve as limited partners in venture firms, are coming back, said Byron Deeter of Bessemer Venture Partners in Menlo Park, California.']"

Tuesday’s acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion shows that the company wants to ensure its longevity after social media has hit its saturation point. The dive into virtual reality might seem rash in 2014, but it makes more sense a few years down the line.\n\nSo what might Facebook look like in 2020, with VR on its side? Here’s a couple of threads it could explore:\n\nDouble down on games\n\nA more concerted effort in gaming is the most natural extension of the work that Oculus VR has already done Within a few years, the company could establish a cross-platform VR experience, offering a games platform similar to Valve’s Steam: cross-platform VR and social games available for purchase directly through the website.\n\nOculus reaffirmed its commitment to gaming in a blog post about the acquisition:\n\n“Over the next 10 years, virtual reality will become ubiquitous, affordable, and transformative, and it begins with a truly next-generation gaming experience. This partnership ensures that the Oculus platform is coming, and that it’s going to change gaming forever.”\n\nWith a vibrant community already in place, Oculus could reinvigorate Facebook’s gaming platform and give it that little extra it needs to compete on mobile.\n\nVirtual reality communications and events\n\nWhat Facebook’s really betting on, however, is Oculus’s success outside the gaming world. Mark Zuckerberg said in his post about the deal that he wants to take virtual reality to the next level — and hopes it will be the next communication trend after mobile. Imagine a future where you could pop on a VR headset, plug into Facebook and watch a live concert or feel as if you’re face-to-face someone who lives across the country. Facebook could become not only a social media platform, but a broker of VR communications.\n\nVC Fred Wilson wrote a blog post about Facebook’s decision to tackle VR, specifically that it’s about finding the “next big thing”:\n\n“It isn’t clear if the next thing is virtual reality, the internet of things, drones, machine learning, or something else. Larry doesn’t know. Zuck doesn’t know. I don’t know. But the race is on to figure it out. Trillions of dollars of collective market capitalizations are on the line. So a couple billion here or there is chump change. Except for the people who collect that chump change for selling them an option on the next thing. It’s real money to us.”\n\nIf Facebook is right and the next big thing is VR, then the more the company focuses on integrating VR technology into its platform in all areas, the bigger the payoff could be by 2020.\n\nReal Facebook hardware?\n\nPerhaps the most important thing about Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus is that it also gained a highly capable hardware team. While Facebook has said Oculus will remain independent for the time being, the company might want to pursue branded hardware years down the line. The hardware aspect is also, arguably, the most “future-proof” part of the deal: in addition to CTO John Carmack, a pioneer in graphics technology in his own right, Oculus has a stable of engineers with backgrounds in mobile, robotics and many aspects of hardware design.\n\nEven if VR ends up not being the cash cow Facebook hopes it will become, the team it has acquired will give Facebook the flexibility to pursue more hardware initiatives in-house, rather than relying on outside partnerships — like the one it forged with HTC to push mobile product — to make it happen.', 'Tuesday’s acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion shows that the company wants to ensure its longevity after social media has hit its saturation point.\nThe dive into virtual reality might seem rash in 2014, but it makes more sense a few years down the line.\nSo what might Facebook look like in 2020, with VR on its side?\nVirtual reality communications and eventsWhat Facebook’s really betting on, however, is Oculus’s success outside the gaming world.\nReal Facebook hardware?']"

The library district has had it available for people to demo for a few months.\n\nThe devices have gained a lot of of attention since Facebook purchased Oculus VR on March 25 for $2 billion. The company was founded through a $2.5 million Kickstarter campaign.\n\nOli Sanidas, director of digital services for Arapahoe Library District, said Oculus has received a lot of attention at recent electronics and gaming conferences. He said offering the virtual reality device is part of a larger technology initiative that is also lets library uses try Google Glass and 3D printers.\n\n“We’re trying to find things that could be of interest — we’re not just trying to select random technology,” Sanidas said. “We thought it would be interesting to show our patrons what does virtual reality look like in this day and age.”\n\nHe said Oculus Rift is a bit more advanced than the virtual reality machines people may have tried in the 1990s or early 2000s. The device has sensors that monitor your movements and change the view based on where your head is moving. He said the graphics are closer to PlayStation 3 or older. The devices they’re offering have mostly games including a roller coaster, driving, helicopter, elephant, rafting, and scary maze simulation.\n\n“I don’t think I can predict totally where it’s going, but it’s a new level of immersion for gaming.” Sanidas said.\n\nOther uses at some point might include surgery training for doctors.\n\nSanidas said beyond just showing patrons relevant technology, he’s hoping the experience will open up a new world of possibility for game and application designers and coders.\n\n“If you got to see it in the library and that inspired you to build something, that’s fantastic,” he said.\n\nThere’s no set schedule for when or how long a patron can play and experiment with the device, but Sanidas said patrons are spending about five to 10 minutes with Oculus Rift.\n\n“If someone wants to spend a good long time with it and there’s not a line, we’ll let them spend as much time as they need to,” he said.\n\nSanidas said version two of the device is coming out in July. It is expected to have higher resolution and the district will probably purchase it. He said if the devices are popular enough, they will consider buying more than one for each branch. He said each device cost $300.\n\nFor more information on how to schedule a time to demo Oculus Rift, visit arapahoelibraries.org/oculus-rift-demo-library\n\nClayton Woullard: 303-954-2953, cwoullard@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yhclayton', 'While virtual reality headset Oculus Rift has yet to be made available for general consumers, the Arapahoe Library District has units people can test.\nThe library district has had it available for people to demo for a few months.\nOli Sanidas, director of digital services for Arapahoe Library District, said Oculus has received a lot of attention at recent electronics and gaming conferences.\n“We’re trying to find things that could be of interest — we’re not just trying to select random technology,” Sanidas said.\nFor more information on how to schedule a time to demo Oculus Rift, visit arapahoelibraries.org/oculus-rift-demo-libraryClayton Woullard: 303-954-2953, cwoullard@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yhclayton']"
48680,http://www.tampabay.com/features/popculture/rescape-is-picking-up-where-oculus-rift-never-went/2172074,technology,"['While the tech world is tittering about Facebook\'s breathtaking $2 billion acquisition of Oculus Rift (and whether it is a boon or bane for virtual reality gaming), a tiny firm in Sweden hopes to ride a similar wave of initial crowdsourcing support.\n\nThe difference is, 13th Lab has a product people might actually use.\n\nReScape is a new project that uses your iPhone to map your environment and turn it into a virtual reality FPS game board. The phone is locked into a plastic, submachine gun-like controller and fitted with a camera that helps the program stitch together this AR game, then layers AI opponents on it to create an immersive shooter that reacts to player movements.\n\nThe application is based on NASA technology called Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, or SLAM, a technique the company said was largely used in robotics. 13th Lab is adapting the method for other applications, including ReScape.\n\nThe developers have taken a page from countless other gaming apps and are attempting to fund the project with a Kickstarter campaign, seeking $150,000 by April 16 to build the controllers and a software development kit that can be used to make any number of AR games. The firm has already made a shooter called Office Defender, which lets you turn your corporate HQ into a virtual shooting gallery filled with enemy soldiers — co-op players even get a digital makeover to look suitably well-equipped in game.\n\nThe company says an iOS shooter can be adapted to the technology, if you can\'t wander around your office pretending to shoot people for some strange reason. They use Quake as an example, and it appears to translate pretty well.\n\nReports say there are some growing pains with the product, as some obstacles are difficult for the software to read, but that\'s to be expected from early version SDKs. More importantly, the very idea of what ReScape offers is quite literally a game changer.\n\nDevelopers have been trying for years to make VR and AR games work. There have been some mild successes, such as games that use the PlayStation Eye and Xbox Kinect, and some spectacular failures, like Nintendo\'s Virtual Boy. Lately the talk has been about the Oculus Rift, and how it will revolutionize the industry. Rift creator Palmer Luckey has said the acquisition by Zuckerberg and company makes a lot of sense, because it ""accelerates our vision."" But just from looking at what has kind of worked and what certainly hasn\'t points to one big problem.\n\nNo one wants to wear those damn goggles.\n\nIt doesn\'t matter how cool Oculus Rift may be, because people still simply don\'t cotton to having to put things on their faces to experience entertainment. At the movie theater, sure, but report after report shows that as impressive as 3D television has become, sales consistently fail to meet expectations. Besides cost, one of the biggest factors cited is having to wear the glasses.\n\nReScape removes all that. Even with the advent of voice- and motion-controlled games, people are used to holding a controller in their hands. The technology lends itself quite well to the FPS genre, seeing as how shooter fans — populated with coveted early adopters — are used to playing games that involve a firearm-like controller, even if home consoles have shied away from the gimmick in recent years. Plus, how easy is it to strap your phone to a controller and play for 10 minutes, rather than get out a set of VR goggles and make sure the room is empty?\n\nIf it sounds like a smartphone is a poor substitute for wraparound vision or even a large TV screen, 13th Lab points out it\'s all a matter of perspective. Take your iPhone and hold it 9 inches in front of your face. They argue it\'s the same as a 50-inch TV at 9 feet away. And your peripheral vision isn\'t ruined in the process.\n\nWhether ReScape ever makes it beyond footnote status in the annals of gaming history is up in the air. But if it makes it out of the planning stages, I wouldn\'t be surprised to see it perform better than however Oculus Rift ends up. At the very least, ReScape is sure to please its Kickstarter backers much more than Luckey\'s initial supporters have been the past few days.\n\nJoshua Gillin writes about video games for tbt*.

Since debuting on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter two years ago, the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset quickly became the most-talked-about device in gaming.\n\nVirtual reality is so hot that Sony announced its own VR headset — Project Morpheus — last week, and even showed one of the first games made for the Oculus Rift running on Sony hardware: the starfighter simulator EVE: Valkyrie.\n\nGamers and developers alike have been expecting big things from Oculus, and even speculating about an acquisition — just not by Facebook.\n\n""I\'d say I was pretty shocked,"" says E McNeil, the developer of a virtual reality game called Darknet. His first reaction to news of the Oculus acquisition was pretty common among his fellow developers, he says. ""A lot of people were thinking that maybe Microsoft would try to purchase Oculus — or some other gaming company, and I guess Facebook is involved in gaming. No one really saw this coming. A lot of people are surprised right now.""\n\nSome of that surprise has turned to anger; many of the hundreds of comments on the Oculus blog post announcing the deal can\'t be read on air. The commenters accuse Oculus of abandoning its grass-roots vision, and worry that Oculus headsets will be flooded with Facebook\'s ads.\n\nThe companies are strange bedfellows.\n\n""Facebook is distraction-ware, and Oculus Rift is definitely not distraction-ware; it requires the application of a device to your face, and it\'s arresting, and it\'s immersive,"" says game industry journalist Leigh Alexander.\n\nUnlike clunkier attempts at virtual reality in the 1980s and \'90s, the Oculus Rift provides what developers call ""presence."" Putting on the snorkel-like Oculus mask feels like diving into another world — ironically, like one free of the technological distractions of our own.\n\nFacebook, on the other hand, is synonymous with casual games like Candy Crush Saga that marry classic game mechanics with lucrative microtransactions, like paying for extra moves.\n\n""Facebook promised that it was going to be a viable platform for game developers before, and there\'s a lot of reasons why that hasn\'t gone so well, or why that fad was particularly short-lived,"" Alexander says. ""Even though there are games like Candy Crush that are still played pretty actively on Facebook, I think there are a lot of developers that would prefer to continue innovating and go in another direction.""\n\nA lot more is at stake with virtual reality than just games. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions the Oculus being used to take people courtside at sports games, and into distant classrooms. He calls it a ""new communication platform.""\n\nDanfung Dennis is an Academy Award-nominated filmmaker who is already at work on a film designed for the Oculus Rift and other VR headsets. He says Facebook is just looking to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n""This is a fundamentally new medium. A new form of computing. So I think it\'s natural for any company that is trying to build a stake in the future and is trying to have a stake in the next major platform to be considering VR,"" he says.\n\nOculus\' founder, 21-year-old Palmer Luckey, took to Reddit on Tuesday night to make his case for the buyout. And there\'s no shortage of explaining the company will be expected to do: At least one high-profile project, an adaption of the popular game Minecraft, has already been canceled. The creator of Minecraft went so far as to call Facebook ""creepy.""\n\nSome would-be Oculus developers are pledging to cancel their orders for the latest development kits that they would have used to build new software for the headset.\n\nAlexander says this could be a heat-of-the-moment reaction by gamers. ""We\'re used to pressing a button when something comes up, and I think right now we\'re in knee-jerk mode.""\n\nNot all developers see the purchase as a bad thing: There\'s a silver lining in the deep pockets that Facebook brings to Oculus. Facebook\'s billions can evolve Oculus far faster than the startup would have been able to on its own, and the social network says Oculus will continue to operate independently, much as Instagram has.\n\nTurnstyle News is a tech and digital culture site from Youth Radio.', 'Backlash To Facebook Buying Virtual Reality Firm Comes SwiftlyEnlarge this image toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen Facebook purchases a company, you can often hear a collective groan go around the Internet — ""There goes the neighborhood.""\nThe Oculus VR acquisition announced Tuesday is Facebook\'s first high-profile hardware purchase — a very popular one, too.\nSince debuting on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter two years ago, the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset quickly became the most-talked-about device in gaming.\n""I\'d say I was pretty shocked,"" says E McNeil, the developer of a virtual reality game called Darknet.\nUnlike clunkier attempts at virtual reality in the 1980s and \'90s, the Oculus Rift provides what developers call ""presence.""']"

In December, Andreessen Horowitz led a $75 million round of Series B funding for Oculus VR, which included ""significant"" additional investment from Spark Capital, Matrix Partners and Formation 8.\n\n""Facebook came knocking after the second round of financing,"" Politi told Business Insider. ""Just like everyone else that had seen the product, he [Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg] fell in love.""\n\nOculus VR raised $2.4 million through Kickstarter in September 2012, far surpassing the $250,000 it had hoped for. The Oculus Rift had been marketed as a virtual reality headset for video games during its original campaign, but Oculus VR had always planned to do much more, according to Politi.\n\n""The company always had in mind that this was going to be a mainstream product,"" he said. ""Facebook coming in doesn\'t change it.""\n\nAccording to a blog post from Zuckerberg, Facebook plans to ""accelerate"" Oculus\' plans to encourage immersive gaming, but also wants to expand virtual reality to broader use cases. Politi offered some theoretical use cases explaining how Facebook could work with a device like the Oculus Rift. For example, rather than logging in to a computer, Facebook users could put on their Oculus Rift and chat with friends virtually, becoming completely immersed in their environment.\n\nThere\'s been much discussion about how Facebook could integrate with Oculus VR\'s technology, but there\'s also a large opportunity for Oculus VR to benefit as well, Politi says. Typically, a platform would need to amass millions of users before big-name developers are interested in creating apps for that ecosystem. Facebook could address that concern, according to Politi.\n\n""Facebook has billions of users, and if only a subset of those adopted this product, it\'s a huge audience,"" he said.\n\nPoliti also notes that there are other large tech companies interested in working with Oculus VR\'s technology, and said that there are a ""bunch"" of partnerships that haven\'t been announced yet.\n\n""I\'m not surprised at all that it happened when it happened,"" he said.

It is a transformative and disruptive technology that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it\'s only just the beginning,"" Oculus VR co-founder and CEO Brendan Iribe said in a statement.\n\nScientists and researchers have worked on the concept of virtual reality - a computer-powered headset, room or other device that lets a person be enveloped in a digitally created experience without physically relocating to a different place - since the 1960s. But no one has fully delivered on the promise.\n\nChallenges Ahead\n\nGartner Research analyst Brian Blau, a former virtual-reality researcher, developer and entrepreneur, said Facebook will face the same technological challenges with its first major foray into consumer tech hardware.\n\n""Building great virtual-reality experiences is difficult,"" Blau said. ""It\'s a risky move, to be honest.""\n\nWith Oculus, Facebook is buying a company that in just two years jumped to the front of virtual-reality development with its only product, the Oculus Rift, which uses high-definition 3-D view screens over the eyes to simulate a 360-degree experience.\n\nThe Irvine startup last year landed a $75 million investment round led by Silicon Valley venture-capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. Oculus also raised $2.4 million on Kickstarter in August, so the Facebook deal will make Oculus the most successful crowdfunded project of all time.\n\nOculus executives were at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last week trying to persuade game makers to buy the company\'s Rift Development Kit so they could work on virtual-reality games and other applications. The company said it has orders for about 75,000 development kits.\n\nElectronics and entertainment giant Sony stole some of Oculus\' thunder by announcing Project Morpheus - competing virtual-reality headgear for the PlayStation 4 home video-game console.\n\nThe Facebook deal, however, gives Oculus a bigger war chest to battle Sony and some 15 other companies working on head-mounted virtual-reality devices. But the Rift is still only in a second prototype stage. Although published reports said it might go on sale this year, company executives have declined to outline a timetable to avoid disappointing the market.\n\nFacebook will buy Oculus for $400 million in cash and $1.6 billion worth of stock. The deal includes an additional $300 million in cash and stock that will be paid if Oculus reaches ""certain milestones,"" the companies said.\n\nAnother Big Buy\n\nThis is the second big purchase for Facebook in a month. In February, Facebook agreed to buy mobile texting app maker WhatsApp of Menlo Park for $19 billion, in a deal expected to close this year. Facebook also bought online photo-sharing app Instagram for $700 million in 2012.\n\nBoth of those deals fit more immediately into Facebook\'s goal of becoming the world\'s communications hub. The company may also want to prevent rival Google from gaining too much ground in wearable computing with its Google Glass project.\n\nBut Zuckerberg said the Oculus deal fits Facebook\'s strategic growth plans over the next decade.\n\nThe Facebook deal upset one early Oculus investor, ""Minecraft"" creator Markus Persson.

He was right about mobile, and he's created the world's biggest online social network.\n\nSo, is he loony, or visionary?\n\n“Mobile is the platform of today and now we're starting to also get ready for the platforms of tomorrow. To me, by far the most exciting future platform is around vision or modifying what you see to create augmented and immersive experiences,” Zuckerberg said on a conference call Tuesday discussing the deal. “Today's acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing. I believe Oculus can be one of the platforms of this future.”\n\nFacebook's investors seem to think Oculus's promise is too far off. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based social networking company's stock fell 7 per cent on Wednesday to close at $60.38.\n\nBeyond sticker shock, the WhatsApp and Oculus deals — along with the Facebook's spurned offer to buy SnapChat for $3 billion- have raised questions about Facebook's ability to innovate on its own. Some of the company's most high-profile products, such as the SnapChat-like Poke, the messaging service Facebook Messenger and Home, have flopped. The jury's still out on Paper, a stand-alone app that lets users read news, Facebook feeds and more.\n\n“Facebook I don't think has the best innovation strategy,” says Gartner analyst Brian Blau. “So far it's been 'move fast and break things.' Move fast is good, but break thinks, may not be.”\n\nBlau calls the Oculus acquisition “kind of out of left field.”\n\n“We have always thought about experience as a focus of virtual reality,” he says. “Certainly it can be social, but we have not thought about it as a core social experience.”\n\nThat's not to say it can't work. There were questions about Facebook's acquisition of Instagram back when it offered $1 billion for the photo-sharing app (the final purchase price was $715 million) in April 2012 -and Instagram “turned out fine,” Blau points out. Facebook said Tuesday that Instagram has 200 million users, up from 30 million at the time it agreed to buy the company.\n\nOculus is a horizontal acquisition for Facebook, which means it lets the company expand into a new space, rather than grow its core business. It's a strategy employed by Amazon.com Inc., whose businesses range from online retail to video streaming to tablets, and Google Inc., which recently bought hi-tech thermostat and smoke-detector maker Nest Labs for $3.2 billion.\n\nLike Facebook, Google is led by a CEO, Larry Page, who has vowed to make huge investments building or buying technology that might not pay off for years. Page can do pretty much as he pleases, too, as long as he gains the support of fellow co-founder Sergey Brin and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt. The trio collectively controls enough votes to overrule the rest of Google's shareholders.\n\nGoogle has made more than 230 acquisitions since going public nearly a decade ago, but most of those deals have been relatively small for a company that now generates more than $50 billion in annual revenue.\n\nA few of the deals have been large enough for some investors to wonder whether Google's brain trust had lost its senses.\n\nWhen Google bought YouTube in 2006 for $1.76 billion in stock, some analysts questioned whether the company had paid far too much for a video site with virtually no revenue and a huge stack of potentially expensive legal claims for copyright infringement. But that deal is now widely viewed as a brilliant move. YouTube has productive relationships with most movie and television studios and sells billions of dollars in video advertising while amassing a worldwide audience of more than 1 billion people.\n\nGoogle's biggest acquisition, a $12.4 billion purchase of troubled cellphone maker Motorola Mobility, turned out to be a dud, just as many analysts predicted it would be when the deal was announced in 2011. Google wound up selling all of Motorola's device divisions for a combined $5.25 billion, leaving the company with a portfolio of mobile patents that help ward off lawsuits against Google's Android software.\n\nAndroid, meanwhile, now the world's most popular mobile operating system, is among several smaller deals that have yielded huge dividends for Google.

Its price was too small to require disclosure."", ""FACEBOOK’S latest multi-billion dollar acquisition of virtual reality headset maker Oculus is prompting some people to wonder if CEO Mark Zuckerberg is already living in an alternate reality.\nLongtime technology analyst Roger Kay wonders whether Zuckerberg “is nuts” for agreeing to pay $2 billion for Oculus less than five weeks after inking a deal to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion.\nI believe Oculus can be one of the platforms of this future.”Facebook's investors seem to think Oculus's promise is too far off.\nMove fast is good, but break thinks, may not be.”Blau calls the Oculus acquisition “kind of out of left field.”“We have always thought about experience as a focus of virtual reality,” he says.\nLike Facebook, Google is led by a CEO, Larry Page, who has vowed to make huge investments building or buying technology that might not pay off for years.""]"

But as the bewilderment and disbelief started to fade and reality began to sink in, I realized Facebook buying Oculus\n\nLoading\n\nIn spite of the tremendous hype surrounding virtual reality amongst the games industry and enthusiasts, the mass market appeal for VR has yet to be proven. For many, VR is still closely associated with the earliest manifestations of the 1980s and 90s — Virtual Boy, gimmicky shopping mall attractions, etc. — and it’s a stigma that may be tough to shake. Anyone who tries the Rift immediately understands the difference, but creating opportunities to experience the product, let alone commanding attention long enough to generate curiosity is not easy, especially for a start-up led by inventors, gamers, and engineers.Facebook’s brand equity and immense marketing resources could help propel Oculus and the Rift from niche market darling to a household name. To gamers and VR purists, mainstream awareness may seem insignificant — or could even sully Oculus’ mission — but it’s critical to broader adoption, and subsequently, greater interest and investment by content makers. The more consumer interest there is and the more units there are in the wild, the more lucrative the platform will be for game developers and app makers.Another important takeaway from this week’s announcement is Facebook’s seeming lack of interest in making margins on hardware sales. “We’re not going to try and make a profit off of the devices long-term,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. “We view this as a software and services thing.” As a result, Oculus will have the freedom to price the retail version of the Rift low enough to be accessible for more cost-conscious consumers. In an interview with IGN , the company’s leadership emphasized how Facebook’s resources will allow them to purchase components at lower prices, build units at a significantly larger scale, and ultimately at a lower cost to consumers.\n\nOf course, since Oculus hadn’t committed to a price or release date prior to the acquisition, we’ll never know how much the final product will differ from the company’s original plans, but if the goal is to build a large install base, keeping costs as low as possible would seemingly be paramount.\n\nLoading\n\nBut for all of the benefits — both theoretical and actual — there are legitimate concerns. Facebook is a business built upon commoditizing and monetizing its users. Despite its stringent emphasis on privacy, Facebook targets advertising and other promotional campaigns based upon a user’s age, sex, location, interests, and browsing behavior. In Zuckerberg’s own words, Facebook sees great value in Rift as a platform for “software and services,” which suggests a heavier handed approach to the Rift's functionality. While Facebook’s influence may not be evident for months or even years, it ultimately intends to build and monetize a business out of Oculus and the Rift.\n\nThe big question, however, is how.\n\nLoading\n\nFacebook and Oculus are such an odd pairing that it’s not immediately clear how the social networking giant could establish a meaningful revenue model in VR. In the wake of the announcement, countless Photoshopped images and memes have emerged, depicting VR Facebook news feeds, Farmville Simulator, a VR game emblazoned with ads, and the like. Though exaggerated for the sake of satire, the point the community is trying to make isn’t completely without merit — Facebook's homepage is laden with contextual advertising and promoted posts.But if you look at how Facebook has approached other acquisitions, specifically Instagram, its influence has been subtle — if not completely unrecognizable. Nearly two years later, the only major change has been the small, non-invasive, and, most importantly, optional sharing and linking of data between Facebook and Instagram.\n\nIt’d be naive to think that Facebook won’t significantly alter how Oculus and the Rift evolve in the long-term, but it’s also unfair to assume that it will be inherently negative for users. In fact, VR’s unproven viability on a broad scale makes it all the more imperative for Facebook to ensure its efforts don’t diminish the experience. For now, Facebook claims it will be hands-off and will offer more potential benefits than drawbacks — lower costs, greater scale, and backing that will make Rift a more alluring platform for developers.\n\nAt some point, existing and prospective Rift owners may have to decide whether or not they want to volunteer themselves and their data to Facebook's ecosystem of services and software — regardless of whether it's intrusively designed or not — but for now, in spite of appearances, Oculus is in an advantageous position and we should all feel cautiously optimistic.\n\nScott Lowe is IGN's resident tech expert and first-person shooter fanatic.

Google Inc has been testing Google Glass, a stamp-sized electronic screen mounted to a pair of eyeglasses for several years. Last week, it introduced an effort to develop computerised wristwatches. On Tuesday, Facebook said virtual-reality technology could emerge as the next social and communications platform.\n\n“The history of our industry is that every 10 or 15 years there’s a new major computing platform, whether it’s the PC, the Web or now mobile,” Facebook co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts and media on Tuesday to discuss the acquisition.\n\n“We’re making a long-term bet that immersive, virtual and augmented reality will become a part of people’s daily life,” the 29-year-old Zuckerberg said, noting that wearing the Oculus goggles was “different than anything I’ve ever experienced in my life.”\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook was not interested in becoming a hardware company and did not intend to try to make a profit from sales of the devices over the long term. Instead, he said Facebook’s software and services would continue to serve as the company’s underlying business, potentially generating revenue on Oculus devices through everything from advertising to sales of virtual goods.\n\nWhile Oculus will operate as an independent company, Zuckerberg stressed that Facebook’s plans for Oculus extended well beyond games.', 'San Francisco, March 26 (Reuters): Facebook Inc will acquire two-year-old Oculus VR Inc, a maker of virtual-reality glasses for gaming, for $2 billion, buying its way into the fast-growing wearable devices arena with its first-ever hardware deal.\nMany in the industry believe that wearable devices could represent the next big platform shift.\nOn Tuesday, Facebook said virtual-reality technology could emerge as the next social and communications platform.\nInstead, he said Facebook’s software and services would continue to serve as the company’s underlying business, potentially generating revenue on Oculus devices through everything from advertising to sales of virtual goods.\nWhile Oculus will operate as an independent company, Zuckerberg stressed that Facebook’s plans for Oculus extended well beyond games.']"

People are communicating more in small circles of close friends on messaging apps.\n\nFacebook has been adding only small features and cluttering its pages with annoying ads. Its biggest innovation has been in the way it markets user data and photos, and that hasn\'t particularly endeared it to its users.\n\nMeanwhile, Google has been testing self-driving vehicles - like those we see in science-fiction movies.\n\nIt is researching how the brain works so that it can predict what we search for, where we want to go, and what we want to eat.\n\nIt is aiming to become our trusted personal assistant just as it has become our librarian. And it has been testing new ways of delivering internet access and developing futuristic displays embedded in eyeglasses.\n\nCompanies need to experiment with ""moonshots"" such as these if they are to survive in today\'s era of exponentially advancing technologies - when innovations come out of nowhere and disrupt entire industries.\n\nIt seems that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has recognised the threat.\n\nFacebook\'s recent acquisition of WhatsApp for a record-breaking US$19 billion offers Facebook a unique advantage in the rapidly growing mobile-social-media space; and its acquisition of virtual-reality headset maker Oculus gives it an edge in the future market for virtual-reality displays.\n\nThough Zuckerberg may have missed the opportunity to invent his own technologies, he is now doing the smart thing by using Facebook\'s stock as a currency to buy what he needs.\n\nBut it\'s not that easy.\n\nIntegrating acquired technologies into a company when it has been extremely successful is even harder than doing so when it is desperate to reinvent itself. Until their backs are against the wall, technologists always believe that theirs is the best solution, and they resist change.\n\nThere are always internal battles due to the ""not invented here"" syndrome and to technological incompatibilities.\n\nWhatsApp is a mobile app known for its culture of ""no ads, no games, no gimmicks,"" and that is how it became so successful and gained hundreds of millions of users. Facebook\'s entire business model is based on selling ads, games and gimmicks.\n\nPerhaps it will find profitable ways of mining WhatsApp user data, but it will be a struggle. As well, the revenue it can gain from users in countries where WhatsApp\'s market share is large - such as India, Kenya and Brazil - is very small.\n\nWith the Oculus acquisition, Facebook has entered the hardware business. This is a tough business for any company, as Google learned when it acquired Motorola and had to beat an expensive retreat.\n\nHardware necessitates massive capital outlays for manufacturing and inventory management.\n\nIt necessitates the creation of distribution channels and customer-support mechanisms - all of which are new to Facebook. Microsoft turned Xbox into a success, but only after many years of billion-dollar losses. It still has not succeeded in the computer-tablet market despite massive investments.\n\nZuckerberg no doubt has a plan to acquire more companies and to diversify Facebook\'s technologies.\n\nFacebook may well be in luck and find its next multibillion-dollar revenue source.\n\nIt is encouraging to see the company behaving as though it is doomed unless it reinvents itself.\n\nThis is the same challenge that all Silicon Valley companies now face and that other industries will soon face as technology continues its exponential advance.', ""Facebook has been adding only small features and cluttering its pages with annoying ads.\nWith the Oculus acquisition, Facebook has entered the hardware business.\nThis is a tough business for any company, as Google learned when it acquired Motorola and had to beat an expensive retreat.\nIt necessitates the creation of distribution channels and customer-support mechanisms - all of which are new to Facebook.\nZuckerberg no doubt has a plan to acquire more companies and to diversify Facebook's technologies.""]"

Notice the pattern in the recent big tech acquisitions? Facebook is really, really spending big on getting all futuristic.\n\nIt may seem like distant past, but Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram was viewed as potentially foolhardy when it happened. The monstrous growth of Instagram and its recent success in the hot micro video segment has pretty much proven Facebook made the right call.\n\nTuesday’s acquisition of Oculus Rift seems wildly extravagant — paying $2 billion for an exciting, but seemingly niche, high-end immersive gaming technology is kind of loopy. But Facebook apparently views buying the future as a must.\n\nWhatsApp cost $19 billion and monetization of its 400 million users is deep, deep in the future as long as Facebook keeps its pledge to not hammer the service with ads. To some extent, Twitter and Google are acting like Facebook, though on a more modest scale.\n\nTwitter’s Vine acquisition took place before the service exploded to becoming the No. 1 app in America in June 2013; at the time when the transaction cleared, the concept of 6-second video clips becoming a major new product category was theoretical at best.\n\nGoogle’s Nest purchase is also fairly daring, although it’s a lot easier seeing sentient thermometers going mainstream before virtual reality gear.\n\nEveryone is buying the future — products and concepts that just might become huge revenue generators around 2022.\n\nEveryone except Microsoft.\n\nEven as its rivals from Yahoo to Google to Facebook look deep into the next decade, Microsoft is looking into the past.

And TechCrunch says that Facebook is denying that it plans to alter the Oculus’s hardware or slap its own logo on the device.\n\nEven though Oculus Rift was seen as an exciting gaming gadget, Facebook may do other things with it, including creating a new social experience. Mark Zuckerberg suggested that Facebook aims to fuse gaming and social communication together – according to the CEO, 40% of the time that people spend online on computers is for gaming purposes, while 40% is for social networking.\n\n“People will build a model of a place far away and you’ll go see it,” Zuckerberg said during a conference call. “It’s like teleporting.”\n\nUnsurprisingly though, Facebook may use Oculus Rift for monetization purposes as well. “We view this as a software and services thing,” Zuckerberg said during conference call, “a network where people can communicate and buy things.”\n\nEven so, the Facebook deal is seen as “the best shot virtual reality has ever had and probably will ever said,” by Oculus Rift co-founder Palmer Luckey. “Mark does believe in our vision of virtual reality, and we’re going to continue operating independently, delivering what we’ve always wanted to deliver,” he further told The Verge.\n\nNot all virtual reality fans are equally impressed or excited about the purchase though.

Actual reality is hard enough to navigate. I have barely mastered the interface, and I am 26 years old.\n\nI can’t get the dang thing to save. I still walk into things. I still haven’t gotten flossing to work, even though that’s clearly a built-in command. I keep repeating elaborate series of actions that never obtain any result. I am forever putting important items down and forgetting them. I can’t figure out how to get extra lives. I spend most of my time wandering around making unnecessary hand gestures and murmuring to myself, like a Sim who has been surprised by a new piece of furniture. I haven’t even managed to steal any automobiles, and if I have any superpowers I have yet to unlock them. No one ever tells me what my objectives are. To an uninformed observer, it would appear that my only consistent objective is to get coffee every day no matter what else is going on, and that doesn’t seem right.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther players keep zooming past me, flying airplanes and conducting heists and making millions of dollars. Evidently they have discovered cheat codes of which I am unaware.\n\nBut one person who seems to have gotten actual reality to work is Palmer Luckey of Oculus Rift. Facebook just bought Oculus for two billion dollars. He wrote a note on Reddit trying to explain why this was a good idea — there are at least 2 billion reasons.\n\nReddit’s up in arms. Judging by many of the comments, the people who lavishly crowdfunded the Kickstarter for the virtual reality project, to the tune of two million dollars back in 2012, are up in arms too.\n\nThis says less about Oculus and more about Kickstarting, in general. Kickstarting, in general, consists of people giving you hope and you giving them money. But it’s all muddied by the terminology — project, backer. As Patrick Klepek wrote on Giant Bomb News, “Backer. That’s a problematic term. It sounds too much like investor. It implies more control than what Kickstarter actually offers.” (Read the whole piece; it’s great!)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSometimes this works. You get your magical fly swatter from the future without a hitch, and everyone goes home happy. Sometimes, this doesn’t. I’m still waiting for that novel I kickstarted months and months ago. (No pressure.)\n\nBut this is the trouble with Kickstarter — you get the spurious sense of being an investor in something without any of the perks. You’re, as Klepek notes, emotionally invested. You paid money. You had feelings. That seems like an investment. Where’s your payoff?\n\nBut it’s all in the fine print. You get perks, but no say. You give people your money so that they will, you hope, make you things. “You hope” being the key phrase. But there is no guarantee that they will make the things in question, and you have no equity. The only virtual reality experience you are guaranteed is the one where you imagine that you are going to be compensated in some way for being an enthusiastic early supporter of the project.\n\nIt’s the same problem Facebook has, to a degree, the one that makes us so mistrustful of it. It’s free because you’re not the consumer: you’re the product. It feels like one experience — it’s designed to give you that experience — but it’s another. When you give money to make a Kickstarter project happen, you’re not the investor: you’re the consumer. Talk about virtual reality.\n\nAD', 'I am not an expert in Virtual Reality.\nJudging by many of the comments, the people who lavishly crowdfunded the Kickstarter for the virtual reality project, to the tune of two million dollars back in 2012, are up in arms too.\nBut this is the trouble with Kickstarter — you get the spurious sense of being an investor in something without any of the perks.\nWhen you give money to make a Kickstarter project happen, you’re not the investor: you’re the consumer.\nTalk about virtual reality.']"

Now his backers are angry he\'s sold out to the social media giant\n\nYou love your local bookshop. When you and some friends met the proprietor before it opened, you were so impressed that you each donated a small amount to help him get going. As a way of saying thank you, he gave you a free book and painted your names on the wall. Word spread, and soon people were travelling long distances to visit. You feel happy and proud. You were there at the beginning, and you have helped to make something that will benefit everybody. Then you hear the news. The nice proprietor has sold it all to Amazon. He\'s now a billionaire. You still aren\'t. You feel exactly how the people who gave money to Palmer Luckey on Kickstarter now feel.\n\nLuckey is the young Californian inventor of Oculus Rift, a new type of virtual reality goggles. The headsets are not available to consumers yet, but more or less everyone who tries them says the same thing: ""Wooah!"", or words to that effect. In the summer of 2012, during early development, Luckey appealed for donations on Kickstarter, a crowdfunding website that raises money for new projects that people want to see realised.\n\nWhen the appeal closed, 9,522 people had put in a total of $2,437,429 (about £1.5m), almost 10 times the amount that Luckey asked for. According to the size of their contribution, donors received anything from a thank you note to their own prototype. On Tuesday it was announced that Oculus was being sold to Facebook for $2bn. ""I\'m passionate about bringing games to the next level,"" Luckey told prospective investors in his original Kickstarter video. It perhaps went without saying that, on the whole, people are also passionate about sipping Krug in a swimming pool full of money.\n\n""This is about the best possible outcome for the future of virtual reality, not my wallet,"" Luckey told his outraged supporters on Reddit, and there are some reasons to believe him. He says, for instance, that the Rift will now be much cheaper and better when it comes out. He promises that ""you will not need a Facebook account to use or develop … the Rift"", and that Oculus the company won\'t change.""If anything,"" he says, ""our hardware and software will get even more open, and Facebook is onboard with that … The partnership … means a better Oculus Rift with fewer compromises even faster than we anticipated.""\n\nOthers argue that letting Mark Zuckerberg do what he likes with the technology before it even launches would not be a partnership at all. Many express concern about Facebook\'s record, which they see as intrusive and splattered with advertising. Some come to the conclusion that Luckey, who is still just 21, has been terribly naive. This, however, is very much the mild end of the comments.\n\n""You selling out to Facebook is a disgrace,"" says Sergey Chubukov on Kickstarter. ""It damages not only your reputation, but the whole of crowdfunding. I cannot put into words how betrayed I feel by this."" ""Fuck you, Palmer,"" says deletemeapril162014 on Reddit.

The news that Facebook (FB) was the company that pulled the trigger and bought Oculus VR caught me off–guard. Like many industry watchers, I would have pegged Microsoft (MSFT) to be the most likely suitor. It has the cash, and with Sony’s VR move on the PS4, MSFT could use a response for the Xbox One.\n\nEven Valve would make sense — it’s the company that helped develop the Oculus Rift prototype, after all. And it has a vested interest in making its Steam Machine PC gaming in the living room platform initiative more attractive to console gamers.\n\nBut Facebook?\n\nCommercial virtual reality headsets have been firmly focused on the video game industry. The Oculus Rift headset, in particular, has made its name with mind-blowing VR-enabled video game demos.\n\nFB does casual games like Zynga’s (ZNGA) Farmville 2, but a sci-fi first person shooter like Half-Life (one of the titles optimized for Oculus Rift)? Not so much.\n\nDoes Facebook expect that its users will don Oculus Rift VR headsets for an even more immersive personal sharing of their family photos, Likes and favorite Internet memes? Given the difficulty Google (GOOG) has had in gaining public acceptance of its Glass augmented eyewear, I can’t imagine FB is going to have much luck convincing people to don headgear the size of a scuba mask.\n\nSo why did FB buy Oculus VR? Here are three possible reasons:\n\nOculus VR: A Bet on Future VR Integration With Social Media\n\nIn its corporate blog post about the FB deal, the Oculus VR team wrote about Facebook staff visiting their office, experiencing the Oculus Rift and sharing a “vision of creating a new platform for interaction that allows billions of people to connect in a way never before possible.”\n\nThat sounds a lot like a future Facebook where virtual reality lets you not just see the photos of your high school friend’s new kitchen renovation, but actual experience the glory of the new cabinets, granite countertops and smart appliances through VR.\n\nEven if it does require silly-looking headgear.\n\nOculus VR: A Counter to Those “Facebook Users are Getting Old” Complaints\n\nEvery day, we hear warnings that Facebook users are getting old and that young people are abandoning the platform. This can make investors nervous that FB may face a collapse on the same scale as MySpace, where the cool kids leave first and only a few oldsters reluctant to change are left to turn the lights off.\n\nWhether this scenario is likely or not, FB would obviously prefer to be a hub for the younger demographic, too. Hardcore video game players tend to skew young, and the Oculus Rift is highly regarded by gamers and the tech industry in general.\n\nAs the owner of Oculus Rift, FB regains some hip cred. Maybe even a method to draw these gamers onto the social media platform. How about automatic posting of high scores or dramatic game video captures to a Facebook account for sharing with the gaming community?\n\nBut the problem is, this crowd tends to be suspicious.\n\nThe first evidence of backlash to the deal took only hours. The creator of Minecraft — one of the most popular games out there and a title in line for an Oculus Rift version — has pulled the plug, tweeting that “Facebook creeps me out.”\n\nThat’s bad news for Oculus VR and for FB stock.\n\nOculus VR: Oculus Rift Means Diversification for FB\n\nMicrosoft did it. Google is doing it in a big way. One strategy to counter the threat of slowing (or declining) Facebook membership is to diversify into hardware.\n\nIt helps if that hardware drives users to your software services (like Google’s Android devices contribute to its search ad revenue), but even hardware on its own can help to take the sting out of a bad quarter and calm fears that your company is a one-trick pony.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also talking about expanding Oculus VR technology beyond gaming into education and other markets, so this deal could be about eventual FB services diversification beyond its core social media platform as well.\n\nEven after shelling out $4 billion in cash as part of its $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, Facebook still has plenty of cash on hand ($11.5 billion at the end of Q4 2013 minus that Whats App buy).\n\nBy acquiring Oculus VR and the Oculus Rift, FB diversifies just a little bit with a foray into hardware, has the best VR equipment and minds out there to work on making social media even more sticky. And it even gets a shot at drawing a younger demographic — and hardcore gamers — into the Facebook web.\n\nThe Oculus Rift bet could eventually pay off in a big way for FB stock.\n\nAnd even if it doesn’t, $2 billion (only $400 million of which is cash) represents a relatively minor expenditure in today’s tech world — especially for a company the size of Facebook.\n\nAs of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\n', 'If you’re going to buy your way into VR, then Oculus VR is it.\nThe news that Facebook (FB) was the company that pulled the trigger and bought Oculus VR caught me off–guard.\nEven Valve would make sense — it’s the company that helped develop the Oculus Rift prototype, after all.\nAs the owner of Oculus Rift, FB regains some hip cred.\nOculus VR: Oculus Rift Means Diversification for FBMicrosoft did it.']"

The headsets cover a user\'s eyes and create an immersive world that reacts to turning one\'s head or moving back and forth.\n\nBeyond games, Zuckerberg said virtual reality headsets might someday be used to enjoy a courtside seat at a basketball game, study in a classroom, consult with a doctor face-to-face or shop in a virtual store. The technology also has social applications, he said.\n\n""Imagine sharing not just moments with friends online but entire experiences and adventures,"" he said.\n\nIt is Facebook\'s second big acquisition in as many months. Last month the social network announced that it would pay $19 billion for deal messaging startup WhatsApp, a deal that hasn\'t closed.\n\n""I don\'t think you should expect us to make multiple multibillion-dollar acquisitions within a couple months frequently,"" Zuckerberg said.\n\nBut he called Oculus a ""unique"" company with a major lead on rivals in technology, engineering talent and developer interest.

Oculus employees are also eligible for an additional $300 million if the company achieves certain targets.\n\nFacebook Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman said Oculus was valued based on the expected returns from the video game industry alone, with a higher return expected if it can expand into communications, entertainment or other fields.\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook intends to let Oculus continue with its roadmap of development but help out with recruiting, marketing, infrastructure and opening doors to new partnerships. He said he intends not to make a profit on hardware but instead make the product affordable and ubiquitous so Facebook can look at generating revenue from services, software, advertising, virtual goods or other areas.\n\nFacebook says Oculus has received more than 75,000 pre-orders for second-generation development kits for the headset at $350 apiece. The kits are to ship in July.\n\nSales of Oculus\' development kits alone are 10 times bigger than all other headsets in the history of virtual reality, said Antonio Rodriguez, general partner of venture capital fund Matrix Partners, an early investor that put $18.5 million in Oculus starting last year.\n\nHe said he decided to invest within minutes of trying on a pair of the goggles. Games he\'s seen being developed for the system include one where the player jumps off the side of a building and tries to avoid hitting things on the way down, and another where the player picks up and moves around blocks in constructing their own world.\n\nRodriguez said virtual reality could be used to enhance virtual tours of homes for potential buyers and for getting a flavor for distant locations before planning a vacation, say to Cancun.\n\n""Short of the sunburn and the smell of the sweet Caribbean Sea, you\'re getting the whole experience,"" he said.

In a story about the deal, the New York Times quotes a source who claims Facebook will eventually redesign and rebrand the Oculus headset:\n\nAccording to a person involved in the deal who was not allowed to speak publicly because he was not authorized by either company, Facebook eventually plans to redesign the Oculus hardware and rebrand it with a Facebook interface and logo.\n\nUpdate: In a statement to TechCrunch, Facebook has denied the allegation by the Times’ source. The rumored redesign is ""not true and not in the spirit of our relationship [with Oculus],"" Facebook says.\n\nAs the Times points out, news of the acquisition has also given one developer cold feet. Minecraft creator Markus Persson tweeted this yesterday:\n\nWe were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus. I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.\n\nStill, the deal’s architects maintain that it makes sense. In a blog post on the company’s website, Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey says that he, too, had his reservations at first—but was eventually convinced:\n\nWhen Facebook first approached us about partnering, I was skeptical. As I learned more about the company and its vision and spoke with Mark, the partnership not only made sense, but became the clear and obvious path to delivering virtual reality to everyone. Facebook was founded with the vision of making the world a more connected place. Virtual reality is a medium that allows us to share experiences with others in ways that were never before possible.\n\nLuckey goes on to promise ""[v]ery little changes day-to-day at Oculus,"" although he says the company will have ""substantially more resources to build the right team."" And speaking of resources, Luckey had some interesting things to add on Reddit:\n\nWe have not gotten into all the details yet, but a lot of the news is coming. The key points: 1) We can make custom hardware, not rely on the scraps of the mobile phone industry. That is insanely expensive, think hundreds of millions of dollars. More news soon. 2) We can afford to hire everyone we need, the best people that fit into our culture of excellence in all aspects. 3) We can make huge investments in content. More news soon.\n\nLuckey went on to note, ""This deal specifically lets us greatly lower the price of the Rift."" That jibes with a related InfoWorld story that quotes Mark Zuckerberg as saying, ""We’re not going to try to make a profit selling the devices, long-term. We view this as a software and services thing."" It sounds like Facebook could follow in the footsteps of console vendors with a razor-and-blades business model for the Oculus Rift.\n\nI suppose that sounds pretty good. Then again, I can’t help but notice that Luckey looks a little conflicted in the mugshot at the bottom of his blog post. Maybe he just got a call from Zuck about a FarmVille-branded Oculus headset…', 'More juicy news fodder is floating to the surface after yesterday’s announcement that Facebook plans to buy Oculus VR.\nUpdate: In a statement to TechCrunch, Facebook has denied the allegation by the Times’ source.\nThe rumored redesign is ""not true and not in the spirit of our relationship [with Oculus],"" Facebook says.\nMinecraft creator Markus Persson tweeted this yesterday:We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus.\nIt sounds like Facebook could follow in the footsteps of console vendors with a razor-and-blades business model for the Oculus Rift.']"

Over 9,500 people backed the initial call for funding in August and September 2012. Many who donated felt they were helping a cool new product -- the Oculus Rift headset -- that was outside of the influence of the usual Silicon Valley giants. Then Facebook (FB) came calling.\n\nRelated: Facebook to buy virtual reality firm Oculus VR for $2 billion\n\nIt seems the reality of business, the plans of a social media powerhouse, and the hopes and dreams of mom and pop investors who liked the idea of ""starting the next big thing"" are colliding in a nasty mix of bile, disappointment and a belief that the ""little guy"" (aka crowdfunders) got double crossed.\n\nOn the Kickstarter\'s ""backers"" page Sergey Chubukov said, ""You selling out to Facebook is a disgrace. It damages not only your reputation, but the whole of crowdfunding. I cannot put into words how betrayed I feel by this.""\n\nThat was but one of many outraged voices. Sander van Rossen left this comment, ""Glad you guys were able to sell out with a product built on our money. I can understand that you guys need more money to be able to compete with Sony, Bat Facebook? Come on!""\n\nPhilipp Struchtrup spouted this: ""Thanks for selling us out Palmer! You couldn\'t have chosen a worse company. Why not also team up with the NSA... Sadly I supported this company. A mistake which will not happen again.""\n\nThere were a few backers, like Jeff McMorrris, who took a more sanguine approach, ""I am not sure why everyone\'s so upset. Facebook is going to increase resources available to Oculus. It\'s just silly to think it\'s going to become an advertising platform. Facebook is smart. They saw the future, just like the rest of us here and bought it for $2 billion. They got a bargain.""\n\nReaction on social media site Reddit was largely tame. Many people there looked at the bigger picture.\n\n""I know people are offended and outraged about this, but turning down such a huge number of cash for your creation is too hard to ignore. They basically do not have to work for the rest of their lives, several of them, and their families. For a virtual gadget, nonetheless. People don\'t seem to understand that the creators don\'t owe you anything,"" one commenter wrote.\n\nSome on Reddit even noted that the Oculus founders may take Facebook\'s money and start something else with it, although some thought the team behind Oculus may have lost their most important edge: the ""it"" factor. As one commenter said, ""At the very least its gone from ""cool"" to ""not cool"" in a flash.""\n\nKickstarter backers understand they have no real stake in the company. Sometimes they receive t-shirts or other promotional items, but they do not get stock or any decision making power. Those who contributed over $300 in the Oculus VR crowdfunding campaign were supposed to receive a pair of the gaming glasses in the development phase.\n\nNicholas Negroponte, founder of the influential MIT Media Lab told CNNMoney, ""They have no right to be angry. I was astonished at the naivete of people. Each side...Facebook and Oculus will get better partners. This is analogous to people who were complaining when Google bought Nest. I find it surprising.""\n\nWhen asked about the level of acrimony that some crowdfunders seemed to feel, Negroponte attributed it to envy.\n\nWe\'ll see soon enough whether this anger lasts, and, more importantly, if it has any impact on future Kickstarter campaigns for emerging tech companies.', 'Facebook might not have a ""dislike"" button, but its $2 billion deal to buy Oculus VR is getting plenty of negative feedback, especially from people who participated in a Kickstarter campaign to help the fledgling virtual reality company.\nOculus VR chief Palmer Luckey used Kickstarter to raise $2.4 million.\nKickstarter backers understand they have no real stake in the company.\nThose who contributed over $300 in the Oculus VR crowdfunding campaign were supposed to receive a pair of the gaming glasses in the development phase.\nWe\'ll see soon enough whether this anger lasts, and, more importantly, if it has any impact on future Kickstarter campaigns for emerging tech companies.']"

Facebook, on the other hand, has about 1.2 billion users. Depending on how Facebook incorporates Oculus’ technology into their social networking, they could make mainstream an experience that until now has been mostly limited to gaming.\n\nWorking out of his parents’ garage, the 20-year-old Palmer Luckey built the Oculus Rift headset out of ski goggles and smartphone and tablet parts, then posted his invention on Kickstarter to raise money for the prototype that he thought would forever change gaming.\n\n“The Holy Grail of gaming,” as Making Sen$e called it last year, the Rift allows users to exist within the game. That same technology tricks the brain into experiencing seemingly real-life scenarios — whether that’s the terrors of Poe’s pit or the joys of Michelangelo’s David — by tracking movements. In Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, for example, sensors track hand positions to an accuracy of one-quarter-of-one-millimeter, 200 times a second, according to director Jeremy Bailenson.\n\nIn his lab, Bailenson is exploring ways to harness virtual reality for positive effects. Exposing college students to avatars of their older selves, for example, has been demonstrated to make young people more willing to save for retirement. They bond with their “senior selves,” inspiring in them deeper empathy for their future financial struggles. Bailenson believes that when people experience life as a cow through virtual reality, they will be less tolerant of slaughtering, in the same way that shoppers who cut down a tree in a virtual world are less inclined to buy non-recycled toilet paper.\n\nBut as excited as he is about the possibilities to engineer behavioral and social improvements with virtual reality, Bailenson is leery of virtual reality in a commercial market. “I think of virtual reality like uranium. It can heat homes and it can destroy nations,” he told the NewsHour.\n\nThe big question now is how Facebook will use that technology. Bailenson met with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at this Stanford lab, and they discussed using virtual reality for educational, environmental and health applications, he told the NewsHour Wednesday. With virtual reality, your friends won’t just be messaging each other, Bailenson said; “it’ll be as if they are in the room with you.”\n\nBut Bailenson himself is not a Facebook user, having told Paul Solman last year that Internet users should remove high-resolution photos of themselves from the web to prevent companies from developing fake avatars that could be made to do any number of things in a virtual world.\n\nAdvertisers, for example, will be able to exploit virtual reality’s psychological effects, even to the point of influencing voting behavior.\n\nSeeing your image morphed with the face of a political candidate, for instance, can make you more sympathetic to that candidate.\n\nAnother of virtual reality’s early developers, Jaron Lanier, told Making Sen$e he used to think “VR” tilted more toward the positive, “approximately because virtual bullets aren’t bullets, but virtual art is still art.” But he too is wary of its use in Silicon Valley, where technology, he said last year, has created a “giant sort of spying system, where we collect data on people, to try to sell them things and try to influence them.”', 'Oculus VR, the virtual reality company Facebook purchased for $2 billion Tuesday, has sold about 75,000 of its headsets to game developers, but none to the public.\nDepending on how Facebook incorporates Oculus’ technology into their social networking, they could make mainstream an experience that until now has been mostly limited to gaming.\nIn his lab, Bailenson is exploring ways to harness virtual reality for positive effects.\nBut as excited as he is about the possibilities to engineer behavioral and social improvements with virtual reality, Bailenson is leery of virtual reality in a commercial market.\n“I think of virtual reality like uranium.']"

The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and impressive record of earnings per share growth. However, as a counter to these strengths, we find that the company\'s return on equity has been disappointing."" Highlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: FB\'s very impressive revenue growth greatly exceeded the industry average of 16.4%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues leaped by 63.1%. Growth in the company\'s revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.\n\nAlthough FB\'s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.03 is very low, it is currently higher than that of the industry average. Along with this, the company maintains a quick ratio of 11.46, which clearly demonstrates the ability to cover short-term cash needs.\n\nPowered by its strong earnings growth of 566.66% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 158.97% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Setting our sights on the months ahead, however, we feel that the stock\'s sharp appreciation over the last year has driven it to a price level which is now relatively expensive compared to the rest of its industry. The implication is that its reduced upside potential is not good enough to warrant further investment at this time.\n\nCurrent return on equity exceeded its ROE from the same quarter one year prior.

Immediately following the announcement, there was a backlash from Wall Street, developers and early supporters of Oculus who had provided seed capital on Kickstarter.\n\nAs a West Coast-based company, Facebook announced the purchase about an hour-and-a-half after stock markets closed in New York on tuesday. Despite confident words from Zuckerburg in a phone call with investors, Facebook's stock price, which closed up for the day, slid below its Tuesday opening price of $64.25 during after-hours trading.\n\nThe slide continued on Wednesday. At the time of writing, shares of Facebook are down more than four points, or 6.5 percent.\n\nMoney talks, for sure, but a more impassioned response came from the video game and technology communities. After all, “Designed for gamers, by gamers,” was one of Oculus Rift’s selling points on Kickstarter, and many backers felt the company betrayed the grassroots, independent spirit that led them to donating.\n\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, explained the purchase on Reddit, promising that the Facebook acquisition will be good for video gamers.\n\nThe public reaction was far less positive.\n\n“Palmer, as a die-hard fan and supporter since the first day that the kickstarter went live, I am legitimately disappointed by this news, not to mention your response [sic],” Reddit user “Soranma” wrote in one of the top responses to Luckey’s post.\n\n“Everyone in the world knows there's no way Facebook buying OR is 'the best' for VR,” Reddit user “wartzilla” wrote. “It's the best for the owners of OR because it means you get to cash out. Which is fine, we all need money. Just admit it.”\n\nThere is also a worry among developers that Facebook will restrict what developers do with some Oculus technology, like the VR sex simulator that one designer made. Facebook and Oculus also promised that the VR company would remain independent, though neither company would explicitly answer whether the purchase would affect future projects from developers.\n\nPerhaps the loudest reaction came from Markus “Notch” Persson, the designer behind the hit video game “Minecraft.” Persson was working on a virtual reality version of “Minecraft” for Oculus Rift, but he decided to pull the plug after Facebook’s announcement.\n\n“Don’t get me wrong, VR is not bad for social,” Persson said on his blog. “In fact, I think social could become one of the biggest applications of VR.”\n\n“But I don’t want to work with social, I want to work with games … And I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition.”\n\nMany of these backers feel cheated because they won’t see returns on a product for which they helped build value. In the year following the Kickstarter campaign, which raised $2.4 million in September, Oculus attracted more than $100 million from angel investors who can be sure to see a massive return. Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon joined Oculus’s board after their firm, Andreesen Horowitz, invested $75 million in a second round of funding.\n\nUnfortunately for the Kickstarter backers, Kickstarter explicitly states that project creators keep 100 percent ownership of their projects and cannot promise financial returns or equity. All Oculus was required to do was fulfill the rewards promised for different donation amounts, which ranged from a simple “thank you” to a tour of Oculus headquarters with an Oculus Rift developer kit.\n\n“Some projects that are funded on Kickstarter may go on to make money, but backers are supporting projects to help them come to life, not financially profit,” Kickstarter said in its “Frequently Asked Questions” section.\n\nThe response hasn't been completely negative. While Persson has hinted at taking a virtual reality version of “Minecraft” to Sony, which recently revealed plans for its own VR headset for the PlayStation 4, other developers are excited for the future. Many felt that Facebook’s resources will help Oculus, and its projects, reach consumers faster than without them.\n\nDespite Facebook’s tumbling stock, some Wall Street analysts remain positive. Analysts at UBS were optimistic about Facebook’s purchase and praised the social network for taking early steps to invest in future platforms. The Swiss Bank set its price target for Facebook stock at $90 and called it “one of the most compelling risk/rewards in our coverage.”\n\nStill, Oculus may have irreparably damaged its previously sterling reputation among the video game and tech communities, which could end up benefiting other VR makers."", 'The news that Facebook plans to purchase Oculus VR, the company behind the Oculus Rift virtual reality gaming headset, for $2 billion, rocked the entire tech world on Tuesday afternoon.\nImmediately following the announcement, there was a backlash from Wall Street, developers and early supporters of Oculus who had provided seed capital on Kickstarter.\nAs a West Coast-based company, Facebook announced the purchase about an hour-and-a-half after stock markets closed in New York on tuesday.\nPalmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, explained the purchase on Reddit, promising that the Facebook acquisition will be good for video gamers.\nAnalysts at UBS were optimistic about Facebook’s purchase and praised the social network for taking early steps to invest in future platforms.']"

The company also made its first inroad into hardware, which can be a tricky road to navigate for a social networking company.\n\nWhy would Facebook do all of this for a company that is working on gaming glasses?\n\nIt may be to get the attention, and the online time, of young users.\n\n""Facebook believes that they can use Oculus to reach a different demographic, a teenage gamer demographic,"" said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. ""Facebook realizes that user engagement is the key to monetizing social media. The highest user engagement could come through virtual reality via the Oculus VR.""\n\nThe problem is that gamers who would be enticed by an immersive gaming environment, as opposed to something more casual and 2D like Facebook\'s popular Farmville, is just a segment of the lucrative 18- to 35-year-old demographic.\n\nHowever, it\'s segment that Facebook is looking at closely.\n\nIn November, David Ebersman, Facebook\'s chief financial officer, said during the company\'s quarterly earnings call that the social network is struggling to keep teenagers\' attention.\n\n""We did see a decrease in [teenage] daily users [during the quarter], especially younger teens,"" said Ebersman, who went on to call the network\'s teen user base ""stable.""\n\nWith 1.2 billion monthly active users and 874 million mobile monthly active users, Facebook has been doing better with older users, who may be the uncles, aunts and grandparents of what would be their preferred teen base.\n\nAs far back as 2009, a study released by iStrategyLabs showed that U.S. high school and college-age users were on the decline at Facebook even as its popularity among the 55-and-older crowd was booming . In fact, the number of older Facebook users showed staggering growth in the first half of 2009 -- up 513.7%.\n\nThis isn\'t a new problem for Facebook, but it appears to be getting worse, which stings on multiple levels. The social network was originally launched for college students but now it\'s lost enough cool factor that teens and college-age students are less engaged, ditching Facebook for social alternatives, like Twitter and Snapchat.\n\nLosing younger users also is a problem for Facebook because once users starts with a social network, making connections with family, friends and colleagues, they tend to stick with it. If Facebook isn\'t pulling in teenagers, it\'s losing out on decades of what could be a solid user base.', 'After admitting last year that it was losing traction with teenage users, Facebook may have spent $2 billion to lure some of them back.\nLate on Tuesday, Facebook said it had reached a deal to acquire Oculus VR Inc., a company that makes virtual reality gaming glasses.\nFacebook is buying virtual reality startup Oculus VR for about $2 billion dollars.\nWith 1.2 billion monthly active users and 874 million mobile monthly active users, Facebook has been doing better with older users, who may be the uncles, aunts and grandparents of what would be their preferred teen base.\nIn fact, the number of older Facebook users showed staggering growth in the first half of 2009 -- up 513.7%.']"

I have been through a few of these deals now and they usually take months. This was done in three days. That’s incredible. That’s their commitment to moving fast. We are moving fast and getting together to make the next computing platform.”\n\nIribe said originally, the team was “building this thing and going along this path” when the co-founders met Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg who was ” really interested: in what the company was doing.\n\n“He was fascinated like other people in the geek community, or gaming community,” explained Iribe. “He was really excited about how we were making this thing work. He wanted me to show him the demo at Facebook. I told him there was a better demo down here in Irvine. He was able to hop on a flight down. He met the team. He saw the latest demos. We talked about the vision. The whole thing was about getting more comfortable with each other and the vision and becoming friends. He and I got to be really good friends, and Palmer met him, too. And then he asked, ‘How can I help? How can Facebook help you?’\n\n“We described our roadmap. Then he said, ‘What if we partner with you? You stay the same. Stay who you are. You expand that vision and focus on other things also. Gaming is core. But how can we help and invest significantly into the platform, the hardware, and bring down the cost of it. We could make it more optimized, do custom silicon, make this even better. What if we also invest in the parts so you can sell the virtual reality platform at cost?’\n\n“It would use the best components and build a superior technology platform. Then let’s sell it at cost.”\n\nPalmer Luckey added that Facebook and Oculus didn’t seem an “obvious fit, unlike WhatsApp or Instagram.”\n\n“You can see how they fit together,” he said. “If I were to read the headline, I would be confused about why it would be a good thing. We’ve already said quite a bit. We’re going to have more good news about what we will be able to do now. We are working with Facebook, and we can’t announce it yet.\n\n“Every developer we are working with has had a very positive reaction. My inbox is flooded by email. A huge number of developers. Some people are upset. But the vast majority who are actually software developers see why this is a good thing.”\n\nLuckey admitted that Notch was “an exception to the rule,” but after he sees “everything we are able to do, I hope he will change his mind.”\n\nIt was announced overnight Facebook had acquired Oculus VR for $2 billion.

Baig\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBack in January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas — and before he became the newest recipient of Facebook\'s riches — Oculus VR co-founder and CEO Brendan Iribe opined on the future of virtual reality, and Oculus\' place in it. ""We believe it will blow open the virtual-reality category,"" Iribe boasted of the mind-altering Oculus Rift virtual-reality 3D goggles I had just worn for the first time.\n\nMaybe it\'s not a fair comparison, but I found my maiden Oculus Rift demo way more thrilling than the first time I wore the early prototype of what is now Google Glass.\n\nOh sure, I understood then and now the challenges and realities of virtual reality, which, despite years of promise and potential, really hadn\'t gotten very far. But this Oculus moment was a time to revel in what might be, not what wasn\'t. I dismissed the fact that I was wearing large geeky-looking headgear, that spending more than a few minutes with the prototype might possibly induce nausea, not to mention that we didn\'t know what Oculus might cost, when exactly it would be ready for consumers or which developers would embrace it in a major way.\n\nOCULUS ACQUISITION:Why Facebook and not Google?\n\nWHO THEY ARE:A look at the brains behind Oculus\n\nWHAT IT IS:Five questions about Oculus VR\n\nWe still don\'t have all the answers. But we now know where the money is going to come from (thank you, Facebook, which is shelling out $2 billion to acquire the start-up). And we have a decent sense of the vision. Oculus made its initial mark in gaming, where it is an obvious fit. What\'s more interesting to me — and apparently to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg — is how it then moves much further afield and evolves into a new social paradigm.\n\nSome early examples Iribe laid out to me at CES sounded intriguing but weren\'t as social as the reality it was standing in for. He hinted at virtual-reality vacations: ""Imagine putting a 360-camera with audio as well on the top of Mount Everest or a beach in Barcelona.""(As someone who doesn\'t love heights, loathes the cold and appreciates oxygen, Oculus is going to be as close to the summit of Everest as I ever get.)\n\nIribe moved on to mention futuristic applications in architecture, education, real estate, medicine and, of course, other forms of entertainment.\n\nAt South By Southwest in Austin, I got to experience Oculus for a second time. Using four Kinect cameras that were paired with four high-end Canon EOS 5D Mark III digital cameras, my body was scanned from all sides and then ""teleported"" into outer space.\n\nShortly afterwards, I put on the Oculus headset and watched my newly scanned virtual alter ego explore digital worlds. As I moved my head, my clone moved too, navigating immersive 3-D scenes that alternated between a frozen tundra, marshy volcanic environment and a desert landscape. It was awesome stuff.\n\nSo where are we? A Facebook-backed Oculus appears to give virtual reality its biggest lift yet. But as we\'ve seen with Sony\'s recent unveiling of its own Project Morpheus virtual reality headset, competition is likely to be formidable, with certain big-name companies yet to be heard from (Apple? Google?).\n\nHowever it evolves, this is still a long-term play. But virtual reality and the related technology of augmented reality — visual layers of information tied to your location that appear on top of whatever reality you\'re seeing — seem inevitable. As Zuckerberg reminded us in his post announcing Facebook\'s acquisition of Oculus: ""Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the Internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones.""', 'Oh sure, I understood then and now the challenges and realities of virtual reality, which, despite years of promise and potential, really hadn\'t gotten very far.\nIribe moved on to mention futuristic applications in architecture, education, real estate, medicine and, of course, other forms of entertainment.\nA Facebook-backed Oculus appears to give virtual reality its biggest lift yet.\nBut virtual reality and the related technology of augmented reality — visual layers of information tied to your location that appear on top of whatever reality you\'re seeing — seem inevitable.\nAs Zuckerberg reminded us in his post announcing Facebook\'s acquisition of Oculus: ""Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction.']"

Facebook said it determined the $2 billion price for Oculus based on its potential in the gaming industry alone.\n\nOculus hasn\'t sold a consumer product yet, but it was the largest independent VR developer before the Facebook purchase, said Blau.\n\n""We don\'t have any experience doing this on a mass market scale, so we don\'t really know what the future has to hold there,"" he said.\n\nFacebook has been criticized in the past for not moving quickly enough to focus on new technologies. Around the time Facebook filed its initial public offering in 2012, it acknowledged that its ability to monetize is mobile user base was ""unproven."" Facebook launched its IPO at $38 per share, and then dropped 45 percent from May to October of that year.\n\nFacebook has 556 million people who use the site daily from a mobile device as of December 2013, an increase of nearly 50 percent from a year earlier, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. About 1.2 billion people use the social networking site at least once a month.\n\nLast month, the company spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, a chat program for mobile devices with about 460 million users. Coupled with the Oculus deal, it\'s an indication that Facebook is trying to finally get a handle on mobile and come out ahead of emerging technologies.\n\n""Facebook\'s acquisition of Oculus seems motivated more by fear than by good business alignment,"" writes James McQuivey, a principal analyst and vice president of the analyst firm Forrester, in an e-mail.

Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues leaped by 63.1%. Growth in the company\'s revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share.\n\nAlthough FB\'s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.03 is very low, it is currently higher than that of the industry average. Along with this, the company maintains a quick ratio of 11.46, which clearly demonstrates the ability to cover short-term cash needs.\n\nPowered by its strong earnings growth of 566.66% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 158.97% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Setting our sights on the months ahead, however, we feel that the stock\'s sharp appreciation over the last year has driven it to a price level which is now relatively expensive compared to the rest of its industry.

The goggles, which are still in the development stage, can be purchased only on the company’s website, for $350.\n\nThe technology attracted Zuckerberg for its potential beyond games.\n\n“Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game … just by putting on goggles in your home,” he said.\n\nLuckey was attracted to technology from an early age, his friends and family said.\n\nLuckey’s sister Ginger recalls her brother showing kids how to make a clock out of a potato at the park. “He was always doing things like that,” she said. “He was king of the nerds,” she added jokingly.\n\n“He would always be here tinkering with cell phones,” added Sheila Mattox, who works at the Alamitos Bay Yacht Club, where Luckey used to take sailing lessons as a kid.\n\n“He’d be tinkering all the time,” Mattox recalled with a chuckle. “We are very proud of him.”\n\nLuckey, the eldest of four children, grew up in sunny Long Beach, Calif., in a beach-front home on a narrow peninsula wedged between the Pacific Ocean and the Alamitos Bay. His dad, Donald, was a car salesman and his mom, Julie, was a stay-at-home mom who home-schooled her kids.\n\nLuckey took college courses when he was still a teen, including some at the local community college but — like Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs and many other tech billionaires — he never got a degree.\n\nWhile Luckey didn’t reveal how much he would personally pocket from the deal with Facebook, as the company’s founder he’s sure to get millions. Facebook has agreed to fork over $400 million in cash and about $1.5 billion in stock to merge with Oculus.\n\nOculus executives didn’t return a request for comment on how the money would be distributed.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the trailer Luckey once called home. When he was 18 and working on Oculus, Luckey moved into a trailer parked in his parents’ driveway, where he lived for two years, his sister said.\n\n“This is my brother. He lives in a trailer,” Ginger recalled telling friends visiting their house.\n\nDespite his newfound fame and fortune, Luckey is still a regular 21-year-old. Girlfriend Nicole Edelmann just landed a job as an “attractions cast member” at Disneyland Resorts in Anaheim, Calif., according to her Facebook page.\n\nAnd he recently donned flip-flops to give a presentation at DICE, a Las Vegas gaming conference.\n\n“We’re pretty stoked,” Ginger said of her brother’s success.', '“Even in my wildest dreams, I never imagined we’d come so far so fast,” Luckey wrote on the company’s blog about the deal.\nThe goggles, which are still in the development stage, can be purchased only on the company’s website, for $350.\nWhile Luckey didn’t reveal how much he would personally pocket from the deal with Facebook, as the company’s founder he’s sure to get millions.\nIt’s a far cry from the trailer Luckey once called home.\nHe lives in a trailer,” Ginger recalled telling friends visiting their house.']"

Oculus VR now has the cash backing them to ensure their product will make its way to the market instead of worrying about more future venture capital rounds.\n\n“Facebook has now entered the technology hardware arena and has done so by buying one of the most innovative companies in the world. While many people don’t understand how there could be any synergies between the two companies, I would just suggest the idea of an Oculus VR social network experience. Zuckerberg is no dummy and he saw that VR was a potential threat to Facebook’s dominant position as a communications platform. Facebook’s growth trajectory has changed entirely with this acquisition.”\n\nKhan has previously offered that Nintendo should acquire Oculus VR, but Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Sony should have as well.\n\nEEDAR’s Patrick Walker agreed, stating since the range of potential virtual experiences “is huge,” Facebook wanted to be prepared for such a future in order to integrate their social graph “into this technology platform early.”\n\n“From a gamer’s perspective, this is exciting because another major company is putting their support behind VR technology,” he offered. “VR technology has been an emerging technology in games for a while, and on the cusp of GDC and a wave of new product announcements, including Sony’s new VR headset, appears ready to enter the mainstream. Facebook’s support of the technology will make this happen even sooner.”\n\nIDC research manager Lewis Ward, however, said the acquisition didn’t “make a lot of sense” to him.\n\n“When I think VR, I certainly don’t think Facebook,” he said. “I can see wanting to get in on the ground floor of a new tech that may eventually have mass appeal, but I think critical mass for VR is at least 5 years off, even in developed countries like the US.\n\nI have to assume that Zuckerberg and company have a couple things on their long-term roadmap nobody outside the company has heard of and that they consider a great fit for VR headsets. It’s just not near being a mass market technology at this point so the acquisition is a bit of a head scratcher.”', 'Analysts have weighed in on the Oculus Rift $2 billion buyout by Facebook, which one industry watcher feels will appear as a bargain five years on.\nOculus VR now has the cash backing them to ensure their product will make its way to the market instead of worrying about more future venture capital rounds.\nWhile many people don’t understand how there could be any synergies between the two companies, I would just suggest the idea of an Oculus VR social network experience.\nFacebook’s growth trajectory has changed entirely with this acquisition.”Khan has previously offered that Nintendo should acquire Oculus VR, but Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Sony should have as well.\n“When I think VR, I certainly don’t think Facebook,” he said.']"

We couldn’t even get to pre-orders before the ‘reports’ started surfacing how the leap in technology in the iPhone X will ultimately kill the iPhone line altogether.\n\nUBS analysts Steve Milunovich and Benjamin Wilson released a note to their clients for the week pointing to Face ID as the tech that will ultimately kill the iPhone.\n\n“History suggests that few if any hardware vendors stay at the top for long with the ‘good enough’ attack from below the main reason,” the analysts wrote. “However, we think that Apple could become a leader in developing the Ambient Paradigm, essentially raising the bar on user experience and fending off competition.”\n\nEasy fellas. I know it’s Friday, and you drank the kool-aid at the altar of Apple (I love Apple products too), but that’s a bit much.\n\nWhat is the Ambient Paradigm?\n\nRemember the movie Minority Report? All the devices in the film would instantly recognize you via facial biometrics that makes FaceID look like a bad CGI trick for a Syfy movie. In this type of world, we wouldn’t need passwords – bet Equifax wished that existed – nor personal computers such as smartphones.\n\nWait a minute. Tom Cruise had some badass gloves to manipulate the screen around him and relied on specialized cue balls coming through a bank teller’s cylinder to figure out who is about to be killed. Run Tom!\n\nIn the shift, the smartphone will die as there will be shared computers all around us that will instantly respond to our wearables like headphones or watches.\n\nLet’s send it back to UBS. “Apple has a philosophy of self-cannibalization and identifying personal technology trends. It appears to be laying the foundation for the next era with transition products, such as Apple Watch and AirPods, and services provided by a multi-sided platform. We expect new product categories to be launched.”\n\nSo, Apple is going to cannibalize its money ticket in favor of an Apple Watch and AirPods? Yeah, that’s not happening if Tim Cook still wants a job. I’ll take interacting with my iMac like the Minority Report, but having to hold my arms up all day? Pass.\n\nIs iPhone X Revolutionary?\n\nSimply put, no. It’s a first generation device that seeks to return Apple’s smartphone to a status symbol. There’s no real advancement here except for the speed of their custom-made chips thanks to the tight integration of iOS. Its ‘revolutionary design’ has a damn notch to hold all the ‘tech’ that will get us into the future of Tom Cruise. Love Tom Cruise movies. Not so sure I want to live in that future.\n\nFacial recognition isn’t new. Samsung has been doing it to varying degrees of success. Judging by Apple’s demo, it screams growing pains ahead. Only one face can be stored at launch, and you have to stare at the screen to unlock it. We all thought people were distracted before. Had TouchID been technologically feasible under the OLED screen, you’re damn right Apple would have it as the standard still.\n\nAnd remember back to the conference. What had more demo time? Our ‘Minority Report’ future, or the fact We can be a talking panda, chicken or pile of shit. Sorry UBS, it’s cool to dream, but Apple getting rid of its profit to focus on cheaper items like the watch or AirPods. They just passed Rolex, which should be a damn given considering Rolex is a luxury good.\n\nThink of it as the flying car complex. Sounds cool in theory until you remember your neighbor parks like they had a stroke just as they pulled in. Are we willing to trust them behind the controls of a plane? Nah.\n\nLet’s focus on the small wins first. Maybe a phone that doesn’t drop calls while you’re staring at four cell towers. Perhaps design decisions which aren’t instantly annoying when we flip our phone into landscape mode (the notch). And being honest with ourselves in saying it’s still a damn phone. The watch just now has LTE connectivity.\n\nI love all my Apple products too, but thinking the iPhone X will usher in the world of Minority Report? It’s not even out, and there are zero hands on outside the temple of Apple. Might want to see it working outside a controlled environment first.

48779,http://gamerant.com/oculus-vr-facebook-notch-response/,technology,"['Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\nAt E3 2013 last summer the tech that blew us away had nothing to do with the next-gen consoles from Microsoft and Sony, it was a prototype virtual reality headset from Oculus VR. We had gotten hands-on with the Oculus Rift while playing EVE-VR (now EVE: Valkyrie) and it forever changed us. This new type of virtual reality worked, and worked wonderfully. It was truly what next-gen gaming would become.\n\nThe buzz rippled throughout the video game industry from trade show to trade show, all the while, more and more devs pledged their support to the platform. Developers and fans continued to mod older games to let them work with the Oculus Rift VR headset, from Nintendo classics like Legend of Zelda and Mario Kart to Valve\'s lineup of games (Portal, Half-Life 2, etc.) to the upcoming Doom 4 and EverQuest Next.\n\nThe Oculus VR tech first made a splash when it took to Kickstarter in late 2012 with several video game developer celebrities appearing in its pitch video as backers and supporters of the tech. The company wanted to raise $250,000 and they actually got 10x that. Now it was real. Just over a year later and the company had earned several rounds of additional multi-million dollar investment to fast-track the technology\'s release to the consumer market, all the while, Sony and Microsoft were reportedly developing their own rival VR Headsets.\n\nAnd not a week after Sony unveils their own tech, Project Morpheus, at GDC that Facebook officially announces the acquisition of Oculus VR for a whopping $2 billion. Everyone who owned stock at Oculus VR is now super rich. Everyone who jumped up first to back the tech via Kickstarter get... absolutely nothing. And the response? Well, you can just by some of the comments on social media and in our own article on the Facebook-Oculus acquisition here. There are some nasty comments on the actual Oculus Rift Kickstarter page from backers as well. A lot of interested gamers aren\'t too happy about the mega-corporate entity scooping up the relatively small tech-forward company.\n\nFor backers, who are essentially just donating money to a Kickstarter project either for good will or a specific tier reward, they didn\'t offer their own money towards Oculus Rift so they can sellout to Facebook, and that\'s where some of the controversy stems from. Markus ""Notch"" Persson, creator of Minecraft and top-level supporter of the Oculus Rift Kickstarter (for $10,000) isn\'t happy either. In fact, he\'s no longer going to work with them because he has problems with what he dubs the ""creepy"" Facebook.\n\nOn a personal blog entry, Notch writes on why the Facebook-owned Oculus isn\'t for him:\n\nFacebook is not a company of grass-roots tech enthusiasts. Facebook is not a game tech company. Facebook has a history of caring about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers. People have made games for Facebook platforms before, and while it worked great for a while, they were stuck in a very unfortunate position when Facebook eventually changed the platform to better fit the social experience they were trying to build.\n\nHe holds no ill will towards the team behind Oculus:\n\nI have the greatest respect for the talented engineers and developers at Oculus. It’s been a long time since I met a more dedicated and talented group of people. I understand this is purely a business deal, and I’d like to congratulate both Facebook and the Oculus owners. But this is where we part ways.\n\nWhile backers might be upset about Oculus Rift becoming a department of Facebook, or that post-Kickstarter investors are earning a 20-fold return on their investments, Kickstarter has never been about giving equity to backers. Perhaps after seeing the quick success of this particular project, potential backers will be more conscious of that fact going forward. It is a shame that the earliest supports, those who stepped up first, get nothing from the acquisition, while the big-money investors Spark Partners and hedge fund Matrix Partners who invested $19 million each, now have $380 million each. The rich get richer, as they say.\n\nFrom the Oculus VR team:\n\nThis partnership is one of the most important moments for virtual reality: it gives us the best shot at truly changing the world. It opens doors to new opportunities and partnerships, reduces risk on the manufacturing and work capital side, allows us to publish more made-for-VR content, and lets us focus on what we do best: solving hard engineering challenges and delivering the future of VR. Over the next 10 years, virtual reality will become ubiquitous, affordable, and transformative, and it begins with a truly next-generation gaming experience. This partnership ensures that the Oculus platform is coming, and that it’s going to change gaming forever.\n\nThe real question is how the acquisition will affect the Oculus Rift\'s road to the consumer market. Will it release sooner and for a cheaper price? With the big corporate backing, does this put Sony and Microsofts own VR headsets in a tougher spot to compete? Will Oculus Rift remain PC only? What sort of social experiences can we expect from the tech?\n\n_____\n\nFollow Rob on Twitter @rob_keyes.\n\nSources: Bloomberg, Notch\n\nShare Tweet Email Copy Link Copied', 'We had gotten hands-on with the Oculus Rift while playing EVE-VR (now EVE: Valkyrie) and it forever changed us.\nEveryone who owned stock at Oculus VR is now super rich.\nThere are some nasty comments on the actual Oculus Rift Kickstarter page from backers as well.\nMarkus ""Notch"" Persson, creator of Minecraft and top-level supporter of the Oculus Rift Kickstarter (for $10,000) isn\'t happy either.\nOver the next 10 years, virtual reality will become ubiquitous, affordable, and transformative, and it begins with a truly next-generation gaming experience.']"

Questions like: ""What is an Oculus Rift?"" ""Can you please explain this to me?"" ""Why is this happening, Joe?"" ""Huh?"" ""Wuzzuh?"" My friends and colleagues — people who follow the news, who buy technology, and who like to be informed about the next big thing — are not actually sure that the ""future"" will comprise the virtual reality ""dream of science fiction,"" as Zuckerberg put it — as though all science fiction dreams are the same dream. It is also not clear to all of them what, exactly, the Oculus Rift is. So let me take this chance to enhance your perspective: The Oculus Rift is a giant black box that you strap to your face, obscuring your eyes and nose, in order to help you pretend that you are in other places doing other things. To be sure, it is poised to be the best and most affordable giant black box that you strap to your face in order to help you pretend that you are in other places doing other things, but that is all it is. Another way of putting it is that the Oculus Rift is a big, face-obscuring, strap-on fantasy device, and I don\'t want it to be part of my daily life. And I don\'t think a lot of Americans will want that either.\n\nTap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Exactly what you think is happening is happening.\n\nOf course, if you listen to Zuckerberg, the Rift — and VR in general — will be ubiquitous in short order: ""This kind of immersive, augmented reality will become a part of daily life for billions of people."" The truth is that until yesterday, the Oculus Rift was seen, rightly, as a niche product — one with vague crossover potential — built by a team of superfans for the superfans who funded them. Some facts: The creator of the Oculus Rift is a message-board-weaned 21-year-old named Palmer Luckey who brags about having the largest private collection of VR devices in the world. His new mentor at Oculus is the co-creator of Doom, John Carmack, whose passions outside of gaming are rocketry and Ron Paul. Facebook did not acquire, as Zuckerberg suggests, the next iPhone, but a hobbyist device built by a very particular kind of gaming enthusiast for other enthusiasts. So it\'s worth asking, when we think about the Rift, what exactly its makers and its fans are so enthusiastic about. Gamer culture is huge and multifaceted. But there is undeniably a strain of it — a decreasingly prevalent one, I think — that is about dropping out of life, dimming the lights, and escaping into less challenging and less complex worlds. (If you don\'t believe me, go have a look at r/shittybattlestations, a subreddit dedicated to images of the awful and impressive lengths people go to in order to construct their lairs. One is actually just a beanbag chair, a television, a game console, a dirt floor, and two jugs of water; subsistence gaming.) The Oculus Rift is undeniably of this culture, the kind that wants a ""gaming treadmill"" to enhance ""realism,"" and a mock-up carbine for the same reason (and a not-too-distant cousin of the kind that builds applications like the one pictured above). That\'s quite literally why Luckey set out to built the Rift — to enhance his unsatisfactory gaming experience. There\'s nothing wrong with this hobby, but it\'s a hobby, not a techno-social movement. And it\'s one with social connotations that I don\'t particularly want to transmit. To me, the Oculus Rift is like wearing your parents\' basement on your face.', ""It is also not clear to all of them what, exactly, the Oculus Rift is.\nSo let me take this chance to enhance your perspective: The Oculus Rift is a giant black box that you strap to your face, obscuring your eyes and nose, in order to help you pretend that you are in other places doing other things.\nAnd I don't think a lot of Americans will want that either.\nTap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Tap to play or pause GIF Exactly what you think is happening is happening.\nTo me, the Oculus Rift is like wearing your parents' basement on your face.""]"
48781,http://www.computerandvideogames.com/455918/carmack-in-support-of-oculus-acquisition/,technology,"['PC Gamer: What inspired you to resurrect Quake III Arena as Quake Live?\n\nJohn Carmack: At the very highest level, Quake Live - what we originally called Quake Zero - was one of my experiments about what we could do usefully on the PC platform. The consoles are very good machines for a lot of things, but there are some things the PC platform uniquely does better, such as anything having to do with a web browser and the superior mouse & keyboard interface. [Those things are] pretty darn good reasons to be playing on the PC, and we’re also trying out an innovative business strategy that could pave the way for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove: In-game advertising will bankroll Quake Live, but won’t warn your dumb ass about incoming fire\n\n\n\nIt’s completely free - there aren’t any micro-transactions. Quake Live is completely ad-supported on the web browser pages and [through] in-game advertising. Of course, this is speculative - we’re going to have to see how this works out. Early on, we were tossing around two different orders of magnitudes - anywhere from 50,000 to 5 million people playing. We have no idea where it is going to be in there. The fact that 70,000 people have signed up in a week means that we’re going to be looking at hundreds of thousands of players, if not millions. We hope that that can be a sustained critical mass of a community that can play this type of game, and be self-supporting.\n\n\n\nQuake III Arena was always my personal favorite id Software game. It’s such a pure activity kind of game - more of a sport than a movie. And I’m excited to have this opportunity to bring back the pure type of gaming as opposed to the “everything and the kitchen sink” modern design. We have no pretensions about it being the best multiplayer game in all types of things, but for any player looking to test their [deathmatch] skill, I think Quake III Arena is the best there ever was.\n\nPCG: Why this new direction?\n\nJC: I would say that there is this sense of trying to figure out what to do with PC gaming. Historically, id Software has been a PC gaming company, with consoles a secondary business that happened later. And even though the PC doesn’t get the focus that it used to, in many ways our hearts are still there, and we’d like to do things where the PC is the appropriate platform. [We’d like to] do something that really speaks to the future of where the PC can be superior to consoles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove: The Quake III Arena touch-up for Quake Live includes new and refined character models\n\n\n\nObviously, we have examples like World of Warcraft that show how the PC can be viable and vibrant in its own way.

Many who backed the original Kickstarter are concerned about the fate of the company, while the creator of Minecraft has said that he will no longer release a version of the game for the platform simply because he doesn\'t like the social network. But not everyone is so pessimistic. In fact, a number of developers — those who will actually be making the virtual reality games that will make the Rift awesome — actually seem optimistic that the partnership could be a good thing for VR, helping it reach a larger audience.\n\n""VR and AR are hardware technologies that will eventually reach billions of users,"" says Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney. ""For Oculus to lead the way, they would necessarily either need to grow into a big company or become part of one. Now it will be the latter.""\n\n""Who says that Facebook is even going to intervene?\n\nMinecraft\'s Markus ""Notch"" Persson seems particularly worried about Facebook\'s uneven history as a gaming platform. ""People have made games for Facebook platforms before,"" he wrote in a blog post yesterday, ""and while it worked great for a while, they were stuck in a very unfortunate position when Facebook eventually changed the platform to better fit the social experience they were trying to build."" But other developers see the opposite — Facebook has made other high-profile acquisitions before, but those services have remained largely unchanged since.\n\n\n\n\n\n""Who says that Facebook is even going to intervene? Look at Instagram and WhatsApp,"" says James Crowson, from Oculus developer Hipster Squid Studios. ""How has Facebook intervened with regards to those apps? You don\'t need a Facebook login to sign into WhatsApp and you\'re not forced to see Facebook ads.""\n\n""This announcement makes us nervous.""\n\nLikewise, many developers seem to simply trust the leadership in place at Oculus — and company founder Palmer Luckey has already said that the VR firm will still operate independently, despite its new owners. ""Palmer Lucky and John Carmack are visionaries, and [Oculus CEO] Brendan Iribe has a great business sense,"" says Sweeney. ""They certainly put a lot of brainpower into making a decision they felt was best for the future of VR."" David Reid, CMO at EVE: Valkyrie developer CCP, agrees, saying that ""we share their vision about the future of VR and gaming and are looking forward to participating in the consumer launch of the Oculus Rift.""\n\nThat doesn\'t mean that the news wasn\'t shocking for those in the development community. Like many of us, Owlchemy Labs\' Alex Schwartz and Devin Reimer were surprised to learn about the acquisition. ""We have to admit this announcement makes us nervous because we perceive very little alignment between the goals of Facebook and Oculus,"" the pair told The Verge in an email. ""It\'s definitely a bit disconcerting from a game developer\'s standpoint."" That said, the studio — which is currently porting its crazy BASE-jumping game AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! to the Rift — recognizes that this could be a positive move for VR in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n""It seems too early to panic.""\n\n""The good news here is that Oculus is now backed with the amount of capital required to not only make the Oculus Rift go mainstream but compete directly with Sony\'s offering,"" Schwartz and Reimer say. ""Competition is great for consumers."" They say that the news won\'t influence their development plans, ""but it does cement in our minds that VR, in whatever form it might be, is here to stay.""\n\nOf course, it\'s too early to tell just how much Facebook will change Oculus, if it changes it at all. Already reports have suggested that Facebook will redesign the Rift hardware and interface to better fit its brand (though Facebook later denied this). But what influence it will have on the Rift as a game platform is unclear, and we likely won\'t find out until the commercial version of the headset finally launches later this year, or early next.\n\n""Maybe they can just keep doing what they were doing before, but with more cash,"" says E McNeill, developer of Darknet, one of the Rift\'s more anticipated games. ""Maybe not.

Well, according to the Oculus website it is a ""Technology company revolutionizing the way people experience video games.""\n\nOculus VR is the creator of the Oculus Rift, which is a large headset that features a 5-inch OLED display set in front of the consumer\'s eyes. It connects to a computer through the use of a cable that allows the user to see everything in 3D. The man behind the creation is Palmer Luckey, who first introduced the Oculus Rift device in September of 2012 through humble beginnings with a Kickstarter Campaign.\n\nFacebook mogul, Mark Zuckerberg, opted to buy the company after his personal VR experience at Stanford University with the groundbreaking Oculus Rift device a few weeks ago.

So when Notch responded with a roar of displeasure to Tuesday\'s news that the virtual reality company Oculus Rift had sold itself to Facebook for a tidy 2 billion it is not surprising that the Reddit forum devoted to Oculus Rift applauded wildly.\n\nOne sentence echoed with particular resonance:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n""And I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition.""\n\nJudging from the outpouring on Reddit, a not insignificant number of people who invested their hopes and dreams and Kickstarter crowd-funding dollars in Oculus Rift feel betrayed, shocked and appalled -- or, as one Redditor exclaimed ""straight fucked.""\n\n""Thanks for the money morons, we\'re selling out to The Man.""\n\nIt\'s always sad when your favorite punk band gets a major label record deal and suddenly turns around and releases a pop ballad. For understandable reasons, the VR fans who plunked down their own cash to get Oculus Rift off the ground felt a sense of ownership and connection to the company. No one who isn\'t employed by Mark Zuckerberg feels that way about Facebook. There\'s a very clear warning here: Anyone who is under the impression that contributing to a crowd-funding campaign means having a meaningful say or a stake in the future of your chosen start-up is mistaken.\n\nOf course, that should have been clear to everyone remotely interested in Oculus Rift at least as far back as last December, when the venture capital firm Andreeseen-Horowitz led a $75 million investment round in Oculus Rift. Once the VCs got their hooks into the company, an exit event denouement like Tuesday\'s was all but inevitable. (Interestingly, Andreessen serves on the board of Facebook, but says he ""recused"" himself from Oculus Rift-Facebook negotiations. Riiiiiiight. If anybody is the real winner from this deal, it\'s Andreessen-Horowitz, which just flipped its December investment into a hefty chunk of Facebook stock.)\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut there is also a legitimately interesting cultural story here. Dreams of virtual reality hold special significance in the deep geek heart of the Internet. The fulfillment of true escape from our earthly ties (otherwise known as keyboards, monitors, mice and smartphones) has bewitched generations of science fiction fans and computer nerds. Oculus Rift tapped that vein with high-grade heroin. Oculus Rift promised, as Dean Putney wrote at Boing Boing, to make it possible ""to really feel like you had escaped our shared reality into another.""\n\nThe poetry written about its promise flowed deep and strong. Rabid fans clamored to throw their support and money at the project. They crowded around booths at trade shows to catch a glimpse, and built complicated software programs for the new platform-- sometimes without even being able to try it out themselves. Suddenly, users were booting up and creating any virtual world they wanted, and that power made them think they might be able to influence the real world a bit. Hopes were high! Oculus seemed untouchable; the white knight of VR.\n\nFacebook crushes that dream with an endless stream of targeted advertisements, privacy encroachments and what, for better or worse, we must call real reality. There\'s no escaping the mundane disappointments of this world when Facebook owns the virtual world. The virtual realities envisioned by William Gibson and Neal Stephenson were cool. Mark Zuckerberg is not cool.\n\nThe irony, as clearer heads on Reddit were beginning to realize as the initial clamor began to subside, is that Facebook\'s purchase of Oculus Rift is the most obvious sign yet from the market that virtual reality technology will one day be ready for prime time. And Facebook Rift will surely have its indie competitors. There will be plenty of VR frontiers for the geeks to escape to. The ""Minecraft"" version of VR is just as inevitable as the Facebook mainstreaming of VR.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIt\'s just too bad that there\'s no way to tell, when you plunk down some cash via Kickstarter, which way it\'s all going to go. But every generation has to learn that fact, sooner or later.', ""Of course, that should have been clear to everyone remotely interested in Oculus Rift at least as far back as last December, when the venture capital firm Andreeseen-Horowitz led a $75 million investment round in Oculus Rift.\nDreams of virtual reality hold special significance in the deep geek heart of the Internet.\nSuddenly, users were booting up and creating any virtual world they wanted, and that power made them think they might be able to influence the real world a bit.\nThere's no escaping the mundane disappointments of this world when Facebook owns the virtual world.\nAnd Facebook Rift will surely have its indie competitors.""]"

TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n""We rate OCULUS INNOVATIVE SCIENCES (OCLS) a SELL. This is driven by multiple weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The area that we feel has been the company\'s primary weakness has been its declining revenues.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nThe return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Pharmaceuticals industry and the overall market, OCULUS INNOVATIVE SCIENCES\'s return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.\n\nThe gross profit margin for OCULUS INNOVATIVE SCIENCES is rather high; currently it is at 66.32%. Regardless of OCLS\'s high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, OCLS\'s net profit margin of -18.55% significantly underperformed when compared to the industry average.\n\nOCLS, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 1.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 7.0%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company\'s bottom line, with increasing earnings per share.\n\nOCLS\'s debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.01 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. Along with the favorable debt-to-equity ratio, the company maintains an adequate quick ratio of 1.23, which illustrates the ability to avoid short-term cash problems.\n\nThis stock has increased by 94.77% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period.

""While the Oculus Rift was initially conceived as a gaming device, both Facebook and Oculus believe there are applications for this technology in other verticals, including communications, media/entertainment & education. While Oculus will continue to operate independently within FB in pursuit of the gaming opportunity, the company plans to leverage FB\'s recruiting & marketing capabilities, infrastructure, and developer relationships. Longer term, FB believes VR will succeed mobile as a mainstream computing platform, perhaps becoming ""the most social platform ever."" By investing in Oculus, FB hopes to establish a leadership role in shaping this evolution. That said, FB believes it can justify the cost of the acquisition on the gaming opportunity alone.""\n\nRalph Schackart, William Blair: Reiterates an Outperform rating. ""Facebook indicated that it believes virtual/augmented reality technology could become the next major social, gaming, and communications platform. Similar to the consumer transition from a desktop environment to a mobile environment, Facebook believes future consumers may transition from a hand-held mobile environment to a visual-based augmented reality environment. Facebook believes those companies that take part in developing future platforms have a heavy hand in defining the industry and ecosystem that sprouts around the platforms [...] While Facebook has clearly proved it is a forward-thinking company, we are getting slightly concerned at the rapid pace of multibillion acquisitions. We believe management remains confident in its strategic objectives of these acquisitions, but the acquisitions give us some pause, given the order of magnitude and pace.""\n\nYoussef Squali, Cantor Fitzgerald: Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $67 price target. ""While we believe this is another potential ""long shot"" with an eye-popping valuation, we remain impressed with management\'s intense focus on trying to position Facebook for the next computing platform. Additionally, it\'s always easier to make these kinds of acquisitions when the core business is going strong, which is the case for FB today. P&L results from its other high-visibility deals, Instagram and Whatsapp, have yet to materialize, but it\'s worth noting that growth in users and engagement for Instagram has so far exceeded our expectations, and management remains committed to growing Whatsapp to over 1B users.""\n\nVictor Anthony, Topeka Capital Markets: Reiterates a Buy rating, and a $75 price target. ""While it has been our position that visual wearables will become more mainstream over the next few years, and we get FB\'s logic behind the acquisition, we are taking a wait-and-see approach and are not immediately blessing it. The Instagram acquisition, in our view, has been a success, with 200mm active users, and a revenue monetization opportunity we can see in the billions. So great execution there. However, digesting two major acquisitions at one time is new for Facebook\'s management team and presents risks that could distract management\'s attention away from the core business, which at this point, per our recent checks, and FB\'s implication, is doing great. Furthermore, as we note below, the monetization opportunity outside of hardware sales is not immediately clear. The monetization opportunity for WhatsApp is clearer but the company today is primarily focused on user growth, which FB repeated last night could top 1B. Thus, in addition to the integration risks, the financial payout from both acquisitions are years out. Perfect execution will require absolute faith in management. We are strong believers in the longer-term opportunity in the core platform but will monitor the risks associated with FB seeking to monetize what they see as the next gen computing and messaging platform via WhatsApp.""\n\nStephen Ju, Credit Suisse: Reiterates a Neutral rating, and a $65 price target. ""Given the rapid shift in consumer engagement preference for Facebook from desktop to mobile/smart phone, we view this acquisition as a forward-thinking move to anticipate continued change to other modalities. As we dream the longer-term dream, other expansive use cases could include 1) communication (immersive versions of Skype, synergies with WhatsApp VOIP), 2) entertainment (cinema/events), 3) medicine (remote doctor appointments), 4) education (tutoring/virtual classrooms), as well as 5) commerce. We do not view this move as a direct entry into the videogame space and rather expect Facebook to facilitate availability of the technology (likely as free) to spur content development.""', 'Longer term, FB believes VR will succeed mobile as a mainstream computing platform, perhaps becoming ""the most social platform ever.""\nBy investing in Oculus, FB hopes to establish a leadership role in shaping this evolution.\nThat said, FB believes it can justify the cost of the acquisition on the gaming opportunity alone.""\n""Facebook indicated that it believes virtual/augmented reality technology could become the next major social, gaming, and communications platform.\nSimilar to the consumer transition from a desktop environment to a mobile environment, Facebook believes future consumers may transition from a hand-held mobile environment to a visual-based augmented reality environment.']"

48806,http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/03/26/facebook-ads-another-expensive-toy-with-its-oculus.aspx,technology,"['Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and its nearly ubiquitous social-networking site could in its own right be fairly described as ""virtual reality""; the place where users go online to see what\'s happening in the real world.\n\nBut Facebook opted to make this descriptor all the more fitting yesterday when it announced that it had reach an agreement to purchase virtual-reality start-up Oculus VR for a whopping $2 billion. This marks Facebook\'s second multibillion-dollar buyout this year, although this deal is still infinitely smaller than Facebook\'s February buyout of mobile-messaging mammoth WhatsApp for $19 billion.\n\nSo, as Facebook prepares to welcome in another seemingly disparate start-up into its corporate folds, let\'s see if, and why, this makes sense for Facebook investors\n\nInside Facebook\'s $2 billion venture capital investment\n\nFor those familiar with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\'s thinking, buying Oculus VR shouldn\'t prove all that surprising. To be sure, there are plenty of parallels Oculus VR shares with WhatsApp.\n\nAt its highest level, the key shared characteristic between WhatsApp and Oculus VR is their respective potential to meaningfully shape social interaction and person-to-person communication at some point in the future. In discussing their first encounters with Oculus\' current virtual-reality product, Zuckerberg and several other VCs each described it as ""looking at the future.""\n\nOculus\' current product is mainly focused on virtual reality gaming, but it doesn\'t take an overly active imagination to see how applying its technology more broadly enhance many other aspects of online interaction. For example in the context of Facebook\'s social-networking platform, imagine being able to place yourself in a vacation video a friend\'s posted to their profile through a piece of Facebook or Oculus-connected hardware. And that\'s just the beginning. Imagine how much more intimate video-based messaging platforms like Skype could be improved by integrating more realistic virtual reality elements into them.\n\nNow, there\'s little question that Oculus VR is much earlier along its development curve than WhatsApp. With 450 million users, you can fairly describe WhatsApp as an emerging communications platform, albeit one still that generated little in the way of tangible sales. The point here is, rather than focusing on the specific industries it could improve, Oculus\' broad potential to make a lot of aspects of today\'s online activity appreciably better makes it uniquely valuable to the point where Facebook regarded it as a must-have company. And as a buyout that\'s based almost entirely on potential, the venture capital analogy seems particularly apropos.\n\nSo, is this a good deal for Facebook\'s investors?\n\nDeciphering if this deal makes dollars-and-cents sense is\n\nanyone\'s guess. Sure, $2 billion is another huge check that Zuckerberg has decided to write with Facebook investors largely footing the bill. But with Facebook\'s stock soaring and its valuation favorably described as ""rich,"" using the company\'s stock as the primary source of funding for the deal certainly makes sense.\n\nThis deal also proves as a helpful reminder that investing in Facebook is the equivalent of investing in Mark Zuckerberg, as Facebook\'s CEO and co-founder still retains control over the majority of Facebook\'s voting power. It\'s also worth noting that Facebook could run a major risk of needing to take a sizable writedown should it miss badly on one of these major buys, which could have ugly short-term implications for Facebook shareholders.\n\nAlthough he said otherwise, expect Facebook to continue making these kinds of deals if and when it needs to. But taking out would-be future competitors also isn\'t necessarily the worst strategy out there for a big fish like Facebook.\n\nAt the end of the day this is still a frustratingly open storyline, but one that could hold major implications for Facebook further down the line.', ""But Facebook opted to make this descriptor all the more fitting yesterday when it announced that it had reach an agreement to purchase virtual-reality start-up Oculus VR for a whopping $2 billion.\nTo be sure, there are plenty of parallels Oculus VR shares with WhatsApp.\nAt its highest level, the key shared characteristic between WhatsApp and Oculus VR is their respective potential to meaningfully shape social interaction and person-to-person communication at some point in the future.\nImagine how much more intimate video-based messaging platforms like Skype could be improved by integrating more realistic virtual reality elements into them.\nNow, there's little question that Oculus VR is much earlier along its development curve than WhatsApp.""]"

How does it stack up to Facebook\'s other pricey purchases?\n\nFacebook surprised many people Tuesday when it announced the $2 billion acquisition of Oculus VR, maker of virtual reality headsets. The deal, set to close in the coming quarter, includes $400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook stock, valued at $1.6 billion.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the deal will help the social network focus on the next big platform, which it believes is virtual reality. ""Mobile is the platform of today, and now we\'re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,"" he said in the announcement. ""Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play, and communicate.""\n\nFacebook\'s Oculus purchase is the company\'s third billion-dollar deal in two years. Just last month, the social network spent a mind-boggling $19 billion on mobile messaging service WhatsApp. In April 2012, Facebook plunked down $1 billion for popular photosharing app Instagram.\n\n[Get a grip on your Facebook account. Read 10 Most Misunderstood Facebook Privacy Facts.]\n\nBut don\'t expect Facebook\'s spending spree to continue, Zuckerberg said Tuesday in a conference call. ""[WhatsApp and Oculus] are both incredibly rare companies. You shouldn\'t expect us to do this frequently,"" he said. ""But WhatsApp has the potential to reach a billion users, and any company that can do that will be incredibly valuable. And not many companies are working on what could be the next computing platform [like Oculus]. The rate [of these acquisitions] won\'t continue.""\n\nTen-year-old Facebook is no stranger to big-dollar deals. Here\'s a look at its priciest purchases after Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR.\n\n1. Face.com: $100 million\n\nFacebook announced in June 2012 that it acquired the Israeli startup Face.com for an estimated $100 million. Face.com powered facial recognition software that third-party developers could incorporate into their own apps. The company had two Facebook apps of its own: Photo Finder, which helped people find tagged pictures of themselves and their friends; and Photo Tagger, which helped people quickly assign tags to groups of photos.\n\nIn 2012, Facebook temporarily suspended its facial recognition feature ""to make some technical improvements,"" but reinstated it in 2013.\n\n2. Atlas: $50 million to $100 million\n\nIn February 2013, Facebook acquired online ad serving and measurement service Atlas from Microsoft for an undisclosed amount that many speculated fell between $50 million and $100 million. According to Facebook, its acquisition of Atlas would help advertisers ""close the loop and compare their Facebook campaigns to the rest of their ad spend across the Web on desktop and mobile.""\n\n3. Snaptu: $60 million to $70 million\n\nFacebook announced in March 2011 that it would acquire Snaptu, an Israeli startup that specializes in Java-based feature-phone apps, for an estimated $60 million to $70 million. Two years later, Facebook announced that more than 100 million people use Facebook\'s feature phone app, which is powered by Snaptu technology.\n\n""Millions of people in developing markets like India, Indonesia, and the Philippines are relying on this technology to connect with Facebook, without having to purchase a smartphone,"" Facebook said. ""Ultimately, Facebook for Every Phone is a fast and easy-to-use native app that works with more than 3,000 different types of feature phones from almost every handset manufacturer that exists today.""\n\n4. FriendFeed: $50 million\n\nFacebook acquired FriendFeed in August 2009 for an estimated $50 million. FriendFeed, which Facebook folded, was a real-time feed that aggregated friends\' updates from various social networks. Its 12-member staff joined Facebook to boost its engineering team, including FriendFeed cofounder Bret Taylor. Taylor worked as Facebook\'s CTO until 2012, when he left to start Quip, a mobile word processor.\n\n5. Friendster patents: $40 million\n\nIn 2010, Facebook purchased the entire Friendster portfolio of social networking patents for $40 million to ensure it had the rights to the intellectual property behind its technology. The patents were broad and covered early social networking activities, such as making connections and social media sharing. One year later, Friendster repositioned itself as a social gaming site and discontinued users\' social network accounts.\n\nInterop Las Vegas, March 31 to April 4, brings together thousands of technology professionals to discover the most current and cutting-edge technology innovations and strategies to drive their organizations\' success, including BYOD security, the latest cloud and virtualization technologies, SDN, the Internet of Things, and more.

""This is a special moment for the gaming industry,"" Oculus\' co-founder Palmer Luckey wrote in a Reddit post. ""Oculus\' somewhat unpredictable future just became crystal clear: virtual reality is coming, and it\'s going to change the way we play games forever."" Indeed, the money Facebook can pour into it will likely give Oculus the ability to put its headsets to sale even sooner and provide some always needed cash and leeway. That means hiring more developers who would attempt to make the Rift more user-friendly. ""Facebook has a history of funding its big purchases well and letting them run themselves independently,"" Mashable notes. Its purchase of Instagram is a perfect example, as the company just passed 200 million users and has only lightly toyed with ads.\n\nHowever, not everyone is so excited about the Facebook effect. Markus Persson, one of the creators of the wildly popular Minecraft, revealed last night that his company had been ""in talks"" to make an Oculus-ready version of the game, but he pulled the plug, simply to avoid doing business with Facebook.\n\nWe were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus. I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out. — Markus Persson (@notch) March 25, 2014\n\nShopping\n\nTest-driving a car on the Autobahn or previewing how a shirt would fit on you could make the Oculus a sort of virtual reality Amazon. Arch Virtual, for example, has created a number of Oculus Rift applications that can tour college campuses or give test drives of cars. Using the Oculus to see things (really see them) before spending money could give a better sense of what you\'re actually purchasing. Within this plan lies obvious opportunities for advertising tie-ins too, making it even more appealing for Facebook.\n\nVirtual reality video chat\n\nLike an immersive version of Skype, the Oculus could be used to chat with friends and family in faraway locations while actually feeling present. If everyone begins to wear Oculus headsets, will the world end in a dystopia? Not quite. ""It ends with you using them the same way you\'d use Skype — zipping in and out of the virtual world for meetings, making it much easier to work from home or catch up with far-flung family."" A business meeting through Oculus Rift would certainly be preferable to the awfulness of teleconferences. (Combined with their other big acquisition, WhatsApp, it\'s just another level of global communication.)\n\nOf course, that big headset could make things slightly more difficult. ""Playing a game with a massive set of goggles on your head is one thing,"" Wired notes. ""Using them to chat with your friends is another.""\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe giant headset will provide an easy, if intrusive, way to put banner ads in people\'s vision. That\'s the key fear of Facebook\'s involvement: that the company is too concerned with selling your information to provide targeted ads. While that\'s always been part of the Facebook\'s model, they\'ve tried to minimize their intrusiveness. That would be a lot more difficult in an immersive Oculus headset. The Verge imagines playing a virtual reality game where giving a ""Like"" to a brand — Coca-Cola in this example — allows gamers to venture to the next level or area. Hey, every company has to make money. A Like seems like a fairly small cost.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.', '""Oculus\' somewhat unpredictable future just became crystal clear: virtual reality is coming, and it\'s going to change the way we play games forever.""\nArch Virtual, for example, has created a number of Oculus Rift applications that can tour college campuses or give test drives of cars.\nUsing the Oculus to see things (really see them) before spending money could give a better sense of what you\'re actually purchasing.\nA business meeting through Oculus Rift would certainly be preferable to the awfulness of teleconferences.\nThe Verge imagines playing a virtual reality game where giving a ""Like"" to a brand — Coca-Cola in this example — allows gamers to venture to the next level or area.']"

During a call with reporters and analysts following the announcement, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained that while Oculus will continue to focus on gaming in the short term, the deal was more about placing a bet on the next big computing platform shift.\n\n""We still have a lot of work to do on mobile,"" Zuckerberg said, ""but at this point, we feel strong enough in our position that strategically we also want to start focusing on the next major computing platform that will come after mobile. The history of our industry is that every 10 or 15 years there is a new major computing platform, whether it is the PC, the web, or now mobile. History suggests that there will be more platforms to come. To me, by far one of the most exciting future platforms is around vision -- by modifying what you see to create augmented or immersive experiences. Today\'s acquisition is a longterm bet on the future of computing. I believe Oculus can be one of the platforms of the future.""\n\nZuckerberg said that Oculus\' Rift headset makes you feel like you are in another place with other people.\n\n""Gaming is just the start,"" he said. ""After games, we are going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers from all over the world, consulting with a doctor face-to-face, or going shopping in a virtual store where you can touch and explore the product you are interested in just by putting on goggles in your own home.""\n\nPrior to the acquisition Oculus managed to raise tens of millions of dollars, and some of the company\'s investors told Fortune\'s Dan Primack that Oculus has always been considered much more than a gaming peripheral -- ""such a characterization would have never made it past their investment committees,"" Primack wrote. ""Instead, they view Oculus as a software platform that happens to work on top of proprietary hardware. The Facebook partnership, they argue, reflects how many people view virtual reality as the next major paradigm shift after mobile.""\n\nWired picked up on Zuckerberg\'s telemedicine reference too, and Gartner analyst Brian Blau -- a longtime virtual reality watcher told the publication: “I didn’t hear anything that Zuckerberg said that hasn’t been talked about before in the VR community for a very long time. It has always been billed as a next-gen communication technology — something that can provide a more immersive and deeper connection to somebody else,” but do date it has mostly been a solitary experience.\n\nStill, some researchers are already using Oculus technology for medical reasons. The Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT) at University of Southern California has used the Oculus Rift for post traumatic stress disorder treatment, which Oculus CEO Palmer Luckey has said (during a student interview after his Games for Health keynote last year) has proven to be an effective therapy that doesn\'t involve drug use.\n\nBack to Facebook -- Zuckerberg isn\'t the only billionaire who believes virtual reality gaming technology might have a role to play in the future of healthcare. Back in 2011 Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, CEO of digital health rollup NantHealth, invested $200 million into virtual reality gaming company Fourth Wall Studios. At the time of the announcement, he stated:\n\n""The best ideas often occur when different industries intersect. As I work with new technologies for healthcare and medicine, I see more and more parallels with what\'s happening in entertainment; for example, the rapidly accelerating use of mobile devices and social media platforms, and the use of novel algorithms to create machine vision. As pioneers in the field, Fourth Wall Studios is the ideal team to help take advantage of these synergies through the development of augmented reality.""\n\nAir Jordan IX 9 Shoes', 'The multibillion dollar tech news this week is that Facebook is set to acquire virtual reality gaming company Oculus for more than $2 billion.\nThe history of our industry is that every 10 or 15 years there is a new major computing platform, whether it is the PC, the web, or now mobile.\nThe Facebook partnership, they argue, reflects how many people view virtual reality as the next major paradigm shift after mobile.""\nBack to Facebook -- Zuckerberg isn\'t the only billionaire who believes virtual reality gaming technology might have a role to play in the future of healthcare.\nBack in 2011 Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, CEO of digital health rollup NantHealth, invested $200 million into virtual reality gaming company Fourth Wall Studios.']"
48818,http://time.com/38366/here-are-7-promises-oculus-has-made-after-getting-bought-by-facebook/,technology,"['Maybe you’re upset at Oculus VR and co-founder Palmer Luckey for selling the company to Facebook for $2 billion, but give Luckey credit for at least one thing: He spent hours last night answering questions from distressed Oculus fans on Reddit, and went right back to it this morning.\n\nMost of those comments are being downvoted into obscurity. But a glance through Luckey’s comment history reveals a lot of big promises about Oculus’ future under Facebook. Here are some of the most noteworthy quotes from Luckey’s Reddit Q&A:\n\n“You will not need a Facebook account to use or develop for the Rift.”\n\nThis was in response to a user threatening to be “done” with the Rift if certain conditions were not met. Luckey made a similar comment last night, when asked to guarantee that users wouldn’t have to log into their Facebook accounts to use the VR headset. “That would be lame,” he said — and it would surely scare off the developers who are sticking around.\n\n“We are not going to track you, flash ads at you, or do anything invasive.”\n\nIn terms of Oculus promising not to adopt any of Facebook’s creepier tendencies, this is probably as clear-cut as it gets. It’s understandable to worry that our virtual behavior could eventually be grist for Facebook’s ad mill, though this would likely cause an even bigger backlash if not handled with extreme caution. Many Redditors are choosing not to believe Luckey’s promises. Time will tell who is right.\n\n“None of our gaming resources will be diverted.”\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made clear that the ultimate goal is to expand virtual reality beyond gaming, eventually creating “a new communication platform.” This has naturally led some Oculus fans to wonder whether the company’s commitment to gaming will be diminished. Luckey says that won’t be the case, because Oculus now has more resources for gaming than it did before. That includes more money to invest in indie developers. A bigger question is for how long Oculus will stay deeply invested in gaming. Again, there’s no way to know right now.\n\n“We are not going to lock people out because they compete.”\n\nSome gamers and developers are worried that Oculus will require all games to go through an official Facebook ecosystem. That’s not the plan, Luckey said. While Oculus is working on its own app store and launcher for VR games, developers won’t have to use it. “Facebook has no interest in changing that, they believe in what we have been doing all along,” Luckey said.\n\n“Our relationship with the community is not going to change, and we are not going to spy on anyone.”\n\nThese are two separate concerns, in response to one Redditor. The first concern is that Oculus will stop being so close to its community and become less relaxed with interviews. The second is that Facebook is just using Oculus to reap user data and spy on users. Luckey, in response, gave his word that “nothing will change for the worse.” (See quote number two above.)\n\n“This deal specifically lets us greatly lower the price of the Rift.”\n\nWe don’t know what the price of the finished product would have been, but the latest developer kit costs $350, so presumably the first consumer version will be much cheaper. The news was received warily by the Reddit community, which of course wondered about Facebook’s motives if it’s not looking to profit on hardware. The most likely answer is that Facebook is looking to build up Rift and refine its technology, so that it can eventually be used in mainstream, non-gaming applications. If virtual reality changes communications the same way Facebook did, the opportunities to make money will follow.\n\n“Facebook is going to give us access to massive resources, but let us operate independently on our own vision.”\n\nLuckey repeatedly insisted that Oculus will operate with autonomy, and said Facebook has a good track record for letting acquired companies do so. But the truth isn’t so clear-cut. Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012, operates independently but began sharing user data with Facebook several months after the acquisition. Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp is still pending regulatory approval, so it’s far too early to say how independent it will be. In reality, Oculus will be a major test of Facebook’s promised autonomy.\n\nIf you’re wondering how the Reddit community is responding to these statements, “with skepticism” would be an understatement. Many commenters seem to think that Oculus has ceded all decision-making to Mark Zuckerberg, and that Luckey’s promises can be overridden with the wave of a hand. That seems a bit extreme, especially since we haven’t seen the full terms of the deal, but the underlying concerns are valid. Luckey has given his word that things will only change for the better. We’ll see what that word is worth over the next few years as Oculus and Facebook build virtual reality together.\n\nMORE: The History of Video Game Consoles – Full\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.', 'But a glance through Luckey’s comment history reveals a lot of big promises about Oculus’ future under Facebook.\nIf virtual reality changes communications the same way Facebook did, the opportunities to make money will follow.\nInstagram, which Facebook bought in 2012, operates independently but began sharing user data with Facebook several months after the acquisition.\nIn reality, Oculus will be a major test of Facebook’s promised autonomy.\nWe’ll see what that word is worth over the next few years as Oculus and Facebook build virtual reality together.']"

48825,http://www.pcgamesn.com/four-things-facebook-will-not-do-oculus-rift,technology,"['Facebook bought Oculus VR last night for two billion dollars, which makes my hostile takeover of a £6.10 burrito look a bit rubbish. If that many dollars were laid out end to end, most of it would blow away or be stolen, but what does this acquisition mean for the future of virtual reality? How might this affect the social media ecosystem and the brands? Can Zuckerburg leverage the power of Oculus Rift to enter the internet bodily? And will he look like the Lawnmower Man (from The Lawnmower Man) or the electric gremlin (from Gremlins)?\n\n#Faceboculusgate, as it has come to be known, has hit fever pitch, but consider me the cold flannel on the issue’s forehead, arriving on the scene with the only hastily written and woefully misinformed editorial you’ll need to read today.\n\nHere are the four things Facebook will not do with Oculus Rift, despite all of our deepest fears.\n\nFacebook will not… invent a featureless white cube where you can meet with your friends\n\n“Hey Kate, want to hang out?” speaks Chad into the prehensile plastic tube that snakes out of his computer’s hard drive and into his mouth. It is the year 2019, in the distant future. We cut to Kate, who is on a space aeroplane of some sort. A smaller version of the tube we’ve seen Chad using coils out of her smartphone and daintily inserts itself into her mouth. “Can’t tonight I’m afraid,” she chirrups into the portable speakerpipe. “I’m in low earth orbit where I live, but hop on Facebook and I’ll see you in the Facecube!”\n\nBoth Chad and Kate pull Oculus Rift goggles over their faces and are immediately transported into a featureless white cube measuring twelve feet on each side. A hologram of Mark Zuckerburg fades in through one of the walls, prancing merrily like Richard O’Brien on Crystal Maze. “CONNECTING TO FACECUBE, PLEASE WAIT,” booms the holo-Zuck. As the connection is being made, Mark Zuckerburg does an almost imperceptible little shuffling dance, with his elbows tight to his sides and his fists raised to shoulder height. “CONNECTING. FACECUBE IS CONNECTING. DOO DO BE DO.”\n\nAfter a brief moment holo-Zuck ascends through the ceiling and Chad and Kate find themselves alone together in the featureless white cube. “This is fantastic,” enthuses virtual Kate as she leans against the cube’s most convincing wall, whipping her virtual hair back and forth. “You’re telling me,” shouts Chad as he slaps his open palms against the holographic floor, “it’s like we’re really here in the same room together”.\n\nThe entire ceiling of the cube flashes red three times before becoming Mark Zuckerburg’s big weird face. “DOCTORS HATE HER,” the ceiling shrieks as Chad and Kate try to cover their ears. But the sound is coming from inside their heads. “YOU’LL BE AMAZED OF THIS ONE WEIRD TIP TO A SLIMMER BELLY.” We cut back to Chad and Kate in the real world, still wearing the Oculus Rift, their limp bodies now slumped fully out of their seats, their limbs jutting outwards in contorted poses, warm drool leaking from their slack mouths. Horror.\n\nFacebook will not… rename Oculus Rift\n\nBut if they did, they would have to choose from one of the following names that I have come up with.\n\nFace2Face\n\nTheFacePlace\n\nMySpace 2\n\nGetInMyFace:NowGetOutPlease\n\nFacebook (but the two Os are eyes looking at you)\n\nI’ve Given The World’s Biggest Advertising Superpower A Direct Feed To My Optic Nerves… And I’m Loving Every Minute!\n\nFacebookulus Riftopia\n\nMindSmear: Enter The Holospace\n\nThe Mark Zuckerberg Oculus Rift Experience\n\nShenmue 3\n\nFacebook will not… develop a virtual reality version of Farmville\n\nOculus VR has been having venture capitalist money dumped in front of its offices by an unending parade of bin lorries for some time now. Whether we reach a brave new future of magic goggles or not, virtual reality is a thing that’s shooting upwards in value very, very quickly. I’m no businesss analyst, but even I know that when something you’ve just bought is rolling up money like a big Katamari on auto-pilot, you donothing. You sit back and you watch the Katamari of money get bigger and bigger and think “that is my Katamari of money, I own that now, mine mine mine hahaha”. And if you’re the sort of person who can’t help but not do nothing, you just do the exact same thing the thing you bought was doing before you came along, only faster. Those are some cold hard business facts, I think.\n\nSo that’s why Facebook won’t make an Oculus Rift version of Farmville. Facebook are not interested in changing the course of Oculus Rift development. Facebook bought Oculus because it’s already on course. That, and because people who play free games on Facebook don’t spend hundreds of pounds on virtual reality headsets. And more generally speaking it’s just a really stupid idea.\n\nFacebook will not… accelerate the development of virtual reality technology such that it becomes totally indistinguishable from physical reality, plunging the human race into an existential malaise from which we can never recover\n\nWhat if it’s actually the year 2073 and holographic entertainment has reached a point where, in order to enhance our experience of virtual reality, we willingly wipe our own memories before we step into the machine? What if the technology is also capable of manipulating the rate at which our brains perceive the passage of time, compressing a virtual day into an hour, or a lifetime into a moment? And what if we, as a single-nation planet, had all voted to run a big multiplayer game of 2014 together?

In today\'s headlines, little more than a month after its $19 billion acquisition of messaging app WhatsApp, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has just slapped down $2 billion for virtual reality specialist Oculus. Meanwhile, shares of King Digital Entertainment (UNKNOWN:KING.DL) begin trading today after the mobile game developer offered them in the primary market for $22.50, for a $7 billion valuation.\n\nOn Monday, I asked whether the momentum rally that has propelled certain segments of the tech sector to extraordinary heights had just stalled. But if investors are running out of enthusiasm (and that has yet to be demonstrated), then technology executives are showing that their animal spirits are alive and roaring.\n\nFollowing the announcement of Disney\'s $500 million acquisition of online video content developer Maker Studios, Facebook disclosed yesterday that it is acquiring Oculus, which develops virtual reality technology for gaming. With this $2 billion acquisition, according to data from Thomson Reuters, the dollar value of global technology deals year to date has risen to $65.2 billion (with Facebook accounting for roughly one-third of that total) -- the highest level at this point in the year since the height of the technology bubble in 2000.\n\nThe Oculus acquisition isn\'t about gaming, however -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is dreaming big here (it would be a pity not to be optimistic, even a bit exuberant, when you have a net worth of $29 billion at age 29.). On a conference call with investors and analysts yesterday, Zuckerberg was effusive in his assessment of the acquisition\'s potential, saying virtual reality could replace mobile as the next major computing platform, and that Oculus could be ""the most social platform ever.""\n\nAcquiring Oculus on that basis looks like a high concept/low probability bet. Virtual reality could be the next major platform, but no one, including Mark Zuckerberg, really knows if that potential will materialize. In the meantime, Facebook\'s autocratic governance structure ensures that the CEO is free to make multibillion-dollar experimental bets. If you\'re a shareholder, perhaps it\'s just a matter of keeping the faith -- he\'s led you this far, after all.\n\nAnd speaking of long odds bets, what is the probability that King Digital Entertainment will produce another hit to replace its blockbuster Candy Crush Saga -- which represents the bulk of its revenue? That\'s the bet you\'re making if you buy the shares now -- not an attractive proposition, in my opinion.', ""In today's headlines, little more than a month after its $19 billion acquisition of messaging app WhatsApp, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has just slapped down $2 billion for virtual reality specialist Oculus.\nBut if investors are running out of enthusiasm (and that has yet to be demonstrated), then technology executives are showing that their animal spirits are alive and roaring.\nFollowing the announcement of Disney's $500 million acquisition of online video content developer Maker Studios, Facebook disclosed yesterday that it is acquiring Oculus, which develops virtual reality technology for gaming.\nVirtual reality could be the next major platform, but no one, including Mark Zuckerberg, really knows if that potential will materialize.\nThat's the bet you're making if you buy the shares now -- not an attractive proposition, in my opinion.""]"

(I\'m on still the fence about that myself.) I\'m talking about the cynical jabs at Kickstarter and the $2.4 million Oculus raised there less than two years ago.\n\nThe fallout began immediately. Publication after publication wrote about Oculus\'s Kickstarter backers not receiving a slice of the $2 billion pie. Prominent gaming figures like Markus Persson and Max Temkin railed about the Kickstarter ""investment round"" and how an ""implicit promise of such a campaign"" is freedom from corporate overlords, respectively. The less said about backer comments on Kickstarter, the better. And around it all darted comments about Kickstarter being a store, not an investment house.\n\nSo many smart people—and quite a few less-thoughtful types—all proving that the world still doesn\'t understand the point of Kickstarter.\n\nSeeding the dream\n\nKickstarter itself is very upfront about what it is not.\n\nKickstarter is not a store. Kickstarter is not a venture capital hotspot. Kickstarter is a vessel for breathing life into rad ideas, the far-out, creative endeavors that often struggle to find money elsewhere. Kickstarter is about funding hopes and dreams.\n\nThe first thing you see on Kickstarter\'s homepage.\n\nConsider the Oculus Rift itself: The idea of affordable and useable virtual reality seemed downright insane just two years ago; most VR experiences up to that point cost into the quadruple and quintuple digits and were utterly, deeply janky.\n\nPalmer Luckey and the Oculus VR crew thought they were on to something, though, and asked for a mere $250,000 on Kickstarter to get the vision off the ground. More than 9,500 backers believed in what mainstream investment sources would only scoff at, pledging a whopping $2.4 million in total. Oculus VR had the cash it needed to roll the dice on Luckey\'s vision.\n\nSelling hope, not just hardware\n\nThat is what Kickstarter is for: Helping far-fetched dreams to become grounded in reality. Yes, Oculus Rift backers received a nifty VR headset—a glimpse into the future, if you will. And yes, Oculus VR the company wound up with Facebook money—the bigger, badder cousin of YouTube money. Neither was guaranteed; Kickstarter is neither a store nor a venture capital wellspring, remember.\n\nBut against all odds, Oculus succeeded, and everyone—backers, founders, you and me, everyone—are on the brink of bathing in the success of the core idea behind the Rift, an idea that seemed so ridonkulous mere months ago: Affordable, believable virtual reality.\n\nOculus also lit a fire in the world of technology. Beyond the Rift, hordes of other start-ups are building VR interpretations of their own, often with very different takes than Oculus. Heck, even Sony is building a VR headset for the PlayStation 4 with Project Morpheus.\n\nNonny de la Pena Journalist Nonny de la Peña\'s ""Hunger in Los Angeles"" uses the Oculus Rift to put you in the role of an observer at a food bank line marred by tragedy. It re-creates an actual event and uses audio captured at the scene.\n\nThat is the true success of the Oculus Kickstarter campaign: Imagination literally given (digital) flesh, an idea that spread like a virus and could one day help the injured heal, teachers open minds, and journalists drop you into the scene of triumphs and tragedy.\n\nNo, Kickstarter is not a store or an investment house, despite what so many seem to think. It\'s so much more: an incubator for dreams. The Oculus Rift is a paladin for that potential, regardless of what you think of Facebook\'s multi-billion buyout.', ""Publication after publication wrote about Oculus's Kickstarter backers not receiving a slice of the $2 billion pie.\nOculus VR had the cash it needed to roll the dice on Luckey's vision.\nYes, Oculus Rift backers received a nifty VR headset—a glimpse into the future, if you will.\nAnd yes, Oculus VR the company wound up with Facebook money—the bigger, badder cousin of YouTube money.\nThe Oculus Rift is a paladin for that potential, regardless of what you think of Facebook's multi-billion buyout.""]"

But you might not be happy about the fact that the phone costs at least Rs 51,000. It could be as high as Rs 53,000.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe other small catch is the fact that the phone launched in India is not powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 and hence would not be a 4G phone. The version being launched in India is powered by an octo-core processor combo (quad 1.9 GHz + Quad 1.3 GHz) which seems to be similar to the Exynos 5 processors on the latest Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Note Pro 12.2-inch tablet.\n\nAs reported by indianexpress.com earlier, the company also launched the entire new Gear range along with the Galaxy S5. The Gear 2 is priced at Rs 21,900, while the Gear 2 Neo and Gear Fit are more affordable with a Rs 15,900 price tag. It has also opened up these devices to almost the entire Galaxy range, of which there are 35 million users in India.

Plus, Samsung is certain that people who buy these phones will do so with the help of EMI schemes.\n\nThe rest of the specs of the Galaxy S5 are similar to what was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February.

Looking at the evolution of Samsung's flagship devices from its Galaxy series, one can understand why.\n\nThe S5 is bigger than its previous iterations, and design-wise, is similar to the Note 3. The S5 is similar in dimensions to the S4, but a bit bigger. That's where most similarities end, at least in terms of design. The S5 is more rectangular than the S3 or S4 and its screen is about 0.1 inch bigger than the 5-inch display of the S4. The front face and the ports are similar to the S4, with one notable exception. There is a big flap at the bottom covering the microUSB/USB 3.0 port. One-handed operation is smooth. The phone is all plastic and proud to be so. The patterned back looks great and offers a good grip. Besides black and white, the phone is also available in blue and gold - the colour of the phone actress Freida Pinto sported at the event.\n\nThe phone is light and, in the limited time we used it, the processor seemed zippy. The TouchWiz interface has been revamped. But the two most talked about features were the fingerprint scanner and the heart rate sensor. Of course, the phone's also dust-proof and water-proof - a bucket wasn't available to dunk the phone into it. The fingerprint scanner, on the phone's home button, is different from that on the Apple iPhone 5s. While in the 5s, one needs to place one's finger on the home button, on the S5, one needs to swipe across. The camera's resolution has been bumped up to 16 megapixel and Samsung claims it can focus automatically on objects in just 0.3 seconds.\n\nAnother cool feature is selective focus - where one can blur out some parts of a shot a la DSLRs.\n\nWe found it a bit of a hit-and-miss indoors.\n\nThe S5 hasn't made revolutionary changes from its predecessor, the S4. The subtle changes, however, make it feel less gimicky (it still has the gesture sensors) and a more serious device. Is it a good phone? From our limited interaction, it certainly feels so, but at Rs 51,000-53,000, it better be.\n\nSamsung also launched the Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo (running Tizen and without a camera) and the curved fitness band, Gear Fit, at the event. Samsung has moved the camera from the strap to the watch body in the Gear 2.\n\nOcta core (Quad 1.9 GHz +Quad 1.3 GHz)16 GB internal +microSD slot (up to 128GB cards supported)Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) with TouchWiz"", 'The S5 is bigger than its previous iterations, and design-wise, is similar to the Note 3.\nThe S5 is similar in dimensions to the S4, but a bit bigger.\nThe S5 is more rectangular than the S3 or S4 and its screen is about 0.1 inch bigger than the 5-inch display of the S4.\nSamsung also launched the Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo (running Tizen and without a camera) and the curved fitness band, Gear Fit, at the event.\nSamsung has moved the camera from the strap to the watch body in the Gear 2.']"

It has also opened up these devices to almost the entire Galaxy range, of which there are 35 million users in India. Earlier, the Gear devices synced only with a handful of top-end Galaxy phones. However, they still don’t work beyond Galaxy ecosystem and Vineet Taneja, the country head for India, said this has been done deliberately to draw people towards the Galaxy range.\n\nWhile the pricing might appear steep to a lot of people, the fact is that high prices have not really deterred people from buying flagship phones.

In similar fashion the Galaxy S3 will go down to £119 from its regular £170 price.\n\nThe price cuts will only be available in Vodafone brand shops and will run until Monday, March 31.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 will see an official release on April 11.\n\nThe handset will replace the S4 as Samsung\'s current flagship device and features what the company deems a ""glam"" design with a perforated back plate that shines in different lighting conditions. It will have full LTE coverage, Wi-Fi MIMO 802.11 to cut down buffering, and a download booster that will allow users to download 1GB worth of media in 30 seconds.\n\nSamsung has also drastically improved the battery that now provides users with 10 hours of web surfing, 12 hours of video playback and offers a new Ultra Power Saving mode. This new mode can grant the user another 24 hours\' worth of power if their phone is at 10 percent. It does this by only keeping necessary functions on and turning the screen to black and white.\n\nSamsung also decided to install a fingerprint swipe feature that users can utilize for authorizing payments. It can unlock a special private mode which secures all important documents, settings and files.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 camera comes with a 0.3 second autofocus which is the fastest on the market, according to Samsung.

51944,http://www.inquisitr.com/1189430/six-things-you-should-know-before-buying-the-samsung-galaxy-s5-in-india/,technology,"['Samsung earlier today launched its flagship, the Galaxy S5 in India at an event held at New Delhi. The company also announced its new Gear Line up of smartwatches along with the phone.\n\nAs expected of a flagship phone, the Galaxy S5 is packed to the hilt with features. Chances are high that many of you in India would also be considering this as your next smartphone. However, before you dole out your hard earned money on the Galaxy S5, you better be aware about a few important facts about the Indian version of the phone.\n\nHere are six of them, listed in no particular order of importance.\n\n1. The Galaxy S5 would only be available starting April 11\n\nYou heard that right. Don’t rush to your dealer or to Amazon or Flipkart already because none of them are selling any Galaxy S5’s right now. While the formal launch of the handset happened today, the Galaxy S5 would only be available starting April 11, 2014. This means you have almost two weeks to think over your prospective purchase and finalize. For the ones who simply do not care and want the device first day, go ahead and pre-book your device early. Lines open March 29.\n\n2. It is by no means affordable\n\nQuality might come at a price – but the fact that one ought to shell out over Rs.50,000 for a phone sometimes gets on my nerve. The Galaxy S5 comes in a single variant (16 GB) in India and could be priced anywhere between Rs. 51,000 and Rs.53,000. The only thing awesome about this price is that the iPhone 5S is even more expensive. This also means that the Galaxy S5 is almost Rs.10k dearer than the Galaxy Note 3. Why not consider the quite capable Note 3 itself then?\n\n3. The Indian version does not get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset!\n\nIn case you have been a long time Samsung user, you might be aware that Samsung has different variants of the same phone for different markets. In line with the same, the Galaxy S5’s sold in India would be powered by Samsung’s Exynos 5422 chipset and not the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801. This chipset is an updated version of the Exynos 5420 that powers the Galaxy Note 3 in India. This 8 core chip has four 2.1Ghz Cortex-A15 cores and four low-power 1.5 Ghz Cortex-A7 cores. They have been slightly downgraded to 1.9 Ghz and 1.3 Ghz, respectively in India, though. All these 8 cores can work in tandem – making it what Samsung calls a True Octa core processor. Should you need to dig deep into the architecture of the Exynos 5422 that powers the Galaxy S5, head to Anandtech.\n\n4. The Indian version WILL capture videos in 4K resolution\n\nWhen Samsung launched the Note 3, with its ability to capture 4k videos, Indians were overjoyed. It was then to their utter dismay they later realized that the Indian variant of the Note 3, with the old Exynos 5420 chipset was incapable of capturing 4k videos and could only manage 1080p. That problem has been fixed with the Exynos 5422. The Indian version of the Galaxy S5 will happily let you capture insane 4k videos. No more cribbing about that.\n\n5. India is NOT getting the 32 GB variant\n\nSome people might have thought that the Galaxy S5’s price range of Rs.51 to 53k would encompass different variants with slight differences in memory and other capabilities. That is not the case, though. The Galaxy S5 will come in only a single variant in India. The 16GB one. At this point, the 32 GB version is not being considered. Thankfully, you can enhance the phone’s storage using Micro SD cards.\n\n6. The Indian Galaxy S5 version does not support LTE\n\nIn case you happen to be a frequent traveler and are looking forward to using the Galaxy S5 on LTE networks in countries where they have decent LTE infrastructure, STOP! The Galaxy S5 sold in India would only support 3G networks. This is unlike the Qualcomm Snapdragon version which has comprehensive support for various LTE networks.\n\nI hope these six key points about the Samsung Galaxy S5 would help you decide if this eventually becomes your next phone. We would be reviewing the Galaxy S5 in the days to come and to offer you a better overall picture.', 'Samsung earlier today launched its flagship, the Galaxy S5 in India at an event held at New Delhi.\nThis also means that the Galaxy S5 is almost Rs.10k dearer than the Galaxy Note 3.\nThe Indian Galaxy S5 version does not support LTEIn case you happen to be a frequent traveler and are looking forward to using the Galaxy S5 on LTE networks in countries where they have decent LTE infrastructure, STOP!\nI hope these six key points about the Samsung Galaxy S5 would help you decide if this eventually becomes your next phone.\nWe would be reviewing the Galaxy S5 in the days to come and to offer you a better overall picture.']"

Check out our curated selection of the best Samsung Galaxy S5 deals.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 can be defined by one word: evolution.\n\nThe camera was evolved to give clearer, faster snaps. The fitness-tracking abilities of the S5 are enhanced over the Galaxy S4 by packing in a more powerful S Health app and a dedicated heart rate monitor on the rear. A fingerprint scanner adds to the most secure Galaxy phone ever made.\n\nThe battery is larger, the screen bigger and brighter, the processor quicker and the design altered.\n\nThe spec sheet certainly doesn't let it down: a 2.5GHz quad-core CPU, 2GB of RAM, a 2,800mAh (removable) battery, 16 / 32GB of memory (with up to 128GB extra through microSD), one of the world's most vibrant screens that's been extended to 5.1-inches and added biometrics.\n\nMud still penetrated the casing\n\nHowever, it's hard to point to one stand out feature that will grab the prospective user when they handle the Galaxy S5 for the first time.\n\nAnd now it's been in the market for a long time, and most places aren't even stocking it thanks to the fact the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S7 and now, the Samsung Galaxy S8 have emerged to take the mantle of flagship from Samsung, and both offer a much better experience and design.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5 price\n\nIf you're thinking of still picking the Galaxy S5, it'll set you back £190 in the UK, with the refurbished or second hand markets the place to get your hands on it.\n\nIt'll be about $220 for the same thing, and AU$350. It's a pretty woolly place out there when it comes to buying the Galaxy S5 as most places are running out of stock, so you'll be advised to shop around.\n\nThe thing is, it's packed with much older tech than other phones that cost the same, and it won't be getting an Android Nougat, nor will it receive Android Oreo, thanks to phones powered by Google's OS having a much shorter software upgrade cycle.\n\nSo really think about buying something like the OnePlus 3T instead - you'll be glad you've got something a bit newer.\n\nOK, let's get back to the original review. The phone does still have a lot going for it for the budget-minded and there are some things to consider if you're going for the older model.\n\nAlready sold? Check out the best Samsung Galaxy S5 deals here\n\nThe messaging around the launch of the Galaxy S5 was that Samsung had listened to the consumers and dialled down the gimmicks, focusing instead on what makes a phone special to the consumer.\n\nIt promised a 'fashionable' and 'glam' design, a camera that works in the way you'd want it to and strength through being water resistant.\n\nThere's also the small notion of an improved version - I was told that it was very likely the Galaxy S5 was going to launch with a Samsung Galaxy S5 Prime version in February, with oodles more RAM, a faster processor and QHD screen on board.\n\nHowever, that was pushed back (likely to do with issues in creating the screen in high enough volumes) and has since appeared in the South Korea-only Samsung Galaxy S5 LTE-A version. This one has a Snapdragon 805 CPU, a WQHD screen and all the high end features you can wish for. In short, it's the amazing phone I wish Samsung had announced originally and sold all over the world.\n\nYou can always look at the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, a smaller phone with equal power to the main Galaxy S5, but with a lower-res 720p screen. That's offset by a metal design, although only around the edge of the phone - and Samsung has gone once again for a light weight, rather than making it feel weighty and ergonomic in the hand.\n\nThat phone has a premium design fused with power under the hood - but with a sky high price and the lower-res screen.\n\nIs the Alpha better than the S5? Check out our Samsung Galaxy Alpha review to find out.\n\nThe new Galaxy Alpha, with a metal frame\n\nAnd if you want something a little smaller, then the Galaxy S5 Mini is still available in some places as well. It's a lot like the bigger brother, and the specs have only been dialled down slightly. It's not quite got the raw power but the design aesthetic is there and the heartbeat monitor as well - well worth checking out if you don't want to spend as much.\n\nBut enough of the competition: let's look at one of the key questions that Samsung needed to answer with the Galaxy S5: is it good enough in market that's becoming saturated with decent high-end handsets?\n\nThe water resistance will make a splash with a few buyers\n\nThe simple answer, from the second you hold it in the hand, is no – because the design simply isn't up to the same level as the likes of Apple and HTC.\n\nThat's only a small part of the story though, and underneath the hood Samsung has continued its play of stuffing all the latest specs in and optimising them in a way that doesn't suck down oodles of battery.\n\nWas this phone good enough to keep Samsung fighting with Apple at the top of the sales charts? Yes, but that's mostly through the impressive marketing machine that rolls out in every territory - and even that hasn't led to the greatest sales for the new phone.\n\nThis seems to have been picked up by the market at large given that Samsung recently reported that it has sold around 40 per cent fewer S5 handsets than it did with the Galaxy S4 at the same point in its lifecycle.\n\nThe South Korean giant has responded to the news by stating that it plans to take a closer look at its smartphone strategy and concentrate on price tiers rather than high end handsets.\n\nCritically, and for the purposes of this review, it feels like there's very little to shout about with the Galaxy S5 – but perhaps that's no bad thing for a brand that was accused of bringing pointless innovation with last year's model."", ""Check out our curated selection of the best Samsung Galaxy S5 deals.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 can be defined by one word: evolution.\nSamsung Galaxy S5 priceIf you're thinking of still picking the Galaxy S5, it'll set you back £190 in the UK, with the refurbished or second hand markets the place to get your hands on it.\nCheck out the best Samsung Galaxy S5 deals hereThe messaging around the launch of the Galaxy S5 was that Samsung had listened to the consumers and dialled down the gimmicks, focusing instead on what makes a phone special to the consumer.\nYou can always look at the Samsung Galaxy Alpha, a smaller phone with equal power to the main Galaxy S5, but with a lower-res 720p screen.""]"

We've had more experience with many of these Android KitKat issues than anyone really deserves, but we learned some valuable lessons in the process. So we've compiled this list of the most common KitKat problems and how to fix them. Join us for a walk down Android KitKat troubleshooting lane.\n\nAll Android versions have their problems. Today we deal with KitKat. / © ANDROIDPIT\n\nShortcuts:\n\nAndroid KitKat battery drain\n\nBattery issues following a firmware update are pretty much par for the course, so don't despair. KitKat battery drain was the first KitKat problem we encountered too back when we downloaded it long ago. It tends to settle down after a short while, but you can help this particular issue disappear more quickly. Give our tried-and-true solutions a go:\n\nAssess the apps that are causing the problems by checking your battery usage stats in settings (either reinstall them in the new firmware or remove them).\n\nClear your system cache. This is done through Recovery Mode, specific to your device.\n\nFinally, the only remaining option, but the one that always works best, is a factory reset. Do not reset your phone until you have backed up all your important data though.\n\nPrevent battery drain on your device. / © ANDROIDPIT\n\nAndroid KitKat 'Unfortunately Gallery has stopped'\n\nTroubleshooting the problem of 'Gallery has stopped' is simple. Just clear the cache for the Gallery app. Go to Settings > Apps > Gallery and clear the cache. If the problem persists you can also clear the data for the app, but make sure you have all your photos safely backed up before you do so.\n\nYou can check out our article on how to transfer photos if you need to back up your photos. It would be a good idea to do anyways.\n\nIf you continue to have problems, you can also try uninstalling the app and re-installing it – or another one – if things are still crashing.\n\nA constantly crashing gallery is a massive pain. / © ANDROIDPIT\n\nAndroid KitKat random reboots\n\nA random reboot is when your phone just crashes and restarts without you doing anything and it is an annoying Android KitKat problem. Sometimes it happens regularly, sometimes it happens because of a particular action or app, but it's never cool. There are a million reasons why random reboots might occur, but the easiest way to clear them up is to just wipe your device.\n\nCopy your important files over to your computer with a USB cable and use a backup app or cloud service to keep everything safe. You can also use a computer-based solution like Helium that doesn't even require root for a full system backup.\n\nOnce you have your backup, just go to the Backup and Reset section of your device's settings and follow the steps.

The Galaxy S5 went on sale on Thursday in South Korea, Bloomberg reports, showing that mobile operators are ready to do just about anything to sell new devices to consumers, especially in a competitive market such as Samsung’s home country.\n\nThe three main carriers in the country – including SK Telecom, KT and LG U+ a – have been hit with a smartphone sales ban that coincides with the planned Galaxy S5 launch. The government is punishing the mobile operators by preventing them to sign new customers for their previous smartphone sales-related subsidies that exceeded a certain threshold. Different ban periods have been awarded to all three carriers between March 13 and May 18, with at least two of them, including SK Telecom and KT, not being able to launch the Galaxy S5 on April 11.\n\nEarlier rumors suggested that SK Telecom, the only carrier of the three that’s not banned to sell new smartphones this week, would sell the handset earlier. Samsung denied the reports even though its own Seoul-based stores reportedly told customers who pre-ordered the handset they could pick it up on March 27. “We are very puzzled,” Samsung said in a statement. “SK Telecom strongly asked for an earlier release of the product but we delivered our stance that the global release date of April 11 remains unchanged.”\n\n“The official global launch date of the Galaxy S5 is April 11, as previously announced, Samsung further told The Verge in a statement. “Samsung has provided mobile carriers with a limited number of units for marketing and pre-sales activities, however the decision to release the device early in the Korean market was made by the mobile carrier itself, independently of Samsung. We express our regret at this decision and we are working to verify all the facts.”\n\nMeanwhile, SK Telecom stood by its decision to launch the Galaxy S5 ahead of schedule. “We decided to release the product for a wider consumer choice of handsets before our operation suspension begins on April 5,” the carrier said in a statement.', 'Even though Samsung wants to launch the Galaxy S5 on April 11th in multiple markets simultaneously, some carriers are already selling the new handset, apparently disregarding Samsung’s wishes.\nThe Galaxy S5 went on sale on Thursday in South Korea, Bloomberg reports, showing that mobile operators are ready to do just about anything to sell new devices to consumers, especially in a competitive market such as Samsung’s home country.\nThe three main carriers in the country – including SK Telecom, KT and LG U+ a – have been hit with a smartphone sales ban that coincides with the planned Galaxy S5 launch.\nEarlier rumors suggested that SK Telecom, the only carrier of the three that’s not banned to sell new smartphones this week, would sell the handset earlier.\nWe express our regret at this decision and we are working to verify all the facts.”Meanwhile, SK Telecom stood by its decision to launch the Galaxy S5 ahead of schedule.']"

According to BBC, the Galaxy S5 is already on sale in South Korea, many weeks before it was set to launch on April 11. A spokesperson told BBC that the company was ""very puzzled"" by the events.\n\nThree carriers in the country had already received shipments of new Galaxy S5 orders, but instead of waiting until April 11 each decided to start selling them immediately. So, technically, you can walk into an LG UPlus, KT Corp or SK Telecom store in South Korea and pick one up today, according to the report. There\'s a legal issue at hand that explains why the carriers were so antsy to start selling new handsets.\n\nSouth Korea recently issued new restrictions on wireless carrier sales following concerns that operators were issuing ""illegal subsidies"" to attract new customers, BBC explained. One of those restrictions is 45 day ban on SK Telcom\'s ability to sell phones to new contract customers, starting on April 5. Since the Galaxy S5 launches on April 11, that means that the carrier wouldn\'t be able to sell Samsung\'s flagship smartphone at that point. Also, since the restriction is on new customer sales, that means customers might have otherwise turned and signed up with a competitor instead. So, SK Telecom just decided to rake in the sales now, before the ban goes into effect.\n\nWe highly doubt this is going to change any other launch dates, and recent rumors have suggested Samsung may even be facing some supply issues. The Galaxy S5 is already available for pre-order in the U.S. and will launch in April.', ""According to BBC, the Galaxy S5 is already on sale in South Korea, many weeks before it was set to launch on April 11.\nThree carriers in the country had already received shipments of new Galaxy S5 orders, but instead of waiting until April 11 each decided to start selling them immediately.\nSince the Galaxy S5 launches on April 11, that means that the carrier wouldn't be able to sell Samsung's flagship smartphone at that point.\nSo, SK Telecom just decided to rake in the sales now, before the ban goes into effect.\nThe Galaxy S5 is already available for pre-order in the U.S. and will launch in April.""]"

[NEWSIS]\n\nKorea’s three mobile carriers began selling the Galaxy S5 yesterday, two weeks earlier than the date Samsung Electronics set for its release.It is unprecedented for local mobile operators to sell a Samsung smartphone earlier than the company’s initial release date.Samsung Electronics President Shin Jong-kyun denied the rumor of an early release when he met reporters on Wednesday. Samsung said the S5 would be released simultaneously in around 150 countries on April 11.“We are sorry about their arbitrary decision to begin selling it without an agreement with us,” said an official of Samsung Electronics. The official said the company had provided the three carriers with some Galaxy S5s to support “marketing activities” of the phone. Neither the company nor the mobile carriers would say how many Galaxy S5s were supplied to the carriers.Samsung expressed regret for what it called a “breach of trust” by the carriers.But the early sales by the local operators - which could trigger similar decisions by overseas mobile carriers - could end up benefiting Samsung.Early this month, the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning slapped a 45-day business suspension on each of the carriers for selling phones to customers with excessive subsidies. The carriers were given different windows in which to serve out their suspensions. According to the schedule, SK Telecom, the nation’s largest operator with an approximate 50 percent market share, and KT, No. 2 with a 30 percent share, will be prevented from selling the Galaxy S5 to new customers on April 11.During the suspensions, the carriers are only allowed to sell new phones to existing customers who have used their old phones for 24 months or longer.Currently, SK Telecom is not in its suspension - although KT and the smaller LG U+ are - and it is selling the Galaxy S5 to new customers. KT and LG U+ are marketing the phone to existing customers.The suspension will end for KT on April 27 and for LG U+ on April 5. LG U+ will enter a second period of suspension on April 27.SK, which enters its suspension on April 5, made the decision to “give customers a chance to experience the Galaxy S5 earlier than other companies,” said an official.Samsung said it has yet to decide on any countermeasure, including whether it will stop shipping phones to the carriers until April 11 or other punitive steps. “We are confident that the issue would be addressed smoothly through talks with Samsung,” the SK official said.The price of the flagship phone was set at 866,800 won ($808.80) for a 32-gigabyte model, which is 32,000 won cheaper than the initial price of the Galaxy S4. It is slashed by 200,000 won through sales promotion benefits that took effect immediately.SK Telecom began selling the S5 through its 3,000 shops across the country and its online sales agency T World Direct (www.tworlddirect.com). It said it will discount 100,000 won from the S5 price for all customers through May 19 and give a 100,000 won additional discount to customers who agree to stay with SK even after their contracts expire.KT, which extends its sales of the S5 to offline shops today, had no immediate discount, but it is giving buyers half-price discount coupons for the Samsung Gear Fit, a wristband health tracker. LG U+, which yesterday launched both online and offline sales, said it will soon announce discount promotions for the S5.The S5, seen as a moderate evolution from the S4, is Samsung’s response to a saturated smartphone market, in particular among high-end users. Rival Apple and Chinese handset sellers are strengthening their grip on the market with cheaper models.Meanwhile, the S5 is being sold with a deactivated built-in heart rate sensor, one of the phone’s new features, due to legal concerns. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said on March 17 it will revise a related law to allow the function to be used on smartphones. Samsung expected the revision of the law be completed by April 11 and said owners of the phones will be able to activate the function later through an app.BY MOON GWANG-LIP [joe@joongang.co.kr]', 'A salesgirl at an SK Telecom shop in Jongno District, central Seoul, demonstrates the Galaxy S5, which began to be sold through the country’s three mobile operators yesterday.\nThe announced date for the phone’s release was April 11, but SK Telecom moved it forward to avoid a business suspension window starting April 5.\n[NEWSIS]Korea’s three mobile carriers began selling the Galaxy S5 yesterday, two weeks earlier than the date Samsung Electronics set for its release.It is unprecedented for local mobile operators to sell a Samsung smartphone earlier than the company’s initial release date.Samsung Electronics President Shin Jong-kyun denied the rumor of an early release when he met reporters on Wednesday.\nThe official said the company had provided the three carriers with some Galaxy S5s to support “marketing activities” of the phone.\nAccording to the schedule, SK Telecom, the nation’s largest operator with an approximate 50 percent market share, and KT, No.']"

The move has prompted other carriers in the country —KT Corp. and LG Uplus Corp. —to also release the device early.In response, Samsung issued a statement , according to the Associated Press, saying that the company is ""very puzzled"" by the decision. Carriers were provided with handsets ahead of time to ensure they could fulfill preorders.The move may be driven in part by a looming suspension set to hit SK Telecom on April 5. The carrier is reportedly barred from accepting new customers for a 45-day period because they provided illegal phone subsidies. Selling the Galaxy S5 early would allow them to lock in new customers ahead of that suspension, which will be in effect when Samsung\'s handset officially launches.Samsung\'s apparent difficulties in coordinating the launch of the Galaxy S5 stand in contrast to Apple\'s debut of both the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c in 11 countries and territories last October. Another 24 countries were added a month later, with a total of more than 100 countries carrying Apple\'s latest handsets by the end of 2013.Samsung has said the Galaxy S5 will be available in more than 100 countries on a single day, April 11.

The list includes the Gear 2 Smartwatch, the Gear 2 Neo and the Gear Fit smartband.\n\nThe Gear 2 smartwatch is priced at Rs 21,900 while the Gear Fit and Gear 2 Neo are priced at Rs 15,900. We got a chance to see how the Gear 2 and the Gear Fit band work and here's our quick take on the devices.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Gear Fit is quite light at 27 gms. It has a curved Super AMOLED display of 1.84-inches with a 432x128 pixel resolution. The Gear Fit feels rather light on your hands, although the plastic strap does feel a little tacky. The only problem I experienced with the Gear Fit was that it didn't fit on my hands. If you have tiny wrists, its unlikely to look great on your hand and does feel a little too big.\n\nThe Gear 2 is quite similar in design to its predecessor, but less chunky. It has a 1.6-inch Super AMOLED display with a 320x320 pixel resolution and a changeable strap as well. The fact that Samsung has moved the camera on to the watch itself instead of the strap, makes the whole thing look neat. It feels a little bit more sturdy than the Gear Fit.\n\nProcessor, Memory and other specs\n\nSamsung hasn't specified the processor or storage for the Gear Fit. The Gear 2 has 4 GB storage and 512 MB RAM and a 1 GHz dual-core processor. Both devices support Bluetooth 4.0 and are water and dust-resistant. What this means is that if you drop them in a bucket or spill water on them, they should be fine. They won't be fine though if you decide to swim with them.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe Gear 2 allows users to make calls, receive notifications from Linkedin, Facebook, WhatsApp, Gmail and pretty much every app on your tethered phone. You can also sync your contact list with the device. In addition to this it has a heart-rate sensor, a step or walking counter, and other options to keep a track of your health.\n\nSamsung is also offering a host of wallpapers and clockfaces with the Gear 2. To listen to music on the headset you need a Bluetooth enabled headset, otherwise you can play on the device itself but it is not very loud.\n\nThe Gear Fit allows users to receive alerts, notifications but you can't make calls from the device. It is a device geared towards fitness and thus in the settings you can choose for the device to reflect the amount you've walked, or your current heart rate etc on the homescreen itself. It also has a heart-rate sensor embedded on the back. For the devices to measure your heart rate you need to wear them and hold still. It's a useful device to keep if you're a regular jogger, who might be worried about over-exerting yourself or not pushing yourself hard enough. Even so the main applications of the Gear Fit are only enabled through the companion app on the S5.\n\nOS\n\nThe Gear 2 runs Samsung's Tizen OS, and while the Fit's OS is also Samsung-developed, it's known as RTOS or Real-time Operating System. The devices are compatible with some 20 Samsung devices, as the company is hoping that those who buy its phones will also turn to its fitness tracker and smartwatches. As far as interface goes Samsung has managed to keep it quite clutter free on Gear 2 and Gear Fit, which is noteworthy. A little bit of swiping would ensure that you are soon familiar with how they work, which is exactly what is needed. It's not changed all that much from the original Gear.\n\nPricing\n\nThe Gear 2 is priced at Rs 21,900 and the Gear 2 Neo and Gear Fit will cost Rs 15,900 a piece. For fitness freaks or those love smartwatches both are great options. But the fact that both devices will work with Samsung devices only is a big restriction and many are unlikely to consider it if they don't already own a Samsung phone. At this stage, Samsung's phones are more likely to draw buyers to their wearables, rather than the other way around. When looking at it from that point of view, the price does seem a bit on the higher side."", ""The list includes the Gear 2 Smartwatch, the Gear 2 Neo and the Gear Fit smartband.\nThe Gear 2 smartwatch is priced at Rs 21,900 while the Gear Fit and Gear 2 Neo are priced at Rs 15,900.\nThe only problem I experienced with the Gear Fit was that it didn't fit on my hands.\nEven so the main applications of the Gear Fit are only enabled through the companion app on the S5.\nPricingThe Gear 2 is priced at Rs 21,900 and the Gear 2 Neo and Gear Fit will cost Rs 15,900 a piece.""]"

While Samsung has not put an exact pricing to the device, the company has mentioned that it will lie between Rs 51,000 - Rs 53,000. The device will be officially launched in the country on April 11, 2014, and the pre-bookings for the same will start on March 29.\n\nThe company also revealed that it has sold over 3.5 crore Galaxy devices in the country till date. This number includes all Galaxy smartphones and tablets from the company.\n\nHere is a look at the specifications of the device.\n\nIn India, the company has chosen to launch the Galaxy S5 variant that is powered by a 1.9GHz Exynos octa-core processor. In comparison, the European and North American Galaxy S5 versions come with a 2.5GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor. What this basically means is that you can say bye bye to 4G LTE support in the country. Users will get a choice between 16 and 32GB of internal memory, which can be further expanded up to 128GB with a microSD card.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 comes with a fingerprint scanner and dust- and waterproof capabilities. It offers a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED full HD display (1920 x 1080 pixel resolution) and comes with a 16MP camera with improved menu and user interface. It also gets a 2.1MP front-facing camera. An additional 'Selective Focus' feature allows users to focus on a specific area of an object while blurring out the background.\n\nThe plastic-built Galaxy S5 runs on the latest Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) operating system and also adds a heart-rate monitor just below the camera module. On the connectivity front, it has Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, 3G, Infrared and NFC, as well as a microUSB port and a microSD card slot. The smartphone provides a comprehensive personal fitness tracker to help users monitor and manage their behaviour, along with tools including a pedometer, diet and exercise records, and a new, built-in heart rate monitor.\n\nThe dimensions of the device are 142 mm x 72.5 mm x 8.1 mm and its weight is 145 gm. The company has provided a 2,800 mAh battery in the device, which it claims will provide up to 21 hours of talk time and 390 hours of stand by time. However, there is no major change in terms of, barring that its home button also functions as a finger-print reader. The smartphone will be available in charcoal black, shimmery white, electric blue and copper gold colour options.\n\nGetting the pricing wrong\n\nConsidering the fact that the device is nothing revolutionary or path-breaking in comparison to the Galaxy S4, we had thought that a sensible pricing for it would lie in the under Rs 45,000 price range.

The carrier ban also will be in place for two other major mobile networks in Korea, KT and LG UPlus. The embargo on SK Telecom will prevail from April 5 to May 19, which covers the April 11 global launch of the Galaxy S5.\n\n""We just wanted to provide the device to local users as soon as possible. It is for the good of our subscribers,"" an official from SK Telecom told the Korea Herald.\n\nSK Telecom is selling the Samsung Galaxy S5 for 866,800 won ($806.1), with a discount as low as 660,000 won for long-term subscribers. The carrier will now have nine days to sell the Samsung Galaxy S5 before coming under the ban.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung, which is also based in South Korea, reports that SK Telecom proceeded with its launch of the Galaxy S5 without consent from the manufacturer. The company told CNET it “provided mobile carriers with a limited number of units for marketing and pre-sales activities.” These probably are likely the handsets that SK Telecom is now offering to customers. Samsung says the global launch of the Galaxy S5 will proceed on April 11 as planned.\n\nSK Telecom’s move appears to be a direct response to the punishment set in place by the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning due to carriers’ severe price undercutting for popular mobile devices. Many Korean carriers were subsidizing their handsets well over the maximum 270,000 won or $250 allowed to be taken off the price of mobile devices for a contract; competitors kept cutting their prices to lure customers.\n\nThe price cut race was reportedly spurred by SK Telecom and came to a head when carrier LG Uplus subsidized the price of its Samsung Galaxy S4 model by 1.2 million won ($1,100), a sum greater than the actual $894 retail cost of the phone.\n\nThe ban set in place for Korean mobile networks is notably being staggered, with carriers having to halt new sales at different times, and all of the carriers will have their Galaxy S5 sales hindered to some capacity. KT, Korea’s second-largest carrier, is adhering to a ban period from March 13 to April 26, while LG UPlus, the third-largest, is adhering to a ban period from March 13 to April 4 and then from April 27 to May 18. But SK Telecom, with a ban spanning most of April and well into May, is set to suffer the most by being unable to accept new customers during the initial launch of the Galaxy S5. KT’s ban will end approximately two weeks after the Galaxy S5 launches, while LG UPlus will be able to release its Galaxy S5 on the global launch day and will have have a two-week window to sell the S5 in the middle of its ban period.\n\nSamsung has not indicated how SK Telecom’s move will affect its relationship with the carrier in the future, but Yonhap, the South Korean state news agency, reports that the Korea Communications Commission plans to suspend the businesses of SK Telecom and LG Uplus for seven and 14 days, respectively, after the carrier ban is completed.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.', 'The Samsung Galaxy S5 will now be available in 149 countries starting April 11 as it has been released in South Korea two weeks ahead of its global launch.\nThe embargo on SK Telecom will prevail from April 5 to May 19, which covers the April 11 global launch of the Galaxy S5.\nSK Telecom is selling the Samsung Galaxy S5 for 866,800 won ($806.1), with a discount as low as 660,000 won for long-term subscribers.\nThe carrier will now have nine days to sell the Samsung Galaxy S5 before coming under the ban.\nSamsung says the global launch of the Galaxy S5 will proceed on April 11 as planned.']"

The handset is set to hit commercial availability worldwide on April 11, launching in 150 countries by the end of next month.\n\nSouth Korean carrier SK Telecom, however, couldn\'t wait any longer and has already released the Samsung Galaxy S5 in the country, to everyone\'s surprise - including Samsung.\n\nAfter rumors started to emerge that the Samsung Galaxy S5 would go on sale early in Korea, company chief JK Shin denied such claims and said this is not the case. As it turns out, the early launch took Samsung by surprise as well.\n\nThe reasoning behind this bold move is that Korean networks were punished by the government for illegally subsidizing new customers and are not allowed to sign up any new customers in parts of April and May. Needless to mention, this ban would have had a tremendous impact if the carriers had to sit out and watch the Galaxy S5 official launch come and go, without being able to do anything about it. Consequently, Korean networks were eager to get the latest Samsung Galaxy S5 into the hands of smartphone shoppers early, before the punishment goes into effect.\n\nMore specifically, Korean carrier SK Telecom went over Samsung\'s head and released the Galaxy S5 early.\n\n""We just wanted to provide the device to local users as soon as possible. It is for the good of our subscribers,"" an SK Telecom official told the Korea Herald.\n\nSamsung is the world\'s biggest mobile phone manufacturer, and going against its plans in its own home country is an incredibly bold move for a mobile carrier. This newly-set precedent could cause some real chaos on the mobile market if other mobile operators choose to follow suit and ignore the manufacturer\'s release date and launch devices when they feel like it.\n\n""[We have] provided mobile carriers with a limited number of units for marketing and pre-sales activities, but the decision to release the device early in the Korean market was made by the mobile carrier itself, independently of Samsung,"" the Galaxy maker told CNET. ""We express our regret at this decision and we are working to verify all the facts.""\n\nOn the other hand, if the Galaxy S5 release didn\'t come early for the Korean market, Samsung would have missed out on some great sales on its home turf. The ban would have severely affected sales, and Korea is a huge market for Samsung. Moreover, rival HTC has just unveiled its new HTC One M8 flagship and made it immediately available for purchase, whereas the Galaxy S5 is still waiting to hit retail even though it became official back in February.\n\n© Copyright 2018 Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved.

Despite its plastic chassis, the smartphone had a powerful processor for the time and a brilliant screen – but alas, the Galaxy S5 is no more.\n\nThat's right, Samsung's venerable flagship is now five years old and, of course, you can't buy it anymore. You might be able to find one on eBay for less than £100, but there are some far finer alternatives you should be considering instead. For that price, you can pick up an excellent Honor 7A or, if you're willing to spend a little more, the Moto G7 is also a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, if you're craving the latest and greatest flagship, the Galaxy S10 is front and centre on shop shelves, although you'll be expected to pay at least £799 for the privilege.\n\nOur original Galaxy S5 review continues below.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5 review: Design\n\nThe Galaxy S5 is best seen as a refinement of the Galaxy S4, as both share a very similar outward appearance. The S5 has slightly bolder curves than the S4's flowing corners, but sat side-by-side they look almost identical. A metal effect bezel surrounds both handsets, although the dimpled, rubberised rear cover on the S5 feels classier than the S4's glossy finish.\n\nIt looks sleek, and at 8.1mm thick it's also very thin, but we can't help feel a little disappointed that Samsung has stuck with an all-plastic construction. Now that the almost entirely metal HTC One (m8) is on sale, the Galaxy S5 feels a little cheap by comparison. On the plus side, the Galaxy S5 is now IP67 water- and dust-resistant, meaning it is completely protected against the effects of dust and can survive a dunking in up to 1m of water. This should hopefully put an end to dead handsets after dropping them into drinks, toilets or puddles, and gives Sony's Xperia Z2 one less killer feature to draw away potential customers. You won't be able to take underwater photos using the touchscreen, as it can't detect any inputs when under water, but you can use the volume key as a physical shutter button instead.\n\nUnfortunately, in making the phone IP67 compliant, Samsung has been forced to add a flap over the USB port to protect it from water damage. It can be a little fiddly to remove for charging, and is held in place with a piece of rubberised plastic; should that snap off the phone would lose its weatherproof abilities. The port itself uses the faster USB3 standard, but Samsung bafflingly doesn't include a USB3 cable in the box. That means you're stuck transferring data from a PC or Mac at USB2 speeds until you buy the right cable, which costs a few pounds."", 'The Galaxy S5 was first released in February 2014 and was a once great flagship choice.\nDespite its plastic chassis, the smartphone had a powerful processor for the time and a brilliant screen – but alas, the Galaxy S5 is no more.\nOur original Galaxy S5 review continues below.\nSamsung Galaxy S5 review: DesignThe Galaxy S5 is best seen as a refinement of the Galaxy S4, as both share a very similar outward appearance.\nNow that the almost entirely metal HTC One (m8) is on sale, the Galaxy S5 feels a little cheap by comparison.']"

These are equipped with some of the biggest smartphone displays around. They also offer stylus support and a selection of features that are aimed at business users and people in the creative industries.\n\nConsumers on a budget and younger smartphone fans are catered for by the Samsung Galaxy Ace family.\n\nGalaxy Ace models offer broadly similar features to more costly Galaxy smartphones. But with smaller, lower-grade screens and cameras and less processing power, enabling Samsung to sell them for a more wallet-friendly price.\n\nBelow, we take a look at some of the newest additions to the Galaxy range and give you a brief insight into what they offer.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus: key features\n\nThe standout feature on the Samsung Galaxy S8 is the stunning edge-to-edge screen, which fills the front of the phone. The display definitely sets the S8 apart from all other smartphones on the market at the moment and is perfect for watching videos and playing games.\n\nThe S8’s 12-megapizel camera features a large F1.7 lens aperture to give you fantastic results, even in poor lighting conditions. The eight-megapixel front-facing camera has the same large aperture, making it perfect for taking selfies in the dark.\n\nThe S8 also comes with the Bixby voice-activated assistant, which is said to be more aware than Siri or Google Now. In select apps, you'll be able to do anything you'd normally do with touch commands completely hands-free.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has all the same features of the regular S8 but with a better screen, bigger battery and more RAM to make it work even faster.\n\nThe S8 and S8 Plus also come with:\n\nIris scanner, facial recognition tech and fingerprint scanner\n\n3,000mAh battery, or 3,500mAh battery for the S8 Plus\n\nFast-charge mode\n\nPowerful octa-core processor\n\nWater-resistant in 1.5 metres of water for up to half an hour\n\nSamsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge: key features\n\nBilled as the handset that ‘redefines what a phone can do’, the Samsung Galaxy S7 teams a premium metal construction with a 12-megapixel camera, a Super AMOLED screen and a handy always-on display.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge are the first smartphones to feature a dual-pixel sensor, resulting in faster autofocus, improved brightness and better overall quality of your photos.\n\nOther key features of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are:\n\nDust and water-resistant, able to survive an accidental dunk in water\n\n3,000mAh battery, or 3,600mAh battery for the Edge model\n\nSuper-fast charging and wireless charging\n\nhere.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus: key features\n\nIf you're after a Samsung phablet to replace your Note 7, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus is a worthy alternative.\n\nThe S6 Edge Plus combines all of the best features of the S6 with a stunning super-AMOLED edge-to-edge screen.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 Edge: key features\n\nMade from the same deluxe materials as the Samsung Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S6 Edge differs from the standard version by including a screen that curves down both sides of the handset. The curved part of the screen doubles as a kind of secondary display that lets you see information even when the phone is on its side.\n\nIt also features a People Edge feature that assigns colours to five contacts of your choice.

It is powered by a quad-core, 2.5Ghz CPU, and contains 2GB of RAM and up to 32GB of internal storage (expandable via the microSD card slot). The device will ship with the latest version of Google\'s Android 4.4 Kit Kat operating system. The smartphone\'s 5.1-inch super AMOLED panel will deliver a 1920x1080 resolution with a density of 432 pixels per inch.\n\nRELATED: Samsung Galaxy S5 in stores April 11 in Australia\n\nSamsung Electronics Australia enterprise and SMB business solutions vice-president, Craig Gledhill, said that the Galaxy S5\'s IP67 certification, \'Ultra Power Saving Mode\' and \'Download Booster\' technology will be particularly beneficial to resellers\' business-to-business (B2B) discussions with enterprise clients.\n\n""Features like the IP67 open up key markets for Samsung and partners; anything from tradesmen and the services industry to mobile workforces, and even general office professionals,"" Gledhill said.\n\n""Having a device that is water and dust-resistant is an added benefit that reduces overall cost of ownership, as there is a smaller chance it will have to be repaired.""\n\nIP67 is not new to Samsung; the vendor\'s Galaxy S4 Active was rated to the same standard, but required users to sacrifice some capabilities and the aesthetics of the original Galaxy S4 smartphone.\n\nOnce toggled on, the Galaxy S5\'s \'Ultra Power Saving Mode\' switches the device\'s screen to black and white, shuts down all software aside from critical features, including phone calls and text messaging, and four additional pre-selected applications.\n\nGledhill claims that while in \'Ultra Power Saving Mode\', the Galaxy S5\'s 2800 milliamp-hour (mAh) battery can deliver up to 24 hours of standby or up to 10 hours of talk time from 10 per cent charge.\n\nSamsung\'s \'Download Booster\' technology allows the Galaxy S5 to utilise the latest Wi-Fi 802.11ac standard with cellular 4G (LTE) at the same time to not only maximise potential download speeds (reliant on carrier networks, of course), but ensure uptime if one form of connectivity is down.\n\nChannel margins\n\nBut it is not all about the individual product. Gledhill said achieving margins relies on the value the reseller can add to the hardware, which demands an understanding of enterprise customer requirements.\n\n""If we go into an industry where the customer wants to transform a forms-based clipboard and digitise it, a partner which goes in there and builds a whole solution surrounding those requirements will achieve better margins than the partner that tries to compete with Harvey Norman on hardware price points,"" he said.\n\nRELATED: Samsung Galaxy S5: Telstra, Optus, and Vodafone pricing\n\nPart of the task is incorporating a wider range of mobility products into the discussion in order to allow customers to delegate investments as appropriate; while enterprises may opt for premium devices through a choose-your-own-device (CYOD) approach for mid-managers and upwards, other staff could be assigned to older generations, for example.\n\nThe January 2014 launch of the second generation of Samsung\'s enterprise mobility security software, Knox, Gledhill believes is a means of addressing the risk component of the customer discussion.\n\nIn February, he ARN that there has been interest in Knox, although its uptake has been slow while it gains customers\' confidence. Knox\'s growth has since accelerated.\n\n""The thing with Knox is that enterprises like proof of concepts to see if it integrates into the back end and so on,"" Gledhill said.\n\n""To get the uptake it requires overcoming a lot of hurdles in terms of integration and testing.""\n\n""We have been doing that for a number of months, so uptake of Knox will accelerate.""\n\nOne hundred per cent of Samsung\'s enterprise sales go through the channel. The vendor launched its formalised Samsung Team of Empowered Partners (STEP) channel program in July last year, which introduced a structured means of interaction between the company and its partners.\n\nThe three-tier (platinum, gold and silver) was designed to reward partners\' investments by enabling more effective integration between Samsung technology within resellers\' own product and solutions portfolios.\n\nSamsung will continue to stock and supply its Galaxy S4, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note II and Galaxy Note III.

52012,http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/first-impressions-samsung-galaxy-s5-packs-great-features-but-asking-price-is-too-much-220547.html,technology,"[""Shruti Dhapola\n\nSamsung today launched the Galaxy S5 smartphone in India at a special event in New Delhi. The company has chosen to launch the 3G/HSPA+ version of the smartphone with an octa-core processor and 16 GB storage space. Samsung did not confirm whether India would get the 4G version of the phone in the near future.\n\nSamsung’s Galaxy S5 will go on sale in India on 11 April and the pre-orders for the device will open on 29 March. The company has not yet announced the final price for the smartphone but has said that price will be between Rs 51,000 to Rs 53,000. We got a chance to play with the Samsung device and here’s our quick take on it.\n\nDesign\n\nSamsung’s Galaxy S5 has a bigger screen and the company has tried to give the phone a different kind of back body with a textured, ‘dotted’ feel. Just like the faux-leather look for the Note 3, the ‘dotted’ feel on the back of the S5 doesn’t look great. The upside to this is that it doesn’t feel so plasticky as the previous versions of the Galaxy S devices.\n\nThe bezel on the side still feels far too thick and the textured back doesn’t help with the overall look.\n\nScreen, Processor and Memory\n\nThe S5 has a 5.1-inch screen with a Full HD resolution and an octa-core (eight core) processor which consists of two quad-core processors clocked at 1.9 and 1.3 GHz respectively. The device comes with 2GB RAM, memory space of 16 GB and a microSD slot that can accept cards up to 128 GB.\n\nIn terms of space, the 16GB plus the microSD slot card should be enough for users. As far as the screen is concerned, Samsung says the screen’s 'Local Contrast Enhancement' feature allows users to use the phone easily even in harsh lighting conditions, such as the sun, etc. When there is less light, the smartphone dims the light to allow users to read more easily.\n\nWhile the octa-core processor is fine, one should remember that users won’t get access to 4G in India. For users who plan to pay over Rs 50k for a smartphone, the 4G restriction might just be the deal breaker. While it’s true that in India 4G is a long way to go, for urban customers who are ready to shell out so much for a phone, they are also likely to be the first ones to sign up for 4G when it comes to their city. In that case, the S5 without 4G might seem not so desirable.\n\nCamera\n\nThe Galaxy S5 has a 16 megapixel camera and according to the company, the world’s fastest auto-focus speed (up to 0.3 seconds). It has also has an 'Advance HDR' mode for better colours and light. The camera comes with a new 'Selective Focus' feature which lets users focus on a particular object in the room, surroundings, etc.\n\nAs far as the camera goes, there was no denying that the picture quality was quite good, despite the terrible light in the room. The camera also has several modes such as Best Shot, Dual Shot, Panorama, etc, which were there in the S4 as well.\n\nThe only problem when you get into the camera settings is that it does seem a little overwhelming with so many features. It does take a little bit of time to figure how you’re supposed to go about clicking, especially if you are used to a clutter free design on a smartphone camera.\n\nBattery\n\nSamsung has promised good battery life for this device. The smartphone has a 2800 mAh battery which Samsung says has a talk-time of 21 hours and a standby time of 300 hours in the Ultra Power Saving mode.\n\nThe Ultra Power Saving mode allows users to access calls, messages ( the bare essentials) when they are running on low battery. While the feature is great, as far as battery goes, one can only tell when we have used the phone for a longer time. You should remember that the S5 has a lot of other features such as S Health app, Heart rate monitor, etc, and if you intend to use these are lot, it’s unlikely that the battery won’t drain fast.\n\nS Health and Heart rate sensor\n\nFor Samsung, these are part of the biggest changes to the Galaxy S5 and along with the Gear range, Samsung is hoping the smartphone will appeal to the fitness freaks. The smartphone has a Heart rate sensor below the smartphone’s camera on the rear. You can access this via the S Health app and you have to put your finger on the sensor to let the smartphone measure your heartbeat. Do note that you need to stay completely still when doing this and it worked quite well when we tried it.\n\nThe S Health app been revamped quite seriously and you can see a variety of functions from pedometer to heart rate to calories burnt. Users can also set diet and records and the company is offering more apps to link to S Health. S Health 3.0 has a number of great features, and will appeal to those who are serious about their fitness.\n\nFingerprint Scanner\n\nThe S5 has a fingerprint scanner which is used for locking the device. The pay from PayPal using the Fingerprint scanner option is not available in India however. Setting up the Fingerprint Scanner can be quite a task as Samsung requires you to swipe the device 8 times. It does appear to be a tad frustrating.\n\nPrice\n\nThe S5 is going to be priced between Rs 51,000-53,000. Like almost all the latest premium smartphones that have been launched in India, it is priced in the Rs 50K bracket which isn’t really surprising. The question is: Can the fitness and imaging features justify this kind of pricing? The fingerprint scanner, heart-rate sensor and a 16 megapixel shooter are the newest features of the device. Whether this is enough for users to ditch an S4 and buy the new S5 will of course depend on user preference. Personally speaking, it does appear a high price to pay, but the smartphone does have a great camera. Where the fingerprint scanner and heart rate sensor go, I would still put them in the category of gimmicky features."", 'Shruti DhapolaSamsung today launched the Galaxy S5 smartphone in India at a special event in New Delhi.\nWe got a chance to play with the Samsung device and here’s our quick take on it.\nDesignSamsung’s Galaxy S5 has a bigger screen and the company has tried to give the phone a different kind of back body with a textured, ‘dotted’ feel.\nThe upside to this is that it doesn’t feel so plasticky as the previous versions of the Galaxy S devices.\nS Health 3.0 has a number of great features, and will appeal to those who are serious about their fitness.']"

The tipster has posted 2 images of the awaited device on Twitter yesterday, hence pulling the veil off the mystery of its ostensible display.\n\nApparently, the 7-inch tablet looks nothing less than a colossal counterpart of the Samsung Galaxy S5. The leaked images show the purported tablet in both black and white models.\n\nBy the look of the leak, Samsung seems to be sticking to its conventional tablet design – the same wallpaper and physical home button along with other multitasking buttons at the front of the tablet. Power and volume buttons are on the right, and the front camera is located at the top edge.\n\nNothing can be spoken outright about the specifications of the new model. However, Samsung’s previous ventures into the design and features foretell that Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 could offer a 1280 x 800 display, a quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor backed by 1GB of RAM, a 3-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of internal storage + microSD and a 6800mAh battery. The device is expected to run on Android 4.4 KitKat operating system.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is rumored to be launched with a series of other powerful devices – the 8 and 10-inch Galaxy 4 tablets. It’s expected to be launched on Thursday April 24th, as the leaked image hints. All the models are likely to have AMOLED displays. The faces of these much-talked about models, however, are yet to be laid bare.\n\nAfter the release of Samsung Galaxy TabPRO and NotePRO, clearly Samsung deserves rest for a while. Probably that’s why there’s no word on when the world will get to have these objects in its possession.

Design\n\n\n\nThe watches are designed to be sleeker and lighter than Samsung’s original £300 Galaxy Gear, which was criticised for having only a single day of battery life, a limited selection of apps and a clunky camera.\n\nBoth models are 10mm thick and come with removable straps, which include charcoal black, gold brown and wild orange for Gear 2, and charcoal black, mocha grey and wild orange for Gear 2 Neo.\n\nMost notably, the Android operating system that powered Galaxy Gear has been ditched in favour of Samsung’s own Tizen software, which it hopes will offer better connectivity and integration.\n\nThe all-metal Gear 2 weighs 68g and has moved the 2-megapixel camera that includes 720p HD video capture to the watch-face itself, whereas the plastic Neo weighs 55g and has no camera.\n\nBoth watches have the same 1.63-inch 320×320 AMOLED screen as their predecessor and use a faster dual-core 1GHz processor with 512MB of RAM.\n\nThey’re also dustproof and water-resistant, and feature a 300mAh battery with up to three days of standby time, a built-in speaker and mic, 4GB of storage, and a heart rate sensor and pedometer to measure stress levels, sleep and exercise (with or without a smartphone).\n\n2. Application\n\nThe watches are meant to act as a companion device for about 16 of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Calls can be taken via the wrist, while the screen notifies users on incoming emails, phone calls, text messages and social media updates without having to check their phone.\n\nSamsung wearers can download apps from the watch’s app store, which currently has 23 apps that are designed to improve lifestyle.\n\nA WatchON Remote app, paired with the Gear 2’s inbuilt IR blaster, controls electronic devices like a TV or video recorder, while Sleep Genius is designed to track sleep cycles and improve sleep quality by waking users up gradually.\n\nOther standalone apps so far include Runtastic’s fitness tracker app, an iHeartRadio streaming radio app, an events reminder app and other fitness apps. Songs can also be loaded and played when paired with a Bluetooth headset.\n\nLike startup Omate’s TrueSmart, Samsung is looking to find the best apps on the market after releasing its own Tizen software development kit (SDK) for developers.', 'Korean manufacturer Samsung launched two successors to its Galaxy Gear smartwatch at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in February 2014: the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo.\nCBR tells you five things you need to know about the latest specs, prices, competitors and reviews.\nBoth models are 10mm thick and come with removable straps, which include charcoal black, gold brown and wild orange for Gear 2, and charcoal black, mocha grey and wild orange for Gear 2 Neo.\nMost notably, the Android operating system that powered Galaxy Gear has been ditched in favour of Samsung’s own Tizen software, which it hopes will offer better connectivity and integration.\nApplicationThe watches are meant to act as a companion device for about 16 of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones and tablets.']"

The tweet simply says, ""Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0"" in typical evleaks manner. So it could be the official name for the tablet.\n\nWe get a good look at the front and sides of the tablet, which features characteristic Samsung styling. The Tab 4 does look a lot slimmer than the current 7-inch model.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 is rumoured to sport a 1280x800 pixel WXGA display and run Android 4.4 KitKat out-of-the-box with Samsung’s heavily-customised TouchWiz UI and magazine-style homescreen. It’s also expected to have a gigabyte of RAM, a 3-megapixel camera and 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera. It’s said to have 8GB of internal storage, and a microSD card slot as well.

52031,http://www.whatmobile.net/2014/03/27/review-nokia-1320/,technology,"['Bigger is better. That’s the consensus among smartphone makers right now. The Samsung Galaxy Note 3, for instance, sports a display measuring 5.7 inches, while the Sony Xperia Z Ultra measures a whopping 6.4 inches. And yes, you’re still supposed to make calls with them.\n\nNot one to miss out on the ‘phablet’ fun, Nokia brought out its own 6-inch Windows Phone late last year, the Nokia Lumia 1520, and now it’s back with a budget follow-up.\n\nMeet the Nokia Lumia 1320, a 6-inch 4G warhorse at a SIM-free price under £300 — half the cost of a Samsung Note. Is it as good though? It would be if it wasn’t for Windows Phone.\n\n[alert type=alert-blue]Design & build[/alert]\n\nThe 1320 channels the exact same design as its Lumia predecessors, with a smooth, robust polycarbonate shell, curved edges and a monolithic front face that isn’t marred by physical buttons. It looks great, and at 9.8mm deep, it’s not too thick to regularly handle comfortably.\n\nThe 1320’s display measures a huge 6 inches diagonally. It sounds daunting but it isn’t. As Samsung has proved by selling millions of massive Notes, a giant screen isn’t a problem — it’s the added bulk from an enormous bezel around the screen that can make a phone cumbersome. Luckily, Nokia has avoided making this error, which crippled HTC’s humongous phablet, the HTC One Max. The 1320 is very manageable despite its dimensions. It’s almost all screen, with a narrow frame on the top and bottom. This gives you oodles of space for watching videos, reading articles or thumbing out emails with an ‘embiggened’ keyboard.\n\nWhat has changed with the display, however, is the pixel density. To cut costs, Nokia has used a 720p-resolution IPS LCD screen. This is technically still HD, but its 1,280 x 720-pixel resolution means a lot fewer pixels than you’ll find on a crisp 1,920 x 1,080 Full HD display, as seen with the Lumia 1520 and HTC One.\n\nBut we’re splitting hairs here. The difference is barely discernible and unless you’re a real smartphone screen connoisseur, you probably wouldn’t notice.\n\n[alert type=alert-blue]Performance[/alert]\n\nNokia hasn’t skimped on the important specs. The Snapdragon S4 processor powers other top-of-the- line phones including the HTC One and LG G2, and it flies here. You won’t have any problems running taxing 3D games (although you might have trouble finding them — more on that later).\n\nBetter still, Nokia’s included LTE support, meaning the 1320 enjoys the same super-fast 4G speeds as the latest flagship smartphones. So long as you have coverage in your area, you’ll come to love near-instant downloads, as well as rapid uploads, if you’re constantly sharing pictures and video away from wi-fi. Despite all this power, battery life (one of the real advantages of phablets) is solid — you’ll easily clear a day of constant email syncing, browsing the web and watching videos, as you would with a Galaxy Note 3. With casual use, you could easily manage a whole weekend.\n\nThere is one area that Nokia has cut corners with: the camera. The 5-megapixel sensor on the 1320 is a pathetic pixel count compared to the outstanding 1020 and Lumia 925 snappers. It suffers from weak low-light performance and visible mottling outdoors if you don’t keep still. Nokia’s excellent camera app with slide-out settings on the Lumia 1020 is also sorely missed here. But it’s far from the worst we’ve ever tested.\n\n[alert type=alert-blue]Windows phone & apps[/alert]\n\nSo far, good enough, right? Sadly, much of Nokia’s hard work is undone by the software. Android has developed dramatically since it launched in 2008 and it now boasts a store with more than a million apps and games. Windows Phone, by contrast, hasn’t aged a day — it remains as pretty as ever and just as vacuous.\n\nThe Start screen is a pleasant way to navigate apps and inboxes, and with that blazing CPU under the hood, there’s no slowdown. But there remain glaring issues.\n\nYou’re not able to change your keyboard layout; Nokia’s bundled Here mapping app is one of the best pre-installed navigation apps to be found on the 1320 there’s still no decent universal notification centre; and Internet Explorer is a mess, hiding tabs away behind multiple clicks and sometimes rendering web pages very oddly.\n\nThe Windows Store lags behind its competitors on quality and quantity of must-have apps. At least Vine and Instagram are both available at long last (they come preloaded, along with WhatsApp and a few branded apps you should ignore, especially novelty card purveyor Funky Pigeon), and there’s an excellent Flappy Bird game.\n\nThere’s still no official YouTube app, while Microsoft only recently added TV shows and movie rentals to its download service, something Apple has offered on the iPhone for more than six years. Windows Phone has always felt late to the party, but it’s especially true here.\n\nThe large screen is fine for viewing photos but the pixel density is not that high and the camera lacks quality\n\n[alert type=alert-blue]Conclusion[/alert]\n\nThe Windows Phone software doesn’t suit a screen this size. Beyond an extra column of tiles dumped onto the homescreen, the massive display offers few advantages. You can’t run apps side by side, as with the Galaxy Note. You can’t adjust the size of the keyboard to suit your thumbs or swipe to type. And there’s no stylus for writing. It’s just the small screen experience, stretched out and blurrier.\n\nThen there’s the price. At around £280 SIM-free, it’s only a fraction cheaper than Google’s phenomenal Nexus 5 — and we know which has better apps. On contract pricing, that small difference melts away, with contracts for both on 4G at around £21 per month. It’s just not that cheap for an affordable phablet — not while Google and LG undercut the market with the Nexus.', 'Not one to miss out on the ‘phablet’ fun, Nokia brought out its own 6-inch Windows Phone late last year, the Nokia Lumia 1520, and now it’s back with a budget follow-up.\nMeet the Nokia Lumia 1320, a 6-inch 4G warhorse at a SIM-free price under £300 — half the cost of a Samsung Note.\nIt would be if it wasn’t for Windows Phone.\nWindows Phone, by contrast, hasn’t aged a day — it remains as pretty as ever and just as vacuous.\nWindows Phone has always felt late to the party, but it’s especially true here.']"

But you might not be happy about the fact that the phone costs at least Rs 51,000. It could be as high as Rs 53,000.\n\nThe other small catch is the fact that the phone launched in India is not powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 and hence would not be a 4G phone. The version being launched in India is powered by an octo-core processor combo (quad 1.9 GHz + Quad 1.3 GHz) which seems to be similar to the Exynos 5 processors on the latest Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Note Pro 12.2-inch tablet.\n\nAs reported by indianexpress.com earlier, the company also launched the entire new Gear range along with the Galaxy S5. The Gear 2 is priced at Rs 21,900, while the Gear 2 Neo and Gear Fit are more affordable with a Rs 15,900 price tag.\n\nIt has also opened up these devices to almost the entire Galaxy range, of which there are 35 million users in India. Earlier, the Gear devices synced only with a handful of top-end Galaxy phones.\n\nHowever, they still dont work beyond Galaxy ecosystem and Vineet Taneja, the country head for India, said this has been done deliberately to draw people towards the Galaxy range.\n\nWhile the pricing might appear steep for a lot of people, the fact is that high prices have not really deterred people from buying flagship phones.\n\nA case in point is the success of iPhone 5s despite its price tag. Plus, Samsung is certain that people who buy these phones will do so with the help of EMI schemes.\n\nThe rest of the specs of the Galaxy S5 are similar to what was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. The change in processor has been necessitated by the fact that there is still no nationwide 4G service in India. HTC, which earlier this week announced the HTC One M8 powered by the same processor as the S5, has decided to launch only the 4G version in India.', 'Samsung Galaxy S5 will cost at least Rs 51,000 but it could be as high as Rs 53,000.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S5 is finally here.\nAs reported by indianexpress.com earlier, the company also launched the entire new Gear range along with the Galaxy S5.\nThe rest of the specs of the Galaxy S5 are similar to what was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February.\nThe change in processor has been necessitated by the fact that there is still no nationwide 4G service in India.']"

Samsung is understandably ‘puzzled’ at this development and still trying to verify the facts to formulate its appropriate response. Samsung has stated that its decision on global release on April 11 remains unchanged.\n\nSamsung had scheduled the release of Galaxy S5 across 150 countries on Friday, April 11. However, the carriers in South Korea had other plans. According to the new policy for the carriers in South Korea, SK Telecom, KT Corp and others won’t be allowed to take up any new customers for 45 days. This policy came into being because the carriers offered illegal discounts to customers.\n\nAccordingly, SK Telecom has gone on to release the smartphone today, two weeks ahead of its schedule. Other carriers such as KT Corp and LG Plus Corp are likely to follow. Samsung also revealed that SK Telecom, the largest carrier in South Korea, had requested for an earlier release date, but it was turned down.\n\nIn a move to justify this premature release, SK Telecom stated that it’s resorted to this step to provide wider choice of smartphones prior to the impending suspension taking effect from April 5. While the global release is far from here, the mobile carriers seem to have the stock of S5, needed for the early release as Samsung had provided the same for marketing and pre-orders in view of the global launch.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, the Galaxy S5 doesn’t come overloaded with far too many features. In fact, the company has attempted to stick to the basics. However, the Galaxy S5 comes with features pertaining to fitness such as built-in heart rate monitor, pedometer and fitness tracker, designed to lure the fitness enthusiasts. SK Telecom said that it’s available for approx. $808 sans contract.\n\nWith the premature release of Galaxy S5, Samsung faces a situation unheard of so far.

The Samsung Gear Fit as well as the Samsung Gear 2 Neo will both be priced at Rs 15,900 whereas the Samsung Gear 2, which is a successor to the first Samsung Galaxy Gear, will be selling at Rs 21,900. All three will start selling from April 11 in India, along with the Galaxy S5.\n\nThe Gear 2 is the proper follow-up, while the Gear 2 Neo is a toned-down update and could do for the category what some of Samsung’s mid-range phones have done for smartphones. Both watches run Tizen and this is a move forced in part by one of the biggest criticisms of the first-gen Gear i.e. battery life. The company is announcing better battery life numbers, but we don’t know whether this is due to hardware or software changes. Tizen, which has been developed largely by Samsung and Intel in conjunction with other tech companies, is also an open-source OS and thus has the same advantages of Android.\n\nBoth watches are more or less the same with some minor hardware differences. They have a 1.63-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 320×320 pixels. They both feature a 1GHz dual-core processor, 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage. That sounds about as good as a low-end Android phone. The Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo are both IP67 certified for dust and water resistance.\n\nThe Samsung Gear Fit was has a 1.84-inch curved Super AMOLED display with 432×128 screen resolution. The screen is fully touch capable. The sensors on the device are Accelerometer, Gyro, Heart Rate. In terms of connectivity it has Bluetooth 4.0 and it is IP67 Water and Dust Resistant. The dimensions of the device are 23.4 x 57.4 x 11.95 mm and it weighs 27g. It has a standard 210mAh battery and Samsung is promising 3-4 days battery life with typical usage and 5 days of battery life with low usage.\n\nIt features a pedometer, exercise metre, heart rate monitor and can track your sleep as well as act as a stopwatch and a regular watch.

The phone will be priced between Rs 51,000 and Rs 53,000, according to Samsung, who declined to reveal the final price. This is for the 16GB version as the 32GB variant will not be making it to India.\n\nThe S5 will be on pre-order from March 29 and will go on sale from April 11. The Galaxy S5 will be available in black, white, blue and gold in India, along with the three Gear watches that were also launched for India.\n\nWe have already examined the Galaxy S5’s features and specs and there’s no mystery about the phone. But the S5 launching in India has the Exynos octa-core processor and not the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, as announced at MWC. This is the first time that this variant has hit retail in the world. Samsung has made changes in the processor as compared to the S4 and now the octa-core CPU can have all eight cores running at the same time.\n\nThe S5 is an itinerant update over last year’s S4 and features a slightly bigger display with the same Super AMOLED panel and 1080p resolution. Samsung has added a fingerprint scanner in the home button and a heart rate monitor on the back under the camera, which are two highlights of this phone. As a result of the waterproofing treatment, the phone has significantly larger bezels.\n\nAnother area where Samsung claims great advancements is the camera. There’s a 16-megapixel main camera on the S5, armed with interesting editing options and several shooting modes, including selective focus. Initial reviews have all put the S5's camera among the best in the world and we are itching to test it out ourselves.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 comes to the market just at the time when the new HTC One and the renewed LG G2 are hitting stores so competition will be fierce. There’s no doubt that the S5 has great hardware and looks very much like a Samsung flagship, which is not as bad as people assume it would be. But the biggest criticism is that Samsung has not tried to bring anything new in terms of design and is not really pushing the specs envelope as much as it did with the S4 and S3 in the past."", 'tech2 News StaffSamsung has launched its latest flagship the Galaxy S5 in India and the so-called ‘next big thing’ has a hefty price tag as well as the top-of-the-line specs.\nThe phone will be priced between Rs 51,000 and Rs 53,000, according to Samsung, who declined to reveal the final price.\nThe Galaxy S5 will be available in black, white, blue and gold in India, along with the three Gear watches that were also launched for India.\nBut the S5 launching in India has the Exynos octa-core processor and not the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801, as announced at MWC.\nThe Galaxy S5 comes to the market just at the time when the new HTC One and the renewed LG G2 are hitting stores so competition will be fierce.']"

It could be as high as Rs 53,000.\n\nThe other small catch is the fact that the phone launched in India is not powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 and hence would not be a 4G phone.

Plus, Samsung is certain that people who buy these phones will do so with the help of EMI schemes.\n\nThe rest of the specs of the Galaxy S5 are similar to what was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. The change in processor has been necessitated by the fact that there is still no nationwide 4G service in India.

Today Samsung showcased the new device and boy oh boy it has some smart features. Samsung is bringing the 3G version of the smart phone to India on the eleventh of April in the 16 GB version only.Configuration includes a 5.1-inch display, which supports Full HD graphics that is covered with corning Gorilla glass 3. Built on the Snapdragon 801 chipset, Galaxy S5 has a 2.5 Ghz quad-core Krait processor with 2 GB RAM. It has a 2,800 mAh battery that should last for a day on single charge. But the Galaxy S5 does have a new feature that elongates the battery life. To do so you would need to turn the ultra power saving mode on and it will give you just basic functionalities of the phone such as calling and SMS.As far as the cameras are concerned, Samsung Galaxy S5 has a 16 MP rear one and a 2 MP front one. It also features a fingerprint scanner that is nicely hidden under the opaque home screen button.We gave this phone a go and the first impressions were not too shabby. While it did take a wee bit extra time to setup the fingerprint functionality, it does work well. Camera is not too bad either. Samsung has introduced a selective focus feature in the camera, which enhances the subject in the image by blurring the rear scenery.There are quite a few colours available as well, starting from the gold to the black and the blue. But it does boil down to the price, doesn’t it? Samsung is still undecided on the price and the release said it will be priced between Rs 51,000 – Rs 53,000.

But the wait is too long for impatient South Korean carrier SK Telecom, which has made the phone available today for around 866,800 won.\n\nKorean networks were keen to get the S5 into the hands of phone fans early because they\'re not allowed to sign up new customers in parts of April and May, as punishment from the government for illegally subsidising new customers. The sanctions mean SK Telecom, KT Corp and LG Uplus Crop would have had to sit on their hands as the S5\'s official release date came and went.\n\nSo SK Telecom has defied Samsung and started shifting the S5 early. ""We just wanted to provide the device to local users as soon as possible. It is for the good of our subscribers,"" an official from SK Telecom told Korea Herald.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Samsung takes on rivals with Galaxy S5, Gear 2\n\nSamsung boss JK Shin said yesterday that the S5 would not go on sale early, but it appears SK has gone ahead anyway.\n\nUpdate, 3:30 a.m. PT: Samsung told CNET today that it has ""provided mobile carriers with a limited number of units for marketing and pre-sales activities, but the decision to release the device early in the Korean market was made by the mobile carrier itself, independently of Samsung. We express our regret at this decision and we are working to verify all the facts.""\n\nIt\'s a heck of an audacious move for a mobile carrier to risk its relationship with the world\'s biggest mobile phone manufacturer on its own turf -- and it sets a heck of a precedent; I imagine networks and carriers around the world are very curious indeed to see what happens next. I know I am.\n\nWe\'re used to waiting a while for a cool new device after the fanfare of the big unveiling. The S5 was revealed way back in February, so no wonder everyone\'s getting antsy. By contrast, the HTC One M8 has already stolen a march on the S5 by landing in shops the same day as it was announced this week.', 'Andrew Hoyle/CNETThe Samsung Galaxy S5 is on sale now in South Korea, two weeks early -- much to Samsung\'s surprise.\nBut the wait is too long for impatient South Korean carrier SK Telecom, which has made the phone available today for around 866,800 won.\nSo SK Telecom has defied Samsung and started shifting the S5 early.\nIt is for the good of our subscribers,"" an official from SK Telecom told Korea Herald.\nNow playing: Watch this: Samsung takes on rivals with Galaxy S5, Gear 2Samsung boss JK Shin said yesterday that the S5 would not go on sale early, but it appears SK has gone ahead anyway.']"

The benefit of incorporating RTOS is that it allowed Samsung to utilize a smaller amount of memory and a less powerful processor on the Gear Fit.\n\nSamsung suggests that while the RTOS is a much simpler OS, it still comes with multitasking capabilities. It uses a set of predetermined simple tasks which helps speed up the functionality and allows the Gear Fit to last three or four days off of a single charge.\n\nThe downside of the simpler RTOS is that it does not allow developers to create 3rd party apps for the Gear Fit directly.

Its official worldwide launch is slated for next month, on April 11.\n\nSK Telecom, KT and LG UPlus are the local mobile operators in question, with SK Telecom being the largest one in South Korea. Two weeks ahead of the official launch, the smartphone is on sale for ₩866,800 (roughly $809 or €587).\n\nSamsung did not give the three mobile operators the go-ahead to sell the Galaxy S5 today, per the statements issued by the company. The mobile operators have taken this route to avoid possible losses in sales following restrictions imposed by South Korean regulators, that overlap with the April 11 launch of the Galaxy S5. Samsung opposed the early launch, after being asked to agree to it.\n\nYou may wonder how the three can sell the Galaxy S5 today, seeing as stocks may not be large enough at this point to meet demand. Samsung says that mobile operators have received ""a limited number of units"", for purposes not relating to direct customer sales, that may actually be large-enough to entice potential buyers to pull out their credit cards before April 11.\n\nThe early launch of the Galaxy S5 may not be what Samsung officially says it wants, but it gives local (and even international) consumers the chance to get their hands on the handset sooner than most. It also places Samsung in the spotlight once again, which comes in handy after the launch of the HTC One, which is available for purchase ahead of its competitor in a number of international markets.\n\nIf the three mobile operators have agreed to the initial plan, Samsung can ask for a sales ban that will prevent them from selling the smartphone until April 11. On the other hand, a sale, even if it is not when the South Korean maker would have wanted it to be, is still a sale. It will be interesting to see if other mobile operators decide to follow suit, seeing as ""they did it first"".\n\nPhoto Credit: moomsabuy/Shutterstock', 'Mobile operators in Samsung\'s home country of South Korea have decided to give themselves a head start on the Galaxy S5 launch, by making the smartphone available starting March 27.\nSK Telecom, KT and LG UPlus are the local mobile operators in question, with SK Telecom being the largest one in South Korea.\nSamsung did not give the three mobile operators the go-ahead to sell the Galaxy S5 today, per the statements issued by the company.\nThe mobile operators have taken this route to avoid possible losses in sales following restrictions imposed by South Korean regulators, that overlap with the April 11 launch of the Galaxy S5.\nIt will be interesting to see if other mobile operators decide to follow suit, seeing as ""they did it first"".']"

The trendsetting smartphone was unveiled today though it will be available only from April 11th, the originally announced launch date. Samsung Galaxy S5 or the GS5 integrates some of the best hardware features and new software innovations in a smartphone. While the finger-print scanner and the heart-rate monitor will be the stars and the USP of the device, the fastest camera, water-and dust resistance and other software tweaks will definitely continue making the phone popular.\n\nSamsung did not reveal the exact pricing of the device but instead mentioned that Samsung Galaxy S5 would be priced between Rs 51,000 and Rs 53,000 in India. The phone is already up for pre-order and people can book the device initially for Rs 1500, paying the remainder of the amount post launch on the 11th of April. Samsung Galaxy S5 will come to India in all four colours, Gold, Black, White and Blue.\n\nAlong with Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung also launched the Samsung Galaxy Gear Fit, Samsung’s fitness band and Samsung Galaxy Gear 2, the second iteration of the smartwatch. Samsung Galaxy Gear Fit is priced at Rs 15,900 while Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 comes for Rs 21,900.\n\nBack to Samsung Galaxy S5. the new back comes with some sort of a dotted texture in a matte finish. The perforated finish is supposed to help you grip your phone better and also make it ‘shine’. The bandaid jokes circulating the internet prove that the phone’s design has definitely not managed to impress the masses.\n\nDon't Miss 2.1 K SHARES 485 SHARES 529 SHARES 293 SHARES\n\nAs expected, GS5 runs Android KitKat. The one thing different in the Indian Samsung Galaxy S5 is the processor. While Samsung globally launched the GS5 with a quad-core Qualcomm processor while the Indian variant still retians the Exynos octa-processor as last year. The 2 GB RAM and up to 64 GB expandable memory (16/32 GB internal memory variants)complete the internals. The phone comes with a 2800 mAh battery which promises longer talk-time.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5 comes with a 16 MP rear end camera. A new addition is the world’s fastest auto-focus with a time of just 0.3 seconds. Also, the true-tone HDR improve image clarity and brightness for a cleaner image. The Selective Focus feature is by far our favourite and lets users choose and highlight focus areas effectively blurring the background.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5 comes with many boast-worthy features. However, the pricing might be a slight turn-off. The phone doesn’t really seem worth an upgrade as other than the scanners, there’s hardly any additions. The design is one of the biggest let-downs. The camera might be better, but comparing the Samsung Galaxy S5 to the current flagships like LG G2, Sony Xperia Z2 and HTC One M8, the phone definitely lacks a punch. There’s the initial wow factor will it impress continue to impress the market even at a later date with the price? We think not!"", 'Samsung Galaxy S5, this year’s Samsung flagship has come to India a little earlier than expected.\nSamsung Galaxy S5 or the GS5 integrates some of the best hardware features and new software innovations in a smartphone.\nSamsung did not reveal the exact pricing of the device but instead mentioned that Samsung Galaxy S5 would be priced between Rs 51,000 and Rs 53,000 in India.\nAlong with Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung also launched the Samsung Galaxy Gear Fit, Samsung’s fitness band and Samsung Galaxy Gear 2, the second iteration of the smartwatch.\nSamsung Galaxy Gear Fit is priced at Rs 15,900 while Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 comes for Rs 21,900.']"

Both HTC and Samsung have announced their flagship devices, and in an attempt to be different HTC announced and launched their flagship in one day. As for those waiting for the Samsung Galaxy S5, well the wait will end on April 11th. However, for consumers in South Korea, the wait is just about over.\n\nThe three major carriers in South Korea have announced that they have moved up the launch date of the Galaxy S5 to Thursday March 27th 2014. There is an especially interesting reason behind this move too, and it has nothing to do with consumer anticipation. Instead it has to do with a ban that has been placed on the three major carriers. The ban placed by regulators prevents SK Telecom Co Ltd, LG UPlus and KT Corp from enrolling new customers or even replacing devices for existing customers for a spread out amount of time. That time totals 45 days, and is between March 13th and May 19th.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose 45 days are not consecutive, but will still hurt the sales of the Galaxy S5, and in Samsung's home country to make things worse. For example, SK Telecom has only one week between launch and next ban period to sell as many Galaxy S5s as possible. They have even lowered the amount of the device to below the launch price of the Galaxy S4. This problem for Samsung is in addition to the reviews and comments already made about the new flagship device. It has not received the warmest welcome so far, with polls showing more people are looking to get the HTC One M8, or just not buy a new flagship this year. This all is just salt in a wound to Samsung since the Galaxy S4 didn't sell as well as planned at launch. So the question is, are we watching the fall of Samsung from the number one Android OEM in the world? Or is this all just a hiccup for the company? We won't know for sure until numbers are released for quarterly earnings. However speculation is more than welcomed, so speak up down below or on our Google+ page."", ""The anticipation has been brutal to most, as we await to get our hands on the flagship devices we want.\nBoth HTC and Samsung have announced their flagship devices, and in an attempt to be different HTC announced and launched their flagship in one day.\nAs for those waiting for the Samsung Galaxy S5, well the wait will end on April 11th.\nThe three major carriers in South Korea have announced that they have moved up the launch date of the Galaxy S5 to Thursday March 27th 2014.\nAdvertisementThose 45 days are not consecutive, but will still hurt the sales of the Galaxy S5, and in Samsung's home country to make things worse.""]"

Just after one month of its global launch Samsung today has announced the hefty smartphone for the Indian market release.\n\nWell, important information first, Samsung Galaxy S5 will be available in India at a price of around Rs 51,000 to Rs 53,000 depending on the different variants. The pre-booking of the handset will start taking place from March 29th, 2014 and Galaxy S5 will be available in the Samsung India exclusive online retail store from April 11. But at the same time you can expect the handset on the other e-commerce sites in India as well.\n\nOne more thing, that the India version of Samsung Galaxy S5 is not powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, instead it comes with an Exynos 5420 octa-core variant. Moreover even more exciting is the inclusion of the new sensors in the device. The multi-purpose fingerprint sensor at the front and a heart-rate sensor at the rear below the camera are few things you would have hardly seen in current existing smartphone range in the market.\n\nRecommended: Samsung Galaxy S5 Experience App Offering S5-Like Features on Android Smartphones\n\nThe fingerprint sensor works for a number of features like security purpose, payments via PayPal, purchasing content with Samsung services and others. On the other hand, the heart-rate sensor at the back along with the company's S Health app might just emerge as an efficient tool for most athletes and health-conscious users. Although the fingerprint sensors have already been used by HTC and Apple before but those are bit different in terms of functionality and purpose.\n\nRecommended: Top 10 High-End Smartphones To Buy In India Under Rs 35,000\n\nSamsung Galaxy S5 - Specifications\n\nThe Galaxy S5 smartphone sports a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display offering a Full HD resolution and churns out the pixel density of 432 ppi.

There is a 2MP front-facing shooter which is enough for taking selfies and making video calls.\n\nFurther, Galaxy S5 will be offered in two variants depending on the internal storage capacity i.e. 16GB or 32GB. But you will also get a microSD card support via which the storage can be enhanced up to 128GB. It uses (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac) 2x2 MIMO, USB3.0, BT 4.0(LE) connectivity options.\n\nMoreover, the smartphone is IP67 certified which means that the Galaxy S5 is resistant to sweat, rain, liquids, sand and dust, so that your phone will protected from any activity or situation.\n\nMeanwhile, Samsung Galaxy S5 is powered by 2,800mAh battery also comes with a Power Saving Mode.\n\nYou can take a look at in-depth features here.\n\nBest Mobiles in India"", 'Samsung Galaxy S5 with Octa Core CPU Announced In India: Specs, Price, Release Date and More Mobile oi-VivekSouth Korean tech titan Samsung unveiled its flagship successor smartphone the Galaxy S5 this year at the International Mobile World Congress 2014 held back in February in Barcelona.\nWell, important information first, Samsung Galaxy S5 will be available in India at a price of around Rs 51,000 to Rs 53,000 depending on the different variants.\nThe pre-booking of the handset will start taking place from March 29th, 2014 and Galaxy S5 will be available in the Samsung India exclusive online retail store from April 11.\nFurther, Galaxy S5 will be offered in two variants depending on the internal storage capacity i.e.\nMeanwhile, Samsung Galaxy S5 is powered by 2,800mAh battery also comes with a Power Saving Mode.']"

52088,http://www.gforgames.com/gadgets/samsung-galaxy-s5-release-date-skt-selling-41465/,technology,"['Samsung Smartphones: Buying Guide Samsung has a myriad of Smartphones with different models which all have different versions and specs. For instance, you can get an A50 with a dual sim or single sim set up. It’s also available in two different ram sizes and capacities. While shopping by brand may narrow things down a little for you, shopping for the right Samsung smartphone can still be challenging. The following short guide should provide you with a cheat sheet. Not only can it be applied to Samsung phones, but you could use it as a reference for any other brand. Storage Capacity: How Much Can Your Phone Hold? The less capacity a phone has, the cheaper it’s likely to be. Most Samsung smartphones have expandable memories. Which basically means they have slots for micro-sd cards. The maximum is usually 512 GB. If you buy a Note 9 with 512 GB of onboard memory and purchase an SD card with 512 GB of capacity, you could establish an entire 1 TB of free space on your phone. I’ve never met anyone who needs that much space. Not even pornography addicts need that much space. But when you’re shopping for your phone, you need to analyze your own space requirements. Will you be loading the phone up with memes, videos, and music or are you just going to use it for day to day activities like chatting, using apps, making phone calls, etc. Always keep in mind that our needs change but luckily there’s cloud storage and micro SD cards to help us. So don’t waste your money on the 128 GB version of the phone, if you know you’re only going to use 10 GB.\n\nBattery Size: How Long Will Your Phone Last Between Charges? One of the most annoying things about smartphones is how many times you have to charge them during the day. Newer smartphones now come with larger batteries. If you know that you’re going to use your smartphone for a lot of gaming, video shooting, editing, and social media, you need to make sure that it can last a while before it prompts you to charge. This is important especially if you consider that most contemporary smartphones don’t come with user-removable batteries. What this means is that you can’t keep a spare battery which can be used to swap out a tired one. But you can get a power bank – which every smartphone user should have. The best way to determine potential phone usage and charge cycles is by looking at the battery’s capacity which is quantified and measured in milliamp-hours (mAh). The more milliamp Hours battery has, the longer it can last on a single charge. When you’re shopping for a Samsung smartphone, look for one with a capacity of 4000 mAh or better. It’s also important to find a phone with fast charging capabilities. It can take a while to fill-up a large battery – even longer if your phone doesn’t have fast charge. Ruggedness: Is Your Phone Water Resistant and Dust Proof? The first waterproof smartphone was the Sony Xperia Z. Today, every other phone has an IP68 rating. I guess people were tired of leaving their phones in rice. Personally, I’ve never had the need for a waterproof phone. As clumsy as I am, I’ve never dropped my phone in the toilet bowl, got it damp while camping or got pushed into a pool while it was one me. Maybe you face such problems. If you’re an outdoorsman then it might be important to invest in a rugged smartphone or at least a rugged cover. While the manufacturers have no problem in telling you how rugged and durable a phone may be, it’s still important to look at the IP code. The IP code, known as the International Protection Marking or the Ingress Protection Marking, quantifies and rates the amount of protection a casing, electronic device or enclosure has against dust, contact, water, and any other intrusions. The IP code is usually written as a string of four alphanumeric characters. Sometimes the IP marking can contain up to five characters. The first four characters are always mandatory. The first two characters are the IP indication (IP), followed by the first digit which is the solid particle protection(0-6), then second digit which marks the liquid ingress protection (0-9). The third digit marks mechanical impact persistence, is no longer used. The fourth character which is often denoted by a single letter is optional. It’s used to mark any additional protection.\n\nWhen you’re looking for a rugged or waterproof phone, you should use the above chart as a reference, especially if the only information the manufacturer has supplied you with is the IP rating/code. Frequently Asked Questions Is Samsung Coming Out With A New Phone in 2019? Samsung has already had a number of notable announcements and releases this year such as the Galaxy Note 10 (23 August 2019) and the S10 Plus (8 March 2019). But there’s still a lot to look forward to. In the coming months, Samsung is expected to release the Galaxy A60 (1 September 2019), Galaxy A90 (8 September 2019), Samsung Galaxy M60 (10 September 2019) and the highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy Fold (18 September 2019). Ultimately, the short answer is yes, Samsung is coming out with a new phone in 2019. They’re almost always coming out with new smartphones. Is Apple or Android Better? The answer depends on the type of user you are. Android is better for power users who want complete control of the way their phones work. Since Apple has a more limited range of smartphones than Samsung does, they can keep a tighter lid on their phones. Which means iPhones are a lot more secure and their operating systems and user interfaces tend to be less buggy. Even with its leaks in the past, Apple has still proven to be more secure than Android has been. If you want freedom, go with Android. If you want security and simplicity, go with an Apple Smartphone.', 'Samsung Smartphones: Buying Guide Samsung has a myriad of Smartphones with different models which all have different versions and specs.\nWhile shopping by brand may narrow things down a little for you, shopping for the right Samsung smartphone can still be challenging.\nMost Samsung smartphones have expandable memories.\nIn the coming months, Samsung is expected to release the Galaxy A60 (1 September 2019), Galaxy A90 (8 September 2019), Samsung Galaxy M60 (10 September 2019) and the highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy Fold (18 September 2019).\nUltimately, the short answer is yes, Samsung is coming out with a new phone in 2019.']"

52108,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/mobiles/First-impressions-Samsung-Galaxy-S5/articleshow/32776354.cms,technology,"[""NEW DELHI: Samsung is back with a new flagship Galaxy phone – Galaxy S5 . This is going to be the best, most powerful and most feature-rich Galaxy phone for around a year. While we will have the full review of the device in the coming weeks, we checked it out today at the launch event in New Delhi.Here is what we think of Galaxy S5 based on the brief time we spent with the device:The first thing you notice about Galaxy S5 is that the glossy plastic cover – much hated by users but much loved by Samsung – found on previous galaxy phones is finally gone. In its place, Samsung is using a back cover made of plastic that has a matte finish and that feels soft – almost like velvet – to the touch. The back cover also has a dotted pattern, but the dots are small.We feel the change in the design and material of back cover is for the good. Galaxy S5 does look and feel better than Galaxy S4. However, it still can't match iPhone 5S or Xperia Z1 in terms of looks.The other striking bit about Galaxy S5 is how light it feels despite packing in a large screen. With its rounded edges, it fits in the hand very well and due to its relatively low weight it is easy to hold and use it.The build quality of Galaxy S5 looks top notch, though there is still not much of metal in the body. Mostly it is plastic, but to give the device a premium look, Samsung is using a frame in metal finish that fits around the phone.The three buttons – two touch-sensitive buttons for Back and Menu options and one physical button for Home – sit below the screen. There are no onscreen buttons in Galaxy S5.Galaxy S5 has a dust and water proof design. The USB 3.0 port on the device is covered with a flap.The home button has a fingerprint scanner. In our use, we found it works well. A user has to swipe his finger on the Home button and if the fingerprints match, the phone unlocks. If the fingerprint scanner cannot unlock the phone, a user has the option of putting in password or PIN manually.The other sensor – heart rate sensor – is located under the primary camera and also works well. It integrates with S Health app on the device and measures heart rate when a user places his or her finger on top of the scanner.The Indian version of Galaxy S5 is powered by an Exynos processor. It has four A15 cores, which are meant for tasks that require high performance like gaming. These cores run at 1.9GHz. The processor also has four low-power A7 cores that run at 1.3GHz.In our brief use, we found the device to have very good performance. Opening apps or scrolling through app drawer is lag-free and smooth. But we will need to play games, multitask and try out some demanding apps before we can say more about the performance part of the device.The camera seems responsive and fast. We took some shots with and found the focus speed to be very fast. But this is another area that we will explore in detail in our full review.Overall, Galaxy S5 seems an impressive device. The design and how it feels in hand is better compared to Galaxy S4. The features look good and so does performance. We will have more to say about it the full review in the coming weeks but our first impression is that this is going to be one of the best smartphones you will be able to buy this year.Just like Galaxy S5, Gear Fit is surprisingly light. It also uses an all plastic – or rather rubber and plastic – design but on the wrist it looks really cool with its large 1.8-inch screen.The device can track the physical activity of a user. It can measure the steps taken in a day or distance covered in a jogging session.There is a heart rate sensor under the Gear Fit. But unlike Gear 2 , it doesn't have a camera. Gear Fit will work with select Galaxy devices, including Galaxy S5. It can also show notifications like calls or messages received on the phone."", 'NEW DELHI: Samsung is back with a new flagship Galaxy phone – Galaxy S5 .\nThis is going to be the best, most powerful and most feature-rich Galaxy phone for around a year.\nGalaxy S5 does look and feel better than Galaxy S4.\nBut this is another area that we will explore in detail in our full review.Overall, Galaxy S5 seems an impressive device.\nGear Fit will work with select Galaxy devices, including Galaxy S5.']"

This piece of news was originally reported by the Korea Times but unfortunately Samsung has since come forward and denied that those were indeed their plans.\n\nAdvertising\n\nAccording to Samsung’s co-CEO, JK Shin, “Samsung hasn’t agreed with SK Telecom for an early release of our GS5 to only SK Telecom customers.” This means that by the look of things, Samsung’s release of the Galaxy S5 could still be on track for a delayed launch in South Korea following a temporary ban by the government.\n\nFor those who haven’t been following the news, South Korea’s carriers were recently slapped with a temporary ban from selling the Galaxy S5 in their home country of South Korea. This 45-day ban was imposed by the government as a punishment to the carriers for not adhering to the rules. According to the rules, carriers are not allowed to subsidize phones below a specific price, a rule which they ignored.\n\nNaturally when they were caught red-handed, they were served with the 45-day ban. The report that claims the Galaxy S5 could go on sale earlier was speculated so that SK Telecom could circumvent the ban, at least for a while, but it looks like that will not be happening. This will not doubt set Samsung back but given the popularity of the Galaxy S5, perhaps in the end it might not matter.\n\nFiled in .

A company source told Tech2 that while the launch wold take place today, it's unlikely that the phone will go on sale that day.\n\nWhat's possible is that Samsung will kick-off pre-orders for the S5, along with some introductory discounts, and operator and services tie-ups specific to India.\n\nThe company is already bundling in a bunch of apps with the phone. As was announced during the Samsung Unpacked 5 event last month, the company will start selling the phone from April 11, and this has been confirmed by the pricing details that have been released for the US.\n\nAs of now, there's no word on whether Samsung will be also launching the Gear 2, Gear 2 Neo, Gear Fit and the S Band wearables along side the new flagship.\n\nWe know nearly everything there is to know about the Galaxy S5, without seeing the phone first hand. Samsung is betting big on the fitness feature and the heart rate monitor on the phone will get a lot of airtime in the promotions. It's the first phone to feature such a dedicated sensor. Other key features include a 16 MP camera, 2.5GHz Snapdragon 800 SoC with 2GB of RAM and a new feature called the Ultra Power Saving mode, which claims to give you a 24-hour battery even when your phone shows the battery capacity at 10 percent.\n\nIn addition, Samsung has also made the S5 waterproof, which has seemingly added a bit of bulk to the handset, forcing the bezels around the display to be slightly bigger than one would expect. Another USP is the fingerprint scanner on the home button, which will let you sign in to many services with just a swipe. We are yet to see how this works in real-world usage and whether it can go toe-to-toe with the iPhone fingerprint scanner.\n\nIn terms of design, you will not see much difference between the departing flagship the Galaxy S4 and the S5. While they both have a very similar general profile, the biggest and most noticeable change is on the back, where a dimpled polycarbonate exterior takes the place of the glossy panel on the previous flagship."", ""tech2 News StaffSamsung is holding an event in Delhi today to launch the latest flagship Galaxy S5 in India.\nA company source told Tech2 that while the launch wold take place today, it's unlikely that the phone will go on sale that day.\nWhat's possible is that Samsung will kick-off pre-orders for the S5, along with some introductory discounts, and operator and services tie-ups specific to India.\nWe know nearly everything there is to know about the Galaxy S5, without seeing the phone first hand.\nIn terms of design, you will not see much difference between the departing flagship the Galaxy S4 and the S5.""]"

The company\'s Galaxy S5 Active has just leaked.\n\nSamsung has a few weeks to go before it launches its new flagship Galaxy S5 smartphone on April 11 during a worldwide simultaneous launch. The smartphone is widely expected to be one of few to compete with Apple\'s iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 expected in the fall. Samsung has given the new smartphone some notable upgrades over its Galaxy S4 predecessor. The device uses a larger 5.1-inch 1080p Full HD display, a faster quad-core processor, upgraded camera and features, and it is also IP67 certified, which makes it both waterproof and dust-resistant.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 is actually Samsung\'s second waterproof and dust-resistant smartphone. The company released a Galaxy S4 variant last summer under the name Galaxy S4 Active. The smartphone had a similar design and Full HD display all wrapped up in a device that could deal with harsher elements like water and dust. It appeared that Samsung wouldn\'t follow up with a Galaxy S5 Active, as the Galaxy S5 now ships standard with an IP67 certification. It appears Samsung still has plans to ship a Galaxy S5 Active. The company\'s Galaxy S5 Zoom camera-centric smartphone just leaked, and now it\'s the Galaxy S5 Active\'s turn.\n\nA new post from the always reliable @evleaks, a Samsung smartphone with model# SM-G870X is going to officially be called the Galaxy S5 Active. The tipster also says that the smartphone will make its way to AT&T and Sprint and also says it will launch with other carriers too.\n\nSamsung surely isn\'t pleased that details regarding its Galaxy S5 variants are leaking online ahead of the release of the Galaxy S5.\n\nIt\'s not necessarily a surprise to see Samsung following the same recipe it used for its Galaxy S4 and its spin-off smartphones. There hasn\'t been any leak on what we can expect to see in the Galaxy S5 Active, especially now that Galaxy S5 users will already be spoiled with this feature when the S5 Active launches. We\'ll have to wait and see how Samsung markets the Galaxy S5 Active and what its defining feature to earn ""Active"" status.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The Galaxy Mega was announced last year and consisted of two models; a 5.8-inch device and a 6.3-inch smartphone. Sprint and AT&T both carried the Galaxy Mega 6.3 and a new report claims the carriers will also offer the second-generation Galaxy Mega smartphones.\n\nSamMobile reports that Samsung's in-house Exynos processor will power the upcoming Galaxy Mega devices, and likely the same hexa-core model found in the company's recently introduced Galaxy Note 3 Neo. The processor would be a step up from the processor currently used in the Galaxy Mega 6.3. The site also believes the tablet-sized smartphone will run Android 4.4.2 and Samsung's new TouchWiz user interface.\n\nThe Galaxy Mega line has been seen as an inexpensive way for users to try out a Samsung smartphone with a display that falls into the company's more premium Galaxy Note phablet territory. It's unclear if Samsung will use the faux-leather rear case it currently uses on the Galaxy Note 3 and some of its tablets, or possibly the Galaxy S5's dimpled rear case.\n\nThe site doesn't list when we might possibly see the new Galaxy Mega launched, but if we use last year's introduction as a possible launch date, that would happen to fall on April 11, which is also the same day Samsung will launch the Galaxy S5 during a worldwide simultaneous launch. It's pretty safe to assume that the Galaxy Mega announcement won't be coming on April 11.\n\nWhenever it comes to unannounced Samsung devices, it's especially always worth remembering to take these reports with a huge grain of salt. It certainly seems plausible that this is in Samsung's plan, as we're already seeing some of the same moves it made last year with devices and is reportedly going to introduce a Galaxy S5 Active and Galaxy S5 Zoom and presumable a Galaxy S5 Mini. We'll keep you updated.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
