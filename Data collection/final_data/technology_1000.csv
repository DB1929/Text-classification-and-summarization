Titanfall comes to Xbox One and PC tomorrow, March 11, in North America, but should you buy the game or hold off? To help you out, we\'ve rounded up what the critics are saying about the new IP from Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment.\n\nSomething to consider: Titanfall is an online-only title and the integrity of the battlefield could change from what it was when reviewers critiqued the game. Should anything go wrong tomorrow, we will of course make this known. Titanfall is also coming to Xbox 360 on March 25 courtesy of Bluepoint Games. We\'ll have a review roundup for that version of the game when critics have a chance to finally play it.\n\nRight now, Titanfall boasts an 87 metascore on GameSpot sister site Metacritic. That number only includes Xbox One scores.\n\n""Titanfall is the rare game that feels like it came out on top of the few compromises Respawn has had to make. Sliding the spectacle and holy shit moments of an epic campaign among bold, fast multiplayer that steals unlikely elements, Respawn has made them shine like they belonged there all along. Titanfall may not mark the same kind of sea change that Modern Warfare started but the pieces are all there in a game that delivers on its potential as the next big thing."" [Full review]\n\n""When it\'s not all a clash of the you-know-whats, when there\'s a volatile mix of scampering boots and earth-rattling bipeds on the battlefield, Titanfall truly excels. It subsists on imbalance and the race to bear big arms first. It feeds on the fallout that results when equality means the other guy gets a robot too. Titanfall isn\'t tuned to perfection for everyone yet, but it starts as a smart, swift, and startling movement in well-traveled space."" [Full review]\n\n""A consummate multiplayer shooter, Titanfall has little to offer those interested in story--but for everyone else, it\'s a must-play."" [Full review]\n\n""Titanfall lives up to all the expectations established when it was first revealed, in a way that so few games are able ever to accomplish, and represents nothing short of first-person shooter multiplayer taken to new heights."" [Full review]\n\n""The overarching experience of playing Titanfall is one of rejuvenation and reinvigoration. The sprint speed, the arsenal, the game modes, and more are all firmly derived from some of the most successful online shooters of recent years. But by reinventing the way you move, Titanfall reinvents what it feels like to play a competitive shooter. The high-flying action intertwines beautifully with the brutish, tactical titan battles, creating battlefields that crackle with possibility. Titanfall is a leap forward for shooters, a game that combines the vibrant and new with the tried and true to create something special."" [Full review]\n\n""The total lack of single-player capability is at odds with most other FPS games. If the likes of Call of Duty or Halo can provide both single- and multiplayer modes for the same price tag, it doesn\'t seem right that Titanfall can\'t. While Respawn and EA are cutting down on the price of development by foregoing single-player, those savings aren\'t being passed on to gamers, which is the concerning part of the game. At the very least, including an offline AI bot mode would seem to be a no-brainer, but it\'s not here for whatever reason. So, while Titanfall delivers amazing next-generation action, its next-generation business plan isn\'t nearly as impressive."" [Full review]\n\n""But for all its strengths, its reliance on tried and true modes and rigid maps stops Titanfall achieving its full potential. Capture the Flag, Attrition, and Domination are the best gametypes, but none of them show the same invention that\'s occurring elsewhere in the title, leading to a feeling of natural fatigue. Some of the maps also feel too similar to each other, lacking in distinction, and campaign multiplayer is sadly non-dynamic. A very good first installment then, but the best is yet to come."" [Full review]\n\n""For a multiplayer-only game, Titanfall should have some amazing options and ways to play. But it doesn\'t. It has a very healthy number of maps (15), but the lack of interesting new modes will make you feel shortchanged for not getting a single-player campaign. Hell, even shooters like Halo 2 from two console generations ago offer more in the multiplayer-options department. A lot more. It all feels like a temporary stop for Respawn on the way to Titanfall 2. But what is there is so incredible, assuming you\'re already into such games. (Don\'t like shooting things? Nothing here will change your mind.) After almost 20 hours of playtime, my hands are cramped from gripping the controller so tightly--and I\'m going back for more.""

950,http://gamerant.com/titanfall-live-action-show-movie-trailer/,technology,"['Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\n[HTML2]\n\nOne of the most-anticipated next-generation titles currently in development, Titanfall is set for release in less than 24 hours (from the time of this writing). Created by the minds that set a new benchmark for online multiplayer in the Call of Duty franchise, the blockbuster title from Respawn Entertainment is already being celebrated as a major step forward for competitive gameplay - combining fast-moving parkour with customizable mechs, as well as tried-and-true first person shooting.\n\nWhile Titanfall does not feature a traditional story campaign, players will still be immersed in the game\'s larger universe through brief bits of narrative that have been woven into online matches. Story-driven gamers could, likely, be underwhelmed, but the two online story branches are still a welcome glimpse at an intriguing world - one that Respawn hopes to expand through a recently announced live-action component.\n\nPartnering with Playfight, the VFX company best known for their work on Call of Duty: Operation Kingfish and Rocket Jump\'s Video Game High School, the developer is promising an expansion of the Titanfall story that takes chaotic mech vs. pilot battles and makes them a reality in live-action.\n\nAccording to a statement attributed to Respawn Entertainment\'s Dusty Welch:\n\nTitanfall is set in a rich near future universe with visceral, epic battles with Pilots and their Titan companions. We wanted to partner with Playfight, who has a history of delivering movies that meld gameplay, live action and stellar CG into truly entertaining media, for Titanfall. What this collaboration brings is yet to unfold...""\n\nPlayfight appears equally enthusiastic about the partnership, considering their studio has ""already begun laying the foundation for the creation of original content within the vast expanse of the Titanfall universe.""\n\nWhat exactly the partnership means is, at this point, anyone\'s guess - though we\'ll get a much better idea when the project\'s teaser trailer launches alongside the Titanfall game. Playfight has established a website for the collaboration at YourTitanIsReady.com - currently, the page includes a countdown clock that, when it hits zero (at 10pm EST), will unlock the promised teaser video.\n\nThere\'s no question that the Titanfall universe could be a great foundation for a live-action movie adaptation or TV series; that said, considering that Respawn has partnered with Playfight, it\'s much more likely that the venture will result in a smaller scale web series or simply live-action clips for inclusion in future DLC. Playfight is a quality VFX studio with several high profile properties under their belt but it\'s unlikely they have the man power for a full-on Hollywood-style Titanfall production - even if the teaser site promises a ""live action epic.""\n\nStill, given that Respawn mastered the cinematic approach we\'ve come to expect from the Call of Duty series, fans should expect the live-action Titanfall project to offer an immersive and high-quality experience (with great visuals).\n\n-\n\nThat said, not everyone is sitting around waiting for the teaser, or counting the hours until midnight game releases, since some players already have Titanfall in their hands - and are hard at work ranking-up ahead of the official launch.\n\n[HTML1]\n\nAfter Respawn and Microsoft promised not to ban or punish players who got ahold of the game early, lucky Titanfall fans have begun leveling their pilots and titans. A few players have even regenerated their characters (the equivalent of ""prestige"" in Call of Duty) - resetting leveling progress in exchange for G (insert number) designation on their player profile. Titanfall currently supports 10 generations - with a G10 designation being the ultimate honor.\n\nThese fortunate gamers might have a head start but many others are fully prepared for Titanfall tomorrow - unless you\'re playing on Xbox 360 (and have another two weeks to wait).\n\n________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________\n\nTitanfall releases March 11, 2014 for the PC and Xbox One, and March 25th for the Xbox 360.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @benkendrick.\n\nSources: YourTitanIsReady.com & VG24/7\n\nShare Tweet Email Copy Link Copied', 'Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied[HTML2]One of the most-anticipated next-generation titles currently in development, Titanfall is set for release in less than 24 hours (from the time of this writing).\nWhat this collaboration brings is yet to unfold...""Playfight appears equally enthusiastic about the partnership, considering their studio has ""already begun laying the foundation for the creation of original content within the vast expanse of the Titanfall universe.""\nWhat exactly the partnership means is, at this point, anyone\'s guess - though we\'ll get a much better idea when the project\'s teaser trailer launches alongside the Titanfall game.\nStill, given that Respawn mastered the cinematic approach we\'ve come to expect from the Call of Duty series, fans should expect the live-action Titanfall project to offer an immersive and high-quality experience (with great visuals).\n________________________________________________________________________________________________Titanfall releases March 11, 2014 for the PC and Xbox One, and March 25th for the Xbox 360.']"
951,http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/132812-Titanfall-Fans-In-South-Africa-Ask-EA-To-Let-Them-Play,technology,"['Gamers in South Africa are calling on Respawn and EA to release Titanfall in their country, saying that if they want to play with a bad ping, they should have the option to do so.\n\nUpdate: Build Our Titans ZA has confirmed that even though Titanfall isn\'t being released in South Africa, South Africans can still play it by getting a non-region-locked key for the game and redeeming it through Origin. Both Kinguin.net and Evopoints.co.za are reportedly offering them.\n\n""Although this is a work around it is a VERY simple one,"" the group wrote on the Build Our Titans ZA Facebook page. ""We would suggest you take all that pent up frustration over the last couple of days and unleash it on some unsuspecting EU pilots!""\n\nIt added that it will continue to push EA and Respawn to disclose the real reasons for the release cancellation, but for all practical purposes considers the problem solved. ""Our goal was to give ZA pilots the CHOICE to play Titanfall,"" it continued. ""It seems that choice is available (through no actions of our own) and every ZA pilot who wants to play the game now, can do so.""\n\nOriginal Story:\n\nSouth African gamers received a nasty surprise last week when Electronic Arts announced at the last minute that Titanfall would not be released in their country. The problem, according to a message on Origin, is simply one of performance: Titanfall relies on Microsoft Azure servers and there are none close enough to South Africa to provide a decent ping and thus a proper experience. Respawn founder Vince Zampella confirmed the cancellation on Twitter, writing that he doesn\'t want to ""sell you something that isn\'t great.""\n\nIt would seem that quite a number of gamers in South Africa would appreciate the opportunity to buy something that isn\'t great, however. A petition launched shortly after the announcement by a group calling itself Build Our Titans ZA has already attracted nearly 1500 signatures, not an enormous number in and of itself but pretty impressive considering that it\'s coming from such a small slice of the gamer pie.\n\nThe petition notes the lack of Azure servers in South Africa but says the game ran well and ""was still amazing even at the latency disadvantage,"" which left the nation\'s players dealing with pings of 180 ms or greater when connected to European servers. And while that number approaches the sort of lag you\'d associate with a dialup connection, the petition says the final choice should be left up to the players.\n\n""We have been putting up with bad latencies to EU and US for many years in order to enjoy our favourite titles in a multiplayer environment. Please don\'t take away what might be one of the best FPS titles of the decade, on the pretense that we would not enjoy the experience with a higher latency,"" the petition states. ""We humbly petition Electronic Arts and Respawn Entertainment to make the game available to South Africans on release date, and give us the CHOICE to play Titanfall.""\n\nThe petition\'s authors acknowledged that while the response to the game among South Africans was ""almost universally positive,"" its relatively poor performance might be enough to make Electronic Arts shy away, especially after the messes of SimCity and Battlefield 4. There\'s also reportedly speculation that potential legal complaints based on the country\'s consumer protection laws may have spurred the last-minute cancellation.\n\n""I think South Africa is too small a gaming market for EA and Respawn to bother with. Given EA\'s recent issues with releasing unpolished games (or games with a bad online experiences) they might have decided to avoid South Africa altogether given the fact that our latency to EU servers was 200+,"" a Build Our Titans ZA rep said. ""If you throw in any potential legal troubles that might stem from that experience then their decision might make sense. Compare this to Australia and India that have large thriving gaming communities... it wouldn\'t make sense to pull out from these territories as you\'re just throwing away revenue.""\n\nAustralia, like South Africa, has no native Azure servers, forcing players there to rely on servers located in Singapore. Even so, the Titanfall launch in that country is proceeding on schedule.\n\nEA said in response to inquiries that it has nothing more to say on the matter than the statement it released last week. ""After conducting recent online tests for Titanfall, we found that the performance rates in South Africa were not as high as we need to guarantee a great experience, so we have decided not to release Titanfall there at this time,"" it said. ""We understand this is a disappointment for local fans and will keep them posted on any future plans regarding the release of Titanfall in South Africa.""\n\nSource: Change.org', 'Update: Build Our Titans ZA has confirmed that even though Titanfall isn\'t being released in South Africa, South Africans can still play it by getting a non-region-locked key for the game and redeeming it through Origin.\nIt would seem that quite a number of gamers in South Africa would appreciate the opportunity to buy something that isn\'t great, however.\n""I think South Africa is too small a gaming market for EA and Respawn to bother with.\nAustralia, like South Africa, has no native Azure servers, forcing players there to rely on servers located in Singapore.\n""We understand this is a disappointment for local fans and will keep them posted on any future plans regarding the release of Titanfall in South Africa.""']"

956,http://hothardware.com/News/Xbox-One-May-Still-Get-1080p-Titanfall-In-PostRelease-Patch-/,technology,"['\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectations are high for the imminent launch of Titanfall. The game is a major test for Microsoft\'s Xbox One -- its one of the biggest exclusive projects, its beta was well-reviewed, and gamers have been looking for a game that would clarify just what the Xbox One is capable of when compared against the PlayStation 4. The game\'s beta ran an odd resolution -- 1408x792 -- but according to an interview with Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker, an upgrade could still be in the cards.Digital Foundry spoke to Baker, who said: "" One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we\'re going to use, so we\'re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don\'t have to have this larger render target. We\'re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We\'re trying to optimise... we don\'t want to give up anything for higher res.""This is passing odd, for several reasons. It\'s not surprising that the Titanfall team would opt to dump multi-sampled antialiasing in exchange for higher resolutions; MSAA\'s impact on GPU performance is well known. What\'s a little more unusual is that the developer would identify FXAA as the difference between running at 900p and 1080p in the final product.Here\'s the thing to understand about FXAA / MLAA -- it\'s not actually antialiasing at all. In conventional antialiasing, the GPU takes multiple sub-pixel samples of a point in space, then combines that data to create a smoother (albeit somewhat blurrier) line. This requires sub-pixel precision and it\'s computationally expensive. FXAA, in contrast, uses pixel-level precision to identify discontinuities (jaggies) in frame buffer data and then re-draw the image for better visual quality.The impact of FXAA / MLAA on performance is supposed to be modest. That\'s the point. In the graph above (drawn from Intel\'s original presentation on the topic), the purple and red lines are the two to pay attention to. As scene complexity increases, the cost of FXAA stays consistent -- just above the cost of rendering a scene with no AA at all.The jump from 1600x900 to 1920x1080 isn\'t small -- that\'s a 44% leap in total number of pixels, and it\'s downright odd that the performance gap between FXAA and no antialiasing whatsoever might require the Titanfall team to drop the resolution so drastically. But there\'s a potential answer to this question that dovetails with what we\'ve heard from other sources -- the Xbox One\' s EDRAM cache might be a little too small.A smaller-than-ideal cache wouldn\'t completely cripple a game, but it could create exactly the kinds of problems we\'ve seen with launch titles. When the cache isn\'t big enough for everything to fit in comfortably, developers have to get creative about ensuring that data is loaded and evicted at precisely the right moment. Suddenly, it\'s imperative that algorithms be optimized for size, textures need excellent compression, and the game needs to be very, very stingy when it comes to loading only necessary information into cache. Information that gets evicted needs to stay evicted; information that\'s critical to the game\'s operation needs to take up as little room as possible.If this is true, it suggests that 1080p isn\'t impossible on the Xbox One, but we may never see many titles take advantage of it. If it requires significant optimization to hit that level while 720p is readily available, the majority of game studios will likely settle for the 720p experience.', ""Expectations are high for the imminent launch of Titanfall.\nThe target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA.\nIt's not surprising that the Titanfall team would opt to dump multi-sampled antialiasing in exchange for higher resolutions; MSAA's impact on GPU performance is well known.\nSuddenly, it's imperative that algorithms be optimized for size, textures need excellent compression, and the game needs to be very, very stingy when it comes to loading only necessary information into cache.\nIf it requires significant optimization to hit that level while 720p is readily available, the majority of game studios will likely settle for the 720p experience.""]"

That doesn\'t mean it won\'t be a source of embarrassment for the other two companies.

That’s the same as the beta test that EA and developer Respawn ran last month. It’s also a bit more than a hundred lines of resolution short of the 900p that developer Respawn said it was targeting. Now, with Titanfall going live tomorrow for Xbox One and PC (and Xbox 360 later this month), Respawn is still looking to improve its visuals.\n\nTitanfall isn’t ugly on Xbox One. Our review is pretty happy with its visuals, but things can always look better. Respawn engineer Richard Baker told Digital Foundry that his team is still experimenting, and that a higher resolution could come in a future update.\n\n“The target is either 1080p [without anti-aliasing] or 900p with FXAA,” Baker said. FXAA stands for fast approximate anti-aliasing, which is much better at smoothing edges than standard anti-aliasing. These improvements might make for a slight overall visual improvement even if the difference is imperceptible to most people.\n\n“We don’t want to give up anything [to achieve a] higher resolution,” said Baker. “So far, we’re not 100 percent happy with any of the options, and we’re still working on it.”\n\nDon’t expect the update any time soon. When you pick up Titanfall on day one, it’s going to run at 792p on Xbox One.\n\n“We’re still looking at [an update] for post day one,” he said. “We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.”\n\nBaker also said that Respawn is still working to optimize Titanfall so that it runs at 60 frames per second at all times. It is currently at 60 most of the time with occasional dips that cause the game to stutter.\n\n“Ideally, it would have been a rock-solid 60 [fps] all the time when we shipped, but obviously when there’s big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects — we’re still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time.”', 'It’s also a bit more than a hundred lines of resolution short of the 900p that developer Respawn said it was targeting.\nNow, with Titanfall going live tomorrow for Xbox One and PC (and Xbox 360 later this month), Respawn is still looking to improve its visuals.\n“We don’t want to give up anything [to achieve a] higher resolution,” said Baker.\nWhen you pick up Titanfall on day one, it’s going to run at 792p on Xbox One.\n“We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.”Baker also said that Respawn is still working to optimize Titanfall so that it runs at 60 frames per second at all times.']"

The origins of this can certainly be traced back to before the release of its own Xbox One and the Playstation 4; they’ve essentially been playing catch-up ever since, making a series of staggering marketing errors when the console was originally unveiled.\n\nMicrosoft playing catch-up\n\nSince then, the Playstation 4 has consistently outsold the Xbox One all over the world, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) has felt something of a backlash from gamers for some of their initial proposals. Already the price of the Xbox One has been cut in an attempt to cut the sales gap with Sony’s console, and although Microsoft is publicly putting the usual PR spin on the way that the Xbox One has been performing, the reality is that Sony is dominating this generation thus far.\n\nHowever, one area in which Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) can be commended is with regard to the titles that they’ve got to market. The Xbox One launch line-up was probably better than the PS4, and much is expected of the hotly anticipated Titanfall, which will release tomorrow in North America, and a couple of days later in most other territories, as an Xbox exclusive.\n\nIt seems though that Titanfall is to be plagued by another criticism that Microsoft has had to fend off with regard to the Xbox One. The Playstation 4 clearly delivers the more powerful gaming package, and though Microsoft has dismissed the difference between the two and developers are capable of producing similar standard products for both consoles, there is still no denying that Sony’s machine has higher capabilities.\n\nThis is reflected in the fact that it’s been reported today that Titanfall will be yet another Xbox One title that won’t ship in 1080p resolution. It has been confirmed by the developers of the title that Titanfall will launch in 792p, although Respawn Entertainment is apparently intending to patch the game up to a higher resolution once it has been released.\n\nThere is a lot of debate regarding this issue, with various claims being thrown around about the practical effects of high and low framerate and resolutions. It is often asserted, for example, that there is little difference between playing a game in 720p and 1080p on a high-definition television, but from my experience I would have to emphatically disagree.\n\nFull HD yet to come to fruition\n\nWhat is certain is that console gamers, and the wider general public, would surely be expecting media to be rendered in 1080p by now. It’s roughly ten years since HD became a mainstream technology, with television manufacturers of the time encouraging us to rush out and buy ‘full HD’ sets. Yet a decade on, 1080p resolution is still not standard. You have to wonder why Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) bothered to include 4K capabilities with this console; there doesn’t seem to be the remotest chance that it will deliver such a resolution, it can’t even handle full HD at the moment.\n\nRegardless of the debate on what practical difference such screen resolutions make, the continual inability of the Xbox One to deliver 1080p gaming, something that was pretty much the norm with the PS3, does not reflect well on Microsoft’s new console. The company itself can dismiss such concerns, but the gaming community has voted with its feet, and is not likely to change its mind based on the evidence we’ve seen from this console generation thus far.', 'Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) has been behind the eight ball in the next gen console battle for quite some time.\nMicrosoft playing catch-upSince then, the Playstation 4 has consistently outsold the Xbox One all over the world, as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) has felt something of a backlash from gamers for some of their initial proposals.\nHowever, one area in which Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MFST) can be commended is with regard to the titles that they’ve got to market.\nIt seems though that Titanfall is to be plagued by another criticism that Microsoft has had to fend off with regard to the Xbox One.\nThis is reflected in the fact that it’s been reported today that Titanfall will be yet another Xbox One title that won’t ship in 1080p resolution.']"

Players control ""pilots,"" who can either engage with each other directly or take command of titans, giant robots that can be called in from the sky. Pilots are more agile, but titans are more powerful.\n\nPlayers can opt for a number of game modes, including Attrition, which is a team deathmatch-style mode focused on garnering as many kills as possible; Last Titan Standing, wherein all players start in titans and have a single life; and the classic Capture the Flag mode.\n\nLaunch Events\n\nTitanfall will be available Tuesday for Xbox One and PC. It will debut on Xbox 360 on March 25.\n\nMicrosoft is planning a series of major launch events for the game Monday evening at retail outlets across North America. The company is giving away more than US$2,000 worth of prizes at each store\'s launch event, starting at 9 p.m. Prizes to be handed out include Xbox One bundles prepackaged with the game, controllers, media controllers, and subscriptions to Xbox Live -- the Xbox multiplayer service that is required to play Titanfall.\n\nFans also will have the chance to try out the game at demo stations before it goes on sale at midnight. Xbox will host a live stream with walkthroughs of new maps and developer Respawn Entertainment answering fan questions and discussing the future of Titanfall.\n\nImportant Game\n\nTitanfall, which has received early acclaim from critics, is viewed as an important game for Microsoft. The company\'s Xbox One system has languished in comparison to Sony\'s PlayStation 4, with sales of the latter outpacing the Microsoft console by two-to-one in January, according to NPD data.\n\nSony sold more than 6 million units by March 2, while Microsoft shipped 3.9 million Xbox One consoles to retailers by the end of last year, according to company figures.\n\n""I think it will give those that have not purchased an Xbox One or had delayed in purchasing it another reason to go out and actually upgrade and buy one,"" Susan Schreiner, an analyst at C4 Trends, told TechNewsWorld. ""Right now, the PlayStation has a substantial lead. I would say Titanfall has the possibility of narrowing the gap.""\n\nTitanfall comes with a high pedigree as it was developed by much of the same team behind Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, a game that revolutionized online multiplayer gaming in 2007.\n\nMicrosoft is bundling Titanfall with the console in a package deal that retails at $500 -- essentially giving the game away for free, as the console itself retails at that price point. The title also may drive subscriptions to Xbox Live. The premium version of the multiplayer service is required to play Titanfall, which is pegged as an ""always-online"" game.\n\nOnline Problems\n\nThe online-only aspect of Titanfall already has caused some problems, with publisher Electronic Arts canceling this week\'s planned launch in South Africa after testing showed online play performance was not quite at an acceptable level.\n\nRespawn Entertainment will look further into the issues after the game\'s release, cofounder Vince Zampella said. Many major online multiplayer games have had issues with meeting demand at launch, including last year\'s Grand Theft Auto V and Battlefield 4, and it\'s unclear whether Titanfall\'s launch will take off without such hitches.\n\n""As with absolutely any online-driven gaming experience, there\'s a minimal expectation of some issues -- we can never tell just how significant until the service is live in the wild,"" Steve Bailey, senior games analyst at IHS Technology, told TechNewsWorld.\n\n""This is a sizeable learning curve for EA, in terms of both console gaming and leveraging new hardware (Xbox One),"" he said. ""However, if we see a repeat of the issues that dogged Battlefield 4, it would compound the hit that EA\'s reputation will suffer as a result.

Only few moments ago Respawn Entertainment\'s lead engineer confirmed that Titanfall on Xbox One ships at 792p. It\'s a bit disappointing figure because recently concluded open beta of Titanfall ran at 792p only, so we expected something close to 900p for the final build.\n\nAccording to reports coming out from Giant Bomb\'s Jeff Gerstmann, Titanfall on Xbox One struggles with frame-rate figure despite running at a low resolution of 792p.\n\nJeff Gerstmann wrote in his pre-review of Titanfall: ""The frame rate in Titanfall is uneven on the Xbox One and though it\'s usually fine, it can get downright nasty in specific situations.""\n\n""In one Last Titan Standing match–where every player spawns in a robot suit–several players crammed their mechs into a tight area and began duking it out, and the frame rate dived down to what must have been single digits per second. Even out in wider areas, the game feels a little hitchy from time to time, and there\'s noticeable tearing throughout.""\n\nThis was the same issue experienced by players in Titanfall open beta, so it seems like Respawn Entertainment was unable to fix it before launch.\n\nIf Respawn Entertainment was not able to hit the sweet 60 FPS mark with 792 resolution, why didn\'t they go for 720p resolution (at which Xbox 360 is able to run games like CoD without any issues related to frame-rate)\n\nIs there any pressure from Microsoft to up the resolution of Titanfall for Xbox One? This indeed looks like the case because few months ago, NeoGaf insider CBOAT leaked that Respawn wants Titanfall to run at 720p on Xbox One for smooth gameplay experience. Titanfall is powered by a decade old Source Engine so expecting a next-gen graphics/visuals would be a harsh thing.\n\nWe are still putting this into our rumor category, but issues related to Titanfall\'s frame-rate mentioned above by Jeff Gerstmann is widespread and the conclusion derived from it can\'t be ignored.\n\nTell us in the comment section below what you guys think?\n\nIn another news, Respawn Entertainment confirmed that development team is working to increase the Titanfall resolution to 1080p or 900p but changes won\'t arrive anytime soon.

After months of anticipation, Titanfall will soon be out on Microsoft\'s new console and PC, and most of the reviews are in.*\n\nIt\'s the game that has been carrying by far the highest expectations for Xbox One, as it\'s seen as the first major release on the console that can supplement the relative lack of games available for the system. You may have played the beta, you might have only watched, and it\'s possible you avoided hearing much about it altogether. If you\'ve been listening to the feedback, it might not be surprising that the reviews are very positive across the board.\n\nThe uniformity in response to a big-budget release is almost unsettling-is it the expectations created by the hype, or is Titanfall genuinely just that good? Read the review excerpts below (and the full versions at the links) to make a determination for yourself.\n\n*Several outlets are holding their reviews until the game is played extensively with the public and they can better appraise the game.\n\nPolygon, 9/10: ""Titanfall is the rare game that feels like it came out on top of the few compromises Respawn has had to make. Sliding the spectacle and holy shit moments of an epic campaign among bold, fast multiplayer that steals unlikely elements, Respawn has made them shine like they belonged there all along. Titanfall may not mark the same kind of sea change that Modern Warfare started but the pieces are all there in a game that delivers on its potential as the next big thing...\n\n...If there are complaints to be had, I\'d point to performance. Titanfall sits at 60 frames per second most of the time, but when three or four Titans are on the screen at once, firing rockets and arc blasts, things take a dive. It\'s never not playable, but it is noticeable.\n\nI also wanted more ""stuff""--more options and more customization. For starters, Titanfall is begging for a spectator mode and more complex broadcasting options that have appeared in games like the Battlefield series. I also would have liked to see visual customization for Titans.""\n\nCVG, 9/10: ""Lastly, the game\'s always-online requirements are a little too restrictive: it\'s daft that you can\'t even play the tutorial if the servers are down.\n\nThough in truth, there\'s little reason to. It says much about Titanfall that its training courses are all but irrelevant: you\'ll pick up the controller and pretty much instinctively know how to play the game. Some will see that as a bad thing, and it\'s true that Vince Zampella, Jason West and co haven\'t strayed far from what they know. As debuts go, this is pretty safe territory, and not a Titan-sized stride forward.\n\nYet by making some smart tweaks to established design standards, Respawn\'s terrific shooter is a jet-powered hop ahead of its rivals.""\n\nGames Radar 4/5: ""When you mix together all of these unique elements, you\'re left with gameplay that\'s relentlessly cool. You\'ll run along a wall like a boss, hitch a ride on the back of an allied titan, and then shoot at stupid minions as the metal monster runs around the map; or you\'ll call down a titan of your own and get it to follow you as you sneak through buildings, picking off enemy pilots that are jumping along rooftops...\n\n...Titanfall blends familiar concepts with innovative ideas in remarkable ways, leading to a nearly nonstop supply of awesome moments. But for as fun as it is, you\'ll likely find yourself wishing Respawn was more ambitious when it comes to game modes, since there\'s a good chance you\'ve captured enough flags for one lifetime.""\n\nJoystiq 4.5/5: When it\'s not all a clash of the you-know-whats, when there\'s a volatile mix of scampering boots and earth-rattling bipeds on the battlefield, Titanfall truly excels. It subsists on imbalance and the race to bear big arms first. It feeds on the fallout that results when equality means the other guy gets a robot too. Titanfall isn\'t tuned to perfection for everyone yet, but it starts as a smart, swift and startling movement in well-traveled space.""\n\nGamespot 9/10: ""When you look at Titanfall, it\'s easy to see the familiar. Most of the weapons, grenades, and abilities fill well-worn niches. Many of the environments are like the grimy villages and industrial complexes that have hosted countless online battles in dozens of other games. The competitive modes are bog standard. And yet, when you play Titanfall, it\'s impossible to shake the feeling that you\'re playing something special.\n\nThe overarching experience of playing Titanfall is one of rejuvenation and reinvigoration. The sprint speed, the arsenal, the game modes, and more are all firmly derived from some of the most successful online shooters of recent years. But by reinventing the way you move, Titanfall reinvents what it feels like to play a competitive shooter. The high-flying action intertwines beautifully with the brutish, tactical titan battles, creating battlefields that crackle with possibility. Titanfall is a leap forward for shooters, a game that combines the vibrant and new with the tried and true to create something special.""', ""After months of anticipation, Titanfall will soon be out on Microsoft's new console and PC, and most of the reviews are in.\nRead the review excerpts below (and the full versions at the links) to make a determination for yourself.\nAnd yet, when you play Titanfall, it's impossible to shake the feeling that you're playing something special.\nThe sprint speed, the arsenal, the game modes, and more are all firmly derived from some of the most successful online shooters of recent years.\nBut by reinventing the way you move, Titanfall reinvents what it feels like to play a competitive shooter.""]"

I’ve put together a special titanic sized Snatch with all the news for the game, be it good, bad or “what the hell?”\n\nThe game has found its way in the hands of some players earlier than expected and that may have given them an unfair advantage. MP1st reports that some gamers have already ranked up to 2nd generation in the game, the equivalent of a Prestige in Call of Duty.\n\nHowever, those who have got a copy early face a ban on TwitchTV if they stream before launch. Anyone who broadcasts Titanfall before 12:01am EST tonight without “express written permission” from Respawn faces a “DMCA [Digital Millennium Copyright Act] suspension”.\n\nThe multi-player campaign in the game allegedly rather short and lasts a couple of hours.\n\nIt’s about looking where people spend most of their time,” explained Respawn.“Generally people will burn through a single-player campaign as fast as they can … For us, it was about pushing the boundaries of what multiplayer is. Let’s take all that great single-player stuff and build up the world. That world that you’re going to spend a hundred hours in should be the most full-featured.”\n\nFor classic arcade games such as Asteroids and Centipede, now with added Titan, click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyggnm_xumU\n\nThe intro to the game has leaked out and is rather odd and reminds me a little of the Star Trek Enterprise title sequence.\n\n“Titanfall will help propel the idea of high-definition gaming,” – Patrick Soderlund, the executive vice president of EA Studios at Electronic Arts.\n\nYou may recall earlier reports of the Titanfall beta playing at 792p with Respawn saying they were aiming for 900p on release. A user on Reddit has compared screens from the beta with the release code and found that the final resolution for the game is still 792p.\n\nBased on some careful pixel counting (measuring the amount of aliasing artifacts on flat edges), I’ve concluded that the Xbox One version of Titanfall is not rendering at an enhanced resolution relative to the beta. The One version of Titanfall still renders at 792p.\n\nAnother site, Beyond3D, has also suggested the game is still running at 792p.\n\nUPDATE: Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker has confirmed that the game does indeed run at 792p but the resolution may increase after launch with a patch.\n\n“We’re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We’re trying to optimise… we don’t want to give up anything for higher res,” said Richard “So far we’re not 100 per cent happy with any of the options, we’re still working on it. For day one it’s not going to change. We’re still looking at it for post-day one. We’re likely to increase resolution after we ship.”\n\n“A lot of the performance is on the GPU side. There’s still room for optimisation and we’re still working on it,” Baker added. “Ideally it would have been a rock-solid 60 all the time when we shipped but obviously when there’s big fights going on, lots of particle effects, lots of physics objects… we’re still working to condense the systems, make them more parallel so we can hit 60 all the time, ideally.”\n\nVince Zampella has also confirmed the PC version does not run at 60FPS unless V-Sync in enabled, which can result in screen-tearing and lag.\n\n@AjayLikesGaming no, but working on it — Vince Zampella (@VinceZampella) March 8, 2014\n\nSticking with Vince, that ‘Future of Titanfall’ announcement that Microsoft were crowing about?\n\nTalked with @geoffkeighley and it looks like the 'future' thing is just something fun.

991,http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/respawn-patch-to-increase-xbox-one-titanfalls-792p-resolution-likely/,technology,"['Even though Titanfall is also launching on PC tomorrow (not to mention on the Xbox 360 later this month), the game is correctly seen as the most important technology and gameplay showcase so far in the Xbox One\'s short life. So the Microsoft-supporting pixel counters out there might be a bit worried to hear that the game will be launching at a resolution of 1408x792.\n\nThat oddly specific number, the same as the resolution for last month\'s beta, packs exactly 10 percent more pixels in each dimension than the 720p images players are used to on most games for last-generation consoles. Respawn lead engineer Richard Baker confirmed Titanfall\'s launch resolution to Eurogamer, but he also said that the team was ""likely to increase resolution after we ship"" via a downloadable patch.\n\n""We\'ve been experimenting with making it higher and lower,"" Baker told the site. ""One of the big tricks is how much ESRAM we\'re going to use, so we\'re thinking of not using hardware MSAA and instead using FXAA to make it so we don\'t have to have this larger render target. We\'re going to experiment. The target is either 1080p non-anti-aliased or 900p with FXAA. We\'re trying to optimize... we don\'t want to give up anything for higher res. So far we\'re not 100 percent happy with any of the options. We\'re still working on it.""\n\nBaker\'s comments highlight the give-and-take regarding resolution and other graphical issues that developers often have to juggle now that the easier-to-achieve 720p resolution is no longer the de facto console standard. All things being equal, more pixels is generally better than fewer, but processing those additional pixels every frame on graphically intense games can necessitate either dropping the frame rate, lowering the detail and polish on in-game models, or reducing the number of things happening on screen at once.\n\nThis balancing act between conflicting graphical priorities seems to be more of an issue on the Xbox One than the PS4 these days, with Microsoft\'s system falling a bit below 1080p for many games where the PS4 version manages ""full HD"" without issue. Of course, Titanfall isn\'t coming to the PlayStation 4, so console players are stuck with what they\'ve got on Microsoft\'s system this time around.\n\nPlaying with the launch-day version of the game on the Xbox One this weekend, I can\'t say the game\'s visuals suffered for what\'s apparently less than 1080p resolution. On the contrary, the game\'s visual style packs quite a bit of pop, with vibrant colors, smooth curves, and expansive vistas. The very occasional frame rate dips and screen tearing that came up during some especially intense scenes were more significant. I only noticed these issues a couple of times during a full weekend of play, but other people in my chat party were complaining about similar issues more frequently (Eurogamer\'s analysis of the beta also found some frame rate dips).\n\nIn short, none of these graphical issues took away from what has been a very enjoyable experience with Titanfall so far. Still, the game seems destined to be a lightning rod for gamers who are keen on arguing about which console has the most graphical horsepower.', 'So the Microsoft-supporting pixel counters out there might be a bit worried to hear that the game will be launching at a resolution of 1408x792.\nRespawn lead engineer Richard Baker confirmed Titanfall\'s launch resolution to Eurogamer, but he also said that the team was ""likely to increase resolution after we ship"" via a downloadable patch.\nBaker\'s comments highlight the give-and-take regarding resolution and other graphical issues that developers often have to juggle now that the easier-to-achieve 720p resolution is no longer the de facto console standard.\nThe very occasional frame rate dips and screen tearing that came up during some especially intense scenes were more significant.\nIn short, none of these graphical issues took away from what has been a very enjoyable experience with Titanfall so far.']"

Now all we need is software. Most people will probably agree that they are getting a bit bored with the initial slate of software. That changes with tomorrow’s release of Titanfall.\n\nMicrosoft is betting on Titanfall being a huge success. And, everything is lining up for that to happen. Microsoft has been pushing out major updates to the Xbox One’s operating system to address issues in time for Titanfall’s launch. Twitch support will be added just in time for the launch.\n\nThe hype surrounding the Titanfall release is growing to a fevered pitch. Critic reviews have started hitting the web in the past couple of hours. So far, nearly all of them have been overwhelmingly positive. Titanfall’s Metacritic score sits at 87.\n\nSome complaints have centered around the lack of a single player and some framerate issues.\n\nThe big question for Microsoft is how much of a system mover can Titanfall be? No one doubts that it will move hardware, but how much of the Xbox One/PS4 sales gap can be closed with Titanfall?\n\nIt’s hard to make comparisons to other system selling games over the years. The gaming industry is a lot bigger than it was when the Xbox 360 released.\n\nPlus, Titanfall isn’t exclusive to the Xbox One. It’s also releasing on PC and Xbox 360. My prediction? 1 million+ copies, probably closer to 1.5 million. Anything below that and I think Microsoft may want to start panicking. Xbox One hardware is a bit tougher to predict. Titanfall’s not coming out around the holiday season where people are more apt to shell out big money for Christmas. I’m going to say 400,000+ for hardware.\n\nIt’s just hard to tell though. We don’t know how many people put off buying a console until compelling software was released for it.

In this timeframe, the company recorded 161,439 mentions of the game on Twitter. Fizziology compared this to pre-release tweets about other games – 2013’s “Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag” was tweeted about 32,677 times. EA DICE’s “Battlefield 4” was mentioned only 80,969 times.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy/EA\n\nActivision’s popular “Call of Duty: Ghosts” was tweeted about 182,736 times before its launch. That’s only about 20,000 more times than “Titanfall,” which is the first in its franchise. Of course, using Twitter as an early means to measure an upcoming game’s success is only telling part of the story.\n\n“Social media conversation data is increasingly becoming an important indicator of future purchase intent if the data is properly weighted and analyzed,” Rob Key, CEO of NYC-based social media and analytics consulting firm Converseon, told IBTimes. “This means looking beyond sentiment to understand the influence of those speaking and evaluating other relevant factors, such as intensity.”\n\nFizziology also noted that 69 percent of “Titanfall’s” tweets were positive, which means around 50,000 tweets spoke negatively of Respawn’s latest endeavor. Twelve percent of the conversation about “Titanfall” were gamers hoping to play on Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox One. Three percent of Twitter discussions were from people who had already pre-ordered “Titanfall.”\n\nMeanwhile, Respawn and EA are working hard to ensure “Titanfall’s” launch goes flawlessly. The game’s beta ended Feb. 19 – and more than 2 million players participated. EA and Respawn hoped the beta would eliminate any potential bugs and glitches ""Titanfall"" may contain. Respawn cofounder Vince Zampella admitted earlier this month he was actually a bit nervous about the first-person shooter\'s release.\n\nWhen a fan asked Zampella on Twitter Feb. 2 if he was excited about the game\'s March 11 launch, and the cofounder responded with “yes, but mixed with a bit of fear. We want the launch to be as smooth as possible. Beta should help.”\n\n“People are expecting the game to have problems, and I want to make sure that it doesn\'t,” said “Titanfall” engineer Jon Shiring in an interview with Polygon on Feb. 21. “I want to do everything I can to make sure that it launches well. The Xbox Live compute platform is all brand new.”\n\nAn Xbox One update preparing for the game’s release began rolling out March 5.

Sony’s PlayStation 4 took a quick lead with sales totaling 6 million units through the beginning of March, but Microsoft sold 3 million Xbox One consoles in 2013 and a recent report also suggests that anticipation of Titanfall’s upcoming release added at least another 1 million units to the company’s running total. On what might be something of a negative note for Xbox fans, however, the same source who reported that Xbox One sales have skyrocketed thanks to Titanfall also claims that Microsoft has no plans to offer a Kinect-less Xbox One bundle anytime soon.\n\nAccording to industry watchers, one of the reasons Microsoft’s Xbox One hasn’t sold as briskly as Sony’s PlayStation 4 is the steeper price tag. The PS4 costs $399.99 while Microsoft’s Xbox One is sold with a bundled Kinect sensor for a total of $499.99.\n\nWhile the Kinect indeed adds tremendous value to the Xbox One gaming experience, many people have called for Microsoft to offer gamers a cheaper Xbox One option that ditches Microsoft’s voice and motion controller. Microsoft may indeed offer a cheaper Xbox One at some point — it makes sense, since the Xbox 360 was available at multiple price points — however those hoping Microsoft might offer a Kinect-less Xbox One option sometime soon are in for a bit of bad news.\n\nAccording to Pete “FamousMortimer” Dodd, the same insider who stated that Titanfall has increased Xbox One sales by 1 million units so far, Kinect is here to stay — at least for the time being.\n\n“As for ‘get rid of the kinect’ I agree with Pachter that it won’t be this year. Well, it can possibly be this year, but later this year,” Dodd wrote in a recent post on the NeoGAF forum. “I think his reasoning is the same as mine… because the people I talk to say ‘We literally cannot unbundle it, we have contracts with parts suppliers that are yearly or multi-year.’ Mattrick really f**ked them with that device. If you do see Microsoft announce a kinect-less bundle early, like at e3, keep in mind that means they are eating A TON of money. And that has to be worrying for a division that certain people would like to see sold off…”\n\nDodd has a good track record when revealing unannounced plans, so it looks like the Kinect isn’t going anywhere right now. Of course, just about anyone who has used Microsoft’s Xbox One would probably agree that’s not such a bad thing.', 'According to industry watchers, one of the reasons Microsoft’s Xbox One hasn’t sold as briskly as Sony’s PlayStation 4 is the steeper price tag.\nThe PS4 costs $399.99 while Microsoft’s Xbox One is sold with a bundled Kinect sensor for a total of $499.99.\nMicrosoft may indeed offer a cheaper Xbox One at some point — it makes sense, since the Xbox 360 was available at multiple price points — however those hoping Microsoft might offer a Kinect-less Xbox One option sometime soon are in for a bit of bad news.\nAccording to Pete “FamousMortimer” Dodd, the same insider who stated that Titanfall has increased Xbox One sales by 1 million units so far, Kinect is here to stay — at least for the time being.\nOf course, just about anyone who has used Microsoft’s Xbox One would probably agree that’s not such a bad thing.']"

Classing it as a tremendously enjoyable game and the 6v6 feature has been praised as a smart move.\n\nThroughout this review we get the impression this game is still yet to achieve its full potential and after testing this for 9 hours they felt it was worthy of an 8/10. Meanwhile, they say some of the maps do feel too similar to each other, branding the campaign multiplayer as sadly non-dynamic.\n\nEurogamer document their views on Titanfall, but refrain from scoring it at the moment as they have decided to delay their full review until they have had the opportunity to play it extensively. With that in mind, their early preview does not hold back and their extensive account is still worth checking out.\n\nThey mention how this game gets so much right and game-changing ideas that are easy to adapt to, in fact, so much so that they feel it is easy to get complacent. We also get the impression there is still room for improvement, and while they regard Titanfall as a step up for shooters, it is not a giant leap.\n\nWhen it comes to review scores Polygon’s 9 out of 10 gives us more reason to follow their perspective more avidly. Condensing their in-depth account it seems Polygon are impressed with Titanfall and suggest this title has all the makings of the next big thing.\n\nIn addition, they reiterate earlier comments about it being a step up, but also remark on this not being a massive leap like that when Modern Warfare started. Overall, some great things have been said about the upcoming title, even though the word potential keeps coming up.\n\nIn a recent post we discussed the Titanfall Xbox One system that gamers were hoping to get hold of, however, this console is only currently accessible to Respawn Entertainment staff, but we are hoping this will be available to the public in the future.\n\nWith plenty of build-up surrounding Titanfall it seems this game is living up to its hype, and we cannot wait to get the gamers point of view.

Wall-running across an entire map, bouncing off structures and lifting yourself up to a higher ledge to take out an enemy pilot – that’s another. Crushing foes like squeezing tomatoes, stamping your feet like a 3-year old child being pulled out of play-school – it’s a feeling that only comes from Titanfall. If first-person shooters have felt stale for some time, the team at Respawn has done its damnedest to freshen them up.\n\n“Titanfall’s campaign is so drowned out by the gameplay that I have no clue what was happening in the top right of the HUD where the game feeds you mini-cutscenes.”\n\nIt’s hard to write an article about a new shooter without mentioning Call of Duty, and Titanfall is as fine-tuned as a once-famous captain’s moustache. Playing it, you soon realise the agonizing hours that have been put into balancing this behemoth. With all the attention put into this game, the studio deserves as many medals as have already been pinned to its chest since the game first began winning over the press. You can feel the crafting that has gone into the game; from the man versus machine gameplay of pilots fighting Titans, to the burn card perks, the wall running, wall-hanging and even vertical gameplay. The game is so well balanced that its as though these guys have been doing this sort of thing for years…\n\nMultiplayer is the new campaign\n\nYou can’t play Titanfall without an internet connection. At the time of release, if you’ve got no internet, Titanfall is just an intro video on a blu-ray disc. This is a multiplayer game, don’t buy it if you want a single-player experience because it’s not here. And that applies even more so when it comes to a notable story campaign.\n\nCampaign Multiplayer hooks you up into online matches of 6 versus 6 in which the IMC and Militia battle it out. Each side gets its own story. But what that story is, well, I couldn’t give you the foggiest idea of what happened during my time with it. I just remember a lot of bangs and explosions, which is exactly what I came to the game for. Titanfall’s campaign is so drowned out by the gameplay and high-paced action that I have no clue what was happening in the top right of the HUD where the game feeds you mini-cutscenes. It’s like a blur in your vision.\n\nThere’s mention of leviathans (monsters/dinosaurs/whatever we’re calling them now) – these are simply a colourful addition to the game. You can gain points for shooting terrordactyl-type creatures but you won’t be fighting off a 3000 foot Torvosaurus. You can’t choose to play single missions either, you just jump into a lobby and have to deal with it. At this point the game will do its best to create a lobby for the mission you’ve gotten up to in the campaign. This is an issue that I’ve been told will be fixed post-launch.\n\nCapture the Flag 2.0\n\nCapture the flag is a crowd favourite; the old timer. It’s a game mode that over the years has barely changed in shooters. It has always been a flat playground to run and jump your way back to home. The rules haven’t changed yet, but what Titanfall offers is something that truly makes the game worthwhile once more. You can use your Titan to get away with the flag. You can wall-run, you can use your abilities to assist you with your getaway and zipline your way to safety. Putting all this together, Titanfall manages to reboot Capture the Flag and make it exciting again because it all comes together – the flag grab, the jump into a Stryder (the fastest of the Titans), the dart back across the map under fire. Ejecting from a doomed Titan last minute, through the air and straight into through the roof of your base. Flag captured, game over. You win.\n\nTitan-falls\n\nTitans are huge, they’re something to behold and definitely not to be messed with. Dropping your Titan on top of another doesn’t get old. But as smooth as the game can be, some of Titanfall’s smaller maps can feel restrictive when the game struggles to cope with confined spaces. The sense of scale that the game so successfully created elsewhere begins to break.\n\n“There are situations where the game completely throws a hissy fit and jarring technical issues slap you around the face.”\n\nNinety percent of the time you’ll suffer no issues with Titanfall on the Xbox One. But there are situations where the game completely throws a hissy fit and jarring technical issues slap you around the face. It might not screw up the overall match – and the fights carry on with all the usual intensity – but the framerate drops and the screen tears for around 4-5 seconds. This happened at least ten times during the two days we were playing the game in EA’s controlled environment, and we’ve noticed it happening online since then.\n\nIf that’s what happens on the Xbox One, I dread to see what happens during those rare moments on the Xbox 360.\n\nBut despite these technical issues, Titanfall will undoubtedly become the shooter that changed the first-person shooter for a new generation. The mechanics under the hood of Titanfall are phenomenal. Hopefully we’ll see Xbox’s new Xbox Live Compute infrastructure thrive off the traffic – eating it for breakfast and asking for more, but we can never be 100 percent certain during these early days. As with all online games, there’s a certain amount of faith the player has to put into it and patience in the early weeks as Respawn and EA rolls out updates to strengthen the service.\n\nIn short? Get involved. You’ll look back on the day where you first played Titanfall. You’ll remember the first time you ejected over your Titan and crashed back into the battlefield. Titanfall is a game that inspires stories and you’ll shortly have your own to tell.', 'It may have a throwaway story and and a few technical issues, but Titanfall is still a first-person shooter that pushes the genre forward.\nAt the time of release, if you’ve got no internet, Titanfall is just an intro video on a blu-ray disc.\nBut there are situations where the game completely throws a hissy fit and jarring technical issues slap you around the face.\nBut despite these technical issues, Titanfall will undoubtedly become the shooter that changed the first-person shooter for a new generation.\nTitanfall is a game that inspires stories and you’ll shortly have your own to tell.']"

Xbox One sales have so far been lagging Sony Corp’s new console, the PlayStation 4, which also launched in November, priced $100 lower than Microsoft’s offering in the US.\n\nHowever, the Redmond-based software giant believes that the tide could start turning tomorrow, when ‘Titanfall’, a first person shooting game hits the stores in the US.\n\nIn today’s trading, Microsoft shares were 0.1 percent down at $37.83 as of 13:42 UTC.\n\n**Game changer?**\n\nMicrosoft’s Xbox One debuted with strong sales, but apparently not enough to overcome its rival Sony in the early stages of the latest console war. According to estimates from researcher NPD Group, the PlayStation outsold the Xbox One in January by at least a 2-to-1 margin in Microsoft’s home market, the US. On March 4, the Japanese company revealed that the PlayStation 4 had sold six million units since its November 15 launch. In contrast Microsoft hasn’t released Xbox One sales figures since the start of this year, a sign that they may be weaker than expected. It appears the US giant needs a considerable boost to catch up with its Japanese peer. According to Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft’s Xbox group, Titanfall may provide such a fillip.\n\n\n\n“It’s hard to overstate the importance of Titanfall to the Xbox One release this year,” Bloomberg Businessweek last week quoted Mehdi as saying. “For us, it’s a game changer. It’s a system seller.”\n\nTitanfall, a first person shooter (FPS) that focuses on multiplayer battles with futuristic weapons and giant robots, has already generated a lot of buzz amongst players; its open beta version attracted more than two million players, overloading some of Xbox One’s servers.\n\n\n\nWhile not entirely exclusive to Xbox One, Titanfall will not appear on PlayStation 4, meaning that players who want to experience the game will have to play it either on Microsoft’s console or on PC.\n\nFor Titanfall’s US launch, Microsoft is rolling out an Xbox One bundle priced at $499 that includes a free copy of Titanfall, which by itself will retail for $59.99. In the UK, the company announced a price cut to £399 (from £429) for the Xbox One from 28 February and Titanfall will be included in the package, for a limited time, at no additional charge from 14 March.\n\n**As of 14:17 UTC buy Microsoft shares at $37.83**\n\n**As of 14:17 UTC sell Microsoft shares at $37.81**', 'iNVEZZ.com, Monday, March 10: Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is hoping that it could gain an advantage in the video game console race with the help of giant robots.\nIn November last year, Microsoft released its first new video game console in eight years, the Xbox One, but some of the company’s decisions in the months prior to the launch prompted criticism.\nIn today’s trading, Microsoft shares were 0.1 percent down at $37.83 as of 13:42 UTC.\nAccording to Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft’s Xbox group, Titanfall may provide such a fillip.\n**As of 14:17 UTC buy Microsoft shares at $37.83****As of 14:17 UTC sell Microsoft shares at $37.81**']"

True.\n\n“It’s multiplayer only, so it can’t be that great!” claim the naysayers. Also true.\n\nPublisher Electronic Arts and developer Respawn Entertainment release the ultrahyped Titanfall this week for the Xbox One and PC (and later this month for the Xbox 360). The military-style first-person shooter is similar in mechanics and tone to the Call of Duty games — which shouldn’t surprise anyone given that a lot of the same people who worked on that series formed Respawn.\n\nWhile Titanfall will be instantly familiar and comfortable to Call of Duty players, it distinguishes itself with its highly nimble soldiers (called “pilots”) and the giant mechanized, walking tanks (called “Titans”) that they climb into and command. It’s almost difficult to go back to COD at this point, with its grounded, slow-by-comparison characters who don’t get to skip around using mini-jetpacks or drive four-story-tall death-dealing mechs. But Titanfall doesn’t necessarily give enough reasons to hang around for the long-term, either.\n\nWhat you’ll like\n\nBesides giant mechs, you mean?\n\nWhile Titanfall’s cover models are its monstrous Titans of course, you can’t dismiss its people-sized pilots, who are quite fun to play on their own. Counterintuitively, you may even purposely avoid playing as a Titan to run around in the flesh.\n\nIn almost all of Titanfall’s fairly standard modes (kill everyone, hold a point, capture the flag, etc.), you start each match as a pilot armed with a fairly normal primary weapon (assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, etc.). You’re also equipped with a sidearm, an anti-Titan weapon (heavier weapons like shoulder-mounted rocket launchers designed to take down the big guys), and some additional gear or abilities that include grenades, radar enhancements, cloaking abilities, and more. (Yes, character customization — down to the type of scope you put on your guns — is very similar to what you’ve seen in Call of Duty without the more superficial options like the ability to swap out your sight’s red dot with a purple smiley face.)\n\nBut every pilot has their personal jump kit as well, and these — perhaps more so than the Titans themselves — are really what give the game its own identity. Once you’ve had a taste of double-jumping, wall-running, and parkour-like agility that the kits provide, it makes comparable military shooters like COD or Battlefield feel, well, less comparable.\n\nIt helps that all of the levels are vast enough to accommodate multiple Titans battling it out yet contain plenty of indoor areas and smart vertical design to make running around as a pilot feel just as empowering (giving up raw strength for cat-like maneuverability). The tradeoff, however, is that the overall speed may be a bit too much for less experienced gamers, negating some of Titanfall’s newbie friendliness (more on that below).\n\nAnd with heavy-duty anti-Titan weaponry — plus the ability to climb on top of enemy mechs to bypass shields and rip out key components to expose more delicate innards that don’t hold up well against regular ol’ bullets — you’ll never feel shortchanged on the not-so-tall side of the pilot-Titan dynamic.\n\nBut what about those giant mechs?\n\nAs you scamper about as a pilot, picking up a kill here and there, you start building up anticipation for the big prize: “Titanfall.” An onscreen timer backed by audio cues from your in-game dispatcher (“Your Titan will be ready in 30 seconds”) counts down to when you can summon your tower of doom. As you eliminate enemies, the time to Titanfall lessens, speeding up the arrival of your new ride.', 'I’ll make this easy: Everything that anyone’s ever said and speculated on Titanfall is correct.\nPublisher Electronic Arts and developer Respawn Entertainment release the ultrahyped Titanfall this week for the Xbox One and PC (and later this month for the Xbox 360).\nWhat you’ll likeBesides giant mechs, you mean?\nBut what about those giant mechs?\nAs you eliminate enemies, the time to Titanfall lessens, speeding up the arrival of your new ride.']"

No single player really means no single player. You can’t even customize your player character without first logging into a server.\n\nOnce you get in, it quickly becomes apparent exactly what Titanfall is, namely the multiplayer from the multi-million selling Call of Duty games, only with giant robots and free-running instead of modern military combat.\n\nThere are tweaks to the game that make it friendlier to new players, and changes to the gameplay allow more casual players not to be smacked around by the experts (quite as much), but at its heart it’s still Call of Duty With Robots.\n\nWhich is fine. It’s the most popular part of the best-selling modern video-game series new and improved by the people who defined the format. That’s what many fans were hoping for.\n\nThe problem is that while it’s very good it’s also very narrow.\n\nTitanfall is a very thin slice of what games can offer and isn’t even the big, blockbuster package that comes with the yearly installment of Call of Duty (which has a spectacle-based single player and, usually, a co-operative multiplayer mode as well).\n\nWhich isn’t to say that Titanfall needs all that stuff. The game succeeds on its own merits in what it’s trying to do. But it’s hard to imagine buying an Xbox One over a PlayStation 4 just for the sake of Titanfall, especially if you were already leaning towards a PlayStation.\n\nIt’s been a lukewarm year for Microsoft’s Xbox brand. When the new Xbox One was announced last spring, several aspects of the system — such as the inability to sell used games and frequent online check-ins for the system — were roundly reviled by consumers.\n\nAs such, Microsoft quickly backtracked on some of those features before the system was released in late November.\n\nHowever, when the Xbox One hit shelves, it didn’t stack up especially well against Sony’s rival PlayStation 4 on a technical level despite a somewhat wider games library.\n\nThe PlayStation 4 has reportedly outsold the Xbox One by as many as two million units (a third more total sales). As a plum exclusive coming just after launch, Titanfall is the game that’s supposed to stop Microsoft from getting entrenched in second place.\n\n\n\nThat’s a lot of weight to put on a game that will really only appeal to a very specific (albeit large) group of people.\n\nThe way I see it, Titanfall will sell a lot of units, and will help the Xbox One’s overall offerings, but the Xbox One will still likely be behind the PlayStation 4 for the foreseeable future.\n\nHopefully, the game — which I want to re-iterate is very good at what it does — doesn’t get unfairly maligned for not propping up the system all by itself.', '[/np_storybar]COMMENTMicrosoft Corp. has a lot riding on Titanfall, the new game from developer Respawn Entertainment, the creators of the blockbuster Call of Duty series.\nStill, while the game is very good at what it does, it may have a more limited appeal than Microsoft is hoping.\nThe first thing you notice when you boot up Titanfall is that it needs to connect to a data centre to work.\nNo single player really means no single player.\nAs a plum exclusive coming just after launch, Titanfall is the game that’s supposed to stop Microsoft from getting entrenched in second place.']"

Anecdotal evidence has long pointed to Battlefield and Call of Duty players treating those titles’ story modes as optional extras: the underwhelming undercard to multiplayer’s main event; mere distractions to the demands of deathmatches.\n\nAnd yet clearly there are also many FPS fans for whom it does matter, and who view such content as a crucial purchasing decision.\n\nTitanfall’s concession to them is its ‘campaign multiplayer’ mode, a fundamentally flawed attempt to provide the best of both worlds by loosely linking matches with an overarching narrative that remains largely unaffected by anything either team does during them.\n\nWe're testing a new site: This content is coming soon\n\nSure there are some scripted events and a ceaseless stream of NPC chatter that you’ll struggle even to hear mid-combat, let alone make sense of, but for the main campaign multiplayer feels much like regular multiplayer only with fewer gameplay options.\n\nTo compound further the sheer futility of this back-of-the-box-ticking exercise, players have to complete both sides of the campaign to unlock a full compliment of Titans for use in other modes.\n\nIt’s a rare - albeit surprisingly significant - misstep in what otherwise often resembles a masterclass in multiplayer shooter design.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAs many of the 2 million-plus players who took part in the recent Xbox One and PC open beta will surely testify, the impeccable balance struck between Titanfall’s central combat trinity of massive mechs, parkouring pilots and AI-controlled grunts makes for one of the most multi-faceted FPS experiences in recent memory .\n\nRespawn’s most admirable achievement, though, is that it’s also brilliant fun to play. Mindful of the fresh-faced FNGs the game is sure to attract, Titanfall is beautifully accessible - joyously so for anyone who’s been scarred by COD’s merciless killing fields - yet still boasts enough depth to cater for combat veterans.\n\nIt’s an approach that can be felt everywhere from the one-use booster cards that can give you a temporary but tangible edge in encounters to the post-match Epilogue that allows losing players to save face (and XP) by escaping the battlefield.\n\nThe apogee of this aesthetic is surely the auto-targeting Smart Pistol, a wonderfully empowering piece of tech that allows newcomers to feel like headshotting heroes without ever threatening the overall integrity of the game.\n\nPerversely for a game predicated on the presence of multi-story mechs, less is very much more. The small but perfectly tuned arsenal of weapons, upgrades and loadouts, for example, offers a smaller number of meaningful choices rather than overwhelming players with options.\n\nAnd even though Titanfall features only five gametypes - Attrition (deathmatch, essentially), Hardpoint Domination, Capture the Flag, Pilot Hunter (in which only player kills count), and the round-based Last Titan Standing - each feels fresh due to the redesigned battlefield dynamics.\n\nThe 15 or so maps on offer impress more for their layouts rather than their looks, the best becoming colossal climbing frames that you clamber around and over with practiced ease.\n\nVerticality - so often clumsily handled by shooters, if at all - becomes an essential tactic, and it’s the sense of scale coupled with an unprecedented freedom of movement that marks out Titanfall as a truly next gen experience.\n\nWhether all that’s enough to convert single players to the cause or convince floating gamers to splash out on a new console remains to be seen.\n\nOn the one hand, criticising Titanfall for ‘just’ being a multiplayer shooter feels as fatuous as writing off a Ferrari for ‘just’ being a car, and yet it remains the giant robot in the room.\n\nOne thing’s for sure, though: Respawn have certainly gone above and beyond the Call of Duty to reinvent the genre for a new generation.\n\nTitanfall is released on Xbox One and PC on March 14th. An Xbox 360 version will follow on March 28th."", ""Microsoft are hoping Respawn’s Xbox exclusive shooter will be the sort of dead cert system seller that'll bridge the sales gap that has emerged between the Xbox One and rival Sony's PlayStation 4.\nThe difference, though, is that Titanfall is a multiplayer only game.\nIt’s a rare - albeit surprisingly significant - misstep in what otherwise often resembles a masterclass in multiplayer shooter design.\nWhether all that’s enough to convert single players to the cause or convince floating gamers to splash out on a new console remains to be seen.\nOn the one hand, criticising Titanfall for ‘just’ being a multiplayer shooter feels as fatuous as writing off a Ferrari for ‘just’ being a car, and yet it remains the giant robot in the room.""]"

With a digital version available for every platform the game is going to exist on at launch, there’s a good chance you could be stuck waiting for your game to download instead of playing when the servers go live. Unless of course, you preload your game.\n\nIf you’re not planning to wait in line at your local game store at midnight to pick up the small person-sized Collector’s Edition box for PC, digital folks will be seated comfortably at home when Titanfall launches for the US. Whether you’ve purchased the game directly from the Origin store or are waiting for it to become available for purchase on Xbox Live, we’re only a few hours away from the launch.\n\nPC owners will have the ability to preload Titanfall, meaning if you purchase the game now you can have everything ready to go the second it goes live in your timezone. According to Respawn, the launch of Titanfall will be staggered like this:\n\nUnited States: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PDT\n\nCanada: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PDT\n\nMexico: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PST\n\nBrazil: 3/11/14 – 4:00 AM BRT\n\nAustria: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET\n\nFrance: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET\n\nGermany: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET\n\nIreland: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM GMT\n\nItaly: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET\n\nSpain: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CET\n\nUnited Kingdom: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM GMT\n\nAustralia: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM AEDT\n\nNew Zealand: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM NZDT\n\nPreloading the game is easy. If you’ve already purchased Titanfall for your PC, you’ll see a preload option available to you in the Origin app on your computer. If you haven’t made the purchase yet, you’ll see the preload option appear as soon as the transaction is complete and Titanfall has been added to your Library. If you pre-ordered the game at a retail outlet, you’ll be provided with a code that will add the game to your Library, which means you can’t preload without that code.\n\nIf you’re planning to purchase the game digitally on the Xbox One, you’ll need to wait until it is available on Xbox Live to do so. The game will then need to download and install, and neither Microsoft nor Respawn has announced a preload function for the console version yet.\n\nThere will be no “Day One” update for Titanfall on the Xbox One to address the resolution of the game, which was suggested when the Beta rolled out last month. Just like the Beta, Titanfall on the Xbox One will run at 792p. There may be an update later on that addresses this (and gets it nearer to 900p), but at launch the game will likely look almost exactly like the Beta.', 'Arguable the most anticipated game so far this year, Titanfall is a mere hours away for some.\nPC owners will have the ability to preload Titanfall, meaning if you purchase the game now you can have everything ready to go the second it goes live in your timezone.\nAccording to Respawn, the launch of Titanfall will be staggered like this:United States: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PDTCanada: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PDTMexico: 3/11/14 – 12:00 AM PSTBrazil: 3/11/14 – 4:00 AM BRTAustria: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CETFrance: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CETGermany: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CETIreland: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM GMTItaly: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CETSpain: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM CETUnited Kingdom: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM GMTAustralia: 3/13/14 – 12:00 AM AEDTNew Zealand: 3/14/14 – 12:00 AM NZDTPreloading the game is easy.\nIf you’ve already purchased Titanfall for your PC, you’ll see a preload option available to you in the Origin app on your computer.\nIf you’re planning to purchase the game digitally on the Xbox One, you’ll need to wait until it is available on Xbox Live to do so.']"

To get Titanfall to the UK, Respawn will presumably have to manually print every line of code, pack it into a secure, waterproof crate, and then sail it over the Atlantic. Once it arrives, all that data must then be typed into the UK's internet, probably by Johnny Lee Miller's fictional character from the movie Hackers.\n\nAt least, that's the only sensible scenario for having staggered international release dates. And yet, Titanfall pre-loading is now available for pre-ordered digital copies. It suggests that, rather than some tricky infrastructural hurdle, the reason many countries won't be able to play the game until later this week is down to the usual prioritisation of physical media, and the unwillingness of brick and mortar stores to deviate from their traditional release window.\n\nRelease dates and times have now been clarified by EA in a blog post accompanying their pre-load announcement. If you live somewhere in the world, this is when you'll be able to play the game:\n\n\n\nCentral Asia: (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand) 3/11 12:00 KST\n\nNorth America (United States, Mexico, Canada, Brazil) 3/11 12:00 AM EST\n\nRussia: 3/11 11:00 MSK\n\nAustralia: 3/12 13:00 UTC\n\nJapan: 3/12 15:00 UTC\n\nEurope (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland): 3/12 23:00 UTC\n\nNew Zealand: 3/13 12:00 UTC\n\nIndia: 3/13 18:30 UTC\n\nUnited Kingdom: 3/13 23:00 UTC\n\nIreland: 3/13 23:00 UTC\n\nPortugal: 3/13 23:00 UTC\n\nOf course, such a staggered launch isn't unusual. For big games that still have a physical presence, it's only the very biggest that can pull off a day-and-date international launch.

Titanfall is a first-person, multiplayer shooter in which players can fight each other in mechs and as puny infantry with jetpacks… which I guess isn’t so puny. The game is slated to become the new flagship franchise for the Xbox One console and has had previous coverage by us, here. Fans are invited to attend the event at the headquarters of the fictional ‘Hammond Robotics Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation’ and hosted by the not-fictional: EA, EB Games, and Xbox Australia. Guests will be able to play the full game in 6v6 online matches prior to the game’s national release and opportunities to purchase the full game will be provided during the event by EB games as well as other merchandise. Inquiries about the possibility of purchasing a real titan for personal use were only answered with bemused laughter, so one assumes that they must be provided complimentary to guests.\n\nWith every purchase (of a non-titan item), guests will go into the draw to win various prizes ranging from Xbox One consoles, Collector’s Editions of Titanfall, and much more (possibly more titans… for your friends). Also during the event, every purchase of the game will come with a free shirt but only while they’re in stock (I assume that every guest will be guaranteed their own titan however). In between games and (I assume) riding around in your own titan, guests will be treated to food, drink, and other entertainment. The luxury taxi service, Uber, will be providing guests with a $50 voucher for the evening if they wish to be ferried home with their service. Invitations are only being extended to fans 18 years of age and over as I assume children will not be able to reach the piloting controls of the life-sized titans.\n\nIf you would like to be put on the guest list for the event, which will be held at Luxe Studios, 279-283 Liverpool Street, East Sydney on Wednesday 12th of March, register your interest at hammondrobotics@ea.com with your full name and contact details. The full game will be available on PC and Xbox One in Australia on the 13th of March and the 14th of March for gamers in New Zealand.\n\nEdit: Much to my disappointment, there won’t be real-life titans at the release event… I’ll have to console myself by playing Titanfall until real world technology catches up with my ambitions.', 'Respawn Entertainment’s new game for Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Windows operating systems, Titanfall, is set to have a midnight release event in Sydney, Australia.\nTitanfall is a first-person, multiplayer shooter in which players can fight each other in mechs and as puny infantry with jetpacks… which I guess isn’t so puny.\nFans are invited to attend the event at the headquarters of the fictional ‘Hammond Robotics Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation’ and hosted by the not-fictional: EA, EB Games, and Xbox Australia.\nIn between games and (I assume) riding around in your own titan, guests will be treated to food, drink, and other entertainment.\nEdit: Much to my disappointment, there won’t be real-life titans at the release event… I’ll have to console myself by playing Titanfall until real world technology catches up with my ambitions.']"

Those who head to the University Village and Bellevue Square stores in the Seattle region will also be able to meet Seattle Seahawks star cornerback Richard Sherman, who will be taking photos with fans and playing a little Xbox himself at each location.\n\nSherman, who dominated headlines in January with his stellar defensive play and entertaining interviews, did something similar back in November 2012 for a Halo 4 launch party at the U Village Microsoft Store.\n\n“This is amazing,” Sherman told us in 2012. “I wish I knew about events like this when I was younger. They should have these kind of things all the time to bring people together. A lot of gamerheads would love this kind of stuff.”\n\nSherman’s appearance at these midnight launch events are part of Microsoft’s partnership with the Seahawks, who won their first Super Bowl last month. Most recently we noted how Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has become the company’s unofficial athlete spokesperson for the Surface tablet.\n\nAs for Titanfall itself, the game is launching exclusively on the Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Windows PC. Microsoft hopes that the game convinces more people to purchase the Xbox One, which retails at $499 and has taken a backseat to the $399 PlayStation 4 in terms of sales. Sony announced last week that it had sold more than 6 million PS4 systems worldwide — compared to 3.9 million Xbox Ones sold — and outpaced Microsoft nearly 2-to-1 for PS4 sales in the U.S. during January.\n\nMicrosoft last week announced an Xbox One Titanfall Bundle, which includes an Xbox One console, an Xbox One chat headset, one month of Xbox Live Gold and a copy of Titanfall all for $499 — currently the same price as the Xbox One by itself. Purchased separately, Titanfall costs $59.99, so Microsoft is offering a pretty substantial discount with the package.\n\nTitanfall, an online-only multiplayer game, was produced by Electronic Arts and developed by Respawn Entertainment, the folks who created the uber-popular Call of Duty series.

Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), a team of US and Canadian researchers discovered that huge quantities of ultraviolet radiation from stars at least 16-times the mass of our own sun can blast away the raw materials for new planetary systems.\n\nTracking stars and protostars in the Orion Nebula, researchers found that any protostars – that is, young stars the dust and matter around which often goes on to coalesce into planets – within 0.1 light years (around 600bn miles) of an O-type star would have their raw material cleared out by the radiation before it had a chance to cluster.\n\n“Using ALMA, we looked at dozens of embryonic stars with planet-forming potential and, for the first time, found clear indications where protoplanetary disks simply vanished under the intense glow of a neighboring massive star” astronomer Rita Mann explained.\n\nUsually, it takes a few million years for stellar dust and gas to begin to combine into something denser, and then over time form into planets. The raw material is believed to come from the explosion of huge stars going supernova, but ironically anything forming too close can end up being undermined by the radiation pumped out.\n\n“Massive stars are hot and hundreds of times more luminous than our Sun. Their energetic photons can quickly deplete a nearby protoplanetary disk by heating up its gas, breaking it up, and sweeping it away” James Di Francesco, National Research Council of Canada\n\nAlthough telescopes like Hubble had previously allowed astronomers to see very young protostars, known as proplyds, in Orion, they lacked the ability to identify how much mass each had. However, using ALMA meant researchers could look inside the teardrop-shaped forms, to reveal what dust was contained.\n\nThe differences proved striking. Within the extreme-UV read of a massive star, proplyds had less than half the dust mass required to form a planet roughly the size of Jupiter; beyond that, they could have anywhere up to 80x the mass of Jupiter in reserve.\n\nFuture investigation, the team says, will hopefully indicate how common solar systems like our own are, and perhaps help in hunting down areas of space habitable for life.', 'Real-life “Death Stars” deadlier than Darth Vader astronomers findAlderaan isn’t the only planet to fall victim to the “Death Star”, astronomers claim, though the vast O-type stars actually across the galaxy destroying young planets before they’ve had time to form don’t have convenient exhaust ports to stop them.\nUsually, it takes a few million years for stellar dust and gas to begin to combine into something denser, and then over time form into planets.\nThe raw material is believed to come from the explosion of huge stars going supernova, but ironically anything forming too close can end up being undermined by the radiation pumped out.\n“Massive stars are hot and hundreds of times more luminous than our Sun.\nHowever, using ALMA meant researchers could look inside the teardrop-shaped forms, to reveal what dust was contained.']"

Many of these nascent systems will go on to develop planets, while others will have their planet-forming dust and gas blasted away by the fierce ultraviolet radiation emitted by massive O-type stars that lurk nearby.\n\nA team of astronomers from Canada and the United States has used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to study the often deadly relationship between highly luminous O-type stars and nearby protostars in the Orion Nebula. Their data reveal that protostars within 0.1 light-year (about 600 billion miles) of an O-type star are doomed to have their cocoons of dust and gas stripped away in just a few millions years, much faster than planets are able to form.\n\n“O-type stars, which are really monsters compared to our Sun, emit tremendous amounts of ultraviolet radiation and this can play havoc during the development of young planetary systems,” remarked Rita Mann, an astronomer with the National Research Council of Canada in Victoria, and lead author on a paper in the Astrophysical Journal. “Using ALMA, we looked at dozens of embryonic stars with planet-forming potential and, for the first time, found clear indications where protoplanetary disks simply vanished under the intense glow of a neighboring massive star.”\n\nMany, if not all, Sun-like stars are born in crowded stellar nurseries similar to the Orion Nebula. Over the course of just a few million years, grains of dust and reservoirs of gas combine into larger, denser bodies. Left relatively undisturbed, these systems will eventually evolve into fully fledged star systems, with planets -- large and small -- and ultimately drift away to become part of the galactic stellar population.\n\nAstronomers believe that massive yet short-lived stars in and around large interstellar clouds are essential for this ongoing process of star formation. At the end of their lives, massive stars explode as supernovae, seeding the surrounding area with dust and heavy elements that will get taken up in the next generation of stars. These explosions also provide the kick necessary to initiate a new round of star and planet formation.

They think not.\n\nThis unusual stretch of mild temperatures and unprecedented rain in an area traditionally known for its cold and arid climate would have increased the productivity of grasslands in the Mongolian steppe, the researchers say. The abundant grass would in turn increase the number of grazing animals that could live off it.\n\nMembers of Khan’s army reportedly had five horses apiece, which allowed them to swiftly conquer an enormous area that stretched from eastern Asia to eastern Europe, as well as parts of northern India and the Mideast. They also traveled with a herd of livestock that provided them with food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think of it as nature set the table, and Genghis Khan came to eat,” said Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University, in a video describing the research. “He didn’t have to come eat, and he didn’t have to eat the way he did, but the table was set and it was a matter of whether or not the culture and the people capitalized on that.”\n\nHer colleague Neil Pederson of Columbia University’s Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory put it this way: ""Grass was the power of the day.”\n\nThe story of the unusual wet period in Mongolian history was written in scores of ancient Siberian pine trees that Pederson and Hessl first sampled on a whim during a research trip in 2010. The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field in central Mongolia, dotted with horse skeletons. The researchers said that because the trees are severely water stressed, they are especially sensitive to changes in the weather.\n\nOn that first trip, the two scientists took core samples from about a dozen trees. When they got them back to the lab, they discovered that some of those samples dated back more than 1,000 years. They also found evidence of a climate narrative that they couldn’t ignore. For a small stretch of time, some of the rings were visibly thicker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I was just excited that we had wood from the time of Chinggis Khan,” said Pederson, using an Asian name for the ruler. “And it was really the trees saying ‘look how wide our rings are right here.’”\n\nPederson and Hessl returned to the site two years later to sample more trees. Those samples confirmed the initial findings: The expansion of the Mongolian empire coincided with what the trees recorded as a warmer and wetter climate than usual.\n\nIn interviews, both Pederson and Hessl said there was still more work to be done to definitively link the trees’ narrative with human events. They are working with experts from disciplines including ecology, biology, and history to find more evidence of how the fortuitous change in climate may have contributed to the making of the largest empire in history.\n\n“There are still a lot of unknowns out there,” said Pederson. “The climate information in the trees is just one little piece of the puzzle.”\n\nIf you agree that science is fascinating, follow me on Twitter for more like this.', 'The trees were growing on a nearly soil-less lava field in central Mongolia, dotted with horse skeletons.\nThe researchers said that because the trees are severely water stressed, they are especially sensitive to changes in the weather.\nAdvertisement“I was just excited that we had wood from the time of Chinggis Khan,” said Pederson, using an Asian name for the ruler.\n“And it was really the trees saying ‘look how wide our rings are right here.’”Pederson and Hessl returned to the site two years later to sample more trees.\nIn interviews, both Pederson and Hessl said there was still more work to be done to definitively link the trees’ narrative with human events.']"

Although the Mongol empire would break up over the centuries, some of Genghis Khan\'s direct descendants were still ruling pockets of central Asia into the 1920s.\n\nThe timely change in climatic conditions that helped to launch the Mongol empire ""doesn\'t appear to have been associated with any change in volcanic eruptions or solar irradiance,"" says Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleo-climatologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.

A tree lays down a new layer of wood twice a year, creating recognizable rings. These rings tend to be narrower in times of drought and wider in good growing conditions. The science of scrutinizing tree rings is called “dendrochronology”; with it, researchers can read temperature and moisture trends stretching back hundreds or even thousands of years.\n\nBased on a study of 107 living and dead Siberian pines, with a tree ring history stretching over the past 1,100 years, a team of scientists from the U.S. and Mongolia found that the climate during Genghis Khan’s conquests of 1211 to 1225 was unusually warm and wet.\n\n“These climate conditions promoted high grassland productivity and favored the formation of Mongol political and military power,” the authors wrote in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.\n\nSome researchers had thought the Mongol conquests were driven in part by drought in Mongolia – the invaders might have been looking to grab more resources. And, indeed, the researchers found that Mongolia was experiencing intense drought conditions before Genghis Khan ascended to his leadership, between 1180 and 1190. That time also coincided with a lot of internal strife among the Mongol tribes. But as the weather turned, a new leader managed to unite the clans and expand outward toward all points of the compass.\n\n""The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,"" study author and West Virginia University researcher Amy Hessl said in a statement. ""It wasn\'t the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. Where it\'s arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower. Genghis was literally able to ride that wave.""\n\nWith each Mongol warrior commanding five or more horses, and with vast livestock herds supplying the nomadic tribes, grass was an essential resource for the great khan’s troops.\n\n""Before fossil fuels, grass and ingenuity were the fuels for the Mongols and the cultures around them,"" the study’s lead author, Columbia University tree-ring researcher Neil Pederson, said in a statement Monday.\n\nIt’s a hot scientific trend of late to try and match up climate history to political history. The rise and fall of the ancient Maya civilization appears to track the ups and downs of rainfall trends, another team of researchers hypothesized in a 2012 paper published in Science.\n\nThe researchers also looked at recent drought conditions in Mongolia. Current climate models have pointed to a troubling scenario in Central Asia, which is expected to warm faster than the average temperature rise across the globe. In landlocked Mongolia, which is largely desert already, the strain could be particularly hard felt.\n\n""Energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem, up the ladder to human society,” Pederson says. “Even today, many people in Mongolia live just like their ancestors did. But in the future, they may face serious conditions.""\n\nSOURCE: Pederson et al. “Pluvials, droughts, the Mongol Empire and modern Mongolia.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 10 March 2014.', 'Genghis Khan had a key ally you might not have expected: a stretch of nice weather.\nHuman records of climate conditions only go back so far, but thankfully, the history of weather can inscribe itself in other deeply rooted sources like tree rings.\nThe science of scrutinizing tree rings is called “dendrochronology”; with it, researchers can read temperature and moisture trends stretching back hundreds or even thousands of years.\nAnd, indeed, the researchers found that Mongolia was experiencing intense drought conditions before Genghis Khan ascended to his leadership, between 1180 and 1190.\nIt’s a hot scientific trend of late to try and match up climate history to political history.']"

But prior to its ascension, during the late 1100s, the Mongol tribes were racked by disarray and internal warfare. This all came to an end with the rise of Genghis Kahn in the early 1200s.

The shift to a capitalist economy in the 1990s led to even more investment in livestock, Hessl said.\n\nBut, between 1998 and 2002, three consecutive dzuds — severe winters made worse by a preceding drought — killed 20 million livestock. The especially harsh dzud in 2010 killed 20 percent of the nation\'s livestock population, or 8.5 million animals.\n\nThe unrelenting dzuds sent the rural population flooding into the cities, primarily Ulaanbaatar. In 2010, 68 percent of Mongolians lived in urban areas, compared to 57 percent in 2000. The population of Ulaanbaatar ballooned by 300,000 since 2000, and now sits at 1.2 million. About 60 percent of the city\'s population has settled in traditional Mongolian tents called gers, forming massive ger districts —without paved roads, electricity, sanitation, or running water.\n\nThe researchers analyzed tree rings of Siberian pines, which can live up to a thousand years, to reconstruct a 1,112-year history of soil moisture and climate in Mongolia — one of the longest tree-ring histories on record. More rain means moister soil, which causes trees to grow faster and produce thicker tree rings.\n\nCombining their data with previously published tree-ring records, they found that the severity of the recent drought was matched only by dry periods in the late 12th century, which may have contributed to the political instability from which a strong, charismatic leader like Genghis Khan could emerge. The fact that the 21st century has been much warmer than it was in the past means that recent temperature increases likely worsened the drought\'s impact.\n\nThe researchers\' tree-ring record also revealed a time of unprecedented rainfall between 1211 and 1225, coinciding with the expansion of the Mongolian Empire. While some scholars suggest that droughts pushed the Mongols to invade other lands, this is the first evidence to suggest that rain fueled their conquests.\n\n""Contrary to conventional wisdom, the Mongol Empire expanded under a very warm and particularly wet period,"" Hessl said. ""This climate would have benefitted the Mongols by providing them with ample grassland productivity."" This productivity was crucial for providing a consistent energy source for horses and livestock to support armies.\n\nTo determine that tree-ring data was an accurate representation of grassland productivity, the researchers compared their tree-rings to satellite data of vegetation covering Mongolia between 1980 and 2010. Making this link is important, showing that the evidence isn\'t simply coincidental, said Valerie Trouet of the University of Arizona in Tucson, who was not part of the research.\n\n""This work opens up new trains of thought in terms of what drives human migration and the extension of past empires,"" said Trouet, whose research showed that abrupt climate shifts played a role in the fall of the Roman Empire. For example, she said, one hypothesis is that grassland productivity in central Asia also fueled the Huns, who invaded the Roman Empire in the 5th century A.D.\n\nAlthough modern societies tend to be more resilient against rapid climate shifts, today\'s Mongolia shows that\'s not always the case. ""The changes that are ongoing in climate now are very often very abrupt,"" Trouet said. ""And that makes it harder to adapt.""', ""Climate Alters Mongolian Past And PresentTree-ring data sheds light on climate change's historic and modern impact.\nAlthough this study of the Mongolian Empire has been reported previously, the newly published work represents the researchers' completed analysis.\nThe especially harsh dzud in 2010 killed 20 percent of the nation's livestock population, or 8.5 million animals.\nThe researchers' tree-ring record also revealed a time of unprecedented rainfall between 1211 and 1225, coinciding with the expansion of the Mongolian Empire.\nAlthough modern societies tend to be more resilient against rapid climate shifts, today's Mongolia shows that's not always the case.""]"

African elephants who hear human voices can tell people of different sexes, ages and even ethnic groups apart, according to a new study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Such keen ears are necessary when trying to survive in territory marked by human-elephant conflict.\n\nAfrican elephants who live in Amboseli National Park in Kenya share land with the Maasai people, who raise and herd cattle. The two groups sporadically come into conflict over such resources as grazing land and water. Occasionally an elephant will attack cattle or even a human, and Maasai hunters will go spear an elephant in response.\n\nBut these attacks are random, from an elephant’s perspective — and thus, knowing which human is most likely to attack you is a handy skill.\n\n“The elephants can’t predict where the people are going to be because they range over these large areas, grazing their cattle,” said Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Colorado State University who co-led the study. “So the threat is both spatially and temporally very variable -- and so they have to respond appropriately.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoices offer a rich range of auditory cues, and hearing someone from a distance can also give you a key advantage in the survival game if you know what to listen for. Previous research had already shown that elephants can tell the number and sex of lions based on their roaring, and the scientists wondered if the same were true for the elephants’ other major predator, humans.\n\nThe researchers took a speaker, camouflaged it with a screen woven of palm fronds and placed it about 50 meters away from where they expected wandering elephants to end up. They pre-recorded calls from local villagers, including Maasai men, women, and young boys, saying, “Look, look over there: a group of elephants is coming.”\n\nTo compare to the Maasai, they also included calls from people known as the Kamba. Since the Kamba are farmers, not cattle herders, and their clearly defined cropland is easy for the elephants to avoid, they generally come into far less conflict with elephants.\n\nThe scientists sat in a Land Rover about 150 meters way from the speaker, waited for elephant families to wander within earshot, and videotaped their responses to the recorded voices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe experiment took two years to complete, partly because the scientists had to space out the sessions so the elephants wouldn’t become used to the experiment. Sometimes the researchers ran into problems: Occasionally a lion came too close and set off the group’s alarms before the experiment ran. Once, in the midst of an experiment, Shannon said he accidentally hit “shuffle” on his iPod instead of playing the recorded voices -- and the speaker began blasting the Dire Straits’ 1980s classic “Money for Nothing.” The elephants were not impressed.\n\n“They didn’t care at all,” he said. “They took a look at the speaker and wandered off.”\n\nElephants did, however, react with alarm to the voices of Maasai men -- they quickly huddled, protecting the calves, and raised their trunks to sniff the air for any human scent. Recordings from Maasai women or boys didn’t earn anywhere close to that kind of reaction. Neither did the voices of Kamba men.\n\nThat’s because Maasai men are the ones most likely to hunt an elephant down, the scientists said. Women don’t get involved in hunting, the boys are too young, and the Kamba farmers generally don’t need to compete with elephants for resources.\n\nThe Kamba men spoke a different language than the Maasai, so it’s likely the elephants were picking up on linguistic cues rather than some underlying, inherited differences in their voices. But the scientists aren’t sure exactly how the elephants could tell the adult male Maasai voices from the women and boys’ voices. When they remixed the men’s voices to sound more like the women’s and vice versa, the animals weren’t fooled. Figuring out that mystery will be the job of future research, Shannon said.\n\nAfrican elephants can live well into their 60s, and they’re known to have long memories. And the older matriarchs of these elephant clans seemed to be much better at quickly identifying an adult male Maasai’s voice, Shannon said. Younger female leaders tended to be a little more trigger happy, more likely to sniff the air if they heard a Maasai boy instead of an adult man.\n\nSo for the elderly females, their pitch-perfect ability to identify dangerous humans was probably a skill learned over long years of survival.

Scientists say this is an advanced thinking skill that other animals haven\'t shown.

The scientists used voice recordings of Maasai men, who on occasion kill elephants in confrontations over grazing for cattle, and Kamba men, who are less of a threat to the elephants. The recordings contained the same phrase in two different languages: ""Look over there.

Occasionally, elephants are killed in clashes with Maasai men, and vice-versa.\n\nOther recorded voices were from Kamba men, who tend to be farmers or employees of the national park, and who rarely represent a danger to elephants.\n\nStill other voices tested on the elephants included female Maasai speakers and young boys.\n\nAll were saying the same phrase: ""Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming.""\n\nThe recorded voices were played for hundreds of elephants across 47 family groups during daylight hours.\n\nWhen elephants heard the adult male Maasai voices, they tended to gather together, start investigative smelling with their trunks, and move cautiously away.\n\nBut when elephants heard females, boys, or adult male Kamba speakers, they did not show concern.\n\n""The ability to distinguish between Maasai and Kamba men delivering the same phrase in their own language suggests that elephants can discriminate between different languages,"" said co-author Graeme Shannon, a visiting fellow in psychology at the University of Sussex.\n\nThat is not the same as understanding what the words mean, but still shows that elephants can decipher the more sing-songy Maasai language from the Kamba tongue, perhaps based on inflections, use of vowels, and other cues.\n\n""It is very sophisticated what the elephants are doing,"" said Keith Lindsay, a conservation biologist and member of the scientific advisory committee of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project.\n\n""A lot of animals will take flight at just the general threat posed by people, but a smart animal doesn&39;t do that,"" he told AFP.\n\n""Their response to hearing Maasai men talking was to be alert, to move away, but not to run away in total fear,"" added Lindsay, who was not involved in the study.\n\n""It is suggesting that elephants are capable of thinking, (of) recognising that if Maasai men are talking, they are not likely to be hunting because if they were hunting, they would be quiet.""\n\nElephant groups with older matriarchs in their midst did best at assessing the threat from different speakers, further bolstering the presumed role of learning in the animals&39; behaviour.\n\nThe elephants also did not act the same way as they did when recordings of lions were played, as was shown in a previous study.\n\nIn those scenarios, they bunched together so that juveniles - those most at risk from a lion attack - were in the centre, and moved toward the sounds as if to scare the lion away.\n\nWhen it comes to recognising people, elephants may not be alone in this ability.

Age and gender are among the first pieces of information we pick up on when listening to a stranger speak, and studies have even shown that humans can determine a person\'s physical strength by listening to a recording of their voice. This ability is incredibly useful, because it can help us determine whether someone poses a threat without ever having to see them. Other animals can do this too, and have also been known to analyze sounds made by their predators. But African elephants may have taken this ability to the next level, as a new study suggests that elephants might be even better at decoding human voices than we are.\n\n""Look, Look over there, a group of elephants is coming.""\n\nThe study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was initially designed to find out whether the wild elephants of Amboseli National Park, in Kenya, could use the acoustic information contained in human language to distinguish the threat posed by the local Maasai tribes — an ethnic group known for its hunting practices — from the lesser threat posed by the agricultural Kamba ethnic group. In both cases, the recordings featured men saying ""Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming,"" in their respective languages.\n\nIt didn\'t take long for the scientists to realize that these elephants had no trouble figuring out which male voices were cause for alarm and which weren\'t, so they upped the ante by having elephants listen to recordings of Maasai women, who rarely hunt, as well as men. Once again, the elephants had no trouble figuring out who posed a danger to their calves. When they heard the male voices, the elephants would bunch together defensively or retreat, but they barely budged when they heard a woman speak. A third test revealed that the elephants didn\'t feel threatened by the voices of Maasai boys either. ""Elephants have this amazing ability to discern predators on a fine scale,"" says Graeme Shannon, lead co-author of the study and a wildlife ecologist at Colorado State University. ""They can ascribe different levels of threats to certain groups.""\n\n""We thought we were being quite clever when we changed the voices.""\n\nThat\'s when things got tricky. Thinking they could outsmart the elephants, researchers decided to digitally alter the voices to make the Maasai women sound male and the Maasai men sound female. But the elephants weren\'t fooled. They retreated just as much after hearing the feminized male voices as they had before the voice manipulation — something that humans themselves aren\'t capable of doing, Shannon says. ""That was really intriguing because the recordings sounded good to us,"" he says. ""We thought we were being quite clever when we changed the voices.""\n\n""It\'s not so much that they can tell male from female voices, but that they tell the two languages apart,"" says Frans de Waal, an animal behaviorist at Emory University who did not participate in the study, ""and are not fooled by digital manipulation of the voice, which suggests that they use different gender cues than we do — or probably do."" Joshua Plotnik, an elephant researcher at the University of Cambridge, agrees. ""This suggests that the complexity of elephant communication may rival that of most other mammals on the planet.""\n\nThey would even mob the remotely activated speakers\n\nHumans aren\'t the only animals that elephants can ""decode"" by voice alone. A 2011 study, for example, demonstrated that elephants can detect the sex of a lion based solely on its roar. But elephants react very differently to lions than they do to humans, Shannon explains. ""With the lions, the elephants were vocal and made themselves known."" Sometimes they would even mob the remotely activated speakers that played the recordings. This was not the case with the Maasai voices ""because that would escalate the risk,"" he says. ""They tailored their response to the predatory threat by making sure they never really encountered the speaker — they moved away.""\n\nThe ability to distinguish whether a predator is worth fussing over is extremely important for wild populations competing with other animals over food and space. ""If they responded to every single stimuli that actually has a fitness cost,"" Shannon says, ""because they would stop feeding and run every time.""\n\nToday, the wild elephants of Amboseli National Park are doing well. Despite a 2009 drought that killed off many of its older females, the park continues to harbor over 58 families of elephants. And officials have, thus far, been able to keep poaching to a minimum. Yet as this study demonstrates, the humans and elephants who frequent the park don\'t always coexist peacefully. ""Perhaps this information can be used to develop more comprehensive conflict-mitigation techniques that take the elephants\' perspective and decision-making process into account."" Plotnik says. ""I find it very sad that humans have driven elephants to the point that they now need to learn to adapt to humans as a threat.""', 'But African elephants may have taken this ability to the next level, as a new study suggests that elephants might be even better at decoding human voices than we are.\nWhen they heard the male voices, the elephants would bunch together defensively or retreat, but they barely budged when they heard a woman speak.\nA third test revealed that the elephants didn\'t feel threatened by the voices of Maasai boys either.\nBut elephants react very differently to lions than they do to humans, Shannon explains.\nThis was not the case with the Maasai voices ""because that would escalate the risk,"" he says.']"

Wild elephants can distinguish between human languages, and they can tell whether a voice comes from a man, woman or boy, a new study says.\n\nThat\'s what researchers found when they played recordings of people for elephants in Kenya. Scientists say this is an advanced thinking skill that other animals haven\'t shown. It lets elephants figure out who is a threat and who isn\'t.\n\nThe result shows that while humans are studying elephants, the clever animals are also studying people and drawing on their famed powers of memory, said study author Karen McComb.\n\n""Basically they have developed this very rich knowledge of the humans that they share their habitat with,"" said McComb , a professor of animal behavior and cognition at the University of Sussex in England.\n\n""Memory is key. They must build up that knowledge somehow.""\n\nThe study was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nIt\'s close but not quite like the Dr. Seuss book, where the empathetic elephant Horton hears something that others can\'t hear.\n\nMcComb and colleagues went to Amboseli National Park in Kenya, where hundreds of wild elephants live among humans, sometimes coming in conflict over scarce water. The scientists used voice recordings of Maasai men, who on occasion kill elephants in confrontations over grazing for cattle, and Kamba men, who are less of a threat to the elephants. The recordings contained the same phrase in two different languages: ""Look over there. A group of elephants is coming.""\n\nBy about a two-to-one margin, the elephants reacted defensively — retreating and gathering in a bunch — more to the Maasai language recording because it was associated with the more threatening human tribe, said study co-author Graeme Shannon of Colorado State University.\n\n""They are making such a fine-level discrimination using human language skills,"" Shannon said. ""They\'re able to acquire quite detailed knowledge. The only way of doing this is with an exceptionally large brain.""\n\nThey repeated the experiment with recordings of Maasai men and women. Since women almost never spear elephants, the animals reacted less to the women\'s voices. The same thing happened when they substituted young boys\' voices.\n\n""Making this kind of fine distinctions in human voice patterns is quite remarkable,"" said Emory University animal cognition expert Frans de Waal, who was not part of the study.\n\nWhile it shows quite a bit about elephant intelligence and adaptability, it also indicates a problem, said biologist Josh Plotnik, founder of Think Elephants International, a research and advocacy group.\n\n""This is both fascinating in that it supports evidence we already have that these animals are behaviorally quite flexible, but also sad because it suggests that the conflict between humans and elephants is growing,"" Plotnik, who was not part of the study, wrote in an email.\n\nIn yet another experiment McComb and Shannon altered female and male voices, making female voices sound male by lowering their tone and resonance, and males sound female by raising their pitches. Those kinds of changes fool most humans, but the clever elephants weren\'t tricked, McComb said. They still moved away from the altered male voices and not the altered female voices.\n\nJournal: http://www.pnas.org\n\nSeth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears.', ""It's close but not quite like the Dr. Seuss book, where the empathetic elephant Horton hears something that others can't hear.\nThe scientists used voice recordings of Maasai men, who on occasion kill elephants in confrontations over grazing for cattle, and Kamba men, who are less of a threat to the elephants.\nIn yet another experiment McComb and Shannon altered female and male voices, making female voices sound male by lowering their tone and resonance, and males sound female by raising their pitches.\nThose kinds of changes fool most humans, but the clever elephants weren't tricked, McComb said.\nThey still moved away from the altered male voices and not the altered female voices.""]"

The pachyderms can tell certain human languages apart and even determine our gender, relative age, and whether we’re a threat, according to a new study. The work illustrates how elephants can sometimes protect themselves from human actions.\n\n“It is a most remarkable finding,” says Frans de Waal, a primatologist at Emory University in Atlanta. “Animals associating sounds with danger is nothing new—but making these fine distinctions in human voices is quite remarkable.”\n\nElephants in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park, where the study took place, are killed periodically by Maasai pastoralists. Maasai men sometimes spear the animals to protest park policies governing grazing and water rights, and sometimes in retaliation for tusking and trampling people or cattle. “Most of the time, the Maasai and elephants co-exist quite well,” says Karen McComb, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom. “But spearings do occur, and it’s clear that the elephants are tuned into the Maasai in lots of ways.”\n\nIt’s long been known that elephants flee when they encounter Maasai men wearing their distinctive red robes—yet they are far less bothered by other people on foot. Indeed, other studies have shown that the animals even distinguish between the color and scent of clothing worn by Maasai pastoralists and Kamba men, farmers who live in the same area but don’t threaten the animals.\n\nMcComb and her colleagues wondered if the Amboseli elephants could make similar distinctions between the voices of the Maasai and Kamba people. The scientists recorded men from the two ethnic groups, as well as Maasai women and boys, saying “Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming” in their respective languages. (A Maasai man speaks the phrase in the audio file above.) From a concealed loudspeaker, the team then played back the voice recordings to 47 elephant family groups (which are composed of related adult females and their dependent young) while observing and videotaping the animals’ reactions.\n\nRight “from the get-go, the elephants responded differently to the Maasai and Kamba male voices,” says study co-author Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Colorado State University, Fort Collins. They were more likely to retreat and bunch together, forming a defensive fortress around their young, and to smell the air (raising their trunks skyward) if they heard an adult Maasai man speak. But their reaction was not nearly as defensive when the voice was that of a male Kamba. The animals were also much less fearful when presented with the voices of Maasai women or boys. The scientists also altered the recordings, making the adult male voices sound more female and vice versa. But the elephants weren’t fooled and remained vigilant, the scientists report online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n“Cognitively, they know what they’re doing, and they adjust their reaction to exactly what they’re hearing,” McComb says. In a previous playback experiment, she and her colleagues showed that elephants will often come aggressively toward the loudspeaker when they hear lions (their other predator) roaring, apparently to drive them off. But when the elephants heard the adult Maasai male voices, they never showed this mobbing behavior, and instead formed a defensive bunch and retreated stealthily.\n\nAnd apparently because the Maasai men present such a serious threat, all the elephant matriarchs, including the youngest, knew how best to respond, the researchers say. “It’s a key skill,” Shannon says, “and is learned by watching; it’s likely not hardwired.” McComb adds that “older matriarchs appeared better at some voice discriminations—in particular, telling the difference between Maasai men and boys so that they only retreated when faced with men’s voices.”\n\n“This study is one more confirmation of just how intelligent and flexible elephants are,” says Joyce Poole, an elephant expert with ElephantVoices in the Maasai Mara in Kenya. “I routinely tell the Maasai I work with that the elephants are studying us more carefully than we are studying them.” The work may be helpful in preventing “human-elephant conflicts where the species co-exist,” adds Joshua Plotnik, a behavioral ecologist at Mahidol University, Kanchanaburi, in Thailand. For instance, elephants might be deterred from entering farmland or encouraged to stick to the corridors designed for their use, Poole says. “The trouble is elephants are too smart to be fooled by us for long.”\n\nConservationists are also unlikely to be able to use the elephants’ language discerning abilities to stop the poachers armed with machine guns. “The elephants have learned what to do about Maasai men,” Shannon says. “But the Maasai spear only one elephant. Poachers gun down entire families. There’s little elephants can do about that.”', 'McComb and her colleagues wondered if the Amboseli elephants could make similar distinctions between the voices of the Maasai and Kamba people.\nBut their reaction was not nearly as defensive when the voice was that of a male Kamba.\nThe scientists also altered the recordings, making the adult male voices sound more female and vice versa.\nBut when the elephants heard the adult Maasai male voices, they never showed this mobbing behavior, and instead formed a defensive bunch and retreated stealthily.\n“The elephants have learned what to do about Maasai men,” Shannon says.']"

Gox website were greeted with a spam warning letter . The warning cautions everyone about spam emails looking like they are from Mt. Gox in an attempt at phishing. Mt. Gox indicates that they never request personal information by email, and is advising everyone not to respond to any type of email asking for their personal information.Following that, late on Sunday, troubled Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., which follows a previous filing in Japan in February for bankruptcy protection. The filing is under Chapter 15, which is defined as, “Chapter 15 is a new chapter added to the Bankruptcy Code by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. It is the U.S. domestic adoption of the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency promulgated by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (""UNCITRAL"") in 1997, and it replaces section 304 of the Bankruptcy Code. Because of the UNCITRAL source for chapter 15, the U.S. interpretation must be coordinated with the interpretation given by other countries that have adopted it as internal law to promote a uniform and coordinated legal regime for cross-border insolvency cases.” This filing covers all of the interests involved in more than one country.In the court documents filed in Federal Court in Dallas, dated March 10, 2014, CEO Mark Karpeles noted that company has approximately $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets at present. He also states that Mt. Gox has no secured debt and that approximately 12 percent of the equity in Mt. Gox is held by the developer of the initial Mt. Gox software, Jed MacCaleb, with the remaining equity held by Tibbanne Co. Ltd, aka Tibanne KK, a Japanese corporation located in Japan. Karpeles also stated that the business challenges they faced were substantial denial of service attacks which forced them to shut down several times, and which ultimately led to the theft of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins owned by Mt. Gox customers and Mt. Gox itself. Those circumstances resulted in a total halt of all withdrawals on February 7, 2014.Karpeles declaration asks for the court’s assistance to “allow MtGox the breathing room necessary to address technical defects in its processing software, investigate the theft of bitcoins through its exchange, and confirm a rehabilitation plan.”While the future of Mt. Gox remains very questionable, the Bitcoin community as a whole is moving on unfazed by all the recent headlines. The losses at Mt. Gox, Flexcoin and elsewhere didn\'t seem to change prices as much as one would have expected, they\'ve remained in a somewhat steady range between $500 and $700. Many critics, however, still remain skeptical as to what the future holds for the cryptocurrency because bitcoin isn\'t tied to any regulatory bank or government policies, which makes it more susceptible to fraud and abuse, and is an excellent way for criminals to launder their money.', 'Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., which follows a previous filing in Japan in February for bankruptcy protection.\nThe filing is under Chapter 15, which is defined as, “Chapter 15 is a new chapter added to the Bankruptcy Code by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.\nGox has no secured debt and that approximately 12 percent of the equity in Mt.\nGox software, Jed MacCaleb, with the remaining equity held by Tibbanne Co.

The US case is being brought under Chapter 15 of the country's bankruptcy code, which provides a haven for foreign companies seeking to re-organise their finances.\n\nMt Gox's downfall provided fresh ammunition for bitcoin sceptics who have questioned the security and staying power of a digital currency created six years ago as an alternative to government-controlled monetary systems that rely on banks to process most transactions.\n\nOnce the world's largest exchange specialising in bitcoins, Mt Gox is now mired in a financial mess. The exchange froze its users' accounts last month and then shut down after acknowledging it couldn't account for 850,000 bitcoins. Mt Gox chief executive Robert Karpeles blamed most of the losses on computer hackers who took advantage of the exchange's flawed software.\n\nThe missing currency, valued at $US473 million at the time of Mt Gox's February 28 bankruptcy filing in Japan, represents about seven per cent of all bitcoins in worldwide circulation, according to court documents.\n\nAlthough it's based in Tokyo, Mt Gox is opening a US bankruptcy case in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in the state of Illinois on behalf of all US residents burned by the exchange's demise.\n\nThe civil complaint brought against Mt Gox by Illinois resident Gregory Greene alleges the exchange engaged in fraud and other misconduct.

Attorneys for Mt Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.\n\nMt Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers\' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.\n\nThe plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt Gox\'s US-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt Gox\'s assets. Mt Gox\'s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.\n\nThe attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.\n\n""This case involves a massive fraud,"" said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. ""They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr Karpeles. Respectfully, your honour, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse.""\n\nMt Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.\n\nAn attorney for Coinlab, which sued Mt Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behaviour by Karpeles in the days leading up the US bankruptcy filing.\n\n""We don\'t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr Karpeles,"" said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.\n\nMt Gox\'s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nThe Chapter 15 filing allows Mt Gox to ask the US Bankruptcy Court to recognise its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its US-based assets.\n\nHale\'s order protects Mt Gox\'s US assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt Gox will seek a permanent stay of US litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.\n\nKarpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all US residents who paid a trading fee to Mt Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.\n\nGreene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.\n\nMt Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of US$75 million from Mt Gox.\n\nMt Gox\'s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue US law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies\' owners.\n\nThe agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves.

An IT entrepreneur who is building his own Bitcoin exchange, Kloppenborg lost $47,000 in the collapse. ""I realised something was wrong much earlier on – I threatened legal action, and said I\'d call the banks,"" he says. ""It became a waiting game when I realised that the money was essentially frozen."" Series of Bitcoin problems The failure of Bitcoin\'s most public face is just one in a series of hiccups for the fast-rising virtual currency, after raids on online black market SilkRoad, which dealt solely in Bitcoins, and the purported unmasking of Bitcoin\'s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto (later denied by Nakamoto).\n\nFor a mathematical code which has seen its value rise from several US \xaddollars to the thousands in just five years – to be worth $US10 billion ($11.1 billion) at its height – the loss of 744,000 Bitcoins (worth $527 million at Monday\'s average exchange rate) was no doubt a shock to Bitcoin users, many of whom dedicated their trust to the service. And the community is no doubt outraged. Despite statements from Mt.Gox that the loss was a theft, resulting from flaws in the system\'s code, those demanding vigilante justice have attacked the online accounts of Mt.Gox\'s former chief Mark Karpeles, publishing his personal information and the purported bank balance of the company in 18 different currencies, including nearly $A1 million. The information has fuelled speculation that Mt.Gox\'s collapse is more fraud than theft, but provides \xadlittle hope that users will have their Bitcoins returned. In an email trail seen by The Australian Financial Review between \xadKloppenborg and Mt.Gox staff, the exchange admitted it was unable to process \xadBitcoin withdrawals quickly due to difficulty dealing with major banks. It\'s a problem that Bitcoin trader David Parrish says needs to be fixed.\n\n""It\'s still quite difficult to buy \xadBitcoins,"" says Parrish, a software en\xadgineer at Google Australia. Instead of transferring money through online exchanges, Parrish buys and sells \xadBitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders. Average price steady However, despite a seemingly catastrophic blow to a burgeoning system, Mt.Gox\'s failure appeared to expose just how little an effect one exchange could have on the global system. Though Mt.Gox\'s own price collapsed from $US1209 to $US122 shortly before bankruptcy, the average price in the wider market has managed to sustain a $500 average since its collapse, and even risen slightly in recent weeks. Its price remains volatile but it seems those committed to Bitcoin are sticking with it. ""People have been looking for reasons to not trust Bitcoin,"" says \xadSamman. ""But I think it\'s a short-term negative and long-term positive. ""You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself. It will cause people to want to have more regulation than they have in the past."" Governments globally have salivated over the prospect of regulating the currency. Russia has banned \xadBitcoin while China has restricted how banks play with the currency. Japan is contemplating rules as regulators in New York float the idea of a \xadBitcoin licence.\n\nNo plans for Australian regulations In Australia, however, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens told a parliamentary committee on Friday that he was ""not inclined to feel that we have to rush in as a regulator"". ""We have seen some pretty substantial losses incurred by Bitcoin holders in a couple of jurisdictions just in recent weeks,"" he said. ""It is a potential alternative currency so how it will hold its value is the first question. There have been countless currencies through history and the ones that survive are the ones that hold value."" Samman says BTC.sx will join the list of 127,000 creditors seeking retribution from Mt.Gox but is unsure how regulators will even tackle a corporation that deals in assets that countries do not yet recognise. ""They probably will have to tread on very careful water, the judges or whoever is involved in this bankruptcy because if they frame it in a certain way they may get a legal precedent for the legitimacy of Bitcoin,"" he says.', 'In Melbourne, 22-year-old Bitcoin trader Karl Kloppenborg was also burned by the fall of Mt.Gox.\nAn IT entrepreneur who is building his own Bitcoin exchange, Kloppenborg lost $47,000 in the collapse.\nInstead of transferring money through online exchanges, Parrish buys and sells \xadBitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders.\n""You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself.\n""We have seen some pretty substantial losses incurred by Bitcoin holders in a couple of jurisdictions just in recent weeks,"" he said.']"

Gox was once the most popular site for buying and selling the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin. But The Wall Street Journal. Mt. Gox is facing a class-action lawsuit filed in Illinois, and it has long been involved in a $75 million lawsuit with another bitcoin company, called CoinLab.\n\nThe ongoing travails of Mt. Gox act as a metaphor for the bitcoin world as a whole. Though the digital currency is beginning to remake the way the world moves and stores money, many of the companies and individuals that first pushed the technology into the mainstream are now struggling to come to terms with government regulations and the realities of doing business.\n\nAt a press conference last month, Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles admitted that the company lost around 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins — worth around half a billion dollars. He blamed a known issue in the bitcoin protocol that enabled hackers to trick the company’s software into thinking transactions failed. Apparently, Gox’s accounting software didn’t deal with this flaw and could be tricked to send repeated bitcoin payouts to the same customers.\n\nHow Mt. Gox could have lost so many bitcoins without noticing remains a matter of speculation, and many suspect foul play on the company’s part, not just mere incompetence. Among them are the hackers that hijacked Karpeles’ personal website and published a file they claim contains data acquired from the company’s servers. Included in the file was an Excel spreadsheet showing a balance of 951,116 bitcoins.\n\nThe hackers, who also hijacked Karpeles’ Reddit account, claim the document proves that Mt. Gox is still in control of those bitcoins. But given Mt. Gox’s claim that the bitcoins were stolen without anyone at the company noticing, it would make sense that the company’s official balance sheets still show a much larger number of bitcoins. Ultimately, even if the document is authentic, it proves nothing one way or the other.\n\nMany Reddit users claim to have found their own transaction data in the spreadsheet, suggesting that the materials are authentic. But Forbes reporter Andy Greenberg warns that the zip file may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins — and cautions people not to download the file. Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox responded to a request for comment about the spreadsheet’s origins or authenticity.\n\nThe alleged hack follows a number of other leaks and hacks from the company, including a leaked internal document about the missing bitcoins and supposed copies of the code used to run the exchange.

There reportedly are four Bitcoin ATMs in Austin, and four in the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Edmonton.\n\nCoindesk, which carries news about Bitcoin and the exchange rates for the currency, reports that a new patent shows Bitcoin has been part of eBay\'s planning since 2011.\n\nStill, economist Nouriel Roubini, better known as ""Dr. Doom,"" has tweeted that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.\n\nConsumers ""can\'t trust a currency that goes through valuation swings like this,"" Enderle said, ""and given that the U.S. is moving aggressively against the use of these currencies, it\'s doubtful that the current generation will survive.""\n\nRichard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it\'s all leading to.

Gox bitcoin exchange is spilling into U.S. bankruptcy court as the company scrambles for legal cover after losing digital currency valued at $473 million.\n\nMt. Gox's bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday supplements a similar petition made in Japan late last month following the exchange's abrupt closure. The U.S. case is being brought under Chapter 15 of the country's bankruptcy code, which provides a haven for foreign companies seeking to reorganize their finances.\n\nMt. Gox's downfall provided fresh ammunition for bitcoin skeptics who have questioned the security and staying power of a digital currency created six years ago as an alternative to government-controlled monetary systems that rely on banks to process most transactions.\n\nOnce the world's largest exchange specializing in bitcoins, Mt. Gox is now mired in a financial mess. The exchange froze its users' accounts last month and then shut down after acknowledging it couldn't account for 850,000 bitcoins. Mt. Gox CEO Robert Karpeles blamed most of the losses on computer hackers who took advantage of the exchange's flawed software.\n\nThe missing currency, valued at $473 million at the time of Mt. Gox's Feb. 28 bankruptcy filing in Japan, represents about 7 per cent of all bitcoins in worldwide circulation, according to court documents.\n\nAlthough it's based in Tokyo, Mt. Gox is opening a U.S. bankruptcy case in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in Illinois on behalf of all U.S. residents burned by the exchange's demise.\n\nThe civil complaint brought against Mt. Gox by Illinois resident Gregory Greene alleges the exchange engaged in fraud and other misconduct. The suit is seeking to be certified as a class action that would represent all U.S. residents who had paid fees to Mt. Gox as part of a bitcoin trade or had their accounts frozen.\n\nSteven Woodrow, a Denver attorney representing Greene, estimates hundreds of thousands of people could be represented in the case. In a Monday interview, Woodrow said he still intends to seek a federal court order that would freeze Mt. Gox's computers and other assets in the U.S. A hearing on Woodrow's request for the court order is scheduled for Tuesday in Chicago.\n\nIf the Illinois case proceeds, Mt. Gox attorneys contend that it will drain the company's finances and divert management's attention during a critical time.\n\nMt. Gox's bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $64 million and assets of $38 million.\n\nMt. Gox also is hoping to use U.S. bankruptcy laws to ward off another lawsuit filed last year in a Seattle federal court by a former U.S. partner, CoinLab Action.\n\nUnder an agreement signed in November 2012, CoinLab was supposed to use Mt. Gox's technology to run a bitcoin exchange in the U.S. and Canada. The alliance unraveled within a few months, prompting CoinLab to sue Mt. Gox for alleged breach of contract.

Gox completely imploded and filed for bankruptcy. Since that happened, the people who lost $350 million are understandably a wee bit upset and would like to know how, exactly, millions of dollars evaporated. Turns out, it might have been an inside job.\n\n\n\nHackers broke into both the personal blog and the Reddit account of Mark Karpeles, the CEO of Mt. Gox, to decry Mt. Gox’s complete silence on the issue, right about the time a whole bunch of data dropped about what’s on Mt. Gox’s servers. Turns out, something hinky may be in the works, according to CNET:\n\nThe data dump claims that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The embattled exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, saying that Mt. Gox lost nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of the exchange’s own bitcoins. CNET could not independently confirm the veracity of the claims, but some Reddit users said they were able to confirm that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, which was posted in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.\n\nIf true, that means there are 100,000 Bitcoins, currently valued at more than $600 million, that are unaccounted for and that Mt. Gox might be covering something up. This has to be tempered with the acknowledgement that this is an anonymous data dump, and the Bitcoin community is no more immune to trolling than any other subculture on the Internet. Also, Karpeles is not the most popular of people right now, for obvious reasons.\n\nThat said, it certainly raises a few questions. Hopefully these questions will be addressed, especially as Mt. Gox tries to shut down; it just filed for bankruptcy in the US as well.\n\nVia CNET', 'Since that happened, the people who lost $350 million are understandably a wee bit upset and would like to know how, exactly, millions of dollars evaporated.\nTurns out, it might have been an inside job.\nGox’s complete silence on the issue, right about the time a whole bunch of data dropped about what’s on Mt.\nIf true, that means there are 100,000 Bitcoins, currently valued at more than $600 million, that are unaccounted for and that Mt.\nGox tries to shut down; it just filed for bankruptcy in the US as well.']"

It was reported Sunday that Mt. Gox, one of the world’s biggest exchange platforms, suffered 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its shutdown.\n\nAfter years of the peer-to-peer decentralized system decrying government officials getting involved, should the bitcoin community accept authorities entering into the market? If so, is it justifiable?\n\nOver the past year, since the rise of bitcoin and its growing acceptance among the Internet landscape and merchants, numerous central banks and federal governments have outlined a series of messages: it won’t be held responsible if any digital holdings vanish. The institutions have also urged its citizens to be cautious because the cryptocurrency is volatile, risky and vulnerable to security attacks.\n\nBitcoiners, who many believe to be “techno-libertarians,” scoffed at the suggestion that authority figures should even intervene. The state of New York is in the midst of issuing bitlicenses for businesses transacting with bitcoins, while some federal lawmakers are calling for heightened regulation or outright bans of the virtual currency. Japan has also mulled over the idea of intervening following the failure of Mt. Gox, but instead wants international cooperation.\n\nAlthough bitcoin was founded on the premise of being decentralized and anonymous and therefore anti-government, using the tools of government could very well be legitimate and still consistent in the digital currency’s principles. However, its very nature could prove troublesome for some cash-strapped governments because of the intricacies involved.\n\nIndeed, in a libertarian society, free markets prevail but there is still a role for a government: enforcement of contracts, the protection of private property, safety from fraud and defense against force. The same could be applied here: an invasion of property was undertaken and theft transpired so authorities must investigate and detain the alleged perpetrators. It’s as simple as that and perhaps consistent in the libertarian message.\n\nIt has become rather prevalent that several leading bitcoin individuals and organizations have called for regulation of the digital currency. We reported that Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, called for bitcoin regulation. It was also discovered last month that the Bitcoin Foundation, which has also urged for regulatory actions, worked with the New York prosecutor’s office in its probe of Mt. Gox.\n\nOn top of all of this, one whistleblower is threatening to unveil a web of corruption at the Bitcoin Foundation. Identified as Two-Bit Idiot, he published a blog post on Tumblr entitled “Coup or Death for the Bitcoin Foundation?” He plans to post another article listing “damning facts,” including:\n\n“There is evidence that Bitcoin Foundation board members may have had direct access to Mark Karpeles which allowed them to personally deposit and withdraw funds from Mt. Gox, despite persistent delays for other customers.”\n\nAfter a leadership that has decried government coercion against bitcoin, it now seems the same individuals are running to the government for help. Is this the step that the bitcoin community wants to take next? Since the currency is decentralized and there is actual “leader per se, it could be proven difficult to solicit the opinions of its base. Sure, the leadership may want regulations, but what about the people? The people should say if they want regulation or not.', 'With three bitcoin exchanges shutting down after experiencing thefts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, some in the bitcoin community are urging government regulation and intervention to protect consumers.\nAfter years of the peer-to-peer decentralized system decrying government officials getting involved, should the bitcoin community accept authorities entering into the market?\nWe reported that Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, called for bitcoin regulation.\nOn top of all of this, one whistleblower is threatening to unveil a web of corruption at the Bitcoin Foundation.\nIs this the step that the bitcoin community wants to take next?']"

Gox, the former major Bitcoin exchange, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as part of a bid to protect itself from legal action in this country. The exchange had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan back in February, but had avoided doing so in the United States. This latest move was almost certainly precipitated by Sunday’s announcement that hackers had breached Mt. Gox’s records and were publishing data dumps “proving” that Mt. Gox still possessed roughly 950,000 Bitcoins — far more than the 850,000 the company claims to have lost.\n\nConsidering that 850,000 BTC is still worth roughly $530 million at today’s exchange rates, it’s easy to see why so many people are incensed at the actions of Mt. Gox and the disappearance of its CEO, Mark Karpeles. Reports on Mt. Gox’s troubles over the past few months paint Karpeles as distracted, poorly organized, and ultimately more interested in launching a Bitcoin cafe in the same building as the exchange rather than working to solve the security problems of the site itself.\n\nThe hackers released screenshots and other data that purport to show Mt. Gox moving hundreds of BTC to customer wallets even after “transaction malleability” issues had supposedly prevented Mt. Gox from making any transactions at all. Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US allows the company to protect its US assets and recognize its declaration of bankruptcy in US Courts. It can be contested by US creditors.\n\nUnfortunately for Karpeles, filing for legal protection in the United States immediately after hackers claim to have discovered allegations of criminal misconduct will almost certainly fan the flames of the investors and BTC owners already calling for his head. Bankruptcy protection is not an absolute shield — it can protect a company from being chopped up and liquidated by creditors (at least, for a little while) — but it doesn’t shield a company from criminal charges or theft of property.\n\nOne word of caution, however, before accepting the word of the hacking crew as gospel: others have noted that attempts to read Mt. Gox’s activities through the block chain are exceptionally difficult, partly because the software that performs deep block chain analysis is still in its infancy. Similarly, pouring through hundreds of megabytes of records doesn’t automatically link those logged transactions with the block chain history.\n\nEven if data released by the hack is legitimate, it will take a great deal of time to establish its authenticity and confirm that Mt. Gox is or isn’t criminally absconding with other people’s money. If the company has engaged in criminal fraud, than filing bankruptcy won’t save it. If it hasn’t, then the leaks may end up shedding light on how the attacks against Mt. Gox were carried out — which could, in turn, lead to criminal negligence charges depending on the nature of the security breaches.\n\nIt’s clear that Mark Karpeles had neither the intelligence nor the discipline to lead a major Bitcoin exchange, but teasing out the details of the attacks and establishing Mt. Gox’s culpability is going to take time. Meanwhile, the overarching situation around BTC continues to take its own bizarre turns. On Friday, BTC blogger Ryan Selkis promised to unleash information that would destroy the legitimacy of the Bitcoin Foundation by elaborating on various unspecified “damning facts.”\n\nOn Monday, Selkis declared that he had made a tactical error and would not be publishing said facts, leaving the community with plenty of questions and a great deal of mud to fling — but not much more. Then there’s last week’s battle over the identity of Sakoshi Nakamoto who may (or may not) be a 64-year-old man living in the Los Angeles foothills. In every instance, who you believe depends far more on faith than on hard fact. Speculation on the motivations and identities of the players runs just as rampant as speculation on cryptocurrencies themselves.', 'Gox, the former major Bitcoin exchange, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as part of a bid to protect itself from legal action in this country.\nThe exchange had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan back in February, but had avoided doing so in the United States.\nGox still possessed roughly 950,000 Bitcoins — far more than the 850,000 the company claims to have lost.\nGox moving hundreds of BTC to customer wallets even after “transaction malleability” issues had supposedly prevented Mt.\nFiling for bankruptcy protection in the US allows the company to protect its US assets and recognize its declaration of bankruptcy in US Courts.']"

The hacker or hackers themselves say they were careful to strip out any passwords from the database. But other reports suggest that a second scam could be involved, with an application contained within the zip file, called TibanneBackOffice, apparently stealing users’ bitcoin wallets.\n\nThe hackers imply that one particular line in the data, which shows MtGox as holding 951,000 bitcoins at the time of its collapse, is proof of the company’s malfeasance, annotating the line with the comment: “That fat fuck has been lying!!” However, others who have downloaded the database point out that it remains possible that MtGox’s internal accounts were out of sync with the amount of money they actually held.\n\nRoubini: it’s a Ponzi scheme\n\nThe release of the MtGox database followed a stinging attack on bitcoin by influential economist Nouriel Roubini.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Roubini said that, apart from a base for criminal activities, “bitcoin is not a currency”. “Bitcoin is not a unit of account as no price of goods and services is set in Bitcoin unit nor it ever will. So it isn’t a currency,” he added.\n\nInstead, he contended that bitcoin is between “a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn’t safe given hacking of it.”\n\nA Ponzi, or “pyramid”, scheme relies on taking money from people joining it to pay out as interest to people who joined earlier; as such it is unsustainable. Bernie Madoff operated a giant pyramid scheme, for which he was jailed. But pyramid schemes were also blamed for a collapse in the Albanian economy in 1996/7, when they amounted to almost half of the country’s GDP - and their collapse led to civil war and thousands of deaths.\n\nLess damage seems to have been caused by a site called “Ponzicoin”, which offered 120% repayments on bitcoins deposited with it through what its creator openly acknowledged was a pyramid scheme - illegal in a number of countries. According to the site’s creator, all depositors have been refunded; he blamed hackers for compromising his site and, he said, making it appear that he had run off with their money.\n\n• US prosecutors last year charged a man in Texas with running a bitcoin Ponzi scheme\n\n', '“It’s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,” the hackers wrote on Karpeles’ blog, “Magical Tux“ (and crossposted to Pastebin).\nThe hacker or hackers themselves say they were careful to strip out any passwords from the database.\nRoubini: it’s a Ponzi schemeThe release of the MtGox database followed a stinging attack on bitcoin by influential economist Nouriel Roubini.\nBernie Madoff operated a giant pyramid scheme, for which he was jailed.\n• US prosecutors last year charged a man in Texas with running a bitcoin Ponzi scheme']"

Bruce Feinstein, Esq., a bankruptcy attorney in Queens, New York, is using this recent news to shed light on the questions surrounding digital currency and bankruptcy in an increasingly global economy.\n\n“My clients are new to the Bitcoin phenomenon, some of them have never even heard of it,” says Mr. Feinstein. “But that only further underlines the fact that we need to start informing ourselves about Bitcoin and how to treat it when it comes to bankruptcy. One day we may all be dealing in digital currency, and our federal and state laws must provide the proper legal pathways to handle the issues that arise in our evolving global financial market.”\n\nBitcoin is a form of decentralized digital currency established in 2009. It uses cryptography to control the creation and transfer of funds, and bitcoin holders can transfer the money using a special software on their computers and mobile devices. The Bitcoin phenomenon spawned a number of start-ups and trading companies, one of which was Mt. Gox. The company grew into a major player in the Bitcoin industry, only to be toppled when hackers stole approximately $460 million, or 850, 000 bitcoins according to a Wired Magazine article published on March 3, 2014. Mt. Gox subsequently filed for bankruptcy after stopping trades and refusing to pay out its investors.\n\nIt’s stories like these that take innovations like Bitcoin and turn them into nightmare scenarios. Mr Feinstein adds, “On the surface, a company like Mt. Gox is a wonderful entrepreneurial concept. But when you’re working in a new financial market that is taking place outside the banking industry and outside the Fed, you begin to encounter safety concerns such as lack of regulation, possible money laundering, and cyber attacks.”\n\nAnd when a cyber attack did affect Mt. Gox, the result was devastating for the company and its investors. Mr. Feinstein advocates a discussion about creating a legal structure for digital currencies that will protect those who invest in them and develop them. Mt. Gox entered the equivalent of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., and Mr. Feinstein’s firm – which provides Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy aid - continues to monitor this developing story.\n\nThe Law Offices of Bruce Feinstein, Esq. has nearly two decades of experience in bankruptcy law, helping clients and families resolve their issues and move forward with their lives.

Acura sold 165,000 vehicles in the U.S. last year, down considerably from the peak of 209,610 it sold in 2005.\n\nIndustry veteran Michael Accavitti will become senior vice president and general manager of the Acura Division, the Japanese automaker said Monday. He previously headed national marketing of both the Honda and Acura brands.

Acura’s initial sedans, the Legend and smaller Integra were well received when they were introduced in the late 1980s.\n\nBut successive sedans haven’t matched up “and they have struggled to communicate a solid image,” Brinley said.\n\nThat’s left Acura as more of a sport-utility vehicle company. Just two SUVs, the MDX and RDX, accounted for almost 60% of the brand’s sales last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStyling also has held Acura back, gyrating from conservative to outrageous “and neither has worked particularly well,” said Jack Nerad, an analyst at auto information company Kelley Blue Book.\n\n“They need a model or two with great exterior styling that can change people’s perceptions about the brand,” Nerad said.\n\nThe new structure demonstrates that Honda is prepared to devote the resources necessary to “revitalize” Acura, said John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda Motor Co., who will oversee both brands.\n\n“This move obviously reflects the deep commitment we have for the future of Acura,” Mendel said.\n\n“We have done a good job with the SUVs but we have struggled with the sedans,” Mendel said. “There is a lot of recognition that Acura could be and should be a much stronger brand than it is today.”\n\nIn addition to separating the two brands, Honda also has established the Acura Business Planning Office, which will set the global direction for Acura products.

With a 4.7-inch 1080p display, 10-megapixel camera and slimmer build, please. Coming right up, sir. That\'ll be $649.99.\n\nA new iPhone 6 concept design by Sam Beckett, fulfills most of our fondest dreams for Apple\'s next flagship, but also presents a fairly realistic representation of what we can expect when the iPhone 6 finally debuts. The concept design bears the very clever name ""iPhone Air,"" and features that 4-inch-plus display we\'ve all been dreaming about.\n\nIn Beckett\'s design, the iPhone 6 features a 4.7-inch display with a 1080p resolution and pixel density of 468 ppi. It\'s not exactly a stretch of the imagination to think that Apple is getting on the bigger display train, especially since several leaks have indicated that Apple is testing multiple display sizes for the iPhone 6. It also makes sense to see this concept sporting a very, very slight, nearly invisible bezel around the display. Recently leaked photos showed the same design idea and it follows the trend set in motion by the iPhone 5, with its very minimal bezels.\n\nThe iPhone Air concept shows a thinner profile of just 7-millimeters thick. Although it may not be thin enough to earn the title ""iPhone Air,"" Beckett\'s concept makes sense, so far. After all, Apple probably won\'t make the iPhone 6 that much thinner, at least not as thin as some of the curved design concepts show. Beckett added a sapphire glass display to his design, instead of the traditional Gorilla Glass. This particular design move is perhaps the most believable, given the fact that Apple has recently pushed to open multiple sapphire glass factories, including one in Arizona.\n\nBeckett gave his concept a faster A8 processor and upped the camera resolution for his design, bringing it up from 8-megapixels to 10-megapixels. Otherwise, the iPhone Air concept follows Apple\'s design aesthetic and doesn\'t make too many changes, but that is what makes it so believable. Most tech pundits don\'t expect the iPhone 6 to be revolutionary in comparison with other smartphones that are currently on the market. The most exciting thing about the iPhone 6 will probably be its larger display. Beyond that, not too much is currently anticipated.\n\nOf course, it\'s early yet and Apple has a lot of time to come up with an even bigger wow-factor than its first-ever foray into making a 4-inch-plus iPhone.

An iPhone 6 concept video from Sam Beckett ofThe Verge suggests a potential direction for Apple, an iPhone Air.\n\nBeckett created some internet buzz with the video as his suggested iPhone Air brought together many of the iPhone 6 release rumors that have been scattered across the internet. Probably the biggest rumor to date has to do with screen size and the durability of the retina display on the iPhone 6. Apple is in tweaking mode on the iPhone, which could eventually spell trouble for them in an increasingly saturated smartphone market. One thing that Apple does well however, is listen to their consumers and make relevant design changes.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns with the iPhone 5S release was that there was still more Apple could do with screen size. This iPhone 6 concept video suggests that Apple may increase the screen size by as much as 17 percent and increasing the number of pixels by 68 percent. A thinner design has been part of the thinking in line with the iPad Air direction that Apple has taken. There is some thinking that Apple will only have an iPad Air release this year and not another iPad Mini.\n\nSome screen suggestions for the iPhone 6 release have shown a complete elimination of visible edges on the next edition of Apple’s flagship phone. While this design is highly unlikely, the concept video by Beckett does show a more minimalist design than the iPhone 5S. Screen size rumors are not the only thing Apple buyers are interested in. In a fast paced, constantly changing market, iPhone users wanted more speed and quicker processing capabilities. The iPad has already lost considerable ground in the world of tablets and Apple doesn’t want to see the same thing for their phone.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion surrounding the development of the A8 chip, to be utilized in the iPhone 6 release. Apparently, Samsung has been cut out of production and now the Tawainese group TSMC is primarily manufacturing the chip for Apple. It seems the A8 and Sapphire glass screen will be the big sellers on the iPhone 6.\n\nSo when can data consuming iPhone users expect the next generation to be available on the market? According to most recent speculation, the iPhone 6 release date could come sometime in late Summer.\n\n[Image via Apple-Singapore]', 'The iPhone 6 release rumors are ramping up and that means concept and design videos floating across the internet.\nAn iPhone 6 concept video from Sam Beckett ofThe Verge suggests a potential direction for Apple, an iPhone Air.\nThis iPhone 6 concept video suggests that Apple may increase the screen size by as much as 17 percent and increasing the number of pixels by 68 percent.\nThere is some thinking that Apple will only have an iPad Air release this year and not another iPad Mini.\nWhile this design is highly unlikely, the concept video by Beckett does show a more minimalist design than the iPhone 5S.']"

In the past, Apple has increased screen resolution in a manner that would not encourage fragmentation when it comes to app development, so it will certainly be interesting to see what resolution the bigger iPhones will actually have, and whether they’d actually get to Full HD.\n\nThe video showing this iPhone 6 concept follows below.', 'In the wide variety of iPhone 6 concept videos that hit the web on a regular basis, a new clip stands out for potentially showing a next-generation iPhone concept that actually makes sense, considering Apple’s way of doing things.\nBut overall, the iPhone Air looks like a phone you’d expect to see from the Cupertino-based company.\nAccording to Beckett, the phone is 8% larger than the iPhone 5s, and 9% thinner (at 7mm vs 7.6mm for the iPhone 5s), while the display is 17% bigger than the iPhone 5s’.\nThe iPhone Air would have a 1920 x 1080 resolution display with 468 pixel-per-inch (PPI), covered by Sapphire glass.\nOther features of the iPhone Air include a 10-megapixel camera with an aperture of f/1.8 and a fingerprint sensor.']"

Meet the promising, yet entirely imagined, iPhone Air.\n\nWe’ve heard rumors that Apple will be adding some real estate to the display of the next-generation iPhone, and Beckett’s video shows a display that’s 17 percent larger with 68 percent more pixels. Specifically, his concept has a 4.7-inch 1080p display, with 468 pixels per inch.\n\nThe “iPhone Air” also measures 7mm thick, which is slightly (0.6mm) less girthy than the iPhone 5s. Beckett also suggests tossing out that Corning Gorilla Glass (which has been a staple of the iPhone for so many years) for a sapphire crystal display. Sapphire crystal is the same material used in current iPhones’ cameras, and is responsible for that fun blue/purple glare you get in some photos.\n\nFinally, Beckett’s concept uses a 10-megapixel shooter and a faster A8 chip.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the “iPhone Air” concept is that it doesn’t go too far out in terms of design. In fact, it looks almost identical to the iPhone 5s design, with the same TouchId sensor and a similar look and feel in terms of shape.\n\nMost concept designers do something more crazy with their iPhone ideas, like curving the entire back of the phone or pulling from iPad designs. But not Beckett. Everything shown in this video seems possible, given Apple’s engineering prowess, though it may affect the bottom line considering the extra costs for these adjustments.\n\nAgain: This video was not created by Apple, nor were the designs shown within it.\n\n[via TNW]', 'This is one such concept design, from Sam Beckett, which is actually quite realistic.\nThe “iPhone Air” also measures 7mm thick, which is slightly (0.6mm) less girthy than the iPhone 5s.\nBeckett also suggests tossing out that Corning Gorilla Glass (which has been a staple of the iPhone for so many years) for a sapphire crystal display.\nWhat’s interesting about the “iPhone Air” concept is that it doesn’t go too far out in terms of design.\nIn fact, it looks almost identical to the iPhone 5s design, with the same TouchId sensor and a similar look and feel in terms of shape.']"

Making and receiving calls (19 percent), browsing the web (19 percent), and taking photos and videos (19 percent) were most commonly cited by likely buyers as sought-after features, NPD said.\n\nThere are still problems that are keeping wearable products from broader adoption, though. NPD analysts noted that people believe smart glasses can easily be broken and that most smartwatches are too large, unattractive and have a short battery life. Fitness bands also suffer from an image problem with consumers citing many of the previously mentioned problems and adding in that they fear they will lose interest in the device.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

During a talk at South by Southwest on Sunday, Android head Sundar Pichai said an Android SDK for wearables is coming down the pipeline in two weeks, and will give developers the tools they need to make Android-based smartwatches and fitness trackers.\n\nPichai said Google thinks of wearables in terms of sensors that need to communicate to be helpful for users. “We want to build an API so these sensors can work together,” he said.\n\n“When we say wearables, we think about it as a much broader conception. [But] that’s for partners and developers to figure out.”\n\nWatches and activity trackers are the most obvious wearable categories that developers can begin working on, but Pichai said Google wants to offer an Android framework that goes far beyond traditional form factors.\n\n“When we say wearables, we think about it as a much broader conception,” he said. “[But] that’s for partners and developers to figure out. We are thinking about it as software… a jacket one day with sensors. I don’t know.”\n\nThe wearables SDK follows on the heels of the Android for cars initiative that Google announced at CES earlier this year. The two are related, Pichai said, because Google thinks in terms of a unified software ecosystem. That extends to its new acquisition Nest, too.\n\n“We see an ecosystem for all these devices,” Pichai said. “We want to develop a set of common protocols so they all work together.”\n\nWill Glass soon have a stablemate in Google\'s wearables line-up? Pichai wasn\'t telling.\n\nOf course, by releasing an SDK in short order, Google creates an essential feedback loop. In essence, third-party developers can seed Google with helpful data before the company announces any home-brewed wearables of its own.\n\nAnd you can breathe a sigh of relief, Google+ haters: No Google+ account will be required for your new Android-based wearables to function.\n\nA plethora of possibilities\n\nWill we see Google-branded wearables? Maybe. Pichai said Google has ventured into phone and tablet manufacturing to show partners like Samsung how the ideal device marries hardware and software. But Pichai also said Google doesn’t want OEMs to think Google is giving itself an unfair advantage.\n\n“What makes a platform successful is having the discipline to make sure that everything Google can do on top of a platform is something that other people can do as well,” he said.\n\nPichai extolled the virtues of Android’s open nature and pointed to Nokia and Amazon’s Android devices as examples of how companies can build on top of the platform without baking in Google’s own services—though that’s also an option. Hardware manufacturers can twist and mold the operating system to the extent that users don’t even realize they have an Android device.\n\nMany so-called low-end Android devices were on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, but even the sub-$100 phones are increasing in quality, Pichai said.\n\n“There are phones for every segment and the quality of these phones are pretty good,” he said. “The impact of that is huge I think.”\n\nNow that Android phones and tablets are well-covered territory, we’re expecting other Google to shift focus to other form factors at its upcoming I/O conference. Pichai predictably hinted at little of what the company will announce in June, but it looks like car tech and wearables are top priority.\n\nThis story, ""Google\'s Android boss announces SDK specifically geared toward wearables"" was originally published by TechHive .', 'Pichai said Google thinks of wearables in terms of sensors that need to communicate to be helpful for users.\nI don’t know.”The wearables SDK follows on the heels of the Android for cars initiative that Google announced at CES earlier this year.\nIn essence, third-party developers can seed Google with helpful data before the company announces any home-brewed wearables of its own.\nBut Pichai also said Google doesn’t want OEMs to think Google is giving itself an unfair advantage.\nThis story, ""Google\'s Android boss announces SDK specifically geared toward wearables"" was originally published by TechHive .']"

We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.""\n\nPichai discussed how Google wants to develop a common ground for all of these sensors so protocols can be established and products can communicate and work together.\n\nJust as what Android did for smartphones and tablets, it can create sort of a ""big bang"" for wearable technology that can pave the way for millions of wearable device applications and possibly other kinds of wearable gadgets.\n\nThe company is launching the SDK well ahead of the plans to roll out other wearable devices so it can get enough feedback and also help developers visualize what the search engine company plans to do in the wearable technology niche.\n\n""I think we\'re just scratching the surface. Android is one of the most open systems I\'ve ever seen. What makes Android great is it\'s literally designed from the ground up to be customised in a very powerful way,"" Pichai said. ""We do have business relationships, we do do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory you can use Android without Google. If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it\'s not exclusive - you can preload any other services you want.""\n\nHaving a good platform to start on and tapping the help of the whole developer community, manufacturers will lighten their load and can focus on developing more hardware as the baby industry of wearables crawls and evolves.\n\nPichai told the audience at SXSW that Google has sold millions of units of the plug-in device Chromecast in the United States. The $35-gadget that can stream music and video to any compatible HDTV will also be rolled out this year across global markets.\n\nHe also touched on Project Ara, comparing the modular smartphone into application programming interfaces (API) for hardware that will enable consumers to build their handset according to their needs.\n\nAsked about Nest Labs, Pichai did not directly say that consumers will be required to have a Google+ account to make the most of Nest products but clarified that the company is looking at ways to have connectivity into the Google ecosystem.\n\nThe Google executive did not disclose more details about the SDK for wearable devices and most likely it will be rolled out without too much fanfare.\n\nHaving a tool to develop apps for wearable devices will certainly boost the industry but it will not be a walk in the park for Google, especially with Apple around and other manufacturers using Android on other devices that now look to have a certain distance from the platform to develop their own identity as a brand.\n\nⓒ 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

He spoke to The Verge about how Google would like to standardize the way those sensors send their data to the Android operating system, which would conveniently also “allow device manufacturers to opt for Android instead of a custom OS.”\n\nThough the VP didn’t talk about any wearables in the making, it stands to reason that Google’s efforts to expand Android’s relevance to the wearables market could hint at the possibility that a Google smartwatch on the way, The Verge notes.\n\nMore From Wall St. Cheat Sheet:', 'Google Inc.

The Android and Chrome chief recently spoke up about Chromecast coming to other regions and has revealed that a wearable SDK for Android will be released in two weeks.\n\nThe timing of this news is rather reactive, considering Samsung just switched its Gear lineup from Android to Tizen OS, its own platform built with Intel. The move was seen as a cut from Samsung, possibly knocking one big manufacturer off the table when Android for wearables becomes big.\n\nThe wearable SDK for Android will be available for manufacturers who want to build watches and bands, we suspect.

But where development of new wearable technology is concerned, the fun is just beginning, a top Google executive said Sunday.\n\nWearable gadgets aren’t just smart versions of glasses or watches, but also anything that embeds sensors that can collect data and deliver it to devices that can then better serve their users, said Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Chrome, Android and apps at Google. And where that broader wearables market is concerned, “we are just scratching the surface,” he said.\n\nPichai discussed wearables and all things Android in an on-stage interview with author and Federated Media founder John Battelle at SXSW Interactive in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.\n\nGoogle’s Wearable Strategy: Everything And Then Some\n\nIt is often easy to forget that Google isn’t necessarily a hardware company. It partners with manufacturers to make smartphones and tablets under the Nexus series and also has a manufacturer build Google Glass for it. Chromebooks with Chrome OS are made by partners. When the Motorola sale to Lenovo becomes official, Google will be officially out of any part of the hardware manufacturing game.\n\nSee also: Google To Release Android Software Developer Kit For Wearables\n\nWhich means that if and when Google comes out with a smartwatch, it will be in conjunction with some type of manufacturing partner. The rumors now are pointing to a Google smartwatch in conjunction with LG to be announced at its Google I/O at the end of June. In the meantime, Google will make a play to dominate the wearable world in the same way it does the mobile world with a new software developer kit for Android to be released this month.\n\n“In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android [wearables]. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,” Pichai said. “When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors. Sensors can be small and powerful and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.”\n\nGoogle doesn’t think of wearable gadgets as just smartwatches, fitness bands, or Google Glass, Pichai said. Any type of wearable technology, be it sensors embedded in your jacket or your shoe, is the target Google is shooting for. It is the essence of the connected self that Google wants, and it needs developers to build the applications necessary to achieve that reality.\n\nPichai did not say how long Google has been working on the wearable SDK, but Apigee developers Prabhat Jha and Ed Anuff figured that Google could put together a skeleton SDK (like the initial one Google released for Chromecast recently) in two weeks or a fully featured one in about six months. The question of how long Google has been working on the wearable SDK is pertinent after Samsung ditched Android for Linux-based Tizen in its new Gear 2 and Gear Fit smartwatches.\n\nIs Google just reacting to Samsung, or has it long planned to release an SDK intended to dominate the wearable space? We will learn when the wearables SDK drops in a couple of weeks and software developers give us their impressions on its depth and capabilities.\n\nThe View From Android Central\n\nPichai also discussed Android at length, although his spiel on the subject hasn’t evolved much. To wit: Android is open-source and freely available to anyone and has great benefit to manufacturers and developers because of its massive scale.\n\n“Android is one of the most open systems I’ve ever seen. What makes Android great is it’s literally designed from the ground up to be customized in a very powerful way,” Pichai said.\n\nAs with any mega company with a platform that affects millions upon millions of people, Google gets its fair share of speculation, gossip and general interest into what actually happens with Android. What does Google think of Amazon and Nokia’s use of Android? Is Android really free? What kind of stipulations does Google give its business partners? What is really the relationship between Samsung and Google like?\n\nAmid all that speculation, Pichai sat down to … reaffirm the official talking points Google has laid out for Android.\n\n“Nothing that we do is ever exclusive,” Pichai said about Android licensing agreements and placing Google services on devices from hardware manufacturers like Samsung or HTC. “We do have business relationships, we do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory you can use Android without Google. If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it’s not exclusive—you can preload any other services you want.”\n\nPichai and Google will insist forever that nothing nefarious is going on with Android. They respect users privacy, they are not racketeering manufacturers into Google Mobile services and so forth. The Android Open Source Project is open to all that wish to use it. Google Mobile Services is a contractual agreement where Google’s apps get pre-loaded onto manufacturers’ smartphones.\n\nThis is the essential white and black of Android, and neither Pichai nor Google will go into what individual business contracts look like with each one of its partners. When it comes to Android, Google sets performance and design standards and benchmarks and will be involved in the quality assurance testing of mobile devices. How manufacturers customize devices and what they pre-load onto it is of less concern to Google than making sure that the Google apps and cloud integration are present.', 'Google may be commonly associated with Google Glass, one of the most striking, and perhaps strangest, wearable devices out there.\nGoogle’s Wearable Strategy: Everything And Then SomeIt is often easy to forget that Google isn’t necessarily a hardware company.\n“In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android [wearables].\n“We do have business relationships, we do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android.\nWhen it comes to Android, Google sets performance and design standards and benchmarks and will be involved in the quality assurance testing of mobile devices.']"

1309,http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/03/googles-android-based-wearable-device-platform-launches-in-two-weeks/,technology,"['In an interview at SXSW, Sundar Pichai, Google\'s head of Android, Chrome, and Apps, announced that Google will be jumping into the wider wearables space with an Android-based SDK focused on wearable devices. The new SDK will be released to developers in just two weeks with the hope of getting feedback from them. And like Android for smartphones, Google will be developing a device-agnostic app platform for wearable computers.\n\n\n\nWhile it\'s easy to imagine this platform as ""Android for watches,"" Pichai said the company was thinking ""more broadly"" and, according to the Wall Street Journal, pitched an idea for a jacket with tons of sensors. Google is rumored to be working on smartwatch of its own, but Pichai declined to say if Google is working on any devices. Instead, Pichai said he thinks about the wearables market at ""a platform level."" This ""platform"" idea move perfectly mirrors Android\'s strategy in smartphones and tablets, where Google licenses the OS out to other OEMs to produce hardware, and Google uses its influence over the software to drive people toward Google services.\n\nWhile on the surface it would make sense for Google to launch a wearables platform in the same vein as Android, this outcome wasn\'t a foregone conclusion. Google\'s other wearables project, Google Glass, is definitely not a platform that is welcoming to outside manufacturers. With Glass, Google is going the Apple route with a closed-off, fully vertical device where Google controls the hardware and software. None of the special Glass parts are shared with outside developers or OEMs. Google accepts app submissions for Glass, but it strictly controls what is and is not allowed in the Glass store—for instance, facial recognition apps are banned for no reason other than the fact that Google doesn\'t like them.\n\nIt was easy to imagine the Glass OS being the future of Google\'s wearable strategy. The minimal, low-resolution, voice-based OS could have translated easily to a watch. But with the release of a proper Android SDK, Google Glass is looking less like ""the future"" of wearables at Google and more like a one-off, siloed experiment.\n\nA proper Google wearables platform should mean that Google will finally start making wearable-focused apps. The biggest problem with wearables so far, like Google Glass and the Samsung Galaxy Gear , has been a lack of useful apps. Google is one of the biggest mobile app houses in the world, and a wearable with interoperability with services like Google Now, Gmail, Google Maps, Hangouts, and Play Music would go a long way toward creating a compelling device.\n\nWork on an Android-based wearable has been going on for some time. In the summer of 2012, Google bought WIMM Labs, a company that was the furthest along in developing an Android smartwatch. By the time it was bought by Google, WIMM had built an Android smartwatch, watch-focused SDK, and app store. According to reports, WIMM merged with the Android team and has been working on a Google smartwatch ever since.\n\nInternally, Google has been doing its part, too. Over the last few versions, the company has been slowly grooming Android to become a viable wearable device OS. In Android 4.3, Google added a notifications API which can push notifications out to secondary devices and allow the secondary device to dismiss notifications and perform actions on the notification, like archiving a Gmail message. While third-party devices have yet to take advantage of this functionality, it could theoretically allow a perfect replication of the notification panel on a smartwatch. The Galaxy Gear relied on notification support from individual apps, but with Google\'s OS-level implementation, all apps would be compatible. The small size of wearable devices also means that Android will need to run on an even smaller power budget, so for Android 4.4, Google focused on shrinking Android\'s memory footprint. Today Google says the OS can run on 512MB of RAM. For comparison, the Galaxy Gear uses 512MB of RAM, and Google Glass has 1GB.\n\nThe big question is how the OS will work in relation to the main branch of Android. Is it a customized fork, like Google TV or Google Glass, or is the OS part of the main branch of Android, the same way smartphones and tablets are? Tablets started out as a separate version of Android (Honeycomb) and later merged with the main phone branch in Ice Cream Sandwich, so we may have to wait a version or two before we get our answer.\n\nGoogle needs a solid Android wearables platform to come out as soon as possible. The company has already lost its biggest Android customer, Samsung, to a rival operating system in the wearables market. With the newest Gear smartwatches, Samsung switched from Android to its own Tizen OS, so it seems like wearables will be the first battleground where we see a proper Tizen versus Android fight. Google\'s timing with this project couldn\'t be better. As we\'ve seen with smartphones, the platform with the most apps wins, and Samsung has just blown up whatever app catalog it had when it switched to Tizen. Now with Google jumping into the wearable app development fray, any developers considering a Tizen app are probably wary of another switch by Samsung to Google\'s platform.\n\nThe good news is that we only have to wait about two weeks to see if Google\'s smartwatch platform is worth switching to. Like Android for smartphones, it looks like Google\'s wearable OS will be the only manufacturer-agnostic option for some time. This ""horizontal"" strategy almost guarantees it the largest install base, which, along with Google\'s app development, guarantees it the best apps.

This is undoubtedly in no small part due to its widespread media coverage...\n\nThe device, which isn’t even available yet to the wider-public, is already gathering decidedly mixed opinions – especially in regards to privacy and ‘style’ of the device.\n\nFor Google, a ‘Smart Watch’ is a much safer bet than eyewear. These convenient devices were made popular by the Kickstarter-success, Pebble, who at the start of this year unleashed a new version with a more approachable ‘Steel’ style.\n\nRumours pit Google as working with the manufacturer of most of the Mountain View-based company’s ‘Nexus’ line of smartphones and tablets, LG, to create a Google-branded smartwatch. It seems a likely scenario; if not simply as backup or to act as a “gateway drug” to the world of wearable devices to the wider-consumer.\n\nChromecast, which Pichai also made a strong emphasis on having sales “in the millions” and coming to more countries soon; alongside Glass; shows Google’s interest in moving beyond web services and into own-brand physical hardware… A move likened to “software-maker” Microsoft with their Surface hybrid device line-up.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Apple, as Google’s competitors, are both said to be preparing their own plays into the smartwatch market for their respective platforms; Windows 8 and iOS.\n\nIt makes sense for Google to want to get the jump ahead of these two and set the standard for any future Android smartwatches to come. It would also help to boost Google’s main source of profit; their services; and provide consumers with the benefits of the company’s ecosystem.\n\nFor example; It’s easy, and exciting, to imagine Google wanting to put ‘Google Now’ on your wrist available at-a-glance…\n\nHowever, Pichai did say: ""When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly.

Google plans to release its own smartwatch, which will be manufactured by LG Electronics.\n\nSmartwatches are among the first wearable computing devices, but Pichai said that Google hopes its software platform will help developers create many types of wearable devices. He threw out the possibility that one day, Google\'s software would be used in a ""smart jacket"" with sensors, reports the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLast week Patently Apple discovered a Motorola patent application that was published by the U.S. Patent office. The patent which was found listed under Google patents, covers a wearable device that is clearly illustrated as a watch. The patent filing notes that ""embodiments of the invention can provide a telephone keypad, for example, that is disposed along the strap of a wearable device, and that uses no electronics whatsoever. Since the strap is constantly flexing, the lack of electronic parts afforded by embodiments of the present invention is highly beneficial and results in enhanced reliability, usability, improved style, and more aesthetically pleasing form factors.""\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design as noted below uses a strap based on an ""air chamber"" concept that could conform to the user\'s wrist. Moreover, the patent filing notes that ""When the pliant material of the strap is stretched, such as may occur when the strap is stretched tightly about a user\'s wrist, this can be used to launch applications to monitor health conditions or to launch other applications. In one or more embodiments, these applications require the electronic device to have good contact with a user\'s skin.""\n\nIn another area of the patent filing, it\'s noted that touching certain parts of the strap will be able to launch specific applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Google has been known to slap their branding on other OEM designs like their Nexus line. In this case we know that Google will be using LG to manufacture the watch and an LG patent for such came to light in early January.\n\nCNET reporting from the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona last month reported that ""the actual smartwatch itself will make its debut at its Google I/O conference in June.""\n\nApple\'s Current Position on Wearables\n\nRecently Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal that ""Maintaining secrecy is important because talking about the future gives competitors a road map of Apple\'s plans and the company is \'getting ripped off left, right and sideways.""\n\nA case in point would be the whole smartwatch rage. The current explosion of interest in ""smartwatches"" was truly ignited by the revelation that Apple had a patent pending invention on record a little over a year ago. Thereafter rumors of every kind popped up all over the net for those jumping on board. If Apple is just thinking of something cool in a patent filing, the ""fast followers,"" that we know as copycats, go into high gear – even if they don\'t understand where Apple is going with the concept. These companies know full well that they could simply play a word-game with the press that plays off of Apple\'s patent pending innovations and score easy PR points ""sounding innovative.""\n\nSo where does Apple stand on the coming wearables revolution? During Walt Mossberg\'s interview with Tim Cook at the D11 conference last year, he touched on the Nike FuelBand which he was wearing and said it was a great device focused on one thing.\n\n""I would say that the ones that are doing more than one thing … there\'s nothing great out there that I\'ve seen. There\'s nothing there to convince a kid that has never worn glasses or a band or a watch or whatever, to wear one. At least I haven\'t seen it. So I think that there are lots of things to solve in this space, but … it\'s an area where it\'s ripe for exploration; it\'s ripe for all of us to get exciting about. I think there\'ll be tons of companies playing in this."" Cook added that ""I see it as something that\'s another very key branch of the tree.""\n\nFurther on, Cook noted what he felt was important in this space: ""… you first have to convince people that it\'s so incredible that they want to wear it. Because where you two guys are wearing watches [Mossberg and Kara Swisher], if we had a room of full of 10 to 20 year olds and we said everybody stand up that has a watch on, I\'m not sure anybody would stand up. I don\'t see it. If you look at what kids are wearing …. Their watch is this [pointing to an iPhone].""\n\nWhatever Apple is working on, they\'re setting the bar very high and it\'s not going to be a watch like Samsung\'s Gear or the one Google is to launch in June. Apple knows that they\'re not the first in this space. Yet like the MP3 player space, when Apple walked in with the iPod, Apple\'s iTunes Store and a new approach to buying music, they created an entirely new user ""experience."" Something that the late Steve Jobs was adamant about delivering.\n\nThat\'s not what we\'re likely to see coming from the Android camp anytime soon. Then again, maybe Google will surprise us this time around. In the coming weeks and months we\'ll see if Google is able to think beyond the obviousness of what a digital watch should be.\n\nThough if there\'s anything we can count on, it\'ll be Google trying to drown out anything Apple has to say at their developer conference in June. So expect the circus to really get crazy this June as both camps try to impress tech crazed fans around the world that they\'re the ones that really have their finger on the pulse of innovation that you care about.\n\nAbout Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.\n\nOther Google Watch Concepts could be found on Google Images', 'Smartwatches are among the first wearable computing devices, but Pichai said that Google hopes its software platform will help developers create many types of wearable devices.\nThe patent which was found listed under Google patents, covers a wearable device that is clearly illustrated as a watch.\nThe patent filing notes that ""embodiments of the invention can provide a telephone keypad, for example, that is disposed along the strap of a wearable device, and that uses no electronics whatsoever.\nIn another area of the patent filing, it\'s noted that touching certain parts of the strap will be able to launch specific applications.\nOther Google Watch Concepts could be found on Google Images']"

According to him, Google’s idea is that the SDK will be built by them, saying it would be Gogole’s “vision for developers of how we see this market working”. but Developers and OEMs will have the option to pick and choose what to use. That makes it a more cross-platform option for wearables in general, and frees interested OEMs up to hardware development.\n\nPichai did give a solid timeline for a wearable SDK from Google, which is rare. Though he didn’t give specifics as to what the SDK would include, he did say it would arrive n two weeks’ time. While some expected a whole new operating system, it sounds as though there will be a simple SDK, at least for now. Many believe the smartwatch will be based on Google Now, so perhaps Developers will now have access to a Google Now SDK — something many have pined for since the launch of the Search skin.\n\nChromecast sales are interesting, but the little plug-in heading to more countries is much more important. The Android SDK for wearables is a potentially big deal for tiny devices, and could do for smartwatches and other wearables what Android did for smartphones.

Pichai assured that the device would not be released in the first half of the year, which has led many to believe that the Nexus 6 may launch in the last months of 2014. Sources have recently told Android Geeks that the Nexus 6 may be announced in October, which falls in step with many previous unveilings of Nexus devices. The Nexus 5, for example, launched on Oct. 31 last year and went on sale in November. The Nexus 4 launched on Oct. 29, 2012, and the Galaxy Nexus launched on Oct. 19, 2011. Even if the Nexus 6 announcement timeline is plausible, it may be some time before the public gets more concrete information on the device.\n\nThere may also be plenty of time for Google to surprise the public with a new launch strategy. Notably, Google forwent an unveiling event for the Nexus 5 last year and simply announced the device and Android 4.4 KitKat operating system on its blog, as well as on the Google Play Store. Fans and pundits may expect Google to provide a similar launch for the Nexus 6, or something else completely unexpected.\n\nStill, murmurs suggest that the Nexus 6 may be developed by LG and may also take after the rumored LG G3 in design; these rumors also piggyback from old rumors that surrounded the Nexus 5 and Nexus 4 in their pre-release periods. Both the Nexus 5 and Nexus 4 were developed by LG and we both based on other LG devices --- the LG G2 was the model for the Nexus 5, while the Nexus 4 took inspiration from the LG Optimus G. Consumers saw both previous Nexus devices feature similar specs to their LG counterparts; in particular; the Nexus 5 and LG G2 both featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, a 1080p display and Optical Image Stabilization included in their cameras. Many expect that the Nexus 6 may include a number of specs to be introduced on the LG G3.\n\nThe still unofficial LG G3 is rumored to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor, a 5.3-inch or 5.4-inch 1080p True HD-IPS display, 2GB or 3GB mobile RAM, 16GB and 32GB of internal memory, a 13-megapixel to 16-megapixel camera, 3,200 or 3,300 mAh batteries, and the Android 4.4 KitKat operating system. Other rumors suggest the LG G3 may feature a 5-inch screen with Full HD or 2K resolution and a battery around 2,500 mAh. Reports predict a June release for the LG G3, after which we may be able to decipher more information about the Nexus 6.\n\nThe LG G3 and Nexus 6 may not share an operating system, however, as Nexus devices notably introduce the newest Android OS to the market. It is likely two Android updates will be released by the time the Nexus 6 launches. Users should expect an update in the summer and another update, which should be launched alongside the Nexus 6. At this point, it cannot be determined whether Google will continue the Android KitKat series; however, the Mountain View, Calif., company is well known for releasing two updates each year.\n\nReports indicate that the Nexus 6 may feature an exterior design unlike any seen on previous Nexus devices, seeing as Google usually opts for a unique design on each generation of its devices. The Nexus 5 features a matte-and-ceramic type texture, while the Nexus 4 features a double-sized glass exterior.\n\nMany are also certain that we will not learn anything about the Nexus 6 at the Google I/O conference in June. Sources have told Android Geeks that there will be no Nexus or Android announcements at Google I/O, but such new may be saved for an event later in the summer, where the Nexus 8 and Android 4.5 operating system may be unveiled. If true, Google’s 2014 timeline may mimic its release schedule from last year. In 2013, we saw Google launch new Chromebooks, developer tools and the Google Play Edition Samsung Galaxy S4 at Google I/O. In July, Google launched its Nexus 7 2013 tablet alongside the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean operating system, and introduced the Nexus 5 and Android 4.4 OS in October.\n\nAs said, it may take some time for Nexus 6 rumors to solidify, but recent reports indicate that many are interested in the coming devices.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.', 'Sources have recently told Android Geeks that the Nexus 6 may be announced in October, which falls in step with many previous unveilings of Nexus devices.\nThe Nexus 4 launched on Oct. 29, 2012, and the Galaxy Nexus launched on Oct. 19, 2011.\nMany expect that the Nexus 6 may include a number of specs to be introduced on the LG G3.\nOther rumors suggest the LG G3 may feature a 5-inch screen with Full HD or 2K resolution and a battery around 2,500 mAh.\nThe LG G3 and Nexus 6 may not share an operating system, however, as Nexus devices notably introduce the newest Android OS to the market.']"

The SDK will be based on Google\'s Android platform, so it should include tools familiar to app writers who\'ve already targeted Android smartphones and tablets. Google has a chance to maintain its early lead in a space that has immeasurable room for growth.\n\nNews of the SDK came from the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference, which takes place in Austin, Texas, each year. Sundar Pichai, who heads Google\'s Android and Chrome platforms, told an audience at SXSW Sunday that the SDK be released soon, along with Google\'s ""vision"" of what wearables should be.\n\nGoogle first entered the wearables market with Google Glass -- connected eyewear that can take pictures and record video. Google Glass still costs an unfriendly $1,500, and Google is still being picky about who can purchase one. A less-expensive version of Google Glass is expected to hit the market late this year or early next year. Other companies, including Samsung, are working on their own connected glasses.\n\n[A cool-looking wearable isn\'t enough to drive the market. See Software Is Key For Wearables In The Enterprise.]\n\nGoogle is also widely expected to launch its own smartwatch by June. Very little is known about the smartwatch other than it will run Android and will be made by LG, which has manufactured the last two Nexus smartphones for Google. Android is already the world\'s dominant smartphone platform. If Google can convince developers to stick with Android for wearable devices, it could lead to an ecosystem that offers seamless integration for consumers and their myriad bits and pieces of hardware.\n\nSamsung\'s Android-powered Galaxy Gear smartwatch\n\nAndroid has taken an unlikely lead in the smartwatch space, but it\'s unclear how long that lead will last. Samsung used Google\'s Android platform in the Galaxy Gear smartwatch, which was the best-selling smartwatch of 2013. But Samsung dropped Android in favor of Tizen (its own operating system) for the second-generation Gear smartwatch.\n\nIf the Gear 2 sells in better numbers than the original Gear, then Tizen could replace Android as the world\'s leading smartwatch platform. The Gear 2 is a more-attractive, less-expensive device than the Galaxy Gear, and offers a better mix of features, so this is a very real possibility. Let\'s not forget competitors, such as Pebble, Sony, Huawei, Lenovo, and others, that are making their own smartwatches.\n\nBut connected glasses and smartwatches are hardly the only devices in the wearables space -- and that\'s exactly the reasoning behind Google\'s plan to release an SDK. It hopes developers will take the SDK and run with it, using what they already know to create new and interesting product categories. For example, Pichai, spitballing a little bit, said that Google\'s wearable SDK could be used to create a ""smart jacket"" rife with sensors. In other words, the sky\'s the limit here, and Google wants developers to reach for the stars.\n\nThe SDK should be available for download before the end of the month, which gives developers nearly three months to play with it and offer Google feedback before Google\'s annual I/O developer conference.\n\nInformationWeek is conducting a survey to determine the types of measures and policies IT is taking to ensure the security of the full range of mobile assets on cellular, WiFi, and other wireless technologies.Take part in the InformationWeek 2014 Mobile Security Survey and be eligible to win a great prize.

Exec Sundar Pichai announced at SxSW that Google will be releasing its Android operating system for wearables. The software development kit should be available to developers in two weeks. The strategy of licensing its operating system while also selling its own hardware – Google will release a smartwatch this June – has worked well for mobile devices, where Android ships on 4 out every 5 phones and where Android tablets started outselling iPads in 2013. Here\'s hoping, along with famed designer and LinkedIn Influencer Don Norman, that the OS will help make ""smart"" wearables a bit less dumb.\n\nBIG (LYING) DATA – Data coming out of China are decidedly puzzling: Chinese exports plunged 18.1 percent in February year-over-year. Or at least that\'s what the numbers say. Analysts are pointing to the issue of over-invoicing by Chinese businesses – capital flows disguised as exports to evade China’s capital controls, as the Financial Times explains – which was already blamed for a hard-to-believe trade surplus in January. ""Chinese firms have been actually faking exports less since last spring but the practice is still creating trade distortions, by making this year’s declines this year look steeper than they actually are,"" writes Quartz\'s Lily Kuo. In short, no one\'s quite sure what the reality of China\'s economy is, though it does seem to be slowing.\n\nAND THEN THERE WERE TWO – In China still, the e-commerce war is intensifying as Tencent and JD.com strike an alliance against Alibaba. Tencent purchased 15 percent of online retailer JD.com, which is about to go public in the US, and will outsource its own e-commerce activities to it. Alibaba still corners nearly 50 percent of the market but now the competition has the muscles to challenge that. Tencent is the biggest Internet firm In China but has so far got most of its revenue from social media and mobile gaming, with a more modest involvement in online retail.\n\nBITCON? – After first doing so in Japan, where it is headquartered, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in the US on Sunday. That very claim of bankruptcy is being questioned by hackers who say Mt. Gox was sitting on a lot more Bitcoins than reported. CEO Mark Karpelès\' blog, Tumblr and Reddit accounts were hacked to post documents showing Mt. Gox held 951K bitcoins before the online attack that wiped the exchange\'s accounts clean, even though Karpelès announced 850k were stolen. So if those documents prove to be true – and several Reddit users, who can verify their own account in them, say they are – it begs the question: Where did more than 100,000 bitcoins go? Others on Reddit are pointing out that the documents are consistent with Mt. Gox\'s story that their internal accounting did not match the reality of their holdings. Not enough info to tell at the moment.\n\nTOP BANANA – You thought telcos were a concentrated industry? A giant of the banana trade is about to be born, through the marriage of Chiquita, #2 on the market, and Fyffes, #4. The US and Irish companies, to be reborn as ChiquitaFyffes, will together corner 29 percent of the market, passing Dole and Fresh Del Monte. These three corporations will together produce three out of every four bananas in lunch boxes around the world. And that\'s not even counting melons, pineapples and salads.\n\nHave you also thrown your dumb smartwatch against the wall in frustration?

He said a big question at Google is how the company will successfully pull off that kind of expansion. He talked about the company\'s hopes to be included in a number of cars in coming years, and about how powerful sensors are becoming ubiquitous, first in fitness devices, but soon in a wide variety of other technology. Google, Pichai said, wants to create APIs for those sensors, and as such, the SDK for wearables is a big first step.\n\nBut Google knows that mobile phones still present a huge growth opportunity, and Pichai lauded the full range of phones -- from sub-$100 devices to high-end smart phones -- that can lead to the next billion users. Pichai touted Google\'s willingness to let people use Android for free, though he noted that the company requires licensing if companies want to build Android devices with Google services on top of the OS.\n\nWhen it comes to auto manufacturers implementing Android, Pichai noted that in today\'s world, many choose to stick to Apple\'s iOS. But he likened that approach to walking into a hotel and finding that an in-room stereo system only works with iOS devices. ""They\'re probably losing at least half of their users,"" he said.\n\nBattelle asked if Google has plans to put Android on technology like devices from Nest, which it recently purchased for $3.2 billion. Pichai wouldn\'t bite but did say that Google hopes to develop a set of common protocols that allow different devices to work together. Without being specific, he hinted that Nest could be part of that. ""We are thinking hard about the layer which will connect all these devices together,"" Pichai said. ""That\'s something we will work hard"" for.\n\nChromecast\n\nWhile Google doesn\'t say how many of its Chromecast systems it\'s sold, Pichai did say that the number is in the millions, all in the United States. And Google recently released an SDK for the Internet streaming device which 3,000 developers have already registered for.As well, Google is expecting to begin making Chromecast available internationally within weeks.\n\nProject Ara\n\nPichai also touched briefly on Google\'s internal Project Ara, a skunkworks of sorts for advanced projects and research.\n\nHe said that the effort is aimed at concepts that are slightly futuristic, but which can be quickly commercialized. For example, he said, the Project Ara team is working on ways to create modular smart phones, devices that can be broken down into component parts so that rather than replacing a phone, they can have new parts added. ""Think about it as APIs for hardware,"" Pichai said.

The Nexus 5 arrived to blow our minds just last year, but now rumors are already swirling around the next Nexus: the Nexus 6.\n\nA new report from Germany hints that LG will once again be tapped as the manufacturer behind Google's Nexus smartphone. LG made last year's Nexus 5 and the Nexus 4, too. So far, every time LG has made a Nexus smartphone for Google, it has been a huge hit with customers. The Nexus 5 famously sold out of the Google Play Store shortly after it was launched.\n\nIt looks like Google wants to repeat that success and will pass over other manufacturers yet again, preferring to stick with LG, if this latest report is to be believed. After all, don't fix what isn't broken, right?\n\nAt this point, we still know next to nothing about the Nexus 6, but there are a lot of rumors out there, which hint that the Nexus 6 will be a pretty awesome device - again.\n\nIn terms of form factor, the Nexus 6 is expected to be thinner and lighter with almost no bezels at all, giving it the much-sought after edge-to-edge display. Rumors regarding the display's size and resolution have been all over the place. Some reports even claim that the Nexus 6 will feature a Quad HD, 2K display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. The size of the display will supposedly be 5.2-inches.\n\nHowever, given the fact that the Nexus smartphones are typically priced lower than the flagship devices made by other companies, a 2K display seems unlikely. Samsung didn't even put one on the Galaxy S5, so why should LG and Google do so with the Nexus 6? Of course, with Google, anything is possible, but it seems a little far-fetched.\n\nAs far as hardware and software go, rumors point to a 64-bit processor and a 16-megapixel back camera. The Nexus 6 will undoubtedly run the newest version of Android when it launches and that's all we know, or think we know.\n\nThe Nexus 6 release date is also shrouded in mystery. Google's Sundar Pichai stated that it won't arrive in the first half of 2014 and some reports hint that it might not even arrive by October. Needless to say, no one has any clue about when the Nexus 6 will be announced. Chances are we won't know too much about the device until right before it launches.

To this end it is launching a set of developer tools which make it easier for manufactures to run the OS on wearable devices. While talking at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference over the weekend, Sundar Pichai, Google’s SVP of Android and Chrome, said that Google will release a developer SDK designed to make it easier for OEMs to create wearable devices that use Android.\n\nGoogle hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices.\n\nA key component to the new SDK is a new layer which will create a standard way for Android to collect data from sensors. One of the attractions of wearables is that lots of different types of data can be collected often via sensors that aren’t traditionally found on smartphones or tablets. By creating a standardized way for the sensors to send their data to Android it means that the OS becomes sensor agnostic while providing a uniform way for that data to be read. “We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,” said Pichai, “they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together.”\n\nThis move comes at a critical time for Android with regards to wearables. At MWC 2014 Samsung unveiled its latest wearable devices, the Gear 2 and the Gear Fit, both of which run Tizen, an alternative open source Linux based mobile operating system, rather than Android. By standardizing sensor collection OEMs can now opt for Android instead of alternative OSes.\n\nBy wearables Google means more than just smartwatches and fitness bands. “When we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly,” said Sundar. Google hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices. Sundar even suggested a future with “smart jackets” that are loaded with sensors and powered by Android.\n\nGoogle will release the new SDK in about two weeks time and is looking for “plenty of feedback” from developers. During the conference Sundar Pichai didn’t say anything about any wearables which Google itself may release but instead emphasized that Google sees Android being used for wearables “at a platform level.” Of course the release of an SDK could be the prelude to one or more Google designed wearables including the often rumored Google Smartwatch.', 'To this end it is launching a set of developer tools which make it easier for manufactures to run the OS on wearable devices.\nGoogle hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices.\nBy wearables Google means more than just smartwatches and fitness bands.\nGoogle will release the new SDK in about two weeks time and is looking for “plenty of feedback” from developers.\nDuring the conference Sundar Pichai didn’t say anything about any wearables which Google itself may release but instead emphasized that Google sees Android being used for wearables “at a platform level.” Of course the release of an SDK could be the prelude to one or more Google designed wearables including the often rumored Google Smartwatch.']"

Most of the affected vehicles are in North America.\n\nBarra apologized for the recall and sent a letter last week to employees promising an “unvarnished” look at the recall that is occurring 10 years after the issue first came to light. She has not granted any interviews on the matter.\n\n“Mary believes that her time is best spent on making the recall work as smoothly as possible for our customers,” GM chief spokesman Selim Bingol said in an email. “Meanwhile, GM is keeping our customers informed about the recall while working to provide timely responses to questions from regulators.”\n\nWhile recalls are not unusual, the number of fatalities involved and the way GM handled this one stretching over the past decade has the potential to cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and possible legal damages, in addition to tarnishing its reputation.\n\nU.S. safety regulators have also opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent the automaker a list of 107 questions about the recall to answer by April 3.\n\nIn addition to ordering up the apology and crafting the letter to employees with Bingol’s help, Barra has designated assignments for top executives related to the recall, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nBarra placed global product development chief Mark Reuss in charge of working with supplier Delphi Automotive to obtain the replacement parts as quickly as possible and assigned North American head Alan Batey to work with GM dealers on serving the customers, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the recall.\n\nShe also involved GM quality and customer service chief Alicia Boler-Davis as well as Bingol, who is in charge of GM’s governmental affairs in Washington, the person said.\n\nLAWYER IN LEHMAN PROBE TAPPED\n\nAnton “Tony” Valukas has been named head of GM’s internal probe. He is chairman of the law firm Jenner & Block, whose attorneys are helping with the investigation of the recall. Valukas could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nCo-leading the investigation with Valukas is the automaker’s general counsel, Michael Millikin.\n\nSources previously said GM’s team of investigators had begun interviewing employees involved in the problems surrounding the ignition switch, which first came to the company’s attention in 2004.\n\nValukas, a former U.S. attorney, was the court-appointed examiner in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. His probe resulted in the so-called Valukas report, a 2,200-page document released in 2010 which detailed the causes of the financial services firm’s spectacular collapse.\n\nThe report showed how Lehman had long used accounting gimmicks to bolster its balance sheet, and had been insolvent for many weeks prior to its Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy filing.

(NYSE:GM) executives had hoped to begin this year anew, in recovery from the company's 2009 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it seems the past will continue to haunt the world’s second-largest auto manufacturer. GM just began a recall of 1.6 million cars to replace faulty ignition switches that can cause the car to shut down in motion, leading to hazardous driving conditions that have been linked to 13 fatalities and 31 crashes in the U.S. since 2004.\n\nThe company has until April 3 to respond to more than 100 questions from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (click here to read the PDF) about the recall. The NHTSA itself is under scrutiny because it dismissed hundreds of complaints from car owners over the years about cars stalling in motion.\n\nAs more details are released about the recall, it’s becoming clear GM has a corporate bureaucracy that’s slow to respond to safety issues. CEO Mary Barra said recently that she was only informed of the problem on Jan. 31 after deliberations by internal committees who insulate corporate higher-ups, and Robert Lutz, who was vice chair of global product development when subordinates were studying the ignition switch issue, last week vehemently denied to the New York Times knowing anything about the issue.\n\nThe NHTSA could slap the automaker with a civil fine of up to $35 million if it finds that GM knew about a safety problem and didn’t inform the federal safety watchdog within the legally required five business days. The company could also face charges from the U.S. attorney’s office, which is currently going after Toyota, the world’s largest automaker, for the way it disclosed sudden acceleration problems in its vehicles. But $35 million is a relative drop in the bucket compared to what it pays out in product liability claims, which amounted to $601 million in 2012, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last year.\n\nHow much GM could wind up paying out in product liability claims related to the ignition switch recall will depend on how many accidents occurred after the company was turned from General Motors Corporation (aka the “old GM”) into General Motors Company, the “new GM.”\n\nWhen it comes to litigation, the new GM in not liable for any sins committed by the old company.\n\n“The analogy is if someone committed fraud while he was alive; you can go after the assets of the estate of the deceased, if there are any assets,” said John Bird, a bankruptcy lawyer for Fox Rothschild LLP in Wilmington, Del. “The old GM is dead. This is a new GM, with new hands and new shareholders.”\n\nEssentially the new GM is protected from legal liabilities of the old GM, which still exists as a shell company but doesn’t have any assets that could pay out liability claims. That means that anyone harmed by the ignition switch flaw prior to GM’s restructuring will not be able to sue the new GM. So far only two of the 13 fatalities in accidents involving cars that fall under the recall and recorded by the NHTSA occurred after GM’s bankruptcy: one involving a Pennsylvania woman in January 2010 and another from a female driver in Georgia in March of the same year.\n\nThe recall includes six models: the Chevrolet Cobalt (2005-2007 model years), the Chevrolet HHR (2006-2007), the Pontiac Pursuit (2005-2006), the Pontiac Solstice (2006-2007) the 2007 Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion (2003-2007) and the 2007 Saturn Sky."", 'As more details are released about the recall, it’s becoming clear GM has a corporate bureaucracy that’s slow to respond to safety issues.\nHow much GM could wind up paying out in product liability claims related to the ignition switch recall will depend on how many accidents occurred after the company was turned from General Motors Corporation (aka the “old GM”) into General Motors Company, the “new GM.”When it comes to litigation, the new GM in not liable for any sins committed by the old company.\n“The old GM is dead.\nThis is a new GM, with new hands and new shareholders.”Essentially the new GM is protected from legal liabilities of the old GM, which still exists as a shell company but doesn’t have any assets that could pay out liability claims.\nThat means that anyone harmed by the ignition switch flaw prior to GM’s restructuring will not be able to sue the new GM.']"
1442,http://www.benzinga.com/news/14/03/4378658/general-motors-nhtsa-under-scrutiny-amidst-recall,technology,"[""General Motors (NYSE: GM) and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration are under scrutiny for taking years to address an ignition switch problem that is tied to 13 deaths.\n\nLast month, the Detroit automaker recalled 1.6 million vehicles. NHTSA has launched an investigation into how long it took GM to admit there was an issue and take action.\n\nGM learned about at least one incident of ignition switch problems in the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt around the time of the vehicle's launch, according to a chronology report submitted to NHTSA.\n\nThe report says GM employees were able to replicate the ignition switch issue, where the key moved out of the “run” position when the driver accidentally contacted the key or steering column. An engineering inquiry was opened to investigate the issue. Although there were potential solutions, the inquiry was closed without action “after consideration of the lead time required, cost, and effectiveness of each of these solutions,” according to the report.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal says that GM's chronology of events surrounding the issue shows the company is “burdened by bureaucratic complexity” to the point that it wasn't able to decide how to address a fatal defect in its vehicles.\n\nRelated: Mary Barra Takes Charge, Launches Internal Inquiry Into GM Recall\n\n“Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot once said that where he came from, if you see a snake, you kill it. But at General Motors, if you see a snake, you hire a consultant on snakes, then you form a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years,” the WSJ article says.\n\nGM announced Monday it hired Jenner & Block Chairman Anton Valukas to help lead an internal investigation into how the company handled the ignition switch failures, Bloomberg reports.\n\nNHTSA's actions are also being examined. Despite receiving more than 260 complaints over 11 years, federal safety regulators never investigated the problem, the New York Times reports. A NYT analysis of consumer complaints submitted to NHTSA found that complaints about potentially dangerous shutdowns due to faulty ignition switches were received roughly twice a month since February 2003, but the agency repeatedly responded that there wasn't enough evidence to launch an investigation into the issue. The NYT says the complaints involved six of the models currently being recalled by GM.\n\nSenior Kelley Blue Book analyst Jack Nerad told Benzinga the fact that the complaints on the ignition issue occurred across several different brands might have masked the scope of the problem.\n\n“NHTSA relies, in part, on reporting by vehicle manufacturers and typically engages in very frank exchanges with manufacturers in determining if there is a safety issue, how big the issue is and what can be done to rectify it,” Nerad said in an email. “To do its job effectively NHTSA needs to communicate with auto manufacturers. Both NHTSA and the individual auto manufacturers have the same goal – providing safe transportation to the buying public. At times the two sides do differ on what is required to obtain that result.”\n\nWatchdogs and Revolving Doors\n\nThe issue could also be how GM and NHTSA work together. Automotive News suggests that the federal agency is getting too cozy with the automaker, referring to NHTSA as the “watchdog that didn't bark.” The article cites a Sherlock Holmes story where the detective observes that the watchdog didn't bark on the night of a murder, indicating the murderer must have been someone friendly with the dog.\n\nAutomotive safety expert Byron Bloch told Benzinga an ongoing problem for NHTSA is its revolving door between the government and the automotive industry.\n\n“I think it's important to realize that NHTSA is frequently politicized to the point that decision-makers inside have come from the auto industry directly,” said Bloch.\n\nWhen reports of ignition switch issues began trickling in around 2005, Jacqueline Glassman was the acting administrator of NHTSA. Glassman had previously worked as a senior counsel for Chrysler. Jeffrey Rosen was the general counsel for the U.S. Department of Transportation. Before that, he worked for Kirkland & Ellis, who has represents GM.\n\n“If you want to put it in this framework, the top two decision makers were from Chrysler and GM, respectively,” said Bloch. “Might their decisions be gently or more overtly influenced because of these affiliations?”"", ""General Motors (NYSE: GM) and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration are under scrutiny for taking years to address an ignition switch problem that is tied to 13 deaths.\nNHTSA has launched an investigation into how long it took GM to admit there was an issue and take action.\nGM learned about at least one incident of ignition switch problems in the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt around the time of the vehicle's launch, according to a chronology report submitted to NHTSA.\nThe report says GM employees were able to replicate the ignition switch issue, where the key moved out of the “run” position when the driver accidentally contacted the key or steering column.\nWhen reports of ignition switch issues began trickling in around 2005, Jacqueline Glassman was the acting administrator of NHTSA.""]"

With GM\'s recall of 1.6 million cars last month, the finger pointing has begun. While the NHTSA is investigating the ""timeliness"" of the recall, others are asking whether the government agency missed picking up on a trend hidden within its long ledger of complaints.\n\nThe NHTSA has been criticized before for missing patterns, with the agency coming under fire more than a decade ago for failing to flag problems with Ford Explorers with Firestone tires, The Times notes.\n\nBut the NHTSA is defending its track record when it comes to the GM cars, noting that there wasn\'t enough evidence to support an investigation.

TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n""We rate GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, good cash flow from operations, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance and growth in earnings per share. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nDespite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 3.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 3.0%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company\'s bottom line, improving the earnings per share.\n\nNet operating cash flow has significantly increased by 291.54% to $3,058.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, GENERAL MOTORS CO has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of 29.70%.\n\nThe debt-to-equity ratio is somewhat low, currently at 0.85, and is less than that of the industry average, implying that there has been a relatively successful effort in the management of debt levels. Although the company had a strong debt-to-equity ratio, its quick ratio of 0.85 is somewhat weak and could be cause for future problems.\n\nInvestors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company\'s shares by a sharp 34.50% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index. Looking ahead, the stock\'s sharp rise over the last year has already helped drive it to a level which is relatively expensive compared to the rest of its industry. We feel, however, that other strengths this company displays justify these higher price levels.\n\nGENERAL MOTORS CO has improved earnings per share by 5.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, GENERAL MOTORS CO reported lower earnings of $2.35 versus $2.93 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.80 versus $2.35).\n\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: GM Ratings Report\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

This defect shuts down power steering, power braking… and air bags while the vehicle remains in motion, even at highway speed.\n\nThe problem: NHTSA declined to investigate. Instead of investigating the defect, NHTSA responded with form letters.\n\nMany of the complaints detailed frightening scenes in which moving cars suddenly stalled at high speeds, on highways, in the middle of city traffic, and while crossing railroad tracks. A number of the complaints warned of catastrophic consequences if something was not done. – Auto Regulators Dismissed Defect Tied to 13 Deaths [The New York Times]\n\nGM knew about the problem before it began selling the 2005 Cobalt, but brough the vehicle to market anyway.\n\nThis defect has been linked to at least 13 deaths and finally led to GM recalling more than 1.6 million vehicles.\n\nRecalled models include:\n\n2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt\n\n2007 Pontiac G5\n\n2003-2007 Saturn Ion\n\n2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR\n\n2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice\n\n2007 Saturn Sky\n\nNot The First Time\n\nThis isn’t NHTSA first safety failure. The agency has come under fire before for failing to recognize a pattern of consumer complaints or failing to rectify an issue before it becomes widespread.\n\nNHTSA failed to detect the surge of on-road rollovers in Ford Explorer vehicles with Firestone Tires [the Ford/Firestone defect].\n\nNHTSA failed to identify sudden unintended acceleration problems in Toyota vehicles until a California highway patrol officer and his family members were killed, leading to a recall of more than 10 million vehicles.\n\nImportance of 7th Amendment Remedies\n\nA 2000 law – the Tread Act – was designed to help NHTSA identify defects. It requires automakers to report to NHTSA any claims received blaming auto defects for serious injuries or death. This law was used to punish Toyota for failing to report sudden acceleration problems across many of its vehicle lines.\n\nBut now, questions are being raised about NHTSA’s own timeliness.\n\nThe ability to spot trends is a huge issue, and NHTSA has not got it under control by any means. – Joan Claybrook, former NHTSA Administrator via NTY\n\nWhen the federal safety regulators are either unwilling or unable to do their job, it is the 7th Amendment right to trial by jury that holds companies accountable.\n\nGM knew about the defect. NHTSA knew about the defect. Neither took action to correct the problem for nearly a decade. It wasn’t until GM was forced to face litigation under the 7th Amendment that it was finally held accountable and compelled to recall these defective vehicles.\n\nCivil litigation is a window into what companies are really up to – the longstanding knowledge of problems they would rather ignore, and the reluctance to fess up and correct them. In this case… GM’s internal records show that the decision to take the Cobalt to market, despite the ignition switch problem, was just a cost thing – and it cost at least six people their lives.\n\n“The chief engineer who discovered the problem, he just whitewashed it. We can’t fit it in time, so it will have to remain in the car when we begin selling them later this year,” [attorney Lance] Cooper says. “It’s bone-chilling. They recognized the defect. If they just would have fixed it, I have no doubt that Brooke Melton would be alive today.”\n\n“I’m a conservative trial lawyer and I am conservative in my beliefs that the federal government often doesn’t do a good job, and you need the private market – in the case, the jury system that allows individuals to investigate and hold GM accountable.”\n\n– Why Civil Litigation Matters to Safety: GM Edition [Safety Research & Strategies]\n\nNHTSA Finally Acts\n\nNHTSA – finally – has begun acting on the GM ignition problem… but only after civil litigation exposed the problems and private sector investigators publicized the issue.\n\nLast week, NHTSA issued a remarkable 27-page special order requiring GM to answer 107 questions about the ignition defect.

Many of these accidents may have been prevented if car manufacturers acted in a timely manner in recalling defective vehicles.\n\nNew Measures Announced\n\nLast week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced new measures to ensure that customers who may have bought defective vehicles see notices alerting them of recalls. This new move is aimed at getting recalled cars off the road as soon as possible by ensuring that car owners don’t ignore these important notices.\n\nConsumer Awareness is Vital\n\nThe U.S Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said that recalls only work if consumers are aware of them. In reality, most consumers disregard current recall correspondence, thinking that it’s just more spam. This new label on recall correspondence will ensure that car owners act in a timely manner to have their brakes, tires and other components fixed.\n\nThe NHTSA will work closely with state and federal authorities to ensure that this new order is reinforced, and that other marketing campaigns looking to confuse consumers do not distract them from these important notices.\n\nCar accidents have numerous causes. However, a tiny manufacturing defect can lead to a serious auto accident. Even though car manufacturers have to follow stringent rules during assembly, a computer or human error may let a defect pass through unnoticed until a later date. These defects may cause brakes to malfunction, pedals to stick, trip computers to go haywire, and can even even make it impossible for airbags to deploy.\n\nIn addition to manufacturing defects, many automobiles have been recalled due to what are called design defects.

TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\n\n""We rate MARSH & MCLENNAN COS (MMC) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company\'s strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, growth in earnings per share, good cash flow from operations, solid stock price performance and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel these strengths outweigh the fact that the company is trading at a premium valuation based on our review of its current price compared to such things as earnings and book value.""\n\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\n\nThe revenue growth came in higher than the industry average of 19.1%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 3.8%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company\'s bottom line, improving the earnings per share.\n\nMARSH & MCLENNAN COS has improved earnings per share by 14.9% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, MARSH & MCLENNAN COS increased its bottom line by earning $2.41 versus $2.13 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($2.80 versus $2.41).\n\nNet operating cash flow has increased to $766.00 million or 33.91% when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of 17.44%.\n\nInvestors have apparently begun to recognize positive factors similar to those we have mentioned in this report, including earnings growth. This has helped drive up the company\'s shares by a sharp 32.58% over the past year, a rise that has exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index. Looking ahead, the stock\'s sharp rise over the last year has already helped drive it to a level which is relatively expensive compared to the rest of its industry. We feel, however, that other strengths this company displays justify these higher price levels.\n\nDespite currently having a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.37, it is higher than that of the industry average, inferring that management of debt levels may need to be evaluated further. Regardless of the somewhat mixed results with the debt-to-equity ratio, the company\'s quick ratio of 1.47 is sturdy.\n\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: MMC Ratings Report\n\nSTOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stocks that can potentially TRIPLE in the next 12 months.

It will not be until early April, GM said, that the repairs will begin.\n\nNEW YORK — Less than a month after General Motors said it would recall 1.6 million cars because of a defective ignition switch, the automaker faces an arduous task: fixing the cars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the heading “Important Safety Recall,” the letter contains a stern, if unusual, warning: “Remove all items from your key ring, leaving only the vehicle key.”\n\nThat’s because if the defective ignition switch is jostled or even if the key chain is too heavy, it can turn off the engine and the car’s electrical system, disabling the air bags.\n\nGM said it had linked the defect to 31 crashes and 13 deaths since it was first alerted to the problem in 2004.\n\nThe letter, which does not advise drivers to stop using the car, also tells owners the replacement parts “are not currently available.”\n\nFor the older cars being recalled by GM, simply getting the part made is a challenge for the automaker.\n\nThe recall covers six models: 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices; and the 2007 Saturn Sky.\n\nAlan Adler, a GM spokesman, said that the supplier, Delphi, needed to prepare the machines that would make the part before it could be mass-produced.\n\nOnce the part is made, a second letter will be sent to registered owners telling them to schedule an appointment at a dealership. That letter, GM said, will go out later this month. The parts are not expected to arrive at dealerships any sooner than early April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recall of the 1.6 million vehicles, including nearly 1.4 million in the United States, is large, but it is one of many. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that over the past seven years, its investigations have resulted in more than 900 recalls, covering more than 50 million vehicles.\n\nFor models like the Cobalt, GM will use an automotive consulting firm, R.L. Polk, which performs computer searches of state motor vehicle registrations to find current owners through vehicle identification numbers. But they are harder to find.\n\n“These are second- and third-owner cars now, because of their age,” Adler said. And some of those who are reached may not respond, he predicted.\n\nAdler said that General Motors would soon establish a website where owners could get more information, and that it has monitored Facebook discussions of the Cobalt as well.', 'On Friday, GM started sending out the first recall letters to registered owners, telling them a fix is coming.\nNEW YORK — Less than a month after General Motors said it would recall 1.6 million cars because of a defective ignition switch, the automaker faces an arduous task: fixing the cars.\nThat letter, GM said, will go out later this month.\nAdvertisementThe recall of the 1.6 million vehicles, including nearly 1.4 million in the United States, is large, but it is one of many.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that over the past seven years, its investigations have resulted in more than 900 recalls, covering more than 50 million vehicles.']"

Healey\n\nUSATODAY\n\nA former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking for a probe of why NHTSA knew as early as 2007 about a potentially fatal problem with General Motors ignition switches, but didn\'t demand a recall.\n\nNow a safety activist, Joan Claybrook says the safety agency ""failed to carry out the law"" when it didn\'t force GM to fix the problem back then.\n\nGM recalled 1.37 million cars in the U.S. last month because faulty ignition switches can shut off power to the front airbags. GM says it knows of 31 crashes and 13 deaths linked to the fault.\n\nClaybrook asked the Department of Transportation, of which NHTSA is a unit, to probe ""the failure of"" NHTSA ""to require the recall"" earlier. GM last month recalled the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky.\n\nThe switches unexpectedly can move from ""run"" into ""accessory,"" killing power to the airbags and other systems. Heavy key rings can exacerbate the problem. GM says drivers awaiting the fix should be sure nothing is attached to their ignition keys.\n\nNHTSA did not immediately respond to Claybrook\'s slap. But the agency in past cases has noted that it\'s easy, in hindsight, to say a problem should have been obvious, but at the time, the cases might have been so few that they were statistically inconsequential and wouldn\'t have attracted attention.\n\nIn the GM case, NHTSA paid extraordinary attention. Ittriggered three Special Crash Investigations, which are probes performed by outside investigators working under contract and reporting to NHTSA and the DOT.\n\nClaybrook says that makes it even more unlikely that NHTSA should not have seen the problem clearly.\n\nThe agency commissioned the SCIs because it wanted to know why then-new ""smart"" airbags were failing to deploy in some GM crashes: The probes:\n\n•Aug. 15, 2005, into a July 29, 2005, Maryland crash of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt that killed Amber Marie Rose, 16.\n\nThat report, by Calspan Research of Buffalo, said the ignition switch was in ""accessory,"" and the front airbags did not deploy.\n\nThe report also noted that the driver was unbelted, impaired by alcohol, and accelerating under a wide-open throttle to 69 mphwhen the car slammed into trees and rolled.\n\nNHTSA and GM met and discussed the crash in 2007, according to GM\'s own timeline.\n\n•Nov. 26, 2006, into the October 2006 crash of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt that killed Amy Beskau, 15, of Wisconsin, a front-seat passenger. A rear-seat passenger also died. The driver survived. None were wearing safety belts.\n\nThe SCI report in April 2007, by the Indiana University Transportation Research Center, said the switch was in ""accessory,"" and the airbags didn\'t deploy.\n\nThe report noted, however, at least six complaints in the NHTSA database at the time about power being lost when the keys movedinadvertently to ""accessory.""\n\n•March 15, 2004, into the crash of a 2004 Saturn Ion in Pennsylvania in January of 2004. No one was killed. The SCI report by Calspan noted that the crash was severe enough that the bags ""probably"" should have deployed, but didn\'t.\n\nThe position of the ignition switch wasn\'t noted, but Calspan reported anomalies in the data from the car\'s ""black box"" recorder consistent with a loss of engine power prior to the crash.', 'GM recalled 1.37 million cars in the U.S. last month because faulty ignition switches can shut off power to the front airbags.\nClaybrook asked the Department of Transportation, of which NHTSA is a unit, to probe ""the failure of"" NHTSA ""to require the recall"" earlier.\nIn the GM case, NHTSA paid extraordinary attention.\nNHTSA and GM met and discussed the crash in 2007, according to GM\'s own timeline.\nThe report noted, however, at least six complaints in the NHTSA database at the time about power being lost when the keys movedinadvertently to ""accessory.""']"

(NYSE: GM) has recalled 1.6 million cars worldwide to repair a defect that led to 13 deaths. According to a report in The New York Times, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) received an average of two complaints a month since 2003 related to the defect. The NHTSA declined to investigate because “there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant a safety investigation.”\n\nThe problem is that the weight of the key ring, perhaps coupled with road conditions, may cause the ignition switch to be jarred from the “run” position, turning off the engine and shutting down the car’s electrical power which causes the airbags to fail to deploy.\n\nThe Times reviewed the NHTSA’s public database and examined nearly 8,000 complaints made against the recalled models looking for instances of trouble with the ignition switch. It found more than 260 cases where a moving car unexpectedly stalled.\n\nBut how culpable is the NHTSA? The agency’s response to the NYT’s story is that over the past 7 years the agency has issued 929 recalls affecting more than 55 million vehicles and that the agency “uses a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall.” The 260 complaints about the GM cars is about 0.018% of the vehicles under recall according to the agency. How that is relevant is not immediately obvious.\n\nThe NHTSA’s failure does not let GM entirely off the hook. Under a law passed in 2000, automakers are legally required to report to the NTHSA any claims the carmakers receive that blame a vehicle defect for a serious injury or death. The NYT report notes that since 2003, GM has reported no fewer than 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries related to the recalled vehicles. How many of the injuries and deaths are related to the ignition switch defect is not clear.\n\nAny federal penalties the company may face are likely to pale in comparison to the civil claims from the survivors of the 13 dead and who knows how many injured.

Meanwhile, U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation into whether the No. 1 U.S. automaker reacted swiftly enough in its recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles.\n\nGM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Tuesday in a letter to GM employees said she deeply regretted the circumstances but was pleased with the company\'s response and the focus will be on customer safety and satisfaction.\n\nMoving past the recall and related fallout will be critical to ensure the Detroit company continues the rebound since its 2009 bankruptcy reorganization, analysts said.\n\n""They need to get past this as quickly as possible,"" said George Cook, a marketing professor at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester.\n\n""You cannot be reactive in dealing with the American car-buying public,"" added Cook, formerly an executive at Ford Motor for 10 years. ""You have to be proactive and I think they\'ll be forgiving if it\'s not really, really serious. People have short memories about that stuff.""\n\nGM\'s recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off.\n\nGM has said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the ""run"" position, turning off the engine and most of the car\'s electrical components. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.\n\nThe company said last week that the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.\n\nTrent Ross, senior vice president of reputation and risk management at Ipsos Public Affairs, said GM needs to take ownership of the issue right away. Several analysts lauded Barra for her letter.\n\n""GM needs to show it\'s doing the right thing,"" he said. ""And Mary Barra has to demonstrate that the buck stops with the CEO.""\n\nIn her letter to employees, Barra emphasized that whether the company\'s reputation and sales suffer is not the issue.\n\n""Our company\'s reputation won\'t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward,"" she said.\n\nGM faces a fine of up to $35 million from U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in addition to recall costs it has not outlined. Analysts agreed the big costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.\n\nToyota, for instance, settled economic-loss claims in its case for more than $1 billion and is negotiating settlement of hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits. It also is in talks to settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department for a reported $1 billion.\n\nHowever, that has not hurt sales or stopped Toyota from ranking highly in consumer quality rankings conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, suggesting that any damage to GM could be fleeting, analysts said.\n\nGM\'s case could take time, however, given the Detroit company\'s internal probe and the investigation opened by the NHTSA, which Cook said could last at least six months.\n\nAllan Kam, a former enforcement attorney with NHTSA, said the agency\'s 107-question ""special order"" was unusual. ""I\'ve never seen one quite as detailed as this one,"" he said.\n\nKam speculated GM would prefer to settle the NHTSA probe in a way that would allow its answers not to be published widely. However, the mounting pressure on NHTSA, with members of Congress sending letters of inquiry, may make that outcome unlikely.\n\nCopyright: Thomson Reuters 2014\n\nGet Breaking news, live coverage, and Latest News from India and around the world on NDTV.com.

Healy, pointing out that “GM president Dan Ammann came close to directly blaming the ‘old’ GM,” in telling Automotive News at the Geneva Motor Show: ‘This is a new leadership team. We\'re aiming to do things in the right way.""\n\n""We\'re doing everything we can to work with our customers and our dealers to get everything as straight as we can,"" Ammann toldAutomotive News Mike Colias and Nick Bunkley.\n\nThat includes an internal investigation for which it has hired an outside law firm that is questioning employees, WSJ’s Bennett reports.\n\n“GM had maintained before the recall that the cars involved were safe because they can be steered and stopped, even when the key slips out of ‘run,’ turns off the engine and eliminates power assist to the steering and brakes and disables some safety systems,” write James R. Healey and Greg Gardner in the Detroit Free-Press. “GM also has noted that in many of the crashes now linked to the problem that lack of seatbelt use and alcohol were factors.”\n\nIn a document that in parts seems a Pythonesque parody of legalese — “The singular includes the plural; the plural includes the singular. The masculine includes the feminine and neuter genders; the neuter gender includes the masculine and feminine genders” — the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a special order to GM with 107 specific questions it wants answered.\n\nOne in particular — No. 27 — that is drawing a lot of attention in the 27-page document is a statement by GM North America president Alan Batey in a press release Feb. 25 about the expansion of the recall. In it, he admitted, “the chronology shows that the process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.”\n\nThe NHTSA want to know exactly how it “was not as robust” as well “its plans (if any) to change its process.”\n\n“NHTSA also asked GM to name all employees or engineers involved in the ignition switch production whether they worked for GM or part supplier Delphi Automotive, which made the ignition switches,” Bennett reports.\n\n“The company is fully cooperating with NHTSA’s probe and welcomes ‘the opportunity to help the agency have a full understanding of the facts,’ a GM spokesman, Alan Adler, said in an e-mailed statement today,” reports Bloomberg’s Jeff Plungis.\n\nIndeed, General Motors appears to be trying to appear to be as transparent as possible in is current investigation of its past investigation.\n\nIn a letter to employees posted on the GM website Tuesday, CEO Barra wrote that the inquiry “has led some to ask if the recall of these out-of-production vehicles might affect our company’s reputation or sales of our current models.”\n\nHer response is “our company’s reputation won’t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward.”\n\nIndeed, Jeremy Robinson-Leon, COO at crisis public relations firm Group Gordon, tells Healey that Barra is “staking her reputation on handling this properly.”\n\n“Our process for determining whether and when to recall a vehicle is decided by experienced technical experts. They do their work independent of managers with responsibilities for other aspects of the business, so that their decisions are made solely on technical facts and engineering analysis,” Barra wrote in her email. “When this was brought to my team a few weeks ago, we acted without hesitation to go well beyond the decision by the technical experts.”\n\nThe NHTSA is facing scrutiny itself.\n\n“The safety agency has come under mounting pressure over its own failure to act on complaints about the recalled GM cars,” Christopher Jensen reports in the New York Times. “Twice, it has taken an in-depth look at fatal crashes, but has never begun a broader investigation.”\n\nSen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) last month “sent a letter to the agency saying that significant improvements were needed in the way it gathers information about potential defects,’ Jensen writes, but the agency replied that the data it had did not “warrant … opening a formal investigation.”', 'That includes an internal investigation for which it has hired an outside law firm that is questioning employees, WSJ’s Bennett reports.\nIndeed, General Motors appears to be trying to appear to be as transparent as possible in is current investigation of its past investigation.\nThey do their work independent of managers with responsibilities for other aspects of the business, so that their decisions are made solely on technical facts and engineering analysis,” Barra wrote in her email.\n“The safety agency has come under mounting pressure over its own failure to act on complaints about the recalled GM cars,” Christopher Jensen reports in the New York Times.\n“Twice, it has taken an in-depth look at fatal crashes, but has never begun a broader investigation.”Sen.

The series\' host, Neil deGrasse Tyson, a renowned astrophysicist, told CNN\'s Brian Stelter he wants the series to appeal to everyone, including those ""who don\'t know that they like science"" and ""the people who know they don\'t like science at all.""\n\nThe Wire contributor Danielle Wiener-Bronner believes Tyson tried to meet his goal to appeal to a wide audience in the first episode by ""inviting religious viewers to identify with scientists,"" but she also believes Tyson was attempting to persuade his religious audience to subscribe to evolution.\n\n""There was no ambiguity about the fact that Tyson wants its viewers to see the scientifically oppressed as akin to the religiously martyred,"" says Wiener-Bronner. She explains that the shows\' use of the story of Giordano Bruno, a monk who was persecuted and executed for having heretical views about the universe, was similar to a Christian martyr story.\n\nWiener-Bronner\'s fellow Wire contributor Abby Ohlheiser agrees with Wiener-Bronner, but she hopes religious individuals will perceive the Bruno story ""as a redrawing of the boundaries between faith and science"" rather than a condemnation of religion.\n\n""Instead of putting the two in opposition, the show wants to place faith, curiosity, wonder, and questioning — what if my God is too small? to paraphrase Bruno — along with science against enforced ignorance,"" says Ohlheiser.\n\nOther writers feel the new ""Cosmos"" is not sympathetic to religion. ""The new \'Cosmos\' feels like a pushback against faith’s encroachments on the intellectual terrain of science,"" writes Matt Zoller Seitz in Vulture.\n\nAnd Tony Rossi wrote for Patheos that ""Cosmos"" inaccurately showed religion condemning and oppressing science, especially in the case of Bruno, who wasn’t a scientist. And, Rossi said, Bruno was outcast because of his anti-God beliefs and not his perception of the universe.\n\n“The show’s presentation of science will likely be brilliant and visually stunning, hopefully opening people’s minds to the wonder and complexity of the universe,” wrote Rossi. “But it should have stayed within the parameters of its own expertise – or at least provided an unbiased look at the whole story of what actually happened. A show and worldview that thrive on empirical evidence should have the sense and integrity to apply that approach to all aspects of its storytelling.”\n\nIn an update to the post, Rossi argued that the show portrayed the Catholic Church in a negative light, but didn’t address any of the broader views on space from the church’s standpoint.\n\n“Killing people who disagree with us is indefensible, and the church was wrong to do so,” Rossi said. “Still, it’s a church with a 2,000-year history that shouldn’t just be defined by the times it was wrong.”\n\nTyson told CNN he is frustrated by the debates about religion and science that constantly appear in op-ed articles and political campaigns.\n\n""There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,"" Tyson said. ""I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there.""\n\nWhile some might think the new show is arguing against religion and faith, Slate writer Willa Paskin argued that the show is giving a uniting message about God.\n\n“Organized religion certainly comes in for it, but I think this segment is up to something more gentle than declaring war on blinkered anti-science evangelists,” Paskin wrote. “‘Cosmos’ is offering viewers a way to reconcile science and faith: Don’t let your god be too small.”\n\nReligion and space have intertwined for a while now, so much so that believers are perfectly fine with new space information that comes out, Deseret News reported in December of last year. Faithful religious followers see the universe’s chaos as an example that God exists.\n\n“It’s so perfect,” said Jennifer LeClaire, an editor and writer at the Christian magazine Charisma, to Deseret News. It’s so ordered so perfectly. What’s to keep it from melting and coming down?

For now, what we do have is a show about science airing on FOX during Sunday primetime. That’s pretty awesome.\n\nSo, the first episode of ‘Cosmo: A Spacetime Odyssey’ is a forty-minute long ode to the original, with some updated information and sort of obvious subtraction of Carl’s ominous warnings, like “The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars”.\n\nThe environmentalism and anti-war messages are downplayed, but as for the rest, it’s pretty much idea for idea the first episode of the original ‘Cosmos’, “The Cosmos and Our Place in It”, because it’s basically about the cosmos… and guess what… our place in it.\n\nNow, if you’ve been on social media at all during the airing of this episode, you’ll find a lot of people oo-ing and awing about how small and insignificant we are, and I guess with state-of-the-art graphics that makes it even more evident as you consistently zoom out in HD. The calendar Sagan is so famous for showing the world, where he shows that recorded human history only happens in the last hour of the last day of the year is updated, created a breath-taking display of how young we are in comparison to the universe.\n\nThe spaceship of the imagination is also included, only this time it’s rendered in such amazing graphics that I’m not really sure it demands a lot of imagination from the viewer. Gone is Sagan’s beige bridge, and here is a sleek ship that darts through the rings of Saturn and follows the Voyager satellite.\n\nAnd finally, Carl’s voice is heard throughout, adding to the nods the new ‘Cosmos’ is giving to its ground-breaking predecessor. Bonus, a story about how Neil deGrasse Tyson met Carl Sagan, and how that changed his life, and maybe ours as well.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t completely a rehash of the 80s. One notable addition is the story of Giodarno Bruno, a Dominican friar who took Copernicus’ theory of the Earth revolving around the sun, and expanding it by saying the sun was only one of many. It told a tale of how important imagination and critical thinking is to understanding the nature of the universe, while soothing some religious feathers by suggesting that an infinite god would live in an infinite universe. More importantly, he shed light on a little known scientific figure that proved to be right despite popular opinion. Who will be the next person who makes the next big discovery?\n\nWell, maybe they’re watching the show right now.\n\nThe episode was fun, but not really filled with new information for old fans. But then again, that’s not the point. The point of the show is to bring in a new generation of future scientists, and include them in the great Cosmic dialogue. I’m just glad to be a part of the ride, and I look forward to what new wonders the next episode will bring.', 'Years ago, the science community and children of the eighties poked their meerkat-ish heads up at the mention of a ‘Cosmos’ remake.\n“Could it be true?” they wondered, “Is the world really ready to come back to science?”Well, it’s a little too soon to answer that question, but I hope that a resounding “yes” will be the reply.\nFor now, what we do have is a show about science airing on FOX during Sunday primetime.\nAnd finally, Carl’s voice is heard throughout, adding to the nods the new ‘Cosmos’ is giving to its ground-breaking predecessor.\nI’m just glad to be a part of the ride, and I look forward to what new wonders the next episode will bring.']"

Specifically in terms of the Earth being created before the sun, as in Genesis, Tyson said, ""None of that is consistent with any scientifically derived information about the world."" He continued, ""So enlightened religious people know this, and don\'t try to use the Bible as a textbook, using a Western example.""\n\nTyson made the comments during an interview this morning on WNYC\'s ""Brian Lehrer Show.""

1535,http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2014/0310/Seven-amazing-things-we-learned-from-watching-Cosmos,technology,"['""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey"" premiered Sunday night (March 9), rebooting the series that the late astronomer Carl Sagan turned into a TV classic 34 years ago.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of sleek graphics and astronomical imagery, host Neil deGrasse Tyson brought a new generation of viewers up to speed about our place in the cosmos. In the hour-long premiere, Tyson broke down each line in our cosmic address, from Earth to the farthest reaches of the observable universe, and he time-traveled through the cosmic calendar from the Big Bang to the present.\n\nSome of these morsels may be old news for veteran ""Cosmos"" fans and space buffs, but here\'s seven awesome things we learned in the series premiere:\n\n1. Jupiter has hurricane three times the size of Earth\n\nStarting with Sagan, ""Cosmos"" has a long tradition of throwing Earth into scale. The first episode of the new series showed that even within our own solar system our home planet looks relatively small — especially compared to Jupiter.\n\n""With its four giant moons and dozens of smaller moons, Jupiter is like its own little solar system,"" Tyson said. ""It has more mass than all of the other planets combined.""\n\nTyson then pointed out the gas planet\'s Great Red Spot, a hurricane three times the size of Earth that\'s been plaguing Jupiter for centuries.\n\n2. Our solar system has a huge shell that no one can see\n\nOur solar system is enclosed by a swarm of icy bodies known as the Oort cloud, but as a whole, this shell is imperceptible to humans. That\'s because these comets — leftovers from the solar system\'s formation — are separated from each other by hundreds of millions of miles.\n\n""Each one of these little worlds is as far from it\'s nearest neighbor as Earth is from Saturn,"" Tyson said.\n\n3. Our universe may be part of a multiverse\n\nThe ""observable universe,"" is listed as the last line in our cosmic address (Earth is first) in the inaugural episode of the new ""Cosmos."" But as Tyson says, this may only be our cosmic horizon.\n\n""Many of us suspect that all of this — all the worlds, stars, galaxies and clusters in our observable universe — is but one tiny bubble in an infinite ocean of other universes,"" Tyson said. In other words, we could be living in a multiverse.\n\n4. Our cosmic perspective is relatively new\n\nCosmically speaking, it wasn\'t so long ago that humans thought Earth was the center of the universe. (Actually you can still find humans who believe this; a recent survey found that 1 in 4 Americans thinks the sun revolves around Earth.)\n\n""Cosmos"" illustrates just how dangerous it was to challenge cosmic mores a mere 400 years ago through the tale of Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by executive producer Seth MacFarlane). Bruno suggested that we live in a boundless universe, orbiting one of many stars. His reward? Imprisonment and a fiery death at the stake.\n\n5. In the cosmic calendar, Jesus was born just 5 seconds ago\n\nThose who watched Sagan\'s original series will remember the cosmic calendar, which is a way to conceptualize the age of the universe (13.8 billion years). Tyson revived the tool, explaining that Jan. 1 would mark the Big Bang and the present falls on midnight on Dec. 31. At this scale, every day represents nearly 40 million years and humans only evolved in the last hour of New Year\'s Eve.\n\n6. Carl Sagan and new ""Cosmos"" host Neil deGrasse Tyson go way back\n\nOne poignant moment in the ""Cosmos"" premiere occurred at the end, where host Neil deGrasse Tyson touched on Sagan\'s legacy in astronomy and science communication. Tyson showed a day calendar from 1975 - Sagan\'s own daily planner - with a meeting with Tyson penned in on a Saturday. Sagan had invited the then 17-year-old Tyson to Ithaca, N.Y., where Sagan taught at Cornell University, for a visit. It was snowing when the young Tyson went to catch the bus back home to the Bronx. Sagan gave Tyson his home phone number, and invited the student to call him if the bus didn\'t show and spend the weekend with his family. """"I already knew I wanted to become a scientist, but that afternoon I learned what kind of person I wanted to be,"" Tyson said in the premiere.\n\n7. We are made of star stuff\n\nLong-time ""Cosmos"" fans were waiting for this moment and Tyson delivered.\n\nHe explained that the stuff of life and the elements familiar to us on Earth today were cooked inside the hearts of collapsing stars billions of years ago.\n\n""They get so hot that the nuclei of the atoms fuse together deep within them to make the oxygen with breathe, the carbon in our muscles, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our blood,"" Tyson said. ""You, me, everyone: We are made of star stuff.""\n\nThe premiere of ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey will re-air tonight at 10 p.m. ET/PT on the National Geographic Channel and include some extra material on the making of the show.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

I could tell you it melts lead. But that’s not as fun as saying, ‘You can cook a pizza on the windowsill in 9 seconds.’ And next time my fans eat pizza, they’re thinking of Venus!”\n\nTyson told CNN’s Brian Stelter that one of the ideas behind “Cosmos” is to reignite “that flame of curiosity in us all.”\n\n“One of our mission statements in ‘Cosmos’ is to present science with all of its glory and the majesty and the mystery and the wonder — the things we all take for granted as children,” Tyson said on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources.”\n\nTyson acknowledged that he’s bothered about the debate between science and religion that’s became a mainstay of political campaigns and op-ed pages.\n\n“There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,” Tyson told Stelter. “I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there.”\n\nThough there was some tweaking of religion on social media — “SPOILER ALERT: apparently the earth is not 6000 years old… Who knew!?” tweeted JaclynGlenn — in general, people were impressed.\n\n“That was the best commercial for science ever,” tweeted Dan Treadway.\n\nAnd Wil Wheaton — who knows a little something about TV, entertainment and science, having been an actor on “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and “The Big Bang Theory” — was positively effusive.\n\n“Dear everyone involved in making #cosmos: Thank you. Thank you so much. I hope you inspire an entire generation to fall in love with science,” he tweeted.\n\n“Cosmos” will continue for 12 more episodes.\n\nBy Todd Leopold', '“It feels like it’s missing its own point: that the greatest wonders aren’t CG (computer generated) spectacle, but our own marvelous universe,” he wrote.\nScience fans — and fans of the original series — have been awaiting the new “Cosmos” for months.\nThe show has the imprimatur of Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, and is being produced by “Family Guy” mogul Seth MacFarlane, an avowed “Cosmos” geek.\n“There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,” Tyson told Stelter.\n“Cosmos” will continue for 12 more episodes.']"

1540,http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/03/10/3384351/neil-degrasse-tyson-science-deniers/,technology,"['Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and host of National Geographic and Fox’s new show Cosmos, said Sunday that he thinks the media needs to stop providing false balance in stories on scientific subjects like climate change.\n\nHost of CNN’s Reliable Sources Brian Stelter asked Tyson whether he thought the media had a responsibility portray science correctly, particularly when discussing climate change.\n\n“The media has to sort of come out of this ethos that I think was in principle a good one, but it doesn’t really apply in science,” Tyson said. “The ethos was, whatever story you give, you have to give the opposing view. And then you can be viewed as balanced.”\n\nStelter showed a clip of President Obama’s climate speech last year, in which he decried climate deniers by saying the country didn’t have time for a “meeting of the flat Earth society.” Tyson said the president’s reference was a good example of how the idea of “balance” in scientific stories doesn’t make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“In the clip you showed of the president — you don’t talk about the spherical Earth with NASA, and then say ‘now let’s give equal time to the flat Earthers,” he said. “Plus, science is not there for you to cherry pick…You can decide whether or not to believe in it but that doesn’t change the reality of an emergent scientific truth.”\n\nTyson has spoken before about the need for the public to accept scientific facts rather than the talking points of politicians. In 2011, he said people who deny climate change exists need “to be mature enough to recognize something can be true even if you don’t like the consequences of it. That’s what it means to be a mature adult.” And this February, Tyson said on CNN that he hopes America doesn’t wait until climate change has drastically changed the Earth’s landscape to realize that our policies haven’t done enough to prepare us.\n\n“When politicians start analyzing the science, I don’t know what to say at that point,” Tyson said. “Are we going to wait until the coastlines get redrawn as the glaciers melt off of Antarctica and Greenland?”\n\nTyson also said he hopes Cosmos, which premiered March 9, can help Americans learn how to decipher scientific facts from political spin and that it can help Americans become better stewards of the Earth.\n\n“The goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet,” he said. “It involves presenting science in ways that connect to you, so Cosmos can influence you not only intellectually but emotionally, with a celebration of wonder and awe.”', 'Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and host of National Geographic and Fox’s new show Cosmos, said Sunday that he thinks the media needs to stop providing false balance in stories on scientific subjects like climate change.\nHost of CNN’s Reliable Sources Brian Stelter asked Tyson whether he thought the media had a responsibility portray science correctly, particularly when discussing climate change.\n“The media has to sort of come out of this ethos that I think was in principle a good one, but it doesn’t really apply in science,” Tyson said.\n“When politicians start analyzing the science, I don’t know what to say at that point,” Tyson said.\n“The goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet,” he said.']"

The show has the imprimatur of Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, and is being produced by “Family Guy” mogul Seth MacFarlane, an avowed “Cosmos” geek.\n\nSIGN-UP YOUR FAVORITE STUDENT TO BE FOX40’S STUDENT OF THE WEEK\n\n\n\nThrough it all, Tyson has maintained his good humor as he’s promoted the show.\n\n“The universe is hilarious!” he told GQ in a recent interview. “Like, Venus is 900 degrees. I could tell you it melts lead. But that’s not as fun as saying, ‘You can cook a pizza on the windowsill in 9 seconds.’ And next time my fans eat pizza, they’re thinking of Venus!”\n\nTyson told CNN’s Brian Stelter that one of the ideas behind “Cosmos” is to reignite “that flame of curiosity in us all.”\n\n“One of our mission statements in ‘Cosmos’ is to present science with all of its glory and the majesty and the mystery and the wonder — the things we all take for granted as children,” Tyson said on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources.”\n\nTyson acknowledged that he’s bothered about the debate between science and religion that’s became a mainstay of political campaigns and op-ed pages.\n\n“There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,” Tyson told Stelter. “I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there.”\n\nThough there was some tweaking of religion on social media — “SPOILER ALERT: apparently the earth is not 6000 years old… Who knew!?” tweeted JaclynGlenn — in general, people were impressed.\n\n“That was the best commercial for science ever,” tweeted Dan Treadway.\n\nAnd Wil Wheaton — who knows a little something about TV, entertainment and science, having been an actor on “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and “The Big Bang Theory” — was positively effusive.\n\n“Dear everyone involved in making #cosmos: Thank you. Thank you so much. I hope you inspire an entire generation to fall in love with science,” he tweeted.\n\n“Cosmos” will continue for 12 more episodes.', '“It feels like it’s missing its own point: that the greatest wonders aren’t CG (computer generated) spectacle, but our own marvelous universe,” he wrote.\nScience fans — and fans of the original series — have been awaiting the new “Cosmos” for months.\nThe show has the imprimatur of Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, and is being produced by “Family Guy” mogul Seth MacFarlane, an avowed “Cosmos” geek.\n“There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,” Tyson told Stelter.\n“Cosmos” will continue for 12 more episodes.']"

For many people, that show was responsible for introducing them to our universe. It was wildly successful, reaching an estimated 700 million people.\n\nIn the show, Sagan explored not just astronomy, but the very essence of life, from the infinitesimally small, to the uncomprehendingly large. More than 30 years passed and rumours swirled about the possibility of reintroducing the series to a whole new generation.\n\nBut in our day and age — a time of instant gratification and shortened attention spans — how do you wow the audience in a 13-part show about the universe?\n\nCarl Sagan standing next to a model of the Viking lander in Death Valley, California.

Science shows actually had science programming. But with the addition of hundreds of channels all vying for our attention, so-called specialty channels that promised science content had to reinvent themselves.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn order for science to be appealing these days, it has to be sleek and sexy. National Geographic is now “Nat Geo,” a cable channel with a cool nickname. Shiny graphics, maps, and exciting footage are all used together with narration to provide a more immersive experience. And this is what the new Cosmos is doing.\n\nTyson is a logical choice for taking over where Sagan left off: his enthusiasm and love of astronomy and science is clear. He has mass appeal. And Sagan was a huge influence on Tyson, the two having met while Tyson was a teenager. Tyson has often said that he wants to follow in Sagan’s footsteps.\n\nWATCH: Carl Sagan’s influence on Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\n\n\nThe question is whether or not — in the age of the Internet — that this kind of show will have legs.

This was done on purpose, as a way to get the show out to people who may not otherwise be exposed to science like this. I think that was a clever and wise decision. Good on them.\n\nNow about the show: It’s gorgeous, both for the eyes and the brain. The special effects are wonderful and wondrous, and Neil Tyson’s style and voice are a good fit. This first episode is all about showing how small we are; it starts with a brief overview of the Universe (even writing that makes me smile), going from the Earth to the limits of how far we can see.\n\nInterestingly, the next two segments are spent telling the story of Giordano Bruno, a 16th-century Italian monk who theorized that the stars were suns, that other planets existed, and that life existed everywhere. He saw this as an obvious extension to the glory of God, but of course the Church took a dimmer view, convicted him of heresy, and burned him at the stake.\n\nCosmos spent a lot of time on this, and I think they were making an interesting and subtle point. A shallow takeaway is that they were slamming religion, but I don’t think that was the reason behind those segments; that could’ve been done faster, in only a few minutes.\n\nInstead, I see it as making the more interesting and bigger point about suppression of thought and the grandeur of freedom of exploration of ideas. Certainly, the Church was stuck in its dogma, burning Bruno and later having a go at Galileo. But you’ll note that the story was told with the focus on Bruno himself, his ideas, and how he could not be deterred from spreading the word about the greater Universe. Even as he was marched off to his death, his mind was among the stars.\n\nYes, that doesn’t cast the Church in a positive light, but guess what: The Church wasn’t exactly a force for enlightenment back then. Its arrogance held it back while humanity moved on. Cosmos was honest about this and still managed to present this story as a paean to human curiosity and drive for exploration. And to be honest, Tyson then discussed how Bruno’s vision of the Universe was a lucky guess. That’s the thing about science: It spares no truth for comforting fables.\n\nBut there’s more.\n\nTyson faces down the Big Bang.\n\nPhoto by Fox\n\n\n\nThe next segment was about the Cosmic Calendar, retooling all of time such that the 13.8 billion year history of the Universe is rescaled to one year. On this scale, the Sun itself wasn’t formed until late August, the dinosaurs were wiped out on December 30, and all of human written history took place in the last 14 seconds before midnight on New Year’s Eve.\n\nAgain, as in the previous segments, the Universe makes us seem small, insignificant. Through science we have learned that the Universe was not made for us, and we are not at its center, and we hold little or no special place in it. Indeed, its scale crushes our aspirations to dust.\n\nYet here we are, contemplating it. Our greatest achievement is to understand that we are a part of it, that we can understand it at all, and we can explore it if given the freedom to do so. That, to me, was the point of this first episode. And it’s a damn fine one.\n\nFinally, the show ends on a personal note for Tyson, talking about Carl Sagan, the original writer and host of Cosmos. I won’t spoil it, because it was lovely, touching, and remarkably well-done. But it does something I wish more programs would: It humanizes scientists and shows science as a human endeavor. It is the most human of endeavors, in fact. It is our imagination, our urge to explore, our desire to discover, and our unquenchable need to find things out.\n\n\n\nWe stand on the shores of a cosmic ocean, and there is so much more about it to know.', 'Photo from Fox, from the trailer for the showAs I write this, the world premiere of the new, updated version of Cosmos just aired.\nCosmos spent a lot of time on this, and I think they were making an interesting and subtle point.\nCosmos was honest about this and still managed to present this story as a paean to human curiosity and drive for exploration.\nFinally, the show ends on a personal note for Tyson, talking about Carl Sagan, the original writer and host of Cosmos.\nBut it does something I wish more programs would: It humanizes scientists and shows science as a human endeavor.']"

The seminal series opened the eyes of millions to the universe and made a science celebrity out of Sagan.\n\nNow astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson is stepping up to star in a 13-part remake of the series on the National Geographic Channel and Fox. The first show airs on Sunday, March 9 (at 9 p.m. ET/PT), and will be broadcast in more than 70 nations—the biggest launch ever for a global TV series. National Geographic spoke to Tyson, the director of the American Museum of Natural History\'s Hayden Planetarium, about life, the universe, and the ""cosmic perspective"" Cosmos will offer viewers.\n\nWhy re-create Cosmos? Why now?\n\nAny time is good for Cosmos. A lot of things have come together to make this the right time to do it. We have come so far in the last 34 years—more than a generation. Clearly it’s time for another Cosmos. Since then we have discovered a thousand new planets. A lot has changed. Back in 1980 we were trapped in a Cold War mind-set, which polarized people and affected everything. People thought of the environment as a local thing. They didn\'t think of the global environment and how we are all connected.\n\nWhat\'s new about this Cosmos?\n\nWith Cosmos, this version, we\'re able to bring a whole tool kit of storytelling cinematics to bear on the science, the history, the culture, and the politics to fill people with a sense of wonder about our universe. It might even impact people spiritually. I mean that with a little s. That’s the reaction some people might feel by gaining the cosmic perspective—seeing that we are just a small part of the vastness of everything. But that can be emotionally fulfilling in a very deep way.\n\nWhat are the most important advances you’ve seen since 1980 that the new Cosmos will consider?\n\nThe purpose of Cosmos is not to be a textbook to tell people about the latest discoveries. The whole point of telling these stories is to allow you to understand that science, the scientific method, is central to all of our lives. Yes, we\'ll learn more science, about the scientific method. But what we really want is for people to say, ""Wow, I didn\'t know we were all connected in that way."" That\'s the goal.\n\nWhy is understanding the scientific method so important?\n\nBecause it\'s how we make discoveries and how we understand and survive in our world today. Just think for how long humanity was controlled by mystical, magical thinking—the diseases and suffering that led to. We managed to survive, but just barely. It wasn\'t pretty.', 'Now astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson is stepping up to star in a 13-part remake of the series on the National Geographic Channel and Fox.\nNational Geographic spoke to Tyson, the director of the American Museum of Natural History\'s Hayden Planetarium, about life, the universe, and the ""cosmic perspective"" Cosmos will offer viewers.\nThe whole point of telling these stories is to allow you to understand that science, the scientific method, is central to all of our lives.\nYes, we\'ll learn more science, about the scientific method.\nWhy is understanding the scientific method so important?']"

Originally the vehicle of science icon Carl Sagan, the new show is produced in cooperation with his wife Ann Druyan and helmed by astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson. This review includes spoilers below.\n\nIn the first episode, deGrasse Tyson leads off the show with a call to viewers to join the heros of the past and “do science”; a worthy description of the scientific method that may make some subset of Fox Television viewers uncomfortable. This show is going to include discussion of the conventional scientific view of the origins of the universe and biological evolution for example.\n\nTo make this journey we’ll need imagination, but imagination alone is not enough because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine. This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules. Test ideas by experiment and observation, build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones that fail. Follow the evidence wherever it leads and question everything. Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.\n\n“Earth” our home address.\n\nIf the opener, Standing Up In The Milky Way, is any example, Cosmos is not going to be much of an intellectual challenge to many readers of H+. The opening episode explores the familiar theme of our humble place in the vast universe made famous in the Eames film Powers of Ten.\n\nWhile it explores territory we are familiar with, the update is fresh and includes ideas such as the multiverse and crisply shows the real scale of human lives and our world. For those who are not familiar with these ideas, this show will open their eyes at least if they are ready to watch and learn. Cosmos will I expect inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers. And it is fun to watch.\n\nStarting from Earth, Tyson leads us out into the solar system, to the Milky Way galaxy, to the local group and beyond to the “Virgo supercluster” and even beyond this, to the furthest edge of the known universe and a network of 100 billion galaxies.\n\nThe show is not going to shy away from controversy it seems. The first episode follows with the story of a revolution in human ideas at the dawn of the scientific method which is known as the Copernican Revolution. The trial by the Catholic Church of Giordano Bruno is retold in the form of an animation; Seth MacFarlane creator of Fox’s hit Family Guy is the executive producer of Cosmos and it shows right here.\n\nThis sequence was unexpectedly emotional and depicts the conflict between Bruno’s vision of the universe and the existing geocentric and “finite universe” dogma of the Catholic Church at that time. The segment ends with Bruno being burned alive while being menaced with a cross. Wow.\n\nFollowing a presentation about the age of the universe in comparison to human evolution, the show ends with a very personal homage to Carl Sagan from Tyson himself. Some may find the science content a bit too light for their tastes, but Neil deGrasse Tyson performs admirably and confirms himself as the heir to Sagan’s large legacy in this first show. I’m looking forward to watching and sharing the rest.\n\nMissed it? You can watch the first episode of Cosmos on Fox’s website here.

Now, thirty four years later, Neil DeGrasse Tyson stands on the same seaside promontory Sagan used to open his program to introduce Cosmos to a new generation.\n\nThe Ship of the Imagination\n\nFor his series, Sagan created the Ship of the Imagination, a dandelion seed-like snowflake of light and perception which could travel the cosmos unfettered by the limitations of space and time. Tyson\'s newly christened Ship of the Imagination is a slick, environment mapped craft reminiscent of Boba Fett\'s which travels not only through the billions of light years of our visible universe, but also across the decades of advancement in telescopy, filmmaking and visual effects. His Cosmos appears more polished, more richly detailed, but also more familiar to the generation raised on images from the Hubble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd where Sagan began his voyage out in deep space and slowly made his way toward the inner solar system, Tyson begins his journey here, on Earth, and uses the Ship to establish our cosmic address: Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Local Group, The Universe.\n\nYour God is Too Small\n\nSagan and Tyson both follow the Ship of the Imagination with stories of men who helped bring scientific thought to the world. These stories establish the importance of science to humanity and represent the greatest contrast between today\'s Cosmos and the Cosmos of yesteryear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSagan choose for his subject the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, who correctly calculated the curvature of the Earth by comparing noonday shadow measurements taken at different latitudes and follows with a paen for the lost Library of Alexandria. Tyson\'s subject, told in animation, is the story of Giordano Bruno, the sixteenth century monk who challenged church teaching on the centrality of the Earth and the infinite nature of the universe.\n\nSagan, worried about the nuclear arms race and the potential for humanity to destroy ourselves, warned us of the fragility of knowledge and what we can all lose if we\'re too careless with fire. Tyson, on the other hand, warns us of the danger of living in a world where questioning official stories becomes heresy, where curiosity becomes thought crime and where exploration of the universe becomes a trespass into the dominion of authority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Tyson\'s Cosmos, Bruno speaks to his fellow believers and tells them that if they cannot accept a universe where the stars are truly suns, where Earth is but one of many planets and where the scope of creation extends into infinity because these ideas violate their sense of God, then it is their sense of God that is too small.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is a danger is making a God that is too big as well. A theory of anything is a theory of nothing, and there is just as much harmful dogma in giving equal time to geocentrists and flat Earthers as there is in forbidding ideas that contradict a holy book. ""We will speculate,"" said Sagan in his introduction, ""but we will always remember that there is a difference between speculation and fact."" At a time when our leaders openly characterize science as ""just another worldview"" and suggest that it\'s simply not fair that myths and hunches should not be given an equal place at the table as theories and data, this restatement of the purpose of science is more than a little bit welcome.\n\nThe Cosmic Calendar\n\nThe final element in both Sagan\'s and Tyson\'s first episode is the Cosmic Calendar, which presents the entire history of the cosmos compressed into a single year. Having placed our home world in its spatial context and our epoch in historical context, the Cosmic Calendar places our entire existence in its temporal context: if the universe was one year old, civilization would be less than ten seconds old. Everything we\'ve ever heard of, every battle, every king, every empire, every invention, every tragedy and every triumph exists in those scant few final seconds of the Cosmic Year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSagan ends his premiere episode with a slightly metaphor-breaking question about how our civilization will face the first seconds of the next cosmic year and whether we will have the wisdom to avoid destroying ourselves and prove ourselves worthy inheritors of the vast cosmos we inhabit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTyson answers this question by bringing the story back to Carl Sagan himself, recalling the contributions he made not only to cosmology and planetary science, but also to Tyson\'s own life as well as our own. On a different, more humble calendar, Tyson shows us a meeting Carl Sagan had scheduled on December 20th 1975 with a 17 year old kid from the Bronx named...Neil DeGrasse Tyson.\n\nIn her introduction to the 2005 re-issue of the original series, Ann Druyan described Cosmos as ""both a history of the scientific enterprise and an attempt to convey the soaring spiritual high of its central revelation: our oneness with the universe.""\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn tying Sagan\'s personal voyage back to his own, Tyson not only elevates Sagan to the pantheon of scientific visionaries like Bruno, Eratosthenes, Kepler, Galileo and the others who struggled to light a candle and banish the darkness of the demon haunted world, but he reminds us that the value of science must be told and retold to each subsequent generation.\n\nWhether we\'re confronting the scientific ""hostage situation"" created by Cold War hegemony or filtering the deluge of dubious information that the current generation absorbs on a daily basis, science is the corrective lens that helps us see more clearly that our faults lie, as ever, not in our stars, but in ourselves.\n\n\n\nCosmos airs each Sunday night at 9:00 on Fox TV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJason Shankel is a writer and creative developer who is made of star stuff.', ""In 1980, Carl Sagan opened his series Cosmos with these words, capturing both the immensity and intimacy of the universe.\nNow, thirty four years later, Neil DeGrasse Tyson stands on the same seaside promontory Sagan used to open his program to introduce Cosmos to a new generation.\nHis Cosmos appears more polished, more richly detailed, but also more familiar to the generation raised on images from the Hubble.\nThese stories establish the importance of science to humanity and represent the greatest contrast between today's Cosmos and the Cosmos of yesteryear.\nThe Cosmic CalendarThe final element in both Sagan's and Tyson's first episode is the Cosmic Calendar, which presents the entire history of the cosmos compressed into a single year.""]"

I could tell you it melts lead. But that’s not as fun as saying, ‘You can cook a pizza on the windowsill in 9 seconds.’ And next time my fans eat pizza, they’re thinking of Venus!”\n\nTyson told CNN’s Brian Stelter that one of the ideas behind “Cosmos” is to reignite “that flame of curiosity in us all.”\n\n“One of our mission statements in ‘Cosmos’ is to present science with all of its glory and the majesty and the mystery and the wonder — the things we all take for granted as children,” Tyson said on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources.”\n\nTyson acknowledged that he’s bothered about the debate between science and religion that’s became a mainstay of political campaigns and op-ed pages.\n\n“There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,” Tyson told Stelter. “I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there.”\n\nThough there was some tweaking of religion on social media — “SPOILER ALERT: apparently the earth is not 6000 years old… Who knew!?” tweeted JaclynGlenn — in general, people were impressed.\n\n“That was the best commercial for science ever,” tweeted Dan Treadway.\n\nAnd Wil Wheaton — who knows a little something about TV, entertainment and science, having been an actor on “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and “The Big Bang Theory” — was positively effusive.\n\n“Dear everyone involved in making #cosmos: Thank you. Thank you so much. I hope you inspire an entire generation to fall in love with science,” he tweeted.\n\n“Cosmos” will continue for 12 more episodes.', '“It feels like it’s missing its own point: that the greatest wonders aren’t CG (computer generated) spectacle, but our own marvelous universe,” he wrote.\nScience fans — and fans of the original series — have been awaiting the new “Cosmos” for months.\nThe show has the imprimatur of Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, and is being produced by “Family Guy” mogul Seth MacFarlane, an avowed “Cosmos” geek.\n“There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof,” Tyson told Stelter.\n“Cosmos” will continue for 12 more episodes.']"
1576,http://flavorwire.com/444371/neil-degrasse-tysons-cosmos-is-just-different-enough-from-carl-sagans-to-work/,technology,"['The roof-raising finale of True Detective will justifiably dominate discussion of the weekend’s television (I’m never going to look at flowers or dolls quite the same way), but last night also saw the premiere of the new Cosmos. I loved the original series, so I approached Sunday’s premiere with as much trepidation as anything else. The idiosyncratic charms of Carl Sagan’s series — the Ship of the Imagination, the turtlenecks, the need to invent the universe before apple pie — are pretty much impossible to replicate, so was this gonna be any good? Happily, the answer — so far, at least — is “yes.”\n\nPart of the charm of Sagan’s Cosmos was its earnest confidence in both its host’s ability to explain and its audience’s willingness to understand. The show assumed that people really did want to know why there were crabs that looked like samurai, or whether there might be more than three dimensions, and that the subject matter was compelling enough that it didn’t need any jazzing up. It’s striking to compare it to later shows like How the Universe Works, where the story of the universe is structured as a narrative, with hilarious cliffhangers and a dramatic voiceover.\n\nCosmos was never like that — its narrative leaped from the dawn of time to the present to the future and back again, following its creator’s train of thought and his whims. It was presented as “a personal voyage,” and it was — one that could only have been undertaken by the man who took it. Sensibly, host Neil deGrasse Tyson and the new show’s creators don’t attempt to replicate this idea. Instead, this is billed as “a spacetime odyssey,” and Tyson’s style of presentation tends more toward the conventional narration of, say, David Attenborough than Sagan.\n\nStill, Tyson is very much part of the show, and you get the feeling that this series will be as identified with him as the original was with Sagan. At the end of this premiere, he speaks fondly and movingly of the time he met Sagan as a teenager — the two spent a day together, an experience that Tyson suggests was just as formative in shaping his personality as in making him want to become a scientist — and there’s a real sense of a baton being passed here, with Tyson taking up the work of his predecessor and bringing popular science to the world. (He also shares Sagan’s penchants for moments of flair, amusingly donning a pair of sunglasses before bearing witness to a recreation of the Big Bang.)\n\nIt’s a tricky balance to strike, paying homage to what’s gone before while steering clear of being a complete pastiche. On the strength of the premiere, at least, the new Cosmos manages to get it right. There are elements that’ll be familiar to fans of the original show — the Ship of the Imagination, the Cosmic Calendar — but also new ideas, like the animated sections that relate the story of ill-fated 16th-century visionary Giordano Bruno, who was one of the first to propose the idea that the sun was just one of many stars, and was burned at the stake by the Catholic Church for his trouble.\n\nThe animations will divide fans, I suspect, but there’s a certain charm to them, especially as a counterpoint to the big-budget CGI of the new Ship of the Imagination. They’re the sort of thing that Sagan might have liked, you suspect — a method of relating a story that makes it popularly accessible without dumbing down or trivializing the subject. It’s this balance between storytelling and education that the original Cosmos struck so well, and while the first episode isn’t a huge amount of evidence to judge on, the new Cosmos seems to do this well.\n\nPopular science is a field that’s difficult to get right, but hugely rewarding if you do so. As Sagan’s widow Ann Druyan, who co-wrote the original series with her husband, says here: “Both series combine rigorous scientific skepticism with a soaring sense of the romance of life in the cosmos.” That’s an admirable goal, and one that all popular science should aspire to.\n\nScience shouldn’t be dry — it’s eternally fascinating, especially when you’re dealing with headline topics like the origin of the universe and the birth of stars — but neither should it need to be tarted up for the masses. Like the original Cosmos, Tyson’s series talks to the viewer as an equal, and invites them to come on a fascinating journey. It’s one that we’ll enjoy taking, I think.', 'I loved the original series, so I approached Sunday’s premiere with as much trepidation as anything else.\nThe idiosyncratic charms of Carl Sagan’s series — the Ship of the Imagination, the turtlenecks, the need to invent the universe before apple pie — are pretty much impossible to replicate, so was this gonna be any good?\nHappily, the answer — so far, at least — is “yes.”Part of the charm of Sagan’s Cosmos was its earnest confidence in both its host’s ability to explain and its audience’s willingness to understand.\nIt’s this balance between storytelling and education that the original Cosmos struck so well, and while the first episode isn’t a huge amount of evidence to judge on, the new Cosmos seems to do this well.\nLike the original Cosmos, Tyson’s series talks to the viewer as an equal, and invites them to come on a fascinating journey.']"

Produced by Seth Macfarlane and narrated by popular astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the series debuted to both critical acclaim, fan hype and high ratings. However, not everyone is happy with the way the series depicted the birth of the universe.\n\nA group of rigidly inflexible extremists are speaking out against the show for what they feel is an inaccurate depiction of the Big Bang, citing a dated piece of literature as proof. ""I was really excited to see how Cosmos showed the creation of the universe,"" said Geoffrey Graver, a 51 year old analyst from Portland Oregon. ""Imagine my disappointment when they didn\'t show a giant cosmic hand grabbing a spiral galaxy in the center of a astronomical maelstrom.""\n\nGraver and several others are upset that Cosmos didn\'t use DC\'s Crisis on Infinite Earths\' theory of the multiverse, which states that an Oan scientist named Krona created the multiverse when he attempted to view the beginning of the universe, causing all sorts of weird shit to go down. ""With all of Tyson\'s talk of the multiverse and the Big Bang, you\'d think he\'d have the good grace to acknowledge that it all came about when an alien tried to glimpse at forbidden knowledge,"" Graver said. He went on to express his displeasure that the show also didn\'t reference the Source Wall or the Fourth World, both key components in DC\'s universal theory.\n\nGraver stated that he\'s spoken to dozens of like-minded fans and have even gone as far as to petition the US government to force Cosmos to reference the DC theory of creation, citing that viewers would have an otherwise be presented with an incomplete set of universal creation theories. ""It\'s not that I don\'t mind Cosmos discussing other theories about the creation of the universe,"" Graver said. ""It\'s just that I want them to talk about the correct one as well. You know, the one that involves a giant hand squeezing a galaxy like a melon.""\n\nThe Outhouse reached out to deGrasse Tyson for comment, but he was busy with speaking to real websites, so we turned to the only other scientist we know for his opinion on Graver\'s complaints. ""It\'s true,"" said Thaddeus T. Puffinbottoms, professor of Bullshit Astrophysical Theories at the prestigious DeVry University. ""Cosmos didn\'t references giant cosmic hands, Thetans, Cthulhu, or conflicting creation stories found in the same chapter of Genesis. If you were looking for fanciful, but totally legitimate, theories on how the universe was created, you\'d be disappointed.""\n\nGraver isn\'t the only person upset with Cosmos. ""I watched Cosmos just so I could bitch about The Big Bang Theory on Facebook and write fifteen articles about it on my website,"" said Gus Sterlingham, a self-proclaimed know it all and journalist. ""So imagine my surprise when Sheldon Cooper, Penny No Last Name, or Leonard Hofstadter didn\'t make appearances on the show. How am I supposed to whine about a television show if they don\'t put things in there that I don\'t like?""\n\nNational Geographic will air an encore of the controversial episode tonight, featuring new material. New episodes will air on Sundays.', 'Fans are upset that the show didn\'t use the comic book version of the creation of the universe.\nSource: ThanosCopter NewswireLast night, Fox aired the long awaited premiere of Cosmos, a remake of the 1980 Carl Sagan show.\n""I was really excited to see how Cosmos showed the creation of the universe,"" said Geoffrey Graver, a 51 year old analyst from Portland Oregon.\n""It\'s not that I don\'t mind Cosmos discussing other theories about the creation of the universe,"" Graver said.\n""Cosmos didn\'t references giant cosmic hands, Thetans, Cthulhu, or conflicting creation stories found in the same chapter of Genesis.']"

The show featured an introduction by President Barack Obama and on Twitter, NASA let viewers explore some of the featured moments in the episode, from Hubble images to the exploration of planets and interstellar space.\n\nThe first episode, “Standing Up in the Milky Way,” focused on our galaxy, and NASA has played a big role in its exploration. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has big shoes to fill, following in the footsteps of the late Carl Sagan, who created and hosted the original show in 1980, but his personality and sense of humor has already earned him plenty of fans. Much like Sagan, Tyson makes science accessible and fun while reveling in the beauty of scientific exploration.\n\nEarly ratings are in for ""Cosmos,"" and it appears to be a hit. Full numbers will not be available until later on Monday but the Fox premiere averaged 5.8 million viewers, notes the Hollywood Reporter. The premiere of “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey” featured many of NASA’s missions, and the space agency kept the conversation going by giving viewers an in-depth look at some of the coolest moments.

1582,http://thegrio.com/2014/03/10/cosmos-is-back-with-new-host-for-new-generation/,technology,"[""LOS ANGELES (AP) — Astronomer Carl Sagan become Mr. Science for a generation after his 1980 series, “Cosmos,” took audiences on a groundbreaking TV journey through the universe.\n\nAstrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of “Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,” the 21st-century edition debuting Sunday, has a head start with a Twitter following of 1.7 million that’s just edged by the starry likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cee Lo Green.\n\nTyson, a go-to expert for news reports on Earth-threatening asteroids and other science developments, said his public profile frees him from comparisons to Sagan. The educator and author with a gift for conveying the wonder of discovery died in 1996 at age 62.\n\n“If I didn’t have a following, I think people would say, ‘How is he going to fill Carl Sagan’s shoes? How is he going to pronounce billion?'” said Tyson, referring to the “billions and billions of stars” phrase made famous by Sagan in “Cosmos” (although purists insist Sagan said “upon,” not “and”).\n\nSagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and he’s the presenter for the second. He gamely accepts an analogy, one he’s clearly heard before, to the string of actors who have starred in the “Doctor Who” title role.\n\nEach contributes something different, but “you’re still with the franchise at the end of the day,” he said.\n\nThe new version begins its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.\n\nTyson, 55, brings to the program his distinguished credentials as director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an author whose works include “Space Chronicles” and “The Pluto Files.”\n\nHe’s the perfect modern media scientist: tall and good-looking, with a deep voice that he uses to charismatic and authoritative effect.\n\nProving he’s a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took “Gravity” to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his “Mysteries of #Gravity” tweets: “Why Bullock’s hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.”\n\nHe is also one of the nation’s most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isn’t in the forefront of his perspective.\n\n“I’ve never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not?” Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.\n\n“I don’t go around saying I’m going to be somebody’s role model. In fact, I think the concept of ‘role model’ is overrated and should be rethought,” he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldn’t have happened.\n\n“Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because you’re only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you,” Tyson said. “And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.”\n\nHis involvement in “Cosmos” brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for “Family Guy” laughs in the half-hour preceding “Cosmos” on Sunday and suddenly find themselves lost in space.\n\nIt was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind “Family Guy” and other projects including Fox’s “American Dad!” and the movie “Ted,” who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original “Cosmos,” also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.\n\nMacFarlane told reporters in January that he “wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said ‘yes.'”\n\nThey became collaborators on “Cosmos,” with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget “commensurate” with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on “Matrix” and “Spider-Man” movies.\n\nPatrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of “Cosmos.”\n\nAdding to its pedigree: Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.\n\nShe’s also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.\n\n“Yes, it’s the same in that intersection of emotion and solid science and fabulous facts and animation and drama and history,” she told a news conference. “But it’s completely new.”\n\nFor Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the “awe and wonder” of the universe and the role of science in helping them “become a better shepherd of this world.”\n\n“We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address,” he said.\n\n___\n\nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

1584,http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/03/10/cosmos-when-carl-sagan-sent-me-a-letter/,technology,"['One of the nice surprises in last night’s Cosmos reboot with Neil deGrasse Tyson was the show’s tribute to Dr. Carl Sagan at the end of the program.\n\nStanding on the same seaside cliff in Northern California where Sagan filmed some of his scenes from the original series, deGrasse Tyson pulled out a 1970s ledger to show that Sagan had scheduled a day to meet with a then 17-year-old Neil, a kid from the Bronx who had applied to Cornell.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeGrasse Tyson had his own artifact from that day — Sagan had given him a copy of one of his paperbacks, The Cosmic Collection, and had signed it to him, encouraging the aspiring scientist. DeGrasse Tyson explained how important that day was (even though he decided to go to Harvard instead)…\n\nAt the end of the day, he drove me back to the bus station. The snow was falling harder. He wrote his phone number, his home phone number, on a scrap of paper. And he said, “If the bus can’t get through, call me. Spend the night at my home, with my family.” I already knew I wanted to become a scientist, but that afternoon I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become. He reached out to me and to countless others. Inspiring so many of us to study, teach, and do science. Science is a cooperative enterprise, spanning the generations.\n\nThe moment was moving and powerful, and a terrific way to launch the new series.\n\nAnd it reminded me of my own small, fortunate encounter with Sagan’s kindness, and an artifact that I treasure like deGrasse Tyson treasures his.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the early 1990s, I was a grad student in Santa Cruz, California, studying literature at UCSC, but I had another passion — I loved the night sky.\n\nOn the Friday night closest to the First Quarter Moon each month, a friend and I would set up telescopes on the corner of an empty lot across the street from the city’s landmark rock venue, the Catalyst, and show people the moons of Jupiter or the rings of Saturn or craters on the Moon.\n\nMy partner in crime, Gerard Pardeilhan, worked at the university’s optics lab that supplied Lick Observatory with instruments, and years earlier he was one of the original San Francisco Sidewalk Astronomers — the band of crazies who evangelized the Bay Area with the man famous for bringing large amateur telescopes to the masses, the former Vedantan monk and astronomy popularizer John Dobson, who passed away in January at 98.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDobson had been an inspiration for me as well, and the telescope I hauled out to the city street corner each month was a 10-inch Newtonian my grandfather and I had originally built on the Dobson model several years earlier, and then rebuilt with a more complex equatorial mount.\n\nOver the months on that corner, I had developed a quick patter to help people understand what they were seeing in the eyepiece. With a telescope of that size, they could see the gap separating the rings around Saturn and cloud bands on Jupiter, and it stunned the unfamiliar to realize that those details were hiding in what appeared to be a bright star over their heads.\n\nWe got asked the funniest questions, some of them downright bizarre.

It was the best part, answering those questions, and I took the opportunity to knock down a lot of pseudoscientific nonsense.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI ended up writing an article about the experience in a column for Sky & Telescope magazine in March 1996 — by then, I had moved away from Santa Cruz and had started a new career as a reporter for a newspaper in Phoenix.\n\nWhen the story came out, for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to send a copy to Carl Sagan at his Cornell address, with a note thanking him for being such an inspiration. I had been a huge fan of his books, and of Cosmos, and I guess I thought, in my small way, I had made some slight contribution to the effort he had dedicated his life to, sharing a love for nature and chasing away anti-science ignorance.\n\nTo my utter surprise, I soon received a brief note from Sagan, on his Cornell letterhead.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDear Mr. Ortega:\n\nMany thanks for your excerpt from Sky & Telescope, which I much enjoyed.

The fact that barely anyone can remember the answer was but one reason to tune into FOX last night for the premiere of ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey."" The 13-part series, a follow-up to the 1980 original with Carl Sagan, has been exhaustively covered by the media in anticipation of its return. Last night, we were finally able to see if the wait was worth it. And wow — it really did start with a bang.\n\nWhile I encourage you to watch the entire first episode online here, below are some of the more amazing highlights.\n\nI. President Barack Obama\'s opening introduction\n\nWhen the president of the United States is the one opening up your series premiere, you know what\'s coming is not only something special, but also valuable to the overall education of the country. President Obama did that last night with a perfectly succinct opening, expressing his love of the original ""Cosmos"" and hoping that the latest reboot inspires a new generation of Americans to look up and dream.\n\n“America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dream big and reach farther than others imagine,” he said. Check it out below.\n\nII. Host and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson If you know of Neil deGrasse Tyson, seeing him as the host of ""Cosmos"" last night wasn\'t much of a surprise. For millions more, however, Tyson is an unknown. Last night changed all that, with the 55-year-old displaying his talent for making such heavy topics not only accessible, but fun and awe-inspiring. And while some public speakers often find the jump to television a bit intimidating, Tyson pulled it off with ease — especially when you consider that most of the time, he was on a giant green screen set with very little to work off of. III. That amazing Cosmic Calendar While Carl Sagan premiered a similar ""cosmic calendar"" back in 1980, the one on display last night was really incredible. I\'ve no doubt this part of ""Cosmos"" will be replayed countless times in science classes around the world for decades to come. The calendar, represented by our 12-month calendar, covers 13.8 billion years — with 438 years per second, 1.58 million years per hour, and 37.8 million years per day. If you want to feel really small, consider this: Using this scale, humanity only arrived on the scene less than an hour ago.\n\nIV. Inside Jupiter\'s Great Red Spot Of all the computer simulations last night of our solar system, I thought the view from within Jupiter\'s Great Red Spot was the coolest. We\'ve all seen the massive storm, spanning more than the size of three Earths from above, but to be in it looking out was something else entirely. V. The Carl Sagan shout-out In what was a beautiful tribute, I enjoyed how the producers took a break from the science last night to honor the late, great Sagan. In addition to recognizing his substantial efforts to bringing science to the forefront of American culture, Tyson also shared a personal moment — a meeting between the two back in 1975 that forever changed his life. ""I already knew that I wanted to become a scientist,"" recalls Tyson. ""But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become.""

The educator and author with a gift for conveying the wonder of discovery died in 1996 at age 62.\n\nFilling Sagan’s shoes\n\n“If I didn’t have a following, I think people would say, ‘How is he going to fill Carl Sagan’s shoes? How is he going to pronounce billion?’” said Tyson, referring to the “billions and billions of stars” phrase made famous by Sagan in “Cosmos” (although purists insist Sagan said “upon,” not “and”).\n\nSagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and he’s the presenter for the second. He gamely accepts an analogy, one he’s clearly heard before, to the string of actors who have starred in the “Doctor Who” title role.\n\nEach contributes something different, but “you’re still with the franchise at the end of the day,” he said.\n\nThe new version begins its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. today on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.\n\nTyson, 55, brings to the program his distinguished credentials as director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an author whose works include “Space Chronicles” and “The Pluto Files.”\n\nHe’s the perfect modern media scientist: tall and good-looking, with a deep voice that he uses to charismatic and authoritative effect.\n\nStickler for accuracy\n\nProving he’s a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took “Gravity” to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his “Mysteries of #Gravity” tweets: “Why Bullock’s hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.”\n\nHe is also one of the nation’s most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isn’t in the forefront of his perspective.\n\n“I’ve never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not?” Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.\n\n“I don’t go around saying I’m going to be somebody’s role model. In fact, I think the concept of ‘role model’ is overrated and should be rethought,” he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldn’t have happened.\n\n“Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because you’re only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you,” Tyson said. “And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.”\n\n‘Family Guy’ link\n\nHis involvement in “Cosmos” brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for “Family Guy” laughs in the half-hour preceding “Cosmos” today and suddenly find themselves lost in space.\n\nIt was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind “Family Guy” and other projects including Fox’s “American Dad!” and the movie “Ted,” who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original “Cosmos,” also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.\n\nMacFarlane said in January that he “wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said ‘yes.”’\n\nThey became collaborators on “Cosmos,” with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget “commensurate” with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on “Matrix” and “Spider-Man” movies.\n\nPatrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of “Cosmos.”\n\nAdding to its pedigree: Sagan’s widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.\n\nShe’s also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.\n\n“Yes, it’s the same in that intersection of emotion and solid science and fabulous facts and animation and drama and history,” she said. “But it’s completely new.”\n\n‘Awe and wonder’\n\nFor Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the “awe and wonder” of the universe and the role of science in helping them “become a better shepherd of this world.”\n\n“We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address,” he said.', 'Astronomer Carl Sagan become Mr. Science for a generation after his 1980 series, “Cosmos,” took audiences on a groundbreaking TV journey through the universe.\nHow is he going to pronounce billion?’” said Tyson, referring to the “billions and billions of stars” phrase made famous by Sagan in “Cosmos” (although purists insist Sagan said “upon,” not “and”).\nSagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and he’s the presenter for the second.\n“And no one should ever be limited in their imagination.”‘Family Guy’ linkHis involvement in “Cosmos” brings him to a different and bigger stage.\nMacFarlane, a fan of the original “Cosmos,” also turns out to be a Tyson admirer.']"

(AP) — Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel insists there are still plenty of superstars…\n\nDAVID BRANDT\n\nAP Sports Writer\n\nHOOVER, Ala. (AP) — Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel insists there are still plenty of superstars in the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThe only problem is nobody’s heard of them yet.\n\nOne year after high-profile players such as Alabama’s A.J. McCarron, South Carolina’s Jadeveon Clowney and Texas A&M’s Johnny Manziel brought a rockstar feel to SEC Media Days, the buzz is largely missing this week at the league’s preseason showcase.\n\nPart of the reason is a lack of experienced quarterbacks. McCarron, Manziel, LSU’s Zach Mettenberger, South Carolina’s Connor Shaw and Georgia’s Aaron Murray are gone after impressive careers.\n\nThere are still some accomplished players in the league — especially at running back. Alabama’s T.J. Yeldon and Georgia’s Todd Gurley are among the nation’s best.\n\nDriskel said it won’t be long before others become nationally known as well.\n\n“Some of the guys haven’t put up the numbers or the championships that guys in the past have,” Driskell said. “But there’s always going to be talent in the SEC. It’s just a matter of who makes the plays this year. You get guys who end up being household names who weren’t at the beginning of the year.”\n\nBut the shadow of Manziel, McCarron and Co. still looms, even months after they played their last college game.\n\nWhen Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin took the podium on Tuesday afternoon, two of the first three questions he received were about Johnny Football.\n\nAfter the second one, an amused Sumlin said “Is this the SEC Media Days?”\n\nThe Aggies are one of several teams moving on without their stars. They had three players selected in the first round of the NFL draft — which left gaping holes at quarterback, offensive tackle and receiver — but Sumlin said that’s just part of the challenge of the college game.\n\n“In college football, every two, three years you’re going to have turnover and you have to have a plan for that,” Sumlin said. “Whether it’s quarterback, whether it’s a great defender, whatever it is. To me that’s what’s exciting about college football.”\n\nThat might be true eventually, but right now it means there are a lot of unknowns.\n\nArguably the league’s most recognizable quarterback — Auburn’s Nick Marshall — didn’t come to media days after being cited for possession of a small amount of marijuana. Mississippi’s Bo Wallace is the only returning quarterback in the league who threw for at least 2,000 yards last season.\n\nMississippi State’s Dak Prescott and Driskel are among the most intriguing breakout candidates at quarterback.\n\nPrescott threw for 1,940 yards last season and rushed for 829 more as a sophomore despite missing two games because of injuries. Driskel had a promising season in 2012 before missing much of last year with a leg injury.\n\nPrescott said the SEC’s loss of so many star players won’t hurt the quality of the league.\n\n“Those guys were unknown at some point, too, so that’s just part of the game,” Prescott said. “It leaves the door open for guys to step up and get their name out there.”\n\nThe strength of the league might be at running back, where veterans like Yeldon, Gurley and South Carolina’s Mike Davis return for another season. All three averaged around 100 yards per game during their sophomore seasons and scored at least 10 touchdowns.\n\nBut there’s a good chance some of the league’s best players — along with the league’s best teams — are relative unknowns right now.\n\n“Nobody picked Missouri and Auburn to win the divisions last year,” South Carolina Steve Spurrier said. “That’s why we play the game. We don’t know who’s going to win ’em.”\n\n_____\n\nFollow David Brandt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/davidbrandtAP\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

All of these are examples of the new wave of wearable devices which are about to hit the mass market.\n\nEnter Spritz. After three years in stealth mode, the start-up has taken the wrappers of a new service that promises to reinvent the way we read.\n\nSpritz is already being prototyped in an email app developed for the the new Samsung Gear 2 smart watch, which will be launching soon.\n\nThe technology is based around Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), a concept that dates back to the 1970s and was later was used to improve reading efficiency through programs such as speed reading courses.\n\nWhile there are many advantages to improving the efficiency of reader and comprehension, purists will choke at the prospect of a system that looks like the optical equivalent of binge drinking.\n\nAnd anyone who loves typography, layout and the look and feel of the printed word, should probably stop reading here.\n\nHOW TRADITIONAL READING WORKS\n\nThe company says traditional reading - on a page or screen - requires the reader to move their eyes along a sentence, word to word sequentially seeking what Spritz calls the ""Optimal Recognition Point"" or ORP.\n\nThis movement is called a saccade.\n\nYour eye skips along a sentence, much like the animation in a karaoke video when you vocalise the lyrics by following the bouncing ball.\n\nSprtiz argues that traditional reading following the 80-20 rule: 80 per cent of your eye-brain activity is spent moving your eyeball. And only 20 per cent is spent processing the content you read.\n\nHOW THE SPRITZ WAY OF READING WORKS\n\nThe Spritz method streams words, one-at-a-time into a narrow window the company calls a ""redicle"".\n\nThe redicle is designed to show up to 13 characters at a time, which also happens to be the maximum length word on which the eye can focus.\n\nIt\'s a bit like flinging words at your eyeball. Your eye doesn\'t waste time and energy on saccadic activity and as a result you spend more time absorbing and processing the content.\n\nSpritz says it takes five minutes to train yourself to adapt to the rhythm and once that\'s done, you can read at speeds of up to 500 words a minute. It claims some early users are reaching speeds of 1000 words per minute.\n\nThe average ""traditional"" reading speed is about 220 words per minute.', 'And anyone who loves typography, layout and the look and feel of the printed word, should probably stop reading here.\nHOW TRADITIONAL READING WORKSThe company says traditional reading - on a page or screen - requires the reader to move their eyes along a sentence, word to word sequentially seeking what Spritz calls the ""Optimal Recognition Point"" or ORP.\nSprtiz argues that traditional reading following the 80-20 rule: 80 per cent of your eye-brain activity is spent moving your eyeball.\nHOW THE SPRITZ WAY OF READING WORKSThe Spritz method streams words, one-at-a-time into a narrow window the company calls a ""redicle"".\nThe average ""traditional"" reading speed is about 220 words per minute.']"

It even sort of has a celebrity (investor) endorsement.\n\nAn app that will help you read 1,000 words per minute?? http://t.co/OIU2fgUOVa pic.twitter.com/8QoSPEt9yE — ashton kutcher (@aplusk) March 10, 2014\n\nSpritz works by showing one word on a small screen at a time, allowing you to select language and speed (the demo gives options from 250 words per minute to 600 wpm, at 50 wpm intervals) before scrolling through text. You can up the wpm rate as you learn how to Spritz, a process that takes about five minutes, per the developers. The letters in each word are in black font, except for one key letter which is in red.\n\nThe app will come as a preinstalled email app on Samsung devices in April, but creators say they\'ve been working in ""stealth mode,"" figuring out how to make mobile users more efficient readers. They found that we\'re slowed down by unnecessary eye movements. We can comprehend as well just by focusing our sight onto a single, left-of-center letter in each word. Spritz will help us do just that, as they explain:\n\nFor each word, the eye seeks a certain point within the word, which we call the “Optimal Recognition Point” or ORP. After your eyes find the ORP, your brain starts to process the meaning of the word that you’re viewing. With each new word, your eyes move, called a “saccade”, and then your eyes seek out the ORP for that word. Once the ORP is found, processing the word for meaning and context occurs and your eyes move to the next word.\n\nBasically, they say, we don\'t need to read a word from left to right to understand its meaning. And when we do, we waste time;\n\nWhen reading, only around 20% of your time is spent processing content. The remaining 80% is spent physically moving your eyes from word to word and scanning for the next ORP.\n\nThe app\'s co-founder and CEO Frank Waldman says Spritz is probably best used for shorter messages:\n\nAs smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device – the options are almost limitless. Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.\n\nBut that doesn\'t mean the app isn\'t ""working with some pretty big players in [the] field"" of ebooks, so that ""Atlas Shrugged in a day?"" can get the ""You betcha!"" answer promised in the company\'s FAQ section. Spritz knock-off OpenSpritz is already offering the option of Spritzing everything on the Internet, in the form of a ""free speed reading bookmarklet.""

In the 1950s, a schoolteacher named Evelyn Nielsen Wood discovered that she could read at a much faster pace than the normal 250-300 words per minute by sweeping a finger along the page as she read, reading entire groups of words at a time, and by avoiding sub-vocalization, or saying each word mentally.\n\nThese techniques helped Wood reach 2,700 read words per minute, she claimed, and it was these principles she espoused in Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics, her speed-reading business. The comedian Steve Allen hawked the program in TV commercials, and over the years multiple iterations of White House staffers signed up. A generation of lawyers and bibliophiles flocked to speed-reading classes that sprang up in community colleges and on mail-order services.\n\nBy the 90s, though, the speed-reading craze slumped again.

1617,http://phys.org/news/2014-03-apps-great-snippets-sonnets.html,technology,"['Credit: radarxlove, CC BY-NC\n\nA new app is about to come on the market with promises to dramatically increase the speed at which you read. Spritz is a text streaming technology that allows you to read a sentence, one word at a time. Each word is shown for only a brief flash, in the same place on a screen, before the next appears.\n\nUp to 1,000 words can be shown every minute, which would allow you to race through an entire novel in just 90 minutes. This could revolutionise the way we read, particularly on small-screen devices, such as smartphones and smartwatches.\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen we read, our eyes normally make a series of brief pauses to extract information before moving on. These are referred to as eye movement fixations and saccades. It is only during fixations that the eye processes what is before it.\n\nSpritz allows you to read faster by presenting words in the same place on the screen. This means that the eye can remain in the same spot and does not have to waste time making lengthy saccades to get to the next word.\n\nWhen we read we have to recognise words. Spritz supports this by focusing our attention on the most informative part of a word so that we recognise it quickly – the word\'s optimal recognition position. This is done by highlighting the letter that should be fixated in a different colour to the rest. Doing this grabs our attention and makes us fixate at that point.\n\nSpritz also takes into account some of the factors that explain why we don\'t fixate on each word for the same length of time. Rather than reading each letter in a word, our visual system is able to process common words as whole units, using the context of the text and the overall shape of the word as clues to aid recognition. This means that words that are very similar to each other in shape, like ""bed"" and ""fed"", will require more time to process than words that are more distinct, like ""decide"". Spritz therefore slows down when displaying very short words and speeds up for words that are four to seven letters long.\n\nReading or skimming?\n\nReading is more than just moving your eyes across a page. It is a cognitive activity. Our brain is busy processing the meaning of the words that have been read. For demanding content or tasks, this cognitive processing can take time. We naturally compensate for this by lingering on some words for longer than others to give our brains time to process the meaning of what we are reading.\n\nThe spritz website hints that some in-house testing has been done and claims people are able to perform well when tested for their comprehension and recall of a text that they have just ""spritzed"".\n\nBut there\'s a potential problem with treating all words equally and pushing everything through a high-speed funnel. Experiments using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), participants have demonstrated attentional blink. They were more likely to miss something important because their attention is occupied by something else that they had just experienced. For example, if you\'ve just read an emotionally charged word such as ""coffin"" or ""murder"", you\'re more likely to miss something important if it occurs very soon afterwards.\n\nThe current system doesn\'t appear to offer any deeper adaption to the content that is being presented. It doesn\'t slow down if a main character dies suddenly, or a complex idea is presented in a sentence. This is not so surprising as this would be an extremely difficult technological problem to solve.\n\nSpritz does slow down at the end of sentences to provide the reader with a little extra time to process the sentence that has just been read. But this might not be sufficient. In fact, readers frequently re-read sections of text when it did not make complete sense on the first pass –- something that is not possible with this system.\n\nSpritz users might find themselves missing important information that they would have caught with regular reading as a result.\n\nSo while this technology could open up fantastic opportunities for reading small snippets of text, such as a tweet, on a very small screen, there\'s probably some way to go in the development of the technology before you\'d want to read War and Peace on a smart watch.\n\nExplore further E-readers more effective than paper for dyslexic readers\n\nThis story is published courtesy of The Conversation (under Creative Commons-Attribution/No derivatives).\n\n', 'Credit: radarxlove, CC BY-NCA new app is about to come on the market with promises to dramatically increase the speed at which you read.\nSpritz is a text streaming technology that allows you to read a sentence, one word at a time.\nEach word is shown for only a brief flash, in the same place on a screen, before the next appears.\nHow it worksWhen we read, our eyes normally make a series of brief pauses to extract information before moving on.\nSpritz users might find themselves missing important information that they would have caught with regular reading as a result.']"

Sometimes, reading this many words can take a long time, which cuts into our valuable time. However, guess what? There\'s a fix for that problem, and it\'s called Spritz.\n\nSpritz is a text streaming technology that allows readers to run through texts faster. It streams text on the user\'s screen one word at a time, which allows your brain to comprehend it faster, says the company behind the technology.\n\n""We\'re reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,"" said co-Founder and CEO Frank Waldman. ""As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device - the options are almost limitless. Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.""\n\nThe company claims Spritz can allow an eBook reader to run through a novel in just 90 minutes. That sounds great, but we\'re not sure if any eBook reader would be interested in speed reading a book, wouldn\'t that dim the experience and the enjoyment of the book a great deal? We believe this to be true.\n\nHow does the tech work?\n\nSpritz streams one word at a time as noted above. It highlights the ""Optimal Recognition Point"" or ORP of every word in the red, and align certain letters to a specific central point. Apparently, this technique can allow readers to read up to 1,000 words per minute. Then again, it all depends on the user\'s comfort level, so it should be very possible for the speed to be toned down a little bit.\n\nIt shouldn\'t take too long for us to see Spritz in action on smart devices.

Infinite Jest during an afternoon on the hammock. Crime and Punishment over a lunch break or two. With the technologically facilitated speed-reading offered by a new app, called Spritz, soon to be released for the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Gear 2 Watch, it just might be possible.\n\nThe app works by maximizing the efficiency of the movements of the human eye, called saccades, that are required to read text in a traditional format. As explained on Spritz’s website, while reading, the eye searches for the middle of a word before the word can be comprehended. This particular area, located slightly to the left of the mid-point of the word, is called the “Optimal Recognition Point” (ORP). By lining up the words of a text based on their ORP and flashing them rapidly in succession around the same middle point, highlighted in red, the reader never has to expend time by moving his eye, and is able to process what he is reading much more quickly.\n\nSpritz claims that, while reading traditionally, the brain spends only about 20% of the time processing and comprehending the meaning of the words, while the other 80% is dedicated merely to acquisition. Using this method, Spritz users can achieve speeds of a thousand words-per-minute with relative ease, compared to the average natural speed of between 200-400 WPM.\n\nThe demonstrations provided on their website show just how easy it is to pick up. With no preparation or learning curve at all, I was almost immediately blazing away at 600wpm, with full retention, and wishing I could test myself at faster speeds (there is currently no faster demonstration available).\n\nCompare Spritz’s method to other speed-reading techniques—such as sub-vocalization—in which the reader hums or speaks to himself in order to train the brain not to internally recite the word before understanding it. This method, and others like it, require a great deal of practice and focus, whereas Spritz seems to have developed a method that requires almost no effort at all.\n\nBut Spritz is more than just a speed-reading app; since the presentation only requires the space to display one word at a time, it’s prefect for reading on small screens, such as those used in the wearable devices (“watch phones”) that are currently on the cusp of popularity. The website explains: “From the fonts that we use to the algorithms that process content, Spritz is designed from the ground up to empower effective reading on a small display area.”\n\nAssisted-reading technology such as this will certainly be a great new topic of debate between the camps that love to declare themselves on any issue even remotely literary; just see how staunchly “paper-book people” (and I’m one of them) hold out against the tide of convenient e-readers, clinging to our silly notions of aesthetics.\n\nThis, however, seems like a slightly different case. Think of your most cherished reading experiences over the course of your life: the summer in you spent lugging around Stephen King’s The Stand, the vacation that you devoured a book of Lorrie Moore short stories. Isn’t the fact that the book was in your life for a significant period of time part of why it felt so special? Would you want to condense all of that into a few hours?\n\nSurely, if reading solely to acquire information or subjects to discuss at cocktail parties, new apps such as these will be a great convenience. But for those of us who cleave to backwards ideas about how certain books, fiction especially, deserve a slower air of contemplation, it might take some more convincing.', 'What if you could read a thousand-page book in a matter of hours?\nThe app works by maximizing the efficiency of the movements of the human eye, called saccades, that are required to read text in a traditional format.\nAs explained on Spritz’s website, while reading, the eye searches for the middle of a word before the word can be comprehended.\nThis particular area, located slightly to the left of the mid-point of the word, is called the “Optimal Recognition Point” (ORP).\nUsing this method, Spritz users can achieve speeds of a thousand words-per-minute with relative ease, compared to the average natural speed of between 200-400 WPM.']"

What this means in layman\'s terms is that the Spritz app puts a lot of emphasis on the positioning of each word, with the recommended \'focus letter\' highlighted to give the reader the best chance of processing and understanding each word.\n\nThe science doesn\'t stop there either, Waldman also claims that Spritz has an incredible algorithm built into the app that decides how long each word should stay displayed on screen for too.\n\nWhen can I get Spritz on my iPhone/Android device?\n\nThere is no official release date for the Spritz app on other devices as yet, but considering the amount of attention that the app has already received even though it hasn\'t launched yet, it would be madness for the German tech company not to strike/blitzkrieg while the iron is hot.\n\nHow much will Spritz cost?\n\nSpritz\'s CEO Frank Waldman said that the company wanted to follow the Whatsapp business model, which means it will offer the speedy reading app to users for free for a limited time to build a following and get users used to the software, and then start charging a small fee for the app further down the line.\n\nWill I process everything I read?\n\nAccording to the Spritz website, then ""of course"".

Spritz is a new app developed by an MIT entrepreneur and two scientists at the Technical University of Munich. It has the goal of reinventing reading on mobile and wearable devices by streaming individual words using an “Optimal Recognition Point” (ORP) in a special display called the “Redicle.”\n\nThe method claims to make communication faster and more effective by doing away with the inefficient eye movements associated with traditional reading.\n\nThe first implementation of Spritz will be an email application for the Samsung Gear 2 smartwatch and Galaxy S5 smartphone. Spritz’s patent-pending technology will enable Samsung device users to read emails comfortably and conveniently- one streaming word at a time.\n\nDesigned for small screens, Spritz ensures there will be no more scrolling, swiping, squinting and pinching to read on your devices. Instead, you will see streaming individual words, one by one, at the your desired speed.\n\nDeveloped and tested for over three years with roots in science and data, Spritz is supposed to let the brain focus on each word, thereby promoting faster reading speeds and higher information retention rates.\n\n“We’re reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,” said CEO Frank Waldman. “As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently. Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device – the options are almost limitless. Reading has never been easier, more efficient or more effective.”\n\nWhats a Redicle?\n\nSince our eye can only focus on about 13 characters at a time, the app uses 13 characters’ worth of display space.\n\nBy streaming individual words inside of a special display Spritz calls the “Redicle,” the app helps the eyes position themselves precisely at the recognition point for each word. The word Redicle presumably stems from the inclusion of one red letter in each word, which is used to anchor the eye.\n\nI never realized this, but the most time-consuming part of reading is actually the eye movement from word to word. Only around 20% of your time is spent processing content. Spritz takes eye movement out of the act of reading, so much more can be read in the same amount of time.\n\nSo far, so good. But can our brains keep up with a constant input of text?\n\n“When we started testing, we already knew that we were on to something but the comprehension tests surprised even us,” said Dr. Maik Maurer, Co-Founder and CTO of Spritz. “Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension. We’re now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user’s traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers.”\n\nCurrently, Spritz supports English, Spanish, French, German, Russian and Korean. More languages are on the way. Multiple reading speeds range from 100 to 1000 words per minute.\n\nSome of the other applications currently being worked on by the company include SMS Messages/Texts/Messaging Clients, Embedded Media, Closed Captioning, E-Readers, Head Mounted Displays (Google Glass, anyone) and Social Media.\n\nFor more information , visit www.spritzinc.com', 'Spritz’s patent-pending technology will enable Samsung device users to read emails comfortably and conveniently- one streaming word at a time.\nDesigned for small screens, Spritz ensures there will be no more scrolling, swiping, squinting and pinching to read on your devices.\n“We’re reinventing the way people read by eliminating the obstacles associated with traditional reading on mobile devices,” said CEO Frank Waldman.\n“As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently.\nSpritz takes eye movement out of the act of reading, so much more can be read in the same amount of time.']"

If yes, well you must try this app. Spritz is a latest app developed by Frank Waldman, Maik Maurer and Jamie Locke - that aims at changing the way people read and make communications faster, easier and effective. The company is a Boston based startup which focuses on text streaming technology and its integration into modern communication.Founders of Spritz believe that the time is consumed for normal reading because of eye movements from word to word and from one sentence to another. Also the way we read consumes a lot of physical space. The Spritz solves both of these problems. The app makes user read only one word at a time and hence user need not to move eyes word-to-word. With Spritz, user doesn’t see the entire page or the sentence, but just 13 characters of the text. The fast streaming of the words make reading easier and comfortable. Reading becomes unpleasant when the screen size is smaller. Spritz also solves this problem as only a word is to be read inside the display-window called “redicle”. The display time of a word is decided by the use of proprietary algorithms.According to Spritz, the other techniques to improve reading speed such as skimming (reading important words, rather than all words), avoiding sub-vocalization (talking to yourself while reading), reading entire page just by taking a mental snapshot etc takes time to develop reading.

Well, a new app called Spritz just might help with that. According to the company, Spritz will help people read 250 to 1,000 words-per-minute, which equates to reading an entire Harry Potter novel at just over an hour. The Boston-based company states, ""Reading is inherently time consuming because your eyes have to move from word to word and line to line. Traditional reading also consumes huge amounts of physical space on a page or screen, which limits reading effectiveness on small displays. Scrolling, pinching, and resizing a reading area doesn\'t fix the problem and only frustrates people. Now, with compact text streaming from Spritz, content can be streamed one word at a time, without forcing your eyes to spend time moving around the page. Spritz makes streaming your content easy and more comfortable, especially on small displays. Our ""Redicle"" technology enhances readability even more by using horizontal lines and hash marks to direct your eyes to the red letter in each word, so you can focus on the content that interests you.""\n\nSpritz Inc. claims its tech can be integrated into photos, maps and websites, too. And while we know how traditional ways of reading can be time consuming, just how does the Spritz make us read faster? ""The time consuming part of reading lies mainly in the actual eye movements from word to word and sentence to sentence. In addition, traditional reading simply takes up a lot of physical space. Spritz solves both of these problems. First, your eyes do not have to move from word to word or around the page that you\'re reading. In fact, there\'s no longer a page - with Spritz you only need 13 total characters to show all of your content. Fast streaming of text is easier and more comfortable for the reader, especially when reading areas become smaller,"" the company claims.\n\nFor reference, a .gif showing what 500 words-per-minute looks like can be seen below, with 1,000 words-per-minute speeds doubling that of what\'s shown.\n\nWhile using the app might make people read faster, that doesn\'t necessarily mean they\'ll understand all the words flashing on screen. But according to a statement from Dr. Maik Mauer, co-founder and CTO of Spritz, ""spritzing"" does increase a person\'s comprehension. ""Happily, our tests confirmed that spritzing increases comprehension. We\'re now starting to research whether time spent spritzing will also increase a user\'s traditional reading speed and comprehension, an effect reported to us by many of our testers,"" Mauer notes.\n\nCurrently, the speed-reading app is set to launch on the upcoming Samsung S5 smartphone and Gear 2 smartwatch; but the company states they are working with other mobile makers, wearable manufacturers and even e-book companies to make the technology more accessible in the future. You can test the app on its official site to see if it works just as the company intended, or you can also check out the open-source implementation or even the Chrome extension that\'s available.\n\nPersonally, I\'m all for making people read faster.

When I’m on the couch reading a book, my husband likes to record the seconds between page-turns. He finds my ability fascinating, and my friends often complain about my Goodreads updates jamming their Facebook feeds.\n\nSo what do I think of the new speed-reading technology Spritz? First, let me try to make sense of the “science” behind speed-reading.\n\nUsually, we read books word for word, line for line. I just recently learned that for each word, the eye seeks a certain point called the “Optimal Recognition Point.” Once you find this point, you recognize the word and realize its meaning. That is reading: word by word, meaning by meaning, and voilà, story line!\n\nSo here’s the deal with Spritz: Spritz takes a book, takes a word from that book and adds a single red letter to each word. The red letter is the ORP. Then, Spritz presents all of the ORPs at the same space on the screen. In this way, our eyes don’t move at all as we see the words. In theory, we process the information instantaneously rather than spend time decoding each word.\n\nOf course, I experimented. On the Spritz website, you can try the program from 250 words per minute up to 600. (I get dizzy at about 550.) The idea works. I had no trouble following the rapidly flashing words with their oh-so-important ORPs. Yet, here is the concern: When speed-reading, how much do you, the reader, really retain?\n\nPart of my job is reviewing books, and before I decide to do a write-up, I skim. I skim for language quality, quippy dialogue and beautiful descriptions — but in skimming, do I really “get” the message? No, of course not. To fully immerse myself in a book, I need to sit down, slow down and focus. The question is: does Spritz steal that experience from me?\n\nWhy are we in such a rush to finish books anyway? I guess I understand the use of Spritz for things like boring office notices or the latest state legislature. But a big part of reading is escapism. We read books to visit different places and meet people we may never have met before. Why rush it?\n\nYes, I read fast — really fast — but not 600 words per minute! And I don’t read to show off; I read because I love to read. I’m worried that Spritz is making reading into a contest. (“Guess how many words I got through today!”)\n\nI think Spritz has its place in the business world, but I fear it may distort our more literary aspirations. Don’t believe me? I dare you to read Dickens at hyper-speed.\n\nWeigh in Does speed-reading detract from the reading experience, or are you ready to be a literary super-human?\n\nMore about reading\n\nResistant readers and the parents who love them\n\nE-reader accessories we’re obsessed with\n\nWhat the Dickens? Classic literary baby names', 'For the past three years, Spritz has been working on speed-reading technology, and now, the program is ready to launch.\nUsually, we read books word for word, line for line.\nThat is reading: word by word, meaning by meaning, and voilà, story line!\nSo here’s the deal with Spritz: Spritz takes a book, takes a word from that book and adds a single red letter to each word.\nWe read books to visit different places and meet people we may never have met before.']"
1634,http://www.pcworld.com/article/2105960/spritz-text-streaming-app-increases-reading-speed.html,technology,"[""Between email, Web pages, books and other texts, we each read thousands of words a day. A company called Spritz has spent the last few years in stealth mode, developing a technology to help us read even more, in less time.\n\nSpritz—which is both the name of the technology and the verb for using it—streams text on your screen one word at a time, which, the company claims, allows your brain to comprehend it much more quickly and easily. Their trademarked tagline is “Reading Reimagined,” and after playing with the technology a bit I have to agree.\n\nSpritz technology enables you to read and comprehend information much faster than normal.\n\nSpritz relies on something the company has dubbed the Optimal Recognition Point (ORP). Spritz claims your brain processes the information it's taking in once your eyes reach the ORP of a given word, and it’s trained to process the data as a complete, coherent thought once it reaches punctuation.\n\nAccording to Spritz, 80 percent of the time you spend reading is devoted to physically moving your eyes from one word to the next in search of the ORP, while only 20 percent is spent actually processing the information. To speed things up, Spritz reformats the text and aligns it based on the ORP so there is essentially no physical eye movement, and almost all of your time is spent taking in data.\n\nThe Spritz Web page explains what makes Spritz different from other speed reading systems: “There are lots of other reading techniques out there such as skimming (not reading every word), avoiding sub-vocalization (talking to yourself while reading) and enlarging the peripheral span (reading an entire page at a time by mental “snapshot”) that attempt to increase reading speeds. While these methods can be effective, achieving significant improvement requires intensive, continuous training and dedication. By contrast, spritzing can be learned in less than 5 minutes and, if you don’t spritz for a month, no practice is needed to return quickly to your previous speed or skill-level.”\n\nI am a more voracious reader than most—but not voracious enough to keep up with the pace at which I buy new books. I have tried different traditional speed reading programs over the years with limited success. Spritz seems to work for me.\n\nI wouldn’t necessarily want to read fiction using Spritz. When I read a Dan Brown novel, or The Hunger Games, I want to take in the nuance of the dialogue. I want to give my brain time to imagine the scene being described, and I want to use sub-vocalization to “hear” the different character voices in my head.\n\nFor other texts, however, Spritz would be helpful. Imagine how much more productive you'd be if you could get through all your email in a fifth of the time it normally takes you. I would love to see Amazon partner with Spritz—or just buy it outright—and incorporate the technology as an option when reading a Kindle book.\n\nI can’t wait to take advantage of Spritz, but sadly I’ll have to. Spritz will be pre-installed on the new Samsung Galaxy S5 and the Galaxy Gear 2 smartwatch, but as of right now it’s not available any other way. Hopefully it will soon be incorporated into iOS, or at least into iOS apps.\n\nIf you want to test out Spritz for yourself, visit the Spritz website. At the upper right there is a button labeled “click to spritz,” which brings up a box displaying text using Spritz technology. There is a dropdown box at the bottom right that allows you to select how fast, in words per minute, the text zooms by.\n\nTry it out. I think you’ll be amazed at how much more effectively and efficiently you can read."", 'Spritz technology enables you to read and comprehend information much faster than normal.\nThe Spritz Web page explains what makes Spritz different from other speed reading systems: “There are lots of other reading techniques out there such as skimming (not reading every word), avoiding sub-vocalization (talking to yourself while reading) and enlarging the peripheral span (reading an entire page at a time by mental “snapshot”) that attempt to increase reading speeds.\nI have tried different traditional speed reading programs over the years with limited success.\nI wouldn’t necessarily want to read fiction using Spritz.\nAt the upper right there is a button labeled “click to spritz,” which brings up a box displaying text using Spritz technology.']"

The Boston-based startup found celebrity this week in a series of news stories about its new speed-reading app. In an effort to make communication ""faster, easier, and more effective,"" Spritz created a tool that shows readers words one by one. It relies on a concept called ""rapid serial visual presentation"" and in essence trains your eyes to read faster - up to 500 words per minute or more, which is double the average reading speed. At that rate you could read a novel in about two hours.\n\nSpritz just launched and will only be available for Samsung devices to start, but the company hopes to expand its reach and application, from email to social media and ebooks.

It works by using a red letter to pinpoint the eye’s “Optimal Recognition Point,” or the point where the eye can most easily recognize a word. From here, you can stream (and comprehend) words much faster than you’d imagine.\n\n“As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently,” said Frank Waldman, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Spritz. “Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device—the options are almost limitless.”\n\nGive the technology a try at Spritz’s website. You can practice at up to 600 words per minute on the Spritz site (a press release says the system will support up to 1,000 w.p.m.). While we’re not sure what it would be like to actually read a novel at these speeds, the possibility of eventually completing a work like Infinite Jest in almost one work day is pretty exciting.', 'But whether you buy an ebook or read an article on the web, the format of reading itself is rooted in centuries-old, left-to-right, boring ol’ text.\nAs methods for consuming music, television and games have shifted drastically, the way we read might also head down a new path.\nSpritz streams words individually rather than forcing your eyes to read horizontal rows of text.\n“As smart devices continue to change shape and become increasingly smaller, Spritz enables users to read comfortably and conveniently,” said Frank Waldman, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Spritz.\n“Our technology can be used to read emails, text messages, social media streams, maps or web content and can be integrated onto any mobile device—the options are almost limitless.”Give the technology a try at Spritz’s website.']"

He’s convincing me that the company’s attempt at a speed reading tool will fundamentally alter the way our eyeballs consume sentences. “The faster it goes, the more focused you are.”\n\nRather than bouncing along a line of text, the Spritz reader rapidly blinks each word in a fixed location. The company claims 80 percent of your reading time is “wasted” with saccades — the movement of the eye to a new point, like from word to word on a line of text — and only 20 percent is actually spent processing the word. By allowing the eye to focus in one spot, the process streamlines and we consume more.\n\nSpritz came out of stealth mode at last week’s Mobile World Congress after three years of secrecy. Only time will tell if the startup succeeds, but in the meantime its tweak on reading brings up interesting questions about the way we consume content.\n\nThe normal range for reading is 200-250 words per minute. I tried Spritz for a bit and cranked the speed to 600 words per minute and surprisingly, it wasn’t hard to keep up (though that felt like about the max). It doesn’t feel like reading words, it’s like being injected with them. The experience is closer to the sci-fi, Singularity idea that our nerve endings are nothing but inputs.\n\nHere, try this story:\n\nRapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), the name for the principle behind a lot of speed reading tools, has been around for decades and there’s a cottage industry of speed reading apps and software. QuickReader has a well-review iOS app. Matt Bischoff had used speed reading techniques to study for exams in college but later wrote the iOS Velocity app, which speed sentences them along a line (so you can’t slow down). Since Spritz’s news he says Velocity has seen a boost in downloads because Spritz itself doesn’t offer an app (right now it’s trying to license the tech).\n\n“I’m excited more [companies] are getting into this field,” Bischoff says. “I don’t think a lot of people know about these techniques.”\n\nWhen using Spritz, one letter in each word appears in red. That letter is what the company calls the “optimal recognition point” of the word — the place your eye lands to interpret the rest of the word. We don’t take in each letter as we read. We absorb the whole thing. That’s why you can read msispeled wrods lkie tehse, a playful concept known as “typoglycemia.” (It’s unclear why a lack of sugar should factor into that portmanteau.) So with the eye trained on the most important region of the word, the next step is removing the gaps.\n\nNow, this takes the romanticism out of a lot of reading. When reading a novel, those saccades are the micro-moments when readers can imagine characters, landscapes or questions of the plot. With Spritz, it’s like holding on for life as a firehose of information unleashes into your eyeballs.\n\nAnd Waldman doesn’t have any illusions otherwise. “This isn’t for reading literature,” he says. “It’s for information.”\n\nFor a lot of reading — news, work e-mails, etc — the message is a basic transfer of relatively simple facts. E-mail and industry news are an important part of many professions, but their time-consuming consumption can eat into more productive parts of the day. In those cases, I’d vouch for Spritz. (Though I do not vouch for the company’s attempt to make “spritz” a new verb — no, you weren’t “spritzing” an article, you were reading it.)\n\nSpritz wants to harness the recent push for small screened devices, like smartwatches. Gadget makers like Pebble and Samsung have their versions and other heavyweights like Apple are rumored to be working on their own. An entire news story can’t fit on that screen — but a Spritz firehose would be about right.\n\nThe type of consumption Spritz offers might not be good thing for news organizations. If their text can be distilled into that firehose, they might lose the ability to present advertisements, much as it already happens with read-later apps like Evernote or Readability. An app that scraped news pages and presented the information in Spritz firehose fashion would not be hard to build.\n\nAnd that brings up a tough question for Spritz: if this reading methodology caught on, couldn’t Samsung, Apple and other device makers just make such firehose interface themselves? To prevent this, Waldman says they won’t charge OEMs to license Spritz and that the company also has stocked up on patents. But already there are opensource versions of such a reader.\n\nNo matter the speed, information always has a way of getting free.\n\nFollow @calebgarling', 'He’s convincing me that the company’s attempt at a speed reading tool will fundamentally alter the way our eyeballs consume sentences.\nIt doesn’t feel like reading words, it’s like being injected with them.\nHere, try this story:Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP), the name for the principle behind a lot of speed reading tools, has been around for decades and there’s a cottage industry of speed reading apps and software.\nAn entire news story can’t fit on that screen — but a Spritz firehose would be about right.\nAn app that scraped news pages and presented the information in Spritz firehose fashion would not be hard to build.']"

1648,http://www.newstatesman.com/cultural-capital/2014/03/smartphone-app-claims-make-reading-1000-words-minute-doddle,technology,"[""A new app called Spritz that claims to offer a way to speed-read entire novels at a massively faster pace than normal, but without the kind of loss in comprehension that usually comes from skimming. It works by laying text out word-by-word, aligned in such a way that you don’t have to move your eyes when you read.\n\nHere's what happens at 250 words per minute, which is at the top end of average for most people when it comes to reading speed:\n\nAnd here's 500wpm:\n\nClearly, it works. According to its creators, Spritz has been in development for almost three years, and it based on “research” that states 80 per cent of the time a person spends reading is taken up by the eyes moving and focusing on each new word. Cut that out, and you attain a huge boost in reading speed.\n\nThe red letter in each word reflects what Spritz calls the optimal recognition point (ORP) – that's the bit of the word where the eye needs to focus to be able to grasp the overall shape and meaning of the word around it:\n\nSpritzing presents reading content with the ORP located at the specific place where you’re already looking, allowing you to read without having to move your eyes. With this approach, reading becomes more efficient because Spritzing increases the time your brain spends processing content without having to waste time searching for the next word’s ORP. Spritzing also enhances reading on small screens. Because the human eye can focus on about 13 characters at a time, Spritzing requires only 13 characters’ worth of space inside our redicle. No other reading method is designed to help you read all of your content when you’re away from a large screen.”\n\nThe key selling point for Spritz is actually not in speed, but in comprehension. Speed reading techniques, historically, were developed without the use of technology – they're for reading paper books, after all – and relied upon learning how to take in whole sentences, then whole paragraphs, and then, for the very best, whole pages. It's a case of pattern recognition, and can lead to incredibly rapid reading paces even if there is also, inevitably, a loss of comprehension. Studies have found that scoring greater then 50 per cent on a speed reading comprehension test is exceptional, not the norm.\n\nSpritz, instead, relies on some visual stimuli research from the 1970s, on what's known as rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). It was developed as part of a study into how well participants could identify targets among a group of objects, flashed quickly on a screen; over time, further research revealed that RSVP made a good basis for a speed reading technique, with as much as a 33 per cent improvement in reading speed without any effect on comprehension. Spritz's novelty is the ORP, and aligning all words along that line to make all eye movement redundant. That's how they can claim that people can, unlike with those other speed reading techniques, reach as fast as 1000wpm with barely any training.\n\nSo let’s say you’re really into what Spritz is selling, and want to start getting through War & Peace in less time than it takes to watch a full season of Breaking Bad. The practical limitations of reading text one word at a time should be obvious: shorter words are going to be easier to understand than longer ones, and Tolstoy’s epic is going to be more taxing to grasp word-by-word than, say, Harry Potter. Anything with weird formatting, footnotes or sentences that can last longer than the length of a page – here's looking at you, Infinite Jest – are going to be made incomprehensible with Spritz. There's a button to go back to the start of either the paragraph or sentence that the reader is on, but for texts that require multiple passes to fully grasp (like, say, a scientific study) Spritz is going to be a hindrance, not a help.\n\nThat said, most people don't read those kinds of texts. Authors might be tempted to bemoan a change to the way that readers take in text, but for many people the ability to crunch down an email from a colleague, or their Twitter feed, in bursts like this will actually be pretty useful. The main usage that Spritz is touting is on devices, like smartwatches, that will be showing text designed for larger screens. Grokking a news story on a two-inch screen does seem like an obvious application for a speed reader app like Spritz, so it's going to be interesting to see if developers try to integrate it into their devices (or, less likely, web developers go to the effort of making their pages “Spritz-ready” or somesuch similar standard)."", ""Cut that out, and you attain a huge boost in reading speed.\nWith this approach, reading becomes more efficient because Spritzing increases the time your brain spends processing content without having to waste time searching for the next word’s ORP.\nSpeed reading techniques, historically, were developed without the use of technology – they're for reading paper books, after all – and relied upon learning how to take in whole sentences, then whole paragraphs, and then, for the very best, whole pages.\nStudies have found that scoring greater then 50 per cent on a speed reading comprehension test is exceptional, not the norm.\nThat's how they can claim that people can, unlike with those other speed reading techniques, reach as fast as 1000wpm with barely any training.""]"

Or latest YA favorite Divergent in just 105 minutes. Or a huge classic novel — like Les Miserables, which has roughly 560,000 words of text — in nine hours.\n\nYou can speed read through these books — as well as emails, news articles and blogs — thanks to tech company Spritz, which is promising to change reading forever by altering the way readers view and process text. No more poring over lengthy sentences or losing your place on a page — instead, Spritz is offering readers the chance to process text at speeds as high as 1,000 words per minute.\n\nSpritz will be releasing its technology on the yet-to-be-released Samsung Galaxy S5 and Samsung Gear 2 watch, the company recently announced at the Mobil World Congress in Barcelona. And with the phone or watch, readers will be able to process text one word at a time at various scrolling speeds. Whether one opts for 250 or 1,000 words per minute, Spritz is counting on making the brain change the way it expects and analyzes texts.\n\nIt turns out that Spritz is basing its technology on a well-established speed reading method called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Based on the same premise that trained speed readers use, the special display technology saves readers the time of reading a page from left to right by placing text at one spot at a specified speed. Add to that some fancy jargon called “Optimal Recognition Point” — ORP for short — which, according to Spritz’s blog, refers to highlighting certain text red so that your eye never needs to move from a central viewing point, and you’ve got the recipe for tackling the Bible in 13 hours flat.\n\nBut what happens when the eye processes words — instead of relying on the brain to analyze context? The Boston-based start up isn’t the first to develop a speed reading app — vapps like Velocity and Speed Reading Trainer for Android can be downloaded for just a few bucks — but EW has confirmed they are pitchings its technology to global tech giants like Google, Yahoo and Apple.\n\nSo will Spritz prove an effective tool at tackling the hundreds of emails that seem to flood the average corporate employee daily? Or will authors find themselves competing for audiences for whom the story, instead of its delivery and prose, matters most? And what happens when the core of what makes great books great — the composed phrases that make us laugh, cry, ache and crave more — gets reduced to mere words? We know that technology in the form of e-readers has given a new generation a platform by which to consume books, but will the love and pleasure of reading be changed forever if pleasure can be reduced down to WPM? Are we saying “hello” to a new age of Cliff Notes — or beginning the process or saying “goodbye” to a form of communication that’s been established for centuries?', 'You can speed read through these books — as well as emails, news articles and blogs — thanks to tech company Spritz, which is promising to change reading forever by altering the way readers view and process text.\nIt turns out that Spritz is basing its technology on a well-established speed reading method called Rapid Serial Visual Presentation.\nBased on the same premise that trained speed readers use, the special display technology saves readers the time of reading a page from left to right by placing text at one spot at a specified speed.\nBut what happens when the eye processes words — instead of relying on the brain to analyze context?\nThe Boston-based start up isn’t the first to develop a speed reading app — vapps like Velocity and Speed Reading Trainer for Android can be downloaded for just a few bucks — but EW has confirmed they are pitchings its technology to global tech giants like Google, Yahoo and Apple.']"

1665,"http://www.tomshardware.com/news/ios-7.1-new-features-iphone-ipad,26258.html",technology,"[""Last September, Apple released iOS 7, a major revamp of its mobile operating system for iPhone and iPad. Since then, we've seen a number of smaller OTA updates to the OS. Today brings the first major upgrade to iOS 7, though. This week, Apple finally released iOS 7.1, which brings with it a host of new features. So what can you expect with this iteration of iOS? Read on for the breakdown!\n\nCarPlay\n\nLet's start with the big one: CarPlay. Announced in early March, CarPlay is Apple's in-car infotainment system. The company wants to make using your iPhone in the car safer and more fun. CarPlay will give users access to maps, GPS routing, iTunes, Siri, and the ability to make calls and send messages via the iPhone and iMessage.\n\nSiri\n\nYou can now manually control when Siri listens by holding down the home button and releasing it when you're finished asking your question. It's important to note that Siri isn't always listening for commands, rather this is an alternative method of letting Siri know when you've stopped talking. Before, Siri had to 'notice' by itself. Now, by releasing the home button, you're telling her (or him) you're done and it's time for her to go do her thing. Siri now also has some new voices, including some more natural sounding ones for Mandarin, UK and Australian English, and Japanese. These are available in both male and female versions.\n\nMusic\n\niTunes Radio will now let you buy albums based on the song that's currently playing with just one button press. Apple is also adding a search field above featured stations and allowing users to subscribe to iTunes Match via iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.\n\nIn addition to the changes made to iTunes Radio, Music applications now have Shuffle and Repeat buttons for the times when you want to be surprised or when you don't.\n\nCalendar\n\nApple's native Calendar app will now offer you the option of displaying events while in 'month view.' In addition to this, the company has added country-specific holidays for new countries (though the release notes don't offer a list, so you'll have to check yours and report back in the comments). Apple has also redesigned the list view.\n\nCamera\n\nThis one is specifically for iPhone 5S users. Owners of Apple's current generation smartphone will notice a new setting in the Camera application that automatically enables HDR. You can also use the new 'Upload Burst Photos' option, which is accessed via iOS Settings.\n\nPerformance\n\nWe all know OS updates can be a point of uncertainty for those with older generation devices. If you're still rocking an iPhone 4, Apple is promising you a bump in performance. Cupertino hasn't offered any specifics on this, so we don't know what kind of bump you'll get, but with the iPhone 4 pushing four years old, it's nice users haven't been forgotten just yet.\n\nFaceTime\n\nIf you're used to FaceTiming across multiple devices, you'll be pleased to learn that call notifications from Apple's video calling application will now automatically be cleared when you take a call on another device.\n\nUI\n\nApple has also made a few tweaks to the user interface that you'll no doubt run into sooner or later. These include a new 'Dark Keyboard.' You'll find this under the iOS Settings - > Accessibility.* There you can also navigate to the 'Increase Contrast' tab where you'll find a 'Darken Colors' option. You'll also notice that the bold font option now extends to the keyboard and calculator, and the Reduce Motion option includes Weather, Messages, and multitasking UI animations. The dialer has gotten a refresh, too, as has the slide-to-power-off UI. TouchID and Passcode now feature on the main menu when you navigate to iOS Settings and 'Touch ID requires your passcode when iPhone restarts' will now pop up when you restart your phone.\n\nFixes\n\nWhile Apple has added plenty of new features with iOS 7.1, the bug fixes are a lot more sparse. This is largely because all the minor updates to iOS 7 up until now (iOS 7.01 to iOS 7.06, which was just released mid-February) have been about fixes. Though some of them brought additional features, they, for the most part, focused on fixing bugs, which means there isn't a boatload of bug fixes being administered with iOS 7.1.\n\niOS 7.1 patches exploits used by the evasi0n7 Jailbreak. It also fixes a bug that caused home screen crashing, and improves TouchID recognition. There was also a problem with displaying the unread mail badge for numbers over 10,000. This has also been fixed. Other than that, we expect Apple will continue to roll out fixes on a case-by-case basis in future updates.\n\n*The Dark Keyboard option was apparently removed before final release. We've emailed Apple for clarification on this one. We'll let you know when we hear back. Hat tip to @mcnaugha for the tip!\n\nFollow Jane McEntegart @JaneMcEntegart.

Included in the update are several key features such as CarPlay, but also a collection of smaller tweaks and improvements that make system more convenient.\n\nAmong those features are two very important ones that haven’t really gotten enough press: huge performance improvements on the iPhone 4 and something called “HFP prompts” in the Maps application…\n\nPerformance improvements on iPhone 4\n\nAs anyone who has used iOS 7 on an iPhone 4 will tell you, the older hardware is nearly incapable of keeping up with the newer software. Even with the disabled visual effects and other concessions attempting to keep things running smoothly, the entire system suffered from laggy animations and other problems.\n\nAs shown the video above, via ArsTechnica, the 7.1 update has mostly resolved these issues. Animations are no longer laggy and are much quicker overall than the previous version (as is the case on all devices to some degree, but more so on the iPhone 4).\n\nHFP Prompts in Maps\n\nThe second feature listed above is the addition of “HFP prompts” in the Maps app. You’d be forgiven for having idea what those are, given the unnecessarily technical name. This feature is designed to allow you to listen to your car’s built-in radio or other input devices while using your Bluetooth-connected iPhone for navigation.\n\nOn previous versions of iOS, if you connected your iPhone to your car via Bluetooth and used it for navigation, you would only be able to hear the audible “turn left in 400 feet” prompts if you tuned your car’s stereo to the Bluetooth input. If you were listening to an FM radio station or a CD (people still listen to those, right?), you wouldn’t hear the prompts. Take it from someone who has done that before: this is not a good way to navigate anywhere.\n\nUnder iOS 7.1, a new audio setting in the Maps application allows you to enable HFP prompts, which will automatically tell your car to switch over to Bluetooth when it needs to play an audible direction reminder. After the phone is done speaking the direction, it will automatically switch back to whatever you were doing earlier. Essentially it will work just like a phone call or Siri through your car’s Bluetooth system.\n\nHands-on with iOS 7.1\n\nBelow we’ve embedded a few hands-on videos featuring the new changes in iOS 7.1 so you can see them in action for yourself. ZDNet has also compiled a set of screenshots showing some of the updated interface elements.', 'Apple launched iOS 7.1 this morning after what seemed like an eternity in beta, making the first major update to the mobile OS since it was redesigned last year.\nAs shown the video above, via ArsTechnica, the 7.1 update has mostly resolved these issues.\nHFP Prompts in MapsThe second feature listed above is the addition of “HFP prompts” in the Maps app.\nEssentially it will work just like a phone call or Siri through your car’s Bluetooth system.\nHands-on with iOS 7.1Below we’ve embedded a few hands-on videos featuring the new changes in iOS 7.1 so you can see them in action for yourself.']"

It\'s not a complete recovery from the original iOS 7.0 release, but it\'s about as good as Apple can do with hardware this old.

According to Ars Technica, there is a measurable improvement in iOS 7.1 across a number of native iOS apps, including the speed at which the apps open from the home screen:As Ars notes , iOS 7.1 may well be the final major iOS release for the iPhone 4, as Apple generally removes support for the last generation of iPhones when it releases a new operating system each year.

A list of events has become the default way that many use their calendars, so this is welcome.\n\niTunes Radio now allows you to quickly create stations with a search and now allows you to subscribe to iTunes Match right from an iDevice to get an ad-free experience.\n\nOn the accessibility front, the ‘Reduce Motion’ option now applies to Weather, Messages and the multitasking screen. This reduces the parallax effect that some users had complained was making them ill.\n\nFor those of you who have had issues getting TouchID to work correctly, you’ll be pleased to see that there are improvements to its fingerprint recognition included in this update. Older iOS users will also be happy to see some performance improvements for the iPhone 4.\n\nA recurring bug which has caused the home screen to crash — resulting in a quick ‘reboot’ of your device while using it — has also been fixed with this version. FaceTime call notifications are now cleared and synced across devices, iCloud Keychain support has been expanded to new countries and the iPhone 5s gets a new Camera setting that automatically enables HDR.\n\nYou can download iOS 7.1 via the software update feature of your device or via iTunes.\n\nSource: techcrunch.com', 'Apple has just released iOS 7.1, the first major update for iOS 7 since its launch back in September.\nIn a relatively rare move, Apple has put up a full page detailing the new features of iOS 7.1.\nThere have been some visual tweaks as well to things like the shift keys on the keyboard, the in-call buttons, lock screen icons and more.\nOlder iOS users will also be happy to see some performance improvements for the iPhone 4.\nYou can download iOS 7.1 via the software update feature of your device or via iTunes.']"

They\'re still flat, but a little rounder than before.\n\nWe pored over the official release notes and tested out iOS 7.1 to find that while there aren\'t a lot of major changes, its ability to remedy iOS 7 glitches makes it worth downloading immediately.\n\nDeath to \'the white screen of death\'\n\nThe most pervasive glitch is what Apple is calling ""an occasional Home screen crash bug."" Users have more aptly nicknamed it the ""white screen of death"" glitch.\n\nBy either name, it\'s an annoying software defect that randomly forced iOS devices into a soft reset. A blank screen with the Apple logo would suddenly show up for no apparent reason.\n\nWhile users have complained about this task-closing glitch since September 2013, Apple hasn\'t been able to fix it until now. It first acknowledged the problem and promised a solution in January.\n\nThe company didn\'t reveal why this glitch occurred, but it\'s thankfully gone according to our tests today. Six months is far too long to wait for such a patch.\n\niOS 7.1 revs up CarPlay\n\nApple is putting iOS in the Car, even though its infotainment ecosystem doesn\'t go by that more direct name anymore.\n\nCarPlay is enabled through iOS 7.1 on any iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C or iPhone 5 as long as it\'s paired with a compatible vehicle.\n\nOne of the biggest iOS 7.1 features most people won\'t be able to use\n\nSo far that includes the Volvo XC90 SUV, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and the Ferrari FF with more car models and manufacturers to come.\n\nThe release notes indicate that CarPlay brings phone, music, maps, messages and third-party audio apps to the hands-free infotainment center.\n\nUsers can also control everything through Siri or via the car\'s touchscreen, knobs and buttons.\n\nDesign tweaks\n\nFlat circles are in and skeuomorphic boxes are out, according to Apple\'s iOS design tweaks. The look and feel of iOS 7.1 makes such alterations to the call and power-off screens.\n\niOS 7 vs iOS 7.1 call screen has changed\n\nThe answer and end button are now green and red circles. These smaller but more fashionable pair match the caller\'s round photo icon.\n\nThe same treatment was given to the revised power off slide bar. Holding down the sleep button brings up a new white and red button, replacing the ugly reddish-orange bar.\n\nAll animations have been sped up too, making iOS 7.1 instantly faster when sliding through and opening up apps. It\'s almost as if the processor got a speed boost without the necessary hardware upgrade.\n\nSiri and Touch ID\n\nSiri is easier to operate in iOS 7.1. Before, Apple\'s personal assistant would often cut you off mid-sentence, complicating it as a hands-free solution.\n\nNow, holding down the home button manually controls Siri so that you can drone on and on without having her interrupting your bloviating commands.\n\nOverall minor changes until iOS 8\n\nApple\'s release notes indicate that its Touch ID fingerprint recognition system has improved with iOS 7.1. Users have previously complained that the scanner forgets their fingerprints.\n\nThe Camera and Calendar apps are the final tweaks Apple is highlighting in iOS 7.1. The iPhone 5S automatically enables HDR photos through the Camera app, while Calendar brings the much-needed ability to view events by month.\n\nAll of these upgrades aren\'t significant and few iPhone users can take advantage of CarPlay, but today\'s minor update is a step in the right direction as we await bigger changes for iOS 8 this fall.', ""iOS 7.1 does away with the 'white screen of death'If iOS 7 was a fresh coat of paint for Apple's operating system, then today's iOS 7.1 release is a much-needed touch up six months into the redesign.\niOS 7.1 revs up CarPlayApple is putting iOS in the Car, even though its infotainment ecosystem doesn't go by that more direct name anymore.\niOS 7 vs iOS 7.1 call screen has changedThe answer and end button are now green and red circles.\nAll animations have been sped up too, making iOS 7.1 instantly faster when sliding through and opening up apps.\nOverall minor changes until iOS 8Apple's release notes indicate that its Touch ID fingerprint recognition system has improved with iOS 7.1.""]"
1690,http://www.inquisitr.com/1166740/references-to-unknown-ipad-models-found-within-ios-7-1/,technology,"['Hours after Apple released its newest version of iOS for iPhones, iPads and iPods – the all new iOS 7.1, people who dug deep into the core of the new software came up with some startling facts. The code has references to two new hitherto unheard of devices in the list of hardware that iOS 7.1 supports. The new devices appear in the list as iPad4,3 and iPad4,6. These model numbers are internal code names for product variants and were not known to have existed on any document in the public domain, until today that is.\n\nWhile excited bloggers have already talked about the possibility of these being entirely new iPad variants that could be launched soon, experts are of the opinion that these references within iOS 7.1 are more likely to be minor upgrades to the hardware over the existing iPad models. These revisions usually involve internal components and do not affect the product performance in a noticeable way. In short, these might be inconsequential “upgrades” that might be of little value to the end consumer.\n\nIn case you are unaware, here’s what folks from over at iPhoneHacks have to say about the internal code names for the current iPad versions. According to them, the existing iPad Air models bear internal model numbers iPad4,1 and iPad 4,2. The Retina iPad Mini models are known internally as the iPad4,4 and iPad 4,5. It is therefore highly plausible that the “new” iPad 4,3 could be a slightly tweaked iPad Air while the iPad 4,6 could be a tweaked Retina iPad mini. Of course, these are just calculated guesses at this point of time. In the past, there have been instances like these where a products internal codename was changed midway through its life-cycle after it received a minor update. Case in point, the Third generation Apple TV, which was initially labelled “3,1”, – an updated version with a smaller chip was added later with the model number changed to “3.2”.\n\nMeanwhile, a commenter on MacRumors has talked about the possibility of these new models being new iPad Mini with Retina Display with an upgraded speaker unit. There were some complaints about the volume levels on the iPad Minis soon after their launch. Here is an Apple Discussions Forum thread discussing the same issue.\n\nAnyway, at this point of time, we can only guess as to what these “new” iPad models would turn out to be. Why then don’t you guys let us know what you think this would be? Do you see a new iPad model being launched very soon?\n\n[Image Via: MacRumors]', 'According to them, the existing iPad Air models bear internal model numbers iPad4,1 and iPad 4,2.\nThe Retina iPad Mini models are known internally as the iPad4,4 and iPad 4,5.\nIt is therefore highly plausible that the “new” iPad 4,3 could be a slightly tweaked iPad Air while the iPad 4,6 could be a tweaked Retina iPad mini.\nAnyway, at this point of time, we can only guess as to what these “new” iPad models would turn out to be.\nDo you see a new iPad model being launched very soon?']"

While it was much bigger before the expansion of cable television and the advent of digital, it’s still a thriving, profitable business.\n\nThat said, the success of radio in the US is (and always has been) inextricably linked to the automotive industry. If radios were not in cars, the radio business would be a small fraction of its current size, were it to exist at all. This is interesting because the automotive industry does not profit from the radio business in any way. How would you feel if your business drove a $16 billion business and you didn’t make a dime from it?\n\nYou may argue that the automotive industry doesn’t profit from the oil industry or road construction and literally hundreds of other related industries. You’d be right, of course, but with other industries the ship has sailed. With the advent of connected drivers, the automotive industry can make sure that history does not repeat itself.\n\nThe mission is clear: figure out how to get drivers to log in to their cars.\n\nThis is harder to do than it sounds. After all, you already have a powerful cloud-connected computer in your pocket. Why do you need to log in to the car? Detroit’s strategy is to offer drivers an integrated, enhanced experience so compelling that logging in to the car becomes a requirement. Connected drivers give carmakers the opportunity to interact with drivers in many ways, such as the following:\n\nIn-car entertainment (radio, audio, video, games)\n\nAccess to and egress from the vehicle (seats, mirrors, heat, door locks, trunk)\n\nWay-finding (enhanced GPS, cartography and mapping)\n\nVehicle service (needs analysis, appointments, locations)\n\nPersonal preferences (memory, intelligence, learning)\n\nConnected living features (social networks, email, txt, apps)\n\nDriver safety (inter-vehicle communication)\n\nVehicle movement (traffic jam avoidance, parking space reservations)\n\nInterfaces with other modes of transportation (railroad, airline schedules)\n\nWhat if my car (a computer with wheels) were as easy to operate as an iPhone or a Mac?\n\nAs you probably know, iOS 7 is the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system (the software that makes an iPhone work). CarPlay is iOS 7 on your dashboard. Apple says it designed CarPlay from the ground up to “provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car.”\n\nAs you also probably know, Apple spends as much time searching the thesaurus for superlatives to describe its products as it does making them, so discount “incredible experience” appropriately.\n\nAccording to Apple, you’ll be able to control CarPlay in a few ways. Compatible vehicles will have a dedicated voice-control button on the steering wheel. Apple says that “if it controls your screen, it controls CarPlay,” meaning you’ll be able to use the physical knobs and dials (as well as touch and voice) to interact with your iPhone.\n\nThe whole system is built around Siri. Through voice commands and prompts, CarPlay offers an “eyes-free” experience that lets you answer calls, send text messages and access your music library. (That includes iTunes Radio as well as Spotify, Beats Radio, iHeartRadio and Stitcher.) CarPlay also supposedly knows where you want to go, based on addresses found in your email, texts, contacts and calendars — a little creepy, but cool. Welcome to the future!\n\nCarPlay prominently features Apple’s Maps app, which got off to a very rocky start but has since improved. Use of Apple Maps has skyrocketed in recent months, which helps create a better map experience for everyone using it. But, to be frank, Apple Maps are not Google Maps. While this won’t matter in densely populated, well-trafficked areas, it is sure to yield interesting results in others.\n\nThe first cars to support CarPlay come from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, and were all shown off at last week’s Geneva Motor Show. Other companies, including Nissan, BMW and General Motors, are promising to integrate CarPlay into future vehicles. The rumour mill says that Ford is interested in adding CarPlay into its vehicles, too, even after recent reports suggested it was dropping Microsoft’s Sync systems in favour of BlackBerry.\n\nWhen Can I Use It?\n\nCarPlay is available as of this morning, following an iOS 7 update. Only the most recent iPhones — the 5, 5S and 5C — will be compatible with the system at first. There’s no launch date other than 2014.\n\nApple is not the first to unveil an in-car system, and it won’t be the last. Google and Audi are working on an Android system for the car, which Mercedes-Benz may accidentally have leaked recently.\n\nTo quote Yoda from Car Wars II: Attack of the Phones, “Begun, the Phone War has.” This is really going to be fun!\n\nThis article originally appeared on the Huffington Post.', 'If radios were not in cars, the radio business would be a small fraction of its current size, were it to exist at all.\nThis is interesting because the automotive industry does not profit from the radio business in any way.\nUse of Apple Maps has skyrocketed in recent months, which helps create a better map experience for everyone using it.\nBut, to be frank, Apple Maps are not Google Maps.\nTo quote Yoda from Car Wars II: Attack of the Phones, “Begun, the Phone War has.” This is really going to be fun!']"
1694,http://www.geekwire.com/2014/5-cool-new-features-todays-ios-update/,technology,"['Apple dropped iOS 7.1, its first major update to the operating system that powers iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches everywhere today, and it’s a big one.\n\nWhile support for CarPlay, Apple’s new system that allows people to use certain functions from their iPhone in a new car, has earned top billing in a lot of headlines, it requires that users buy new model cars that haven’t been released to consumers yet. So, while we wait for the first generation of CarPlay-ready vehicles, here are 5 more key new features from today’s update:\n\nSiri is a better listener\n\nAnyone who has tried to use Siri knows that while the virtual assistant is pretty good at picking out a user’s voice from background noise, it can have trouble figuring out when someone is done talking. I’ve definitely had experiences when it’ll ask me if I’m ready to send a text message I’m dictating while I’m in mid-sentence.\n\nWith today’s update, ensuring that Siri keeps listening is a lot easier. Like before, users hold down the home button on their device to invoke Siri. But, if they continue to hold down the home button while they’re talking, Siri will keep listening until they release the home button again. That way, users aren’t left with abridged messages.\n\nFor Touch ID users, Siri will now automatically unlock their iPhone if necessary while their finger is pressed down on the home button. That way, saying something like “Open Safari” will automatically open the app rather than ask users to unlock their phone first.\n\niPhone 5S users automatically get clearer photography\n\nWhile Apple has included High Dynamic Range (HDR) functionality in the built-in iOS Camera app for a while, today’s update brings some new functionality for shutterbugs using the iPhone 5S. HDR combines the results of multiple photographs at different exposure settings to create highly detailed photos, even in very bright or very dark environments.\n\nIn the past, users were required to turn HDR on and off manually, which was great for photographers who knew exactly what they wanted and how to get it, but harder on amateurs who didn’t know what the best uses for HDR might be, or even what it did in the first place.\n\nNow, iPhone 5S users can set their phone up to automatically shoot in HDR. Like automatically using a flash, the iPhone’s camera software will automatically take a HDR picture if the situation calls for it, and will switch it off when that’s not necessary.\n\nCreating new stations in iTunes Radio is smoother\n\nOne of Apple’s major additions to its music ecosystem last year was iTunes Radio, which brought everyone with an Apple ID the ability to create their own personalized digital radio stations similar to offerings from Pandora.\n\nNow, it’s easier to create a station on the fly. Apple added a search box over the featured iTunes Radio stations that allows users to search for an artist, genre, album or song and create a station to listen to in a single tap.\n\nUnfamiliar with iTunes Radio? Check out our review of streaming radio services here.\n\nA new month view for Apple’s Calendar app\n\nIt’s no secret that Apple’s built-in Calendar app for iOS isn’t the greatest. But, for people who are interested in taking a broad view at what their month holds, Apple has added a new calendar view that allows users to tap on a day in a month and look at a list of all their appointments.\n\nI’ve found that it’s great for trying to schedule something a few weeks in advance: month views in most mobile calendars will often show that I’m busy on a particular day, but not necessarily when I’m busy. With Apple’s new view, it’s fairly easy for me to figure out what my schedule looks like even if I’m a month away from whenever an event might be taking place.\n\nBetter accessibility\n\nFor users who have trouble with iOS 7’s motion-heavy animations, Apple has finally updated the settings app to replace all of the pans and zooms with gentle cross-fade animations. To turn it on, go to the Settings app, then toggle the switch on under General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.\n\nSo, there you have it: 5 great features from Apple’s new update to iOS. Did I miss something new you can’t live without? Let me know in the comments.', 'Apple dropped iOS 7.1, its first major update to the operating system that powers iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches everywhere today, and it’s a big one.\nFor Touch ID users, Siri will now automatically unlock their iPhone if necessary while their finger is pressed down on the home button.\niPhone 5S users automatically get clearer photographyWhile Apple has included High Dynamic Range (HDR) functionality in the built-in iOS Camera app for a while, today’s update brings some new functionality for shutterbugs using the iPhone 5S.\nA new month view for Apple’s Calendar appIt’s no secret that Apple’s built-in Calendar app for iOS isn’t the greatest.\nSo, there you have it: 5 great features from Apple’s new update to iOS.']"

1698,http://www.macgasm.net/2014/03/10/ios-7-1-changes/,technology,"['iOS 7.1 is here, and while it doesn’t look drastically different from iOS 7.0, it addresses many of the complaints that people had about its predecessor. Here’s a quick tour of some of the tweaks, changes, and additions we’ve spotted in our adventures with iOS 7.1 so far. We’ll add to this list as we find more things.\n\nHigher-Contrast Keyboard\n\nThe keyboard get a new-ish look in iOS 7.1, but you may have to look closely for it. In iOS 7.1, keyboard lettering is heavier than it had been on 7.0, and the background is a slightly cooler shade of gray. The Shift key gets a new look, too: When Shift is on in 7.1, the key turns white with a black arrow. In 7.0, the key remained gray, but gained a dark gray arrow.\n\nTweaked Icon Colors\n\niOS 7.1 slightly tones down the green icons for the Messages and Phone apps. The rest of the bundled app icons are largely unchanged, but eagle-eyed readers might also notice that the icon labels are slightly lower relative to the icon they’re associated with in iOS 7.1.\n\n(What, you didn’t notice it? Some iOS user you are. :P )\n\nMake Buttons Look Like Buttons\n\niOS 7’s borderless buttons caused…just a little bit of a stir among the user interface design community. And for good reason—some buttons may be hard to distinguish from mere text labels, particularly if you have a vision impairment (like colorblindness) or are just unfamiliar with iOS. iOS 7.1 gives you the option to re-add borders to buttons: Open the Settings app then go to General > Accessibility, then toggle the Button Shapes setting to the on position. The button shapes aren’t pretty, but they work.\n\nCut Down On Gratuitous Animation\n\niOS 7’s animations aren’t for everyone. For some, they’re annoying. For others, they actually cause motion sickness. Previous versions of iOS 7 could reduce some of the motion effects, but as Macworld points out, iOS 7.1 takes it a step further by optionally disabling additional visual effects, such as the scrolling effect in the Messages app and the cloud animations in the Weather app.\n\nOpen to the Settings app, then proceed to General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion to make sure that you don’t lose your lunch over zooming icons. Unfortunately, you can’t turn off only certain effects while keeping others.\n\nDarker “Slide To Unlock” Text\n\nIt’s a small thing (as are all of these—noticing a pattern?), but the “Slide to unlock” text on the lock screen is darker and a bit more obvious under iOS 7.\n\nTweaked Dialer Screen\n\nThe dialer screen in the Phone app gets a minor update in iOS 7.1: Instead of a rectangular button labelled “Call,” you now get a circular button with a phone receiver icon (how quaint). The top bar that displays the number you’re calling gets a slight update too. (Note that the iOS 7 screenshot above is from an iPhone 4 so the proportions may be different from what you’ll see on an iPhone 5/5C/5S, but the basic layout should be the same.)', 'iOS 7.1 is here, and while it doesn’t look drastically different from iOS 7.0, it addresses many of the complaints that people had about its predecessor.\nHere’s a quick tour of some of the tweaks, changes, and additions we’ve spotted in our adventures with iOS 7.1 so far.\nHigher-Contrast KeyboardThe keyboard get a new-ish look in iOS 7.1, but you may have to look closely for it.\nIn iOS 7.1, keyboard lettering is heavier than it had been on 7.0, and the background is a slightly cooler shade of gray.\n:P )Make Buttons Look Like ButtonsiOS 7’s borderless buttons caused…just a little bit of a stir among the user interface design community.']"
1699,http://techreport.com/news/26142/ios-7-1-aims-to-atone-for-ios-7-shortcomings,technology,"['For those of you with iOS devices, Apple has released iOS 7.1 via over-the-air update today. This new rev of the OS adds a few new features and, most notably in my view, attempts to fix some problems introduced with iOS 7. There’s a list of changes here on Apple’s website. Listed first is the new ""CarPlay"" feature for automotive control integration, which is a nice upgrade for those with compatible touchscreens in their cars, I suppose.\n\nTo me, the biggest changes have to do with the UI and performance. iOS 7 was a big and necessary change, but it lacked the sort of polish for which Apple was known under the tyranny of Mr. Jobs. As a result, iOS 7.1 looks to fix some rather obvious problems, most of them filed under the bland, final bullet point in the release notes: ""Continued user interface refinements.""\n\nFor instance, Cyril’s first reaction was relief that the slider to unlock an iPhone when you receive a call has been tweaked so the touch target area is larger, making a swipe-to-unlock motion easier and more reliable.\n\nMy top improvements have to do with iOS 7’s swanky UI animations: they now happen faster and appear to be smoother on older hardware. This fact, combined with some other apparent optimizations, has iOS 7.1 running appreciably faster on my third-gen iPad. I essentially stopped using that system after the iOS 7 update and even refused to sell it to my brother because it was too sluggish. This update has been an awful long time in coming, but it does seem to restore the performance I’d enjoyed under iOS 6. In fact, 7.1 feels faster than 7.0.x even after disabling the ""reduced motion"" accessibility option.\n\niOS 7 was by all accounts horribly sluggish on the iPhone 4.

(Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg)\n\nApple released a new update to its latest operating system, iOS 7, in a Monday update that marks the first major changes Apple\'s made to the system in the six months since it made its debut. The update adds support for Apple\'s new connected car service, CarPlay, and also fixes some bugs such as one that was making some users\' home screens crash.\n\nThe update isn\'t huge — nothing like the complete cosmetic overhaul that Apple unleashed when it first showed off iOS 7 — but it does include several small changes that you\'ll probably notice right away. For one, the colors are little more muted, for better contrast. Plus, certain animations, such as the screen when you get an incoming call, look a little different.\n\nDiving a little deeper into the update, Apple has added some tweaks to the Calendar, which lets users look at a list of their events for the month, and has also improved the recognition technology behind its Touch ID fingerprint reader.\n\nThe firm has also made some changes to Siri, making it possible for users to hold down the home button the entire time they talk to the virtual assistant, and then release it to have the phone stop listening. It\'s an option, but a good usability tweak for those who want it. Users can also choose more ""natural-sounding"" options for Siri in UK English, Australian English, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese.\n\nApple has also made a tweak to its iTunes Radio feature, including one that lets you buy albums from the ""Now Playing"" feature rather than just singles.\n\nAnd finally, for shutterbugs, Apple has also included an update just for iPhone 5s users that will automatically turn on the high-dynamic range, or HDR, feature when needed rather than making you toggle the feature yourself.\n\nThe update is rolling out to users now.

In addition to fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, it provides several interesting new features.\n\niOS 7.1 formally introduces CarPlay, Apple’s new vehicular infotainment system for new cars in 2014. With CarPlay, Apple is making a bid to become the de facto auto-intelligence system—one that provides navigation by Apple Maps, music via iTunes and touchless access to phone calls, apps like Spotify and messaging through the Siri virtual assistant.\n\nCarPlay will be shipped in cars from Volvo, Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes this year with partners like BMW, Chevrolet and Ford down the road.\n\nHere are six other things you need to know about iOS 7.1:\n\nPush-Button Siri\n\nThe Siri virtual assistant has been upgraded so you can signal it when you’re done speaking. Hold down the Home button on your iPhone or iPad when speaking and release it so Siri stops listening. Essentially, Apple has given Siri walkie-talkie capabilities.\n\nFlat Gets Flatter\n\niOS 7.1 brings a couple of design tweaks to the flat design that Apple first rolled out in iOS 7. Users can now switch between light and dark keyboards through the “Accessibility” settings. Several icons are more defined, such as the Message, Phone and FaceTime app icons. Users can disable or minimize the 3D-ish “parallax” effect, in which the screen background appears to shift as you move the phone.\n\nNew Camera Settings\n\niPhone 5S users get new settings in iOS 7.1. HDR (high dynamic range) will turn on automatically for iPhone 5S users. HDR basically makes the camera app take several pictures at different exposures and then composites them together in order to create a sharper final image.\n\nTouch ID Improved\n\nMany users have complained that the Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the iPhone 5S stops working well after a few months of use. This is partly a hardware problem, but also a software issue. In iOS 7.1, Apple has improved the Touch ID software to be more accurate, leading to quicker response times fewer rejections. Let us know in the comments if the update to Touch ID improves the performance on your iPhone 5S.\n\nImproved Performance For iPhone 4\n\nThe oldest Apple device that can run iOS 7.1 is the iPhone 4. Many users complained that the iPhone 4 was basically unusable with iOS 7 and took Apple to task for basically turning their phones into shiny bricks. In iOS 7.1, Apple promises improved performance for the iPhone 4 with better responsiveness.\n\nCalendar Design Update\n\nIt may be a small change, but Apple updated the way its calendar app displays events in “Month View” with the aim of making them more accessible and readable.\n\nHave you downloaded iOS 7.1 yet? What changes do you see to Apple’s latest update? Let us know in the comments.\n\nUpdated on March 12 to clarify the language and fix typos.

The release comes little less than six months after the radically redesigned iOS 7 arrived back in September 2013.\n\nLike iOS 7, its latest iteration is compatible with the iPhone 4 and subsequent models, the iPad 2 and its subsequent variants (including the iPad Mini line-up), and not to mention, the 5th generation iPod Touch models. Like all software updates, this one too boasts of a plethora of bug fixes, design tweaks and feature additions. Let us take a quick look at what’s new with iOS 7.1.\n\nCarPlay\n\nInitially showcased at the Geneva Auto Show earlier this month, CarPlay was formerly known as “iOS in the Car”. It has made its official debut as CarPlay with iOS 7.1. This basically is a tool that will let your iPhone and its software seamlessly integrate with your in-car infotainment system. Apart from handling mundane things like making and answering calls using voice command, it will also help you with navigation, messaging and music. Apple has made the UI as intuitive as possible to ensure that the driver is not distracted from his primary job of driving. As you might have guessed, this requires car manufacturers to join hands with Apple, and some of them have actually done that. Car manufacturers who now support CarPlay include Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. A host of other players are set to enter the fray in the coming months. CarPlay is of course powered by Siri.\n\nSiri\n\nTalking about Siri brings me to the fact that with iOS 7.1, she would sound a lot natural – thanks to addition of a plethora of natural-sounding voices for U.K. English, Australian English, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese languages. The biggest addition however is perhaps the new push-to-talk mode whereby users can hold the home button to fine tune the duration of your query for Siri.\n\nCamera\n\nThe major update that iOS 7.1 to the camera software is the addition of an HDR Auto mode.\n\nCalendar\n\nFor office going iOS users who have been missing the “list view” within month view, it has returned! Also finding its way in is country specific holidays list that shows up depending on where your iPhone is located.\n\niTunes Radio\n\nYou can now buy albums from within iTunes Radio – a feature that wasn’t available when the software first arrived with iOS 7.\n\nTouch ID\n\nImprovements have also been made to the Touch ID biometric reader, making the fingerprint recognition bit even better with iOS 7.1\n\nHow to Download\n\nWondering how to get this latest version of iOS? All you need to do is to navigate to the Settings menu on your iOS device, go to the “General” section and then to the “Software Update” menu. You should be able to see an option to upgrade the software over-the-air. In case you do not see an update listed, you may also try connecting the device to either a Mac or a PC and update to iOS 7.1 using iTunes.by selecting the “Check for Upgrade” button in your device’s summary window.

The latest iOS 7.1 update shows the compatible devices including iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6. Both of these iPad models have never been announced by Apple.\n\nSeems like Apple has some devices running for house use or perhaps under testing. These new iPad models indicate an upgraded Retina Mini iPad and a new iPad Air model. iPad 4,1 and 4,2 are the digits for iPad Air. So it seems like 4,3 could be the digits for modified iPad Air. On the other hands, Apple iPad Retina Mini carries 4,4, and 4,5 indicating that iPad 4,6 could correspond to a new Retina iPad mini.\n\nWhile specifics of these models are yet unknown, it would be interesting to see what is cooking down at Cupertino. It is highly possible that these digits correspond to same iPad Air and Retina Mini models but just kept for internal use. These could only be numbers for some specific region. Another possibility could be that Apple is testing better performance, efficient battery usage, and new tweaks on these devices. Whatever the reason be, we would be on the hunt to see what exactly these iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6 models carry in them!\n\nStay tuned!\n\n- Relevant updates and news:"", 'The latest iOS 7.1 update shows the compatible devices including iPad 4,3 and iPad 4,6.\nThese new iPad models indicate an upgraded Retina Mini iPad and a new iPad Air model.\niPad 4,1 and 4,2 are the digits for iPad Air.\nOn the other hands, Apple iPad Retina Mini carries 4,4, and 4,5 indicating that iPad 4,6 could correspond to a new Retina iPad mini.\nIt is highly possible that these digits correspond to same iPad Air and Retina Mini models but just kept for internal use.']"

This follows the release of iOS 7 in June 2013.According to The Verge, several tweaks have been made to the iOS user interface and some bugs have been fixed. The most significant visual changes are related to the iPhone’s dialing and power off features. “iOS 7.1 switches to rounded UI elements in both of these areas,” according to The Verge , “and the incoming call interface now includes separate decline and accept buttons below floating circular icons for the Remind Me and Message options.”Other fixes include the elimination of random reboots, making the shift and delete keys easier to see, and a change to the Notification Center that allows the user to clear notifications “more accurately,” according to The Verge.The iOS updates also include support for Apple’s new feature, CarPlay. According to Apple’s website, “CarPlay takes the things you want to do with your iPhone while driving and puts them in your car’s built-in display. Now you have a smarter, safer way to make calls, get directions, or play music from your iPhone while in the car.”Using Siri voice commands, the iOS 7.1 CarPlay feature allows the user to respond to incoming calls, dictate text messages, and access music in the user’s library while in the car. The user will also be able to search iTunes Radio for featured stations and more quickly create new stations around songs and artists.Also with Siri, the iOS 7.1 updates include the ability to hold the home button down longer to make sure Siri listens longer during a query.

1723,"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2454785,00.asp",technology,"['Apple on Monday released an updated version of its mobile operating system, iOS 7.1, and it comes with several noticeable changes over the previous release, as well as a few differences that won\'t be apparent unless you know to enable them.\n\nMany of the physical alterations smooth out the design leap that iOS users experienced when jumping from iOS 6 to iOS 7, which introduced the so-called flat design and parallax effects. A few of the changes in iOS 7.1, such as how some Web pages display in Safari, are more behind-the-scenes for programmers and won\'t be apparent to users until developers leverage them.\n\nBut these six changes are worth investigating. Here\'s a few words about them, as well as where you can find them.\n\nPhone and FaceTime Answering Options\n\nIncoming phone calls and FaceTime requests look a little different in iOS 7.1. Buttons shaped like rounded rectangles move to the wayside to make room for circles. The buttons for ""remind me"" and ""reply with message"" look completely different now, almost played down compared with their blocky past versions.\n\nWhere: On screen when a phone call or FaceTime call comes in.\n\nShift and Caps Lock Indicators\n\nThe shift key on iOS\'s virtual keyboard now uses new icons to indicate when it is not engaged (white key, black arrow), has been pressed once for a single keystroke (gray key, white arrow), and tapped twice to turn on caps lock (white key, black arrow with underline). In the image above, from left to right: shift not engaged; single cap shift; all caps.\n\nWhere: On the keyboard.\n\nSiri Voices\n\nWith iOS 7.1, Siri should sound a little sweeter, or more masculine, depending on your taste. Siri now has both male and female voices for Australian English, British English, Japanese, and Mandarin, and they should sound better, too. The developer release notes state that your iPhone or iPad initially uses a ""compact voice for Siri,"" but that it will download and install a higher-quality version automatically once you connect to a Wi-Fi network and plug your device into a power source. I could hear the improvements most clearly in the Australian male voice.\n\nWhere: Settings > General > Siri\n\nButton Shapes\n\nWhen enabled, Button Shapes highlights buttons that otherwise look like text to better differentiate them. It makes iOS 7.1 look slightly less sophisticated and austere, but it makes the buttons pop for sure. In the image above, you can see the traditional view on the left, and the enhanced button shape on the right. Sometimes it takes the form of a simple underline instead of a gray box. I rather like a lot of the accessibility features in iOS because they often improve the experience without really getting in the way, and Button Shapes is one you can enable and forget you ever did. (For other useful accessibility features, try the reduce motion setting if iOS 7 makes you dizzy, and Guided Access to lock your screen while kids use your device.)\n\nWhere: Settings > General > Accessibility > Button Shapes\n\nPerspective Zoom (Ability to Disable Parallax Effect for Wallpaper Only)\n\nWith iOS 7.1, you now have finer controls for disabling some of the visual effects within iOS 7. When you choose a wallpaper for your lock screen or home screen in iOS 7, you\'ll see an option to turn ""perspective zoom"" on or off. Turning it off disables the parallax effect (if you\'re still not totally sure what parallax effect is, scroll slowly through this BBC page, and you\'ll get it), without disabling the other animations, such as the zooming in and out of app preview pages when you double-tap the home button.\n\nWhere: Settings > Wallpaper & Brightness (and then choose a wallpaper)\n\nLess Bouncy Control Center\n\nIt\'s not a huge change, but the quick-access control bar, which lets you adjust the screen brightness, adjust Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, etc., bounces less when you first engage it. The Control Center, which was entirely new as of iOS 7, formerly pulled up higher onto the screen and sprang back into place when you drew it beyond its capacity. Now, it locks into place quicker and more tightly. You still can\'t use it for location services (i.e., GPS), which has been on my wish list since iOS 7 debuted in 2013.\n\nWhere: Control Center; use one finger near the bottom of the screen and swipe up.', ""Apple on Monday released an updated version of its mobile operating system, iOS 7.1, and it comes with several noticeable changes over the previous release, as well as a few differences that won't be apparent unless you know to enable them.\nA few of the changes in iOS 7.1, such as how some Web pages display in Safari, are more behind-the-scenes for programmers and won't be apparent to users until developers leverage them.\nPhone and FaceTime Answering OptionsIncoming phone calls and FaceTime requests look a little different in iOS 7.1.\nSiri VoicesWith iOS 7.1, Siri should sound a little sweeter, or more masculine, depending on your taste.\nIt makes iOS 7.1 look slightly less sophisticated and austere, but it makes the buttons pop for sure.""]"

Both versions of the iPad mini with Retina display are known as iPad 4,4 and iPad 4,5.

The world’s largest carrier has more than 760 million subscribers, and adding a cellular-enabled iPad Air and iPad mini to the mix would make a lot of sense. Version 7.1 of iOS has been long anticipated and comes with a significant amount of bug fixes and other visual improvements. Along with adding CarPlay support, Apple has improved Siri and iTunes Radio. You can learn more about the iOS 7.1 update on Apple's site. The update can be downloaded directly from an iOS device by going to Settings, General, Software Update.

1747,http://recombu.com/mobile/news/ios-71-is-now-available-whats-new_M20183.html,technology,"['After a long time in testing, the final release of iOS 7.1 has today been made available to the masses.\n\nApple has begun seeding the newest update to its iOS mobile operating system, version 7.1. Some of the most talked about features are now present, including CarPlay, but there are a host of smaller and subtler changes too. Here’s a rundown of what to look out for.\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nLet’s get the things you can’t see out of the way first. In amongst the blanket term ‘bug fixes’ Apple has improved the user experience by enhancing the accuracy of the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, iPhone 4 users should notice slicker performance across the board and more countries will now be able to access iCloud Keychain.\n\nWhat’s more, Apple is hoping that this update has quelled the spontaneous reboot bug that some iPhone users were experiencing.\n\nCarPlay\n\nPerhaps the most hotly anticipated part of the iOS 7.1 update is CarPlay, which works with select vehicles to allow for an iOS experience in your car. Manufacturers including Ferrari, Honda and Mercedes-Benz have already signed up to introduce CarPlay compatibility in some of their 2014 portfolio, with brands like Land Rover, Ford, Jaguar, BMW and more set to join the fray soon after.\n\nCarPlay relays key elements of your iOS device in a driving-friendly format. Through your in-car infotainment system, you can browse your music library, make or take calls, handle messages, use Apple Maps and even access some third-party services like Spotify.\n\nThe big bonus here is that you can interact with the system using your car’s inbuilt hardware controls (buttons, knobs, dials etc.) or navigate with the help of Siri using your voice for a safer “eyes-free” experience. We’re closer to recreating KITT than ever before I tell you. Speaking of Siri…\n\nSiri’s more sophisticated\n\nJust ahead of Microsoft’s plans to bring its new voice assistant Cortana to Windows Phone, Apple’s Siri has gained some new skills. What looks to be the most useful is the new home button control, which lets you continue to press the button whilst talking to Siri and release it to immediately have Siri carry out your request.\n\nBefore users would have to leave an awkward pause following their command while Siri determined that they’d finished speaking, now you can simply release the home button and he/she’ll immediately hunt for the information you’re after.\n\nAlso native speakers of Mandarin, UK English, Australian English and Japanese should notice that Siri speaks with a more natural sounding voice.\n\nClearer Calendar\n\nThe iOS 7 Calendar app is clean and clear to read, but it’s not as well suited as some alternatives to showing you your upcoming events. iOS 7.1 goes someway to removing that shortcoming, with an expanded list view button now residing next to the search button within the app.\n\nWhat’s more, if you don’t like the split month/list view, you can, with a little digging around view all of your upcoming engagements in a fullscreen list view, which is arguably much clearer to browse through.\n\nVisual tweaks\n\nThere have been a few nips and tucks throughout iOS 7.1 which should make it easier to navigate and interact with. CultOfMac goes into great depth, showcasing new visual elements found within the OS in all sorts of areas, most notably with animations and transitions.\n\nThe zoom effect when opening or closing a folder has been fractionally sped up, making an already slick experience look and feel slicker. Swiping up Control Center now finishes in a playful little bounce, feeling like somewhat of an animated tip of the hat to the skeumorphic realism of iOS 6 and its predecessors.\n\nThe start/end call and power off slider now follow a circle motif, as opposed to the rounded rectangular forms of before. iPhone 5S users may notice that HDR Auto mode is now an option, which will let your phone choose which of the three images it’s snapped is the best of the bunch for you.\n\nAccessibility\n\nSome visual changes seem purely aesthetic, but there are many that slot more into the realm of accessibility improvements, clearing away an ambiguity in interface elements like buttons and other controls.\n\nIf you’re happy to restart the device, text can now be made bold for better visibility. The frost effect on the back of folders and other similar backgrounds can also be made less transparent and you can darken and dim both the colours and the whiteness of elements in iOS 7.1’s interface.\n\nIf you still miss the button silhouettes that used to sit in the corners of iOS, then you’ll be happy to learn that ‘Button Shapes’ is a new option highlighting control elements you can interact with once again.\n\nHow to get it\n\nSo that’s it. Provided you have a compatible iOS device, you should be able to jump into the Settings menu, tap General and press Software Update. Assuming you’re connected to a WiFi network, the 260-280MB download shouldn’t take all that long, bringing you in line with the latest and greatest mobile experience Apple has to offer.\n\nHere’s the full changelog:', 'After a long time in testing, the final release of iOS 7.1 has today been made available to the masses.\nCarPlayPerhaps the most hotly anticipated part of the iOS 7.1 update is CarPlay, which works with select vehicles to allow for an iOS experience in your car.\niOS 7.1 goes someway to removing that shortcoming, with an expanded list view button now residing next to the search button within the app.\nVisual tweaksThere have been a few nips and tucks throughout iOS 7.1 which should make it easier to navigate and interact with.\nAssuming you’re connected to a WiFi network, the 260-280MB download shouldn’t take all that long, bringing you in line with the latest and greatest mobile experience Apple has to offer.']"

1750,http://www.extremetech.com/mobile/178191-apple-releases-ios-7-1-with-carplay-improved-ui-and-more-lifelike-siri,technology,"['Start your updating because Apple has finally released iOS 7.1. While this point-release offers a handful of tweaks and bug fixes, the biggest news is undoubtedly CarPlay support. The phone, music, maps, and messages apps are all accessible through CarPlay, and even third-party audio apps like Downcast or Pandora can benefit from this system going forward. The update itself weighs in at a hefty 214MB, so you’ll definitely want to wait until you’re near a wall outlet before you tap “Update.”\n\nRight out of the gate, you’ll find that a number of basic UI elements have been noticeably tweaked for this release. The keyboard has been refreshed, numerous buttons have been redesigned for Apple’s core apps, and everything seems a little bit more responsive. From performance improvements on the iPhone 4 to refined fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5S, it seems that this update is a no-brainer for anyone already running iOS 7.\n\niOS 7.1 is the first public release that natively supports Apple’s brand-new CarPlay initiative. While compatible automobiles aren’t available to the masses just yet, this will be a major feature going forward. Ferrari, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo will all have CarPlay-compatible vehicles on the market this year, and more than a dozen more automakers have signed on for future support. This initial release is simply laying the groundwork, but CarPlay will likely serve a huge role in Apple‘s future plans for world domination.\n\nThat’s not all Cupertino has up its sleeves, mind you. If you load-up the iOS 7.1 release notes, you’ll see that a few interesting tidbits made their way into this latest release as well. The Calendar and Music apps have received a number of usability modifications, but Siri is the real star of 7.1. Previously, Siri insisted on guessing when you were finished speaking commands — if you stopped to think while dictating a text message, Siri would assume that you’ve finished, and stop listening completely. Now, Siri’s listening mode can be manually controlled by holding down the button, and releasing it when you’re finished. If you need time to think before you finish your thought, this update will make your life a little bit easier. Siri has also been given more natural-sounding voices when speaking in Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese.\n\nAlso worth noting, Apple has significantly improved a number of accessibility features in iOS 7.1. In the Settings app, users can now turn on bold fonts to ensure that UI text is easier to read. The “Reduce Motion” feature now applies to animations for Weather, Messages, and multitasking. Even better, users can now toggle button shapes, reduce the white point, and darken application colors across the entire OS. Even if you’re not impressed by the flashier features, these accessibility enhancements are an important step forward in usability for the visually impaired.', 'Start your updating because Apple has finally released iOS 7.1.\nWhile this point-release offers a handful of tweaks and bug fixes, the biggest news is undoubtedly CarPlay support.\nIf you load-up the iOS 7.1 release notes, you’ll see that a few interesting tidbits made their way into this latest release as well.\nThe Calendar and Music apps have received a number of usability modifications, but Siri is the real star of 7.1.\nAlso worth noting, Apple has significantly improved a number of accessibility features in iOS 7.1.']"

The exploit existed in iOS 7.0 and all subsequent incremental updates, but since it has been plugged in the latest release, that means untethered iOS 7.1 jailbreak is not possible, at least not immediately.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIt was feared that Apple would finally kill the exploit that evasi0n uses with iOS 7.1, and it has.

This means that all users who upgrade to iOS 7.1 will lose their current jailbreak, they won’t be able to downgrade to iOS 7.0.6, so those who update once will be stuck at iOS 7.1 without a jailbreak.\n\nWe can not say for sure right now how long it will take for an iOS 7.1 jailbreak to be developed.

With this update, Apple has fixed some major and minor bugs and tweaked the overall user experience and visuals. It also includes the recently unveiled CarPlay feature, allowing drivers to access their iPhones “eyes-free” as it boosts Siri’s connection to the with the car.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Apple\n\nChanges\n\nApple redesigned a few minor visuals for the major update. On the keyboard, the delete and shift keys are now easier to see. Apple specific app icons like Messaging, Phone and FaceTime have been refined. And the moving wallpaper can now be turned off when users select a still image for the background. Users no longer swipe to answer a call as Apple has redesigned the incoming call screen to have separate accept and decline buttons. The power off screen has a new look as well. All-in-all, the redesigns are just for visual appeal and don’t change functionality at all.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Apple\n\nMajor Fixes\n\nThe biggest major fix Apple tackled was the random rebooting problem certain iPhone 5s, iPad Air and iPad Mini Retina owners faced. If Apple has done its job well, customers will no longer have to deal with random resetting devices. Another big correction is the Touch ID update, making it more responsive and less finicky for users with the iPhone 5s. Siri also got a big update. Now instead of the software deciding when to stop listening, users can hold down the home button to keep Siri listening to them asking where to bury a body.\n\nPhoto: Courtesy Apple\n\nMinor Fixes\n\nApple added several minor changes with iOS 7.1 too. The camera will now automatically enable HDR when the lighting requires it. iCloud Keychain is available in a few more countries. Apple also redesigned the user experience to be faster on all devices, including the iPhone 4, which had noticeable slowing when iOS 7 first launched.\n\nOverall, iOS 7.1 is an incremental update, but it addresses many of the issues current customers have been facing. The update can be downloaded over the air on all devices. Beta users have a larger download file, around 1.3-1.4 Gb, while users upgrading from iOS 7.06 are seeing a quick update of only 214 Mb.

1768,http://blogs.wsj.com/personal-technology/2014/03/10/apples-ios-7-gets-first-major-update-five-features-to-know-about/,technology,"[""Apple released iOS 7.1 Monday, the first significant update to the mobile operating system it debuted on Sept. 18, offering some incremental feature improvements and fixing some bugs that annoyed iPhone and iPad users.\n\nApple’s iOS 7 was a major departure from previous versions of its mobile operating system, bringing a simpler and cleaner look to the software. The new update builds on some of the new designs concepts, while also allowing users to disable some of the new features that had drawn criticism such as the software’s parallax and zoom functions.\n\nThe update is available from today. Apple will be pushing it out to users over the next few days, but users can go get the new version by going to Settings -> General -> Software Update. Just be aware that although the update itself is only 268 megabytes, you'll need 2.5 gigabytes of storage on your iPhone or iPad in order to install it.\n\nHere are a few notable features of iOS 7.1 worth checking out:\n\nMore Stable\n\nThe new update promises to be more stable, fixing some of the bugs that caused the iPhone and iPad to randomly crash and reboot—an annoyance dubbed the “white screen of death.” This was the biggest complaint of iOS 7 users.\n\nImproved Touch ID\n\nOne of the flagship features of Apple’s iPhone 5S, which debuted running iOS 7, is the fingerprint sensor. The performance of Touch ID has been spotty for some users and a source of frustration. The update aims to address that by improving how the Touch ID adapts over time. Some users had complained that the performance of Touch ID seemed to fade over time. Apple promises that the update will make Touch ID work faster.\n\niOS 7.1 improves the Touch ID fingerprint recognition in the iPhone 5S. Apple\n\nMore “Ive-ification” of the software\n\nThe new look of iOS 7 reflects the sensibilities of Apple’s design head, Jonathan Ive, who oversaw the software’s revamp. In the update, there are more design changes. For example, the green and red icons for answering or declining a phone call are now round instead of square. There are also more colors and greater color contrast to help icons stand out more against the software’s translucent background.\n\nAuto-HDR\n\nApple has included high dynamic range, or HDR, in its mobile software for years, but we may see more people using it. HDR promises to create a better-lit image because it blends the exposure data from three different images—although it can cause a blurry picture if the photographer moves too quickly after taking the photo.\n\nCarPlay\n\nOne of the most interesting new features of the update is something that we’ll have to wait to use. The latest software is compatible with CarPlay, Apple’s new initiative to bring iPhone features such as maps, music and messages to the in-car display. However, no cars currently on the market work with CarPlay. Apple has said CarPlay will be available in certain cars later this year from Ferrari, Mercedes Benz, Volvo, Honda and Hyundai, with additional car makers following in the years to come.\n\nOther improvements include making iOS 7 faster for iPhone 4 users, a new bold font option for the keyboard, a month-at-a-glance view in the calendar and new voices for Siri in British and Australian English, Mandarin and Japanese. Speaking of Siri, you can now talk to it like a walkie-talkie, pressing to hold, then releasing when you no longer want it to listen.\n\nHere's some more info and images about the update."", 'Apple’s iOS 7 was a major departure from previous versions of its mobile operating system, bringing a simpler and cleaner look to the software.\nApple will be pushing it out to users over the next few days, but users can go get the new version by going to Settings -> General -> Software Update.\nImproved Touch IDOne of the flagship features of Apple’s iPhone 5S, which debuted running iOS 7, is the fingerprint sensor.\nThe update aims to address that by improving how the Touch ID adapts over time.\nThe latest software is compatible with CarPlay, Apple’s new initiative to bring iPhone features such as maps, music and messages to the in-car display.']"

1778,http://tidbits.com/article/14581,technology,"['Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nNearly six months after the debut of iOS 7, Apple has released iOS 7.1, the first update to make significant feature changes to the mobile operating system, along with visual tweaks that should make using an iOS device easier for those without perfect vision, and bug fixes that promise to address home screen crashes.\n\nThe update is about 200 MB if you install directly on a device via Settings > General > Software Update; if you download via iTunes, it’s about 1.25 GB and may take several tries to download successfully, if my experience was indicative.\n\nMost of the visual changes in iOS 7 revolve around making text bolder, identifying text-only buttons better, and increasing contrast, along with reducing additional animation.\n\n\n\nIn Settings > General > Accessibility, the Bold Text option now applies to the keyboard, Calculator app, and many icon glyphs, significantly increasing readability. (Turning Bold Text on or off requires restarting your device.)\n\nA new option in the Accessibility settings, Button Shapes, draws shaded outlines around previously text-only buttons, which can make it easier to distinguish label text from controls.\n\nIn Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast, two new options — Darken Colors and Reduce White Point — join Reduce Transparency in making the interface less washed-out. I particularly like Darken Colors, simply because I prefer more saturated colors to iOS 7’s pastels.\n\nThose who find the motion aspects of iOS 7 nausea-inducing (or just irritating) will be happy to learn that the Reduce Motion option in Accessibility now includes the Weather and Messages apps, and multitasking animations.\n\nI strongly encourage everyone to explore these settings to see which are the most comfortable for your eyes.\n\nYou’ll also see a new, rounded look for the power-off screen and for the call button in the Phone app. Plus, the incoming call interface now offers separate circular Decline and Accept buttons below the controls for Remind Me and Message.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew to iOS 7.1 is support for CarPlay, which is designed to use Siri voice commands and prompts to let you control certain apps, including Phone, Music, Maps, Messages, and third-party audio apps, without looking at your iPhone (only the iPhone 5, 5c, and 5s are supported). With CarPlay’s “eyes-free” approach, you’ll be able to answer an incoming phone call, dictate text messages, request directions, and navigate your music library. CarPlay also integrates control of these iOS apps with the car’s own buttons, knobs, and touch screen. But don’t get your hopes up unless you’re planning to buy a Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Honda, or Hyundai in the near future. Most other carmakers are promising future support for CarPlay later on. Also note that CarPlay isn’t available in all countries.\n\nSpeaking of Siri, iOS 7.1 makes it possible to control when Siri listens manually by holding the Home button down while you speak and releasing it when you’re done — a sort of walkie-talkie interface. Apple has also added new, more natural-sounding male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese. No mention is made in the release notes of improved accuracy or responsiveness for Siri, which some people found less functional after the update to iOS 7.\n\niTunes Radio receives several minor tweaks, including a search field above Featured Stations to make it easier to create stations based on a particular artist or song. You can also now buy albums from within Now Playing, and you can subscribe to iTunes Match directly within iOS 7.1 to eliminate the ads from iTunes Radio.\n\nOther welcome changes include:\n\nThe Calendar app on the iPhone can now display events in month view (tap the inscrutable little button next to the magnifying glass), and includes country-specific holidays for many countries.\n\nOn the iPhone 5s, a new setting in the Camera app automatically enables HDR.\n\nSupport for iCloud Keychain has been added for more countries.\n\nFaceTime call notifications are automatically cleared when you answer a call on another device.\n\nTouch ID fingerprint recognition on the iPhone 5s has been improved.\n\niPhone 4 users should see overall performance improvements after upgrading.\n\nThe unread message badge on the Mail icon can now display numbers over 10,000.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, iOS 7.1 includes a variety of security fixes as well.\n\nIf you notice other changes, let us know in the comments!', 'Most of the visual changes in iOS 7 revolve around making text bolder, identifying text-only buttons better, and increasing contrast, along with reducing additional animation.\nCarPlay also integrates control of these iOS apps with the car’s own buttons, knobs, and touch screen.\nSpeaking of Siri, iOS 7.1 makes it possible to control when Siri listens manually by holding the Home button down while you speak and releasing it when you’re done — a sort of walkie-talkie interface.\nYou can also now buy albums from within Now Playing, and you can subscribe to iTunes Match directly within iOS 7.1 to eliminate the ads from iTunes Radio.\nLast, but certainly not least, iOS 7.1 includes a variety of security fixes as well.']"

The upgrade’s been in beta for a while, but it officially arrived on Monday.\n\nProbably the most prominent addition in the new version is that of CarPlay, the “iOS in the Car” experience that Apple recently showed off at the Geneva Motor Show. When vehicles that support it become available later this year, CarPlay will provide an easy way to use your iOS device while driving, with support for built-in apps like Phone, Messages, and Maps, along with first- and third-party audio apps. It also features full support for Siri, as well as touchscreens and physical controls.\n\nWhile we’re waiting for CarPlay, however, there are plenty of other iOS 7.1 tweaks to tide us over. Siri now features an alternate control mode: The virtual assistant can now listen as long as you hold down the Home button, and then immediately stop listening when you release it, rather than having to wait until it thinks you’re done. (If you’re fine with the old way, don’t worry: It hasn’t changed.) Those who speak Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese also get some brand new, more natural speaking voices for the assistant.\n\niOS 7’s iTunes Radio feature gets a new search field, so you can more quickly create stations based on a particular song or artist, as well as tighter integration with buying albums from the Now Playing screen (previously, you could just buy songs).\n\nNew interface tweaks for the Phone and Music apps arrive in iOS 7.1, along with additional Accessibility options.\n\nThose who felt frustrated with the radical interface design changes in iOS 7 have some additional recourse in iOS 7. The Reduce Motion option that turned off the OS’s parallax feature now applies to the Weather, Messages, and multitasking interface as well, and enabling Bold Text will now affect the keyboard, calculator, and some icons. Apple’s also added options for displaying button shapes, darkening app colors to provide more contrast, and decreasing the white point for even more contrast.\n\nAnd the company is still continuing to refine the OS’s interface. Several elements of the Phone app have been reworked here, with a rounded icon-based button replacing the traditional Call button, and a brand new answer screen with round interface elements. The power-off screen has been tweaked as well, as have the shuffle and repeat controls in the Music app. If you were hoping for a return to pre-iOS 7 aesthetics, that train has left the station.\n\nThere’s a veritable smorgasbord of other enhancements: Calendar can now show an agenda-style list of events in the monthly view (an iOS 6 feature many missed), and will now specifically display holidays for many different countries; iCloud Keychain is now supported in additional countries; notifications for FaceTime calls will go away if you answer the call elsewhere; and the Camera app now has a setting that will automatically enable HDR on the iPhone 5s.\n\nIf it’s bug fixes you crave, iOS 7.1 has them in spades too. A bug that could cause a crash on the home screen? Gone. Better recognition of your fingerprints for Touch ID? Check. Improved performance on the iPhone 4? You betcha. A patch for problems with the Mail icon’s unread badge showing numbers greater than 10,000? Fixed, but you should probably still clean out your inbox a bit. In our brief time using the update, it also seems notably zippier in terms of performance.\n\nThe iOS 7.1 update is available for download over the air in Software Update. (We expect it will shortly be available via Apple’s support downloads site as well.) Depending on the model of your iPhone, it varies in size, but you’ll likely need a couple free gigabytes in order to install it. It’s compatible with any device running iOS 7 or later.', 'Lest you thought you might be waiting until iOS 8 for a new dose of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 7.1 is here with a bunch of changes, enhancements, and updates.\nWhile we’re waiting for CarPlay, however, there are plenty of other iOS 7.1 tweaks to tide us over.\nNew interface tweaks for the Phone and Music apps arrive in iOS 7.1, along with additional Accessibility options.\nIf it’s bug fixes you crave, iOS 7.1 has them in spades too.\nThe iOS 7.1 update is available for download over the air in Software Update.']"

We have an amazing lineup of auto partners rolling out CarPlay, and we’re thrilled it will make its debut this week in Geneva.”\n\n\n\nApple has led consumer technology integration in the car for more than a decade. CarPlay brings your car and iPhone together for a thoughtful experience that lets drivers focus on driving, while also tapping into everything they want to do with their iPhone.\n\n\n\nOnce iPhone is connected to a vehicle with CarPlay integration, Siri helps you easily access your contacts, make calls, return missed calls or listen to voicemails. When incoming messages or notifications arrive, Siri provides an eyes-free experience by responding to requests through voice commands, by reading drivers’ messages and letting them dictate responses or simply make a call.', 'Current iPhone and iPad users will have an update awaiting them when they login to their favorite devices this afternoon.\nThis marks the first major update that Apple has reeled since the company revamped the UI of it’s devices with iOS 7.\n“CarPlay has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone and iOS Product Marketing.\n“iPhone users always want their content at their fingertips and CarPlay lets drivers use their iPhone in the car with minimized distraction.\nOnce iPhone is connected to a vehicle with CarPlay integration, Siri helps you easily access your contacts, make calls, return missed calls or listen to voicemails.']"

It includes support for CarPlay, fixes the random reboots many users were experiencing, and includes a number of other changes like performance improvements and UI tweaks.\n\nApple first introduced CarPlay back at WWDC last year under the name “iOS in the Car.” Now that it’s here, it allows you to connect your iPhone to a CarPlay-enabled vehicle to get an iOS experience designed for the car. It allows you to make and answer calls, and use Maps, Messages, Music and other third-party audio apps. You control it by voice via Siri, and through your car’s touch display and controls.\n\nApple also fixed the bug that was causing many devices running iOS 7 to randomly reboot from the home screen (my iPhone 5s included). Other improvements include better Touch ID fingerprint recognition, as well as an overall performance boost for the iPhone 4.\n\nThere are some visual changes you’ll notice as well.

The dialer and power screens use new rounded UI elements and the incoming call interface features distinct accept and decline buttons. The delete and shift keys on the keyboard are easier to see across as well.\n\niTunes Radio now lets you search within featured stations to more easily create stations based on an artist or a song you like.

The company streamlined the operating system to make it work better with the iPhone 4, made some user interface refinements, and included some stability and accessibility improvements.\n\nThe update is available immediately, and the Apple devices will alert users about it over the next week.\n\niOS 7.1 marks the first major update following Apple\'s release of iOS 7 about six months ago. Apple initially unveiled iOS 7 at its developer conference in June of last year and released the operating system in September. The software underwent a complete design overhaul, with everything from the typography and color schemes getting an update. iOS 7 also added useful features like automatic updates to make everyday use easier, AirDrop, and iTunes Radio, as well as a new control center that gives quick access to most-used features. Since the introduction of iOS 7, Apple had released five beta updates of iOS 7.1 to developers.\n\nAbout 83 percent of Apple device users have downloaded iOS 7, Apple said. The operating system won\'t run on the original iPad from 2010 and any iPhones older than the iPhone 4.\n\nApple streamlined functions in iOS 7.1 to make the experience faster for iPhone 4 users, which have a much less advanced chip than Apple\'s newest phones and tablets.\n\nScreenshot by Jason Parker/CNET\n\nWith iOS 7, Siri recognized that a user was done talking because the person paused for a couple of seconds. Now, users can hold down the home button the entire time they\'re talking to Siri. Once they lift their finger, Siri knows they\'re done talking. Both ways of interacting are available in iOS 7.1. Apple also included new male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, British English, Australian English, and Japanese.\n\niTunes Radio also got some tweaks. There\'s a new search field that allows users to create stations based on their favorite songs or artists. Users can buy albums with a single tap from iTunes Radio, rather than only buying singles. And for the first time, users can now subscribe to iTunes Match from their mobile devices rather than from the desktop.\n\nIn the calendar month view, users can now toggle to see daily appointments. And the Touch ID fingerprint reader became more accurate with iOS 7.1. There should be fewer false rejections as well as quicker response times in reading fingerprints.\n\niOS 7.1 also includes a camera update that\'s specific to iPhone 5S users. That\'s because the newer phone uses Apple\'s advanced A7 processor while older devices have less-powerful chips. HDR, or ""high dynamic range,"" will automatically turn on when it\'s needed. That takes many photos at once in different exposures to create a sharp image that looks closer to what the human eye sees, as the varying highlights and shadows are all accounted for.\n\nMeanwhile, iOS 7.1 users will be able to take advantage of Car Play, which Apple unveiled last week at the Geneva Motor Show. The feature is a means for an iPhone (5 and newer) to power a touch screen on a new car\'s dashboard. The interface is iOS-like, but vastly simplified compared with what\'s seen on a phone or tablet. Functionality is limited too -- really just letting users access maps and audio, though Siri can read messages and take dictation for responses.\n\nUpdated at 10:40 a.m. PT: with additional details.\n\n\n\n', ""Sarah Tew/CNETApple on Monday released an update to its iOS 7 mobile operating system -- iOS 7.1 -- that adds new features such as CarPlay and fixes bugs.\nWith iOS 7.1, Apple also tweaked its Siri voice assistant, iTunes Radio, and its Touch ID fingerprint sensor.\niOS 7.1 marks the first major update following Apple's release of iOS 7 about six months ago.\nSince the introduction of iOS 7, Apple had released five beta updates of iOS 7.1 to developers.\nAnd the Touch ID fingerprint reader became more accurate with iOS 7.1.""]"

While this is a point release, Apple has made several tweaks to the iOS user interface, alongside the usual bug fixes and some feature additions. The main visual changes can be found in the phone dialer and power off features. iOS 7.1 switches to rounded UI elements in both of these areas, and the incoming call interface now includes separate decline and accept buttons below floating circular icons for the Remind Me and Message options.\n\nOther UI tweaks are fairly minor, including a slight music app refresh with prominent repeat and shuffle icons, and the option to disable wallpaper motion when selecting an image. iOS 7.1 also includes improvements to the keyboard interface, making the shift and delete keys easier to see. Perhaps the best visual tweak in iOS 7.1 is a change to the Notification Center, which appears to allow you to clear notifications more accurately.\n\niOS 7.1 finally fixes the random reboots\n\nAside from the visual tweaks, iOS 7.1 finally includes a fix for something you hopefully won\'t see anymore: random reboots that iPhone 5S, iPad mini with Retina display, and iPad Air users have been experiencing. Apple promised a fix in January, and the issues have existed since the launch of iOS 7, causing some devices running the latest OS to randomly reset for no apparent reason. Some iPhone 5S users have also complained of Touch ID issues, and Apple has tweaked the recognition to make it faster and more accurate in the latest update. If you\'re stuck on an iPhone 4 and you\'ve not yet upgraded, Apple has also optimized iOS 7.1 to run faster on iPhone 4 hardware. The same goes for older iPads, like the iPad 2, and third-generation iPad.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDR auto mode On the iPhone 5S, the camera software will automatically detect if an HDR photo will be a better choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarPlay is the big new feature for iOS 7.1\n\niOS 7.1 also includes support for Apple’s new CarPlay feature. Known previously as iOS in the Car, CarPlay is built primarily around the use of Siri voice commands and prompts, providing an ""eyes-free"" experience where you can respond to incoming calls, dictate text messages, or access your music library from a vehicle. Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo will support CarPlay in some of their new cars at launch, and a broader range of carmakers, including Ford and BMW, are promising to integrate CarPlay with their future in-car entertainment systems.\n\niTunes Radio has also been tweaked in iOS 7.1, allowing you to search within featured stations and more quickly create new stations based on searches for songs and artists. And for the first time, Apple now lets people subscribe to iTunes Match right from their device, instead of in the desktop version of iTunes. This removes the ads in iTunes Radio, and provides a year of Apple\'s scan and match music service.\n\nAnother change in iOS 7.1 is an adjustment to how Siri is triggered. Siri still activates using the home button, but in iOS 7.1 you can hold the home button down to ensure Siri listens for longer and doesn\'t cut off any pauses in your query. This is useful for speaking long items like calendar events. You can also now access Siri using switch controls, a feature designed for accessibility. With these, you can set your iPhone or iPad to track left or right head movement using the camera.\n\nOverall, the changes iOS 7.1 brings are minor, but welcome, additions to an operating system that powers millions of devices. Since releasing iOS 7 back in September, Apple has fixed lock-screen security issues, iMessage problems, FaceTime call drops, and a major security flaw. The latest iOS 7.1 update is available immediately.\n\nJosh Lowensohn contributed to this article', 'The long-awaited iOS 7.1 update is now available.\niOS 7.1 also includes improvements to the keyboard interface, making the shift and delete keys easier to see.\nCarPlay is the big new feature for iOS 7.1iOS 7.1 also includes support for Apple’s new CarPlay feature.\nOverall, the changes iOS 7.1 brings are minor, but welcome, additions to an operating system that powers millions of devices.\nThe latest iOS 7.1 update is available immediately.']"

1809,http://www.minyanville.com/sectors/technology/articles/CarPlay-Not-Perfect-but-Perfect-for/3/10/2014/id/54075,technology,"['One of the more entertaining trends at CES 2014 involved automakers and in-car apps. The auto companies appeared somewhat desperate in their attempts to make new mobile tech features seem relevant and necessary, as essential as the functions we\'ve come to expect from our smartphones. NYSE:F ), for example, unveiled a pizza-delivery app , while Mercedes-Benz talked about taking NASDAQ:FB ) mobile. NYSE:GM ) announced that future cars would come LTE-equipped, and OTCMKTS:AUDVF ) demoed its very own tablet-based entertainment system. Each manufacturer wanted to show off its app store, even if apps themselves were in short supply.To call most of this redundant would be to state the obvious: One hundred and fifty million Americans now own smartphones, which they generally carry with them into the car. More importantly, embedding mobile technology into the car is a recipe for obsolescence. The average automobile on the road is 11 years old ; the average smartphone was bought in the last 12 months. So while your next car might seem pretty clever as you\'re driving it off the lot, rest assured that for the majority of its existence, it will be about as ""smart"" as that tattoo you got in college.The dearth of apps points to yet another problem. Car manufacturers have been reluctant to commit to a software platform -- much less a standard -- and developers appear to have returned the favor by not bothering to port their apps. For example, GM is pushing its own software platform called Connected by OnStar but has hedged its bets by signing onto both Open Automotive Alliance and the Linux-based GENIVI Alliance.Nobody knows what platform next year\'s models will be running, and that makes software development a risky investment. Perhaps this explains why, a year after releasing its software development kit, GM has only 10 apps to show for it.The whole idea of smartcars needs rethinking, and that\'s what makes NASDAQ:AAPL ) CarPlay so interesting. Known during development as ""iOS in the Car,"" Apple did well to rename the product, since CarPlay pulls its functionality from the phone itself rather than loading the iPhone\'s operating system onto the dashboard. At the moment, this requires a wired connection, but OTCMKTS:VOLVY ) has said that a Wi-Fi option is in the works.There are some caveats. CarPlay will enter life as an app in your vehicle\'s existing operating system. How well it gets incorporated -- and the extent to which you can avoid your car manufacturer\'s default interface -- will vary. AnandTech and SlashGear see this as a trade-off , but it also constitutes an advantage. Automakers are more likely to adopt an app than they are a prepackaged operating system, and it\'s no coincidence that, at launch, Apple can already brag of an exhaustive list of CarPlay partners, including Ford, GM, NYSE:TM ),(ETR:BMW),(TY0:7201), and NYSE:HMC ).Mercedes has raised the possibility of adding this service to preexisting models as an aftermarket solution . If so, that\'s good news for software developers, who will need to do some work to make their iOS software CarPlay-compatible. In this case, they\'re immediately guaranteed a large and committed market, and it wouldn\'t be surprising (or difficult) to see Apple develop a quick lead in apps.From Cupertino\'s perspective, the best part about CarPlay may be that no one else is in a position to copy it. Google will have a hard time convincing carmakers to adopt Android wholesale. Too many of them see the dashboard as a piece of branding and a potential revenue stream. On the other hand, Google\'s operating system is so fragmented that it will take years to get something like CarPlay adopted (although this is probably Google\'s best option, given the limitations of cars and the car market).This is a situation where integration pays off. Being both a hardware and software company has hurt Apple in some ways -- closed products tend to guarantee you a minority market share -- but it also allows the company to offer tightly integrated solutions where no one else can. CarPlay is one such opportunity. Mobile payments may be another . Consumers give up variety when they buy into the iPhone\'s 4-inch, three-model universe, but Apple can reward that sacrifice by giving them more varied ways in which to use that iPhone.The difficulty for competitors is that, as pointless as it is to reinvent the smartphone, it would be even more futile to try and reinvent Apple. I suspect that CarPlay will be a big deal. In any event, it\'s nothing to laugh at.', 'NYSE:GM ) announced that future cars would come LTE-equipped, and OTCMKTS:AUDVF ) demoed its very own tablet-based entertainment system.\nThe average automobile on the road is 11 years old ; the average smartphone was bought in the last 12 months.\nKnown during development as ""iOS in the Car,"" Apple did well to rename the product, since CarPlay pulls its functionality from the phone itself rather than loading the iPhone\'s operating system onto the dashboard.\nCarPlay will enter life as an app in your vehicle\'s existing operating system.\nIf so, that\'s good news for software developers, who will need to do some work to make their iOS software CarPlay-compatible.']"

Many of those companies used the show\'s media days to make major product announcements -- including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nApple showed off its new CarPlay system, the production version of the ""iOS in the Car"" initiative that Apple has been talking about for a while now. It\'ll be available very soon in select models from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo -- and in a long list of other makers\' cars starting in a few years.\n\nBut what is CarPlay? As Fool contributor John Rosevear explains in this short video, CarPlay is Apple\'s first big foray into in-car ""infotainment"" -- an arena that is showing signs of becoming the next big tech battleground.\n\nJohn Rosevear: Hey, Fools, it\'s John Rosevear. This past week saw the press days at the Geneva International Motor Show. This is a really important show for the auto industry in Europe and a lot of companies had important product announcements, and one of those companies was Apple.\n\nNo, Apple\'s not going into the auto business -- not yet anyway, but they are getting into the auto ""infotainment"" system business. Apple fans have heard the company talk about a system called ""iOS in the Car"" for a while now, but now here\'s the actual product. It\'s called CarPlay. Apple has positioned this as a ""smarter, safer, and more fun way to use iPhone in the car."" It does exactly what you\'d expect. It gives you a way to use your voice and some simple controls mounted on the car\'s steering wheel to do pretty much everything you might want to do with your iPhone while you drive.\n\nThis is coming soon from a few automakers, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo showed off models that will incorporate CarPlay this past week in Geneva, and there\'s a long list of other automakers that will be rolling it out over the next few years.\n\nInterestingly, one of the automakers that\'s not on that list is Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA). We\'ve heard all sorts of rumors about some sort of Apple-Tesla tie-up recently, but apparently this isn\'t going to be part of that, and my guess is that\'s because Tesla may have committed itself to Android, to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is working on a rival system.\n\nThe difference, though, is that Google is offering more of a platform, an Android-based platform for the whole in-car infotainment system, whereas Apple\'s CarPlay appears to be just functionality specific to integrating the driver\'s iPhone. But what\'s interesting is that a BlackBerry news site called N4BB says that it has confirmed that CarPlay runs on top of something called QNX, which is an in-car operating system developed by a company owned by BlackBerry.\n\nQNX is used by many automakers to power their infotainment systems. Its main rival is a Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) system. Now, that Microsoft system is what underpins Ford\'s (NYSE:F) SYNC and MyFord Touch systems, these are very prominent and as Ford owners and shareholders know, MyFord Touch has been very problematic and there were reports a few weeks ago that Ford would move the system to QNX in a couple of years, though Ford has said that they have no comment on those reports but they continue to work with Microsoft.\n\nNow, Ford is listed among the companies that will be rolling out Apple\'s CarPlay at some point in the future. Does that mean that Ford really is moving to QNX, or does it mean that CarPlay also works on this Microsoft in-car operating system? Whatever. It apparently means that Apple, BlackBerry, and maybe Microsoft are all working together here. Stranger things have certainly happened. Meanwhile, if you have an iPhone and you want to use it in your car, it looks like that\'s going to get easier over the next few years.\n\nThanks for watching, and Fool on.', 'Many of those companies used the show\'s media days to make major product announcements -- including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nApple showed off its new CarPlay system, the production version of the ""iOS in the Car"" initiative that Apple has been talking about for a while now.\nNo, Apple\'s not going into the auto business -- not yet anyway, but they are getting into the auto ""infotainment"" system business.\nApple fans have heard the company talk about a system called ""iOS in the Car"" for a while now, but now here\'s the actual product.\nApple has positioned this as a ""smarter, safer, and more fun way to use iPhone in the car.""']"

The fingerprint recognition ability of the device has started to become less accurate with the older registration data. Hence, the fix was required.

The feature, formerly known as iOS in the Car and announced at the 2013 WWDC last June, is both very Apple-like and very un-Apple-like in its approach. And by not bringing anything particularly new and ground-breaking to the somewhat chaotic auto infotainment space, CarPlay is also underwhelming.\n\nFirst, the details: CarPlay is an iPhone-specific feature that automakers can incorporate to allow drivers to make calls, access messages, use Maps for navigation, and listen to music on a compatible connected Apple device. In a press release, Apple said drivers will do this ""with just a word or a touch,"" meaning that access to CarPlay is via a vehicle\'s in-dash touchscreen, or using Siri through a car\'s existing voice recognition button.\n\nCarPlay debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in vehicles from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo. (I shot a demo video in Volvo\'s Estate concept, which you can see above). Apple also said CarPlay will ""be available in select cars shipping in 2014"" from BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki, and Toyota. CarPlay will only work with the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5, or devices that use the latest Lightning connector. The feature will be available as an update to iOS 7, and pricing is not yet available.\n\nCarPlay is Apple-like in that it\'s an extension of the company\'s walled garden approach into the dashboard. This brings familiarity to iPhone owners since the UI of their device is replicated on a car\'s in-dash screen, and comfort to automakers seeking an intuitive interface – and less customer complaints.\n\nAndrew Poliack, director of automotive business development at QNX Software Systems, which provides the behind-the-dash processing for CarPlay, noted that since the feature works with a car\'s infotainment system in ""display mode,"" the response time will be faster than with similar existing iPhone-integration schemes like, say, BMW\'s ConnectedDrive, as well as other such systems that are device agnostic.\n\nPoliack also pointed out that CarPlay will be more easily updateable than embedded infotainment systems as new software and apps become available, since these will come through the device. At launch, CarPlay will only support ""select third-party audio apps including Spotify and iHeartRadio,"" although Apple promised that more apps are on the way.\n\nLess impressive than it appears\n\nBut the company hasn\'t indicated whether it will open up CarPlay to third-party developers the way Ford and General Motors have with their app platforms in order to spur innovation. This is very un-Apple-like since the company practically invented the app concept and provided a platform for developers, although the car is a very different and highly regulated environment.\n\nWhat\'s more un-Apple-like is that the company\'s traditional approach with an incipient product category like connected car (think music players and smartphones) has been to unleash class-leading innovation and cutting-edge design not previously available from others in the space. The only thing new about CarPlay is that it integrates Maps navigation with your emails, messages, and contacts to provide what Apple calls personalised routing and traffic info. Everything else – phone connectivity, messaging, navigation, and music – is already available in various forms in a variety of vehicles. And while some of these are good and some are not so good, and they could all use improvement and more interoperability among different devices, you don\'t have to own an iPhone to use them.\n\nNo doubt CarPlay will appeal to iPhone owners and to automakers desperately seeking a smartphone integration solution that new car buyers won\'t curse, although the feature is useless to drivers using Android or other devices. But it also represents a further fracturing in car infotainment vis-à-vis portable device integration. With its Open Automotive Alliance, Google is also going its own way and, like Apple, making a play for the potentially lucrative connected car market. Meanwhile, the Car Connectivity Consortium with its MirrorLink standard and others like Livio Connect (which was recently acquired by Ford) are trying to establish a device agnostic approach to automotive-based smartphone integration.\n\nWe shouldn\'t expect Apple to be concerned with integrating devices it didn\'t create into the dashboard, or to take a more open approach to automotive infotainment. But even within its walled garden, we\'ve come to expect Apple to think differently when it enters a new product category. And it\'s very un-Apple-like to come to market with a me-too product.\n\nFor more on CarPlay, see our closer look at how Apple\'s CarPlay works, and its potential impact on in-car Android.', ""With the introduction of CarPlay this week at the Geneva Motor Show, Apple's has unveiled its initial game plan for moving into automotive infotainment.\nAnd by not bringing anything particularly new and ground-breaking to the somewhat chaotic auto infotainment space, CarPlay is also underwhelming.\nCarPlay will only work with the iPhone 5S, iPhone 5C and iPhone 5, or devices that use the latest Lightning connector.\nBut it also represents a further fracturing in car infotainment vis-à-vis portable device integration.\nFor more on CarPlay, see our closer look at how Apple's CarPlay works, and its potential impact on in-car Android.""]"

Its 2014 story is likely to revolve around the iPhones and newer products. But most of its upcoming products are designed to make the iPhone and iPad more useful. So, there is a distinct possibility that the tech giant may fail to impress investors, who are eagerly waiting for a revolutionary new product, says Ansuya Harjani of CNBC.\n\nBarclays analyst Ben Reitzes recently said in a research note that Wall Street is excited about some products in the pipeline such as geo-location, wearable devices, an improved Apple TV and mobile payments. But nothing, including the TV with motion sensors, seems to be as revolutionary as the iPhone or iPad. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched CarPlay earlier this week, which will allow drivers to integrate the car entertainment system with their iPhone. Though it’s a good move, it’s not sufficient to re-accelerate the iPhone sales growth to sustainable levels.\n\nJune quarter could be tough for Apple\n\nSizemore Capital Management chief Charles Sizemore says that the newer products like CarPlay are interesting. But, in reality, they are just new apps for the existing iPhone. The same holds true for the highly-anticipated iWatch. These initiatives could help Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), but are unlikely to make a huge impact on sales. The next iteration of the iPhone is unlikely to be released before September this year. That’s why Barclays believes that June quarter could be a really tough one for the tech giant.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rivals continue to release new products, which may prompt consumers to shift away from Apple in the near term. The iPhone 6 is anticipated to have a faster processor, a bigger screen and a more durable glass. But the incremental improvements are unlikely to energize customers like the original iPhone did. Moreover, as the Cupertino-based company adds advanced new features to its devices at a similar price point, its margins are likely to suffer. Apple’s smartphone and tablet market share has been contracting since late 2012. According to IDC, the company had only 15.3% smartphone market share in 2013, compared to 31.3% for Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (LON:BC94) (KRX:005930).\n\nApple needs to get better at web services\n\nCharles Sizemore says that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock is widely owned. There aren’t enough new buyers to push up the stock sharply. The stock is trading at a massive discount to the S&P 500, and expectations are low. But Sizemore says that the tech giant seems to have lost its ‘wow’ factor. As far as long-term prospects are concerned, Barclays analyst says that the next era of technology will belong to those companies with a dominant position in web services. And devices are likely to lose their importance in coming years. Apple has been the leader in hardware development. But Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has build solid Internet services such as messaging, email, online maps and cloud. Apple needs to get better at web services because these services are important to keep the ecosystem ahead of others.\n\nApple Inc.

Tough quarter ahead? Barclays says with no major product launches until the second-half, the June quarter could be a tough one for Apple. ""We believe the smartphone market could start to shift away from Apple in the very near term given new product launches from competitors and a lack of new products until the second half of 2014,"" the bank said. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 6 in the second half of this year, with features such as a larger screen, more durable glass and a faster processor. However, the incremental improvements to its products are unlikely to be enough to reenergize its customer base the same way the original iPhone did in 2007, the bank said. Additionally, the company\'s margins may come under pressure as it adds advanced new features to new iPhones at similar price point. ""It seems very hard for hardware vendors to sustain competitive advantages for any meaningful length of time,"" the bank said. (Read more: Will you be driving an iCar soon?)\n\nSince refreshing its iPhone and tablet lines in the second half of 2012, Apple has experienced a contraction in its market share for both - a continued worry for investors.

Barclays downgraded its recommendation on Apple to neutral from overweight towards the end of February, with a 12-month price target of $570.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed its CarPlay feature, the company said it would include support for just four third-party apps—Spotify, Stitcher, Beats Music and iHeartRadio—at some point this year. Of course Apple will also support all of its apps, including iTunes Radio and Apple Maps. But will the company allow Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), the king of maps, to make an app for the CarPlay platform? That’s certainly a good question.\n\nApple still faces off with Google\n\nGoogle Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Maps were once on iOS products, but then Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) pulled them and replaced them with its own maps. That was a disaster because of all the problems with the app, and many iPhone users switched back to Google by downloading Google’s separate app onto their iPhones.\n\nMashable‘s Karissa Bell believes that more third-party developer apps will make their way onto the CarPlay platform, but of course there’s no way to know if Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s maps will make it on there. There is certainly a chance that it could happen, but users will probably have to accept less functionality than with Apple Maps because of course Siri is integrated with Apple Maps in the iPhone. We wouldn’t expect anything less in CarPlay\n\nGoogle already beats Apple in cars\n\nBut Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) really doesn’t have anything to worry about from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in terms of putting its operating system in cars. The search giant is already ahead of Apple in this respect. More than six of the world’s top automakers, including Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) (TYO:7203), Mercedes and others, already have Google Maps APIs or some other form of the search giant’s GPS services inside their vehicles.\n\nCurrently Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only one which uses Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s Maps for turn-by-turn directions. However, Hyundai and Kia both have the Google Places API integrated into their cars. That API uses the same database as Google Maps. Hyundai, Kia, BMW and Toyota all utilize Google’s Send to Car feature, enabling drivers to search Google Maps for directions and send them to the navigation system inside their cars.\n\nGoogle could have more in store for cars\n\nWe may learn more about what Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has planned for cars at its I/O conference in June. The search giant already announced that it was partnering with General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Hyundai and Audi to put its Android operating system in cars. Since Apple Inc.

While iOS 7.1 – also released this week – still has you need to keep several icons in your folders or on home screens, here Apple TV makes clear they’re OK with you pushing some of your lesser-needed icons down or aside.\n\nUnfortunately it would appear that, similar to iOS, you still won’t be able to get rid of icons for apps you don’t use completely. This update to Apple TV brings the system up to version 6.1, allowing you to re-arrange your icons as you see fit. So you can place Netflix right up top and Flickr right at the bottom, or TV Shows right at the bottom and Music up top. Whatever floats your boat.\n\nThis new option goes by the name of “Arrange Main Menu Items”, and it’s accessible by pressing and holding an icon until the icon “jiggles.” This is similar to how you re-arrange icons in iOS, if you did not know. From there you’ll be able to press your controller’s directional buttons to move the icon. You’ll also be able to press Play or Pause for additional options.\n\nFar from a change that would signal any new hardware release, this software update simply suggests Apple isn’t always about ground-breaking change. It’s just a little clutter re-arranger, that’s all.

Many predicted it would land this last week ahead of an update to Apple’s iTunes Festival update. But that update came and went and still no update for iOS 7. Currently developers are on iOS 7.1 beta 5, and if you haven’t heard of all the crazy great new features…. it is because there aren’t any, just minor tweaks and enhancements.\n\nMany developers of publishing apps continue to deal with bugs in their apps following the release of iOS 7 back in the fall. This weekend a number of media app updates were released, though none dramatically changed their apps.\n\nPublishSoSimply, which is one of a number of apps that attempt to get others to create content for their own app – think Flipboard, Zite, etc. – updated its stand-alone app. The concept is that you won’t mind your new digital magazine being buried inside their app, and the company monetizing your efforts, because there is no cost for building the digital magazine. But the concept does not appear to be catching on with either citizen or professional publishers, based on the lack of digital magazines to be found inside the app – most were created by the company themselves, though to be fair, the app has only been around since early November of last year.\n\nPressPad, another company with Polish roots, has been updating the apps using its platform, including this weekend, its own Digital Publishing Guide app. The app is the company’s own digital magazine created for marketing purposes. The update fixes issues with push notifications.\n\nImagine Publishing has been issuing updates for its Newsstand apps, including for Apps Magazine. The updates are designed to fix bugs in their replica edition apps, but the problem the publisher is having with the apps is fairly minor compared to the app strategy overall. Many of their magazines involve technology – apps, software, etc. – and so would be read by tech savvy readers. But their apps are not very tech savvy at all and so probably does their brands more harm than good.\n\nOne UK publisher that produces both native and replica editions is Future plc – which, of course, uses its own FutureFolio digital publishing platform. One of the apps they have updated is their own annual report. Future plc Annual Report is, as you would guess, a native app that reproduces the company’s earnings report in digital magazine format – a totally logical thing to do for a publisher demonstrating their digital chops.\n\nThe update, though, is a bit of a mystery as it simply reproduces the same language in the app description as the previous update. Future’s fiscal year ended at the end of September so there doesn’t appear to be any new information inside the app. In any case, the app download is free so it is worth checking out if you are a digital publisher or a brand thinking of producing an annual report in digital form.\n\nThe Columbia Journalism Review’s Newsstand app also was updated. It appears under the Magzter account name and is, like the other magazines using the platform, a replica edition. The update is part of a series of updated being issued by Magzter that bring in bookmarks and update the interface.', 'Many developers of publishing apps continue to deal with bugs in their apps following the release of iOS 7 back in the fall.\nThe concept is that you won’t mind your new digital magazine being buried inside their app, and the company monetizing your efforts, because there is no cost for building the digital magazine.\nPressPad, another company with Polish roots, has been updating the apps using its platform, including this weekend, its own Digital Publishing Guide app.\nImagine Publishing has been issuing updates for its Newsstand apps, including for Apps Magazine.\nOne UK publisher that produces both native and replica editions is Future plc – which, of course, uses its own FutureFolio digital publishing platform.']"

The national average price at the pump rose to $3.48 per gallon Friday, three cents higher than a week ago, 21 cents more than one month ago, however 24 cents below the same date last year.\n\nThe national average has increased for 28 (through Friday) straight days – the longest streak since a 36-day stretch of steadily rising prices over January and February of last year. On Feb. 21 this year, the national average was 39 cents less than on Feb. 21, 2013. That year-over-year gap has narrowed by 15 cents over the last two weeks. Last year the national average peaked at $3.79 on February 27, the earliest peak on record.\n\nRapidly escalating tensions in Ukraine have been the major story for the oil markets this week. At 10.4 million barrels per day, russia is the third largest oil-producing country after Saudi Arabia (11.7 million barrels per day) and the United States (11.1 million barrels per day), according to the most recent Energy Information Administration data. Although there have been no disruptions to global supplies yet, any further escalation of hostilities could propel global oil prices higher, which has the potential to magnify the seasonal price increases at the pump. Earlier in this week, crude oil prices spiked over the rising tensions between russia and Ukraine, settling close to the $105 per barrel mark, the highest settlement price in five months. However, as the week progressed and russia softened its rhetoric, crude oil prices eased back close to the $100 per barrel mark. Crude oil settled at $102.58, virtually unchanged on the week.\n\nIn its weekly report, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) noted that U.S. crude oil stocks rose 1.4 million barrels to 363.8 million barrels. Gasoline stocks dropped 1.63 million barrels to 229 million barrels. According to the EIA data, gasoline demand dropped 124,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 8.411 million bpd, however the weekly demand figure remains above the four week average of 8.325 bpd.\n\n“AAA expects gas prices to increase 10 to 20 cents more this spring before falling after Memorial Day, barring any unexpected market-moving events,” said Martha M. Meade, Manager of Public and Government Affairs for AAA Mid-Atlantic. “However, the intensifying situation with russia and Ukraine could constitute such an event. Further escalation, including any disruption to global supply, could propel global oil prices higher, which has the potential to magnify the seasonal price increase at the pump.”\n\nLast year the national average peaked at $3.79 on February 27, the earliest pre-summer peak on record. Gas prices are expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks due to seasonal refinery maintenance, which means the year-over-year discount will narrow further; however the national price at the pump is unlikely to surpass last year’s high and AAA expects it to peak between $3.55 – 3.75, barring any unexpected market moving events. The rapidly escalating geopolitical tensions with russia and Ukraine could constitute such an event should global oil supply be impacted.\n\nCURRENT AND PAST GAS PRICE AVERAGES\n\nRegular Unleaded Gasoline (*indicates record high)\n\n3/9/14 Week Ago Year Ago National $3.49 $3.46 $3.70 Virginia $3.27 $3.25 $3.62 Charlottesville $3.24 $3.22 $3.59 Norfolk Area $3.28 $3.25 $3.55 Richmond $3.25 $3.24 $3.57 Roanoke $3.23 $3.23 $3.53 Crude Oil $102.58 per barrel (at Friday’s close) $102.59 per barrel (2/28/14) $91.56 per barrel (3/7/13)\n\nRelated\n\nComments"", 'AAA: Gas prices spring forwardPublished Monday, Mar.\nLast year the national average peaked at $3.79 on February 27, the earliest peak on record.\nAt 10.4 million barrels per day, russia is the third largest oil-producing country after Saudi Arabia (11.7 million barrels per day) and the United States (11.1 million barrels per day), according to the most recent Energy Information Administration data.\nIn its weekly report, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) noted that U.S. crude oil stocks rose 1.4 million barrels to 363.8 million barrels.\nGasoline stocks dropped 1.63 million barrels to 229 million barrels.']"

1940,"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-southwest-snowden-20140311,0,4407078.story",technology,"['AUSTIN, Texas — Edward Snowden brought no bombshells when he arrived to an excited round of applause Monday, his stubbled face relaxed as it was beamed in from across the continents for a “virtual conversation” about the vulnerability of personal data. His presence was event enough.\n\nPublic appearances by the former National Security Agency contractor and U.S. exile are rare, and this one was beamed in from an undisclosed location in Russia via several online proxies for his own security, a bit of technological cloak-and-dagger that could only add to his mystique for the three roomfuls of international tech specialists struggling to hear his words in video that was choppy and often inaudible.\n\nHis message still got through: Personal information is vulnerable not only to government prying but to growing numbers of outside infiltrators because companies have failed to adequately protect the data of their customers. His own exile after leaking to reporters secret information he had gathered while an NSA consultant has made him a central figure in that conversation, and he says he has no regrets.\n\n“Would I do it again? Absolutely,” Snowden said into the camera, in response to one of several questions submitted to him via Twitter (#AskSnowden) and screened backstage at the South by Southwest Interactive conference. “I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. And I saw the Constitution was being violated on a massive scale.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe warned, “If we allow the NSA to continue unrestrained, every other government will accept that as a green light to do the same.”\n\nThe chosen Twitter questions were notably nonconfrontational for a figure often the subject of heated debate even among supporters. One asked whether the mass surveillance was driven by privatization. Another wondered about the potential for society to “reap benefits” from the “big data.” None asked about his life in Russia, or what further revelations might be coming.\n\nThe first question came from Timothy John Berners-Lee, a British scientist known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, who asked Snowden how he would create an accountability system for governance.\n\n“We have an oversight model that could work. The problem is when the overseers are not interested in oversight,” Snowden said. “The key factor is accountability.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnstage in Austin, lawyer Ben Wizner and ACLU principal technologist Chris Soghoian conversed with Snowden as he appeared on a big screen, an image of the U.S. Constitution superimposed behind him. The three agreed that an easier means for citizens to encrypt their data was a pressing need.\n\n“Most regular people are not going to download an obscure encryption app,” Soghoian said. He also noted that “without Ed’s disclosures, a lot of tech companies would not have improved cybersecurity.”\n\nSnowden said, “We need to think of encryption not as a dark art,” and warned that the NSA was “setting fire to the future of the Internet. And the people in this room, you guys, are the firefighters.”\n\nFor his audience, Snowden’s choice of the SXSW conference to directly address his peers in data technology was easy to understand.\n\n“You have people from every major media company, every major brand, every major agency,” Ryan Kite, a director of digital strategy for Los Angeles-based marketing agency TVGla, said after Snowden’s hourlong talk. “Where else would you get a message like that out there to people who actually move and control the data?\n\n“He was insightful,” Kite added. “He made me think about privacy versus functionality. He was a good predictor about what’s happening. We have a choice — which path do we go down? Do we go down that path of free and easy with no liberty and complete openness to all of our data? Or do we switch and take preventative measures and secure everything?”\n\nWhile not as excited a crowd as that gathered this week to hear Lena Dunham’s keynote speech at the SXSW Film conference — that line was much longer — Snowden’s audience was a nearly full house of 3,000. Tech registrants steadily entered the hall to hushed electronic music. In front of the stage, an artist drew a running comic on the issues being discussed.\n\nHans Meier, a teacher of interactive design at Oslo School of Architecture and Design in Norway, said Snowden seemed “like a sympathetic person. Maybe not as a leader. What he’s done is such a breakthrough thing, and he’s got so many enemies, so for him there will always be this buzz whenever he comes on. But he’s broken ground for a lot of other people to speak out. He’s made these companies actually tighten up the security.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSnowden has kept a low profile of late — he faces felony charges of espionage and theft of government property — and has said he won’t return until the United States changes its whistle-blower protection laws.\n\nAtty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. has taken a strong stand against granting amnesty to Snowden, saying he caused harm to national security and should be held accountable. Holder has described him as a defendant, not a whistle-blower.\n\nBarton Gellman, a Washington Post reporter who has worked with Snowden, released a video of his own ahead of Snowden’s appearance. He said Snowden wanted to speak with “the people who are building and creating the next generation of the Internet” because “technologists” are “a group he wants to influence.”\n\n“He’s looking for places where there can be reform” to “practices that he regards as overbroad and overly intrusive,” Gellman said.\n\nsteve.appleford@latimes.com\n\nTimes staff writer Molly Hennessy-Fiske in Houston contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n', 'AUSTIN, Texas — Edward Snowden brought no bombshells when he arrived to an excited round of applause Monday, his stubbled face relaxed as it was beamed in from across the continents for a “virtual conversation” about the vulnerability of personal data.\nThe three agreed that an easier means for citizens to encrypt their data was a pressing need.\n“Where else would you get a message like that out there to people who actually move and control the data?\nDo we go down that path of free and easy with no liberty and complete openness to all of our data?\nBarton Gellman, a Washington Post reporter who has worked with Snowden, released a video of his own ahead of Snowden’s appearance.']"
