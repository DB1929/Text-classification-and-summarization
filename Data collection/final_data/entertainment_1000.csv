Over the course of six hours, fewer than 20 people at the New Orlando Gun Show asked for a free autograph or photo with Trayvon Martin’s reclusive killer, who was hanging out in a rear office of The Arms Room gun store in Orlando. A sign directs people to the Zimmerman meet-and-greet, where fewer than 20 people asked for an autograph or photo over the course of six hours. One couple who met the former neighborhood watchman and wanna-be cop, who gave their names as Melissa and Matt, said they were the only people waiting in line to meet him. …. “He seemed nervous and actually a little scared to be there. He also appeared emotional, like he was really thankful and touched that people would come out to see him,” said Melissa. “It was pretty weird to meet him in person — and wow, he has gained a lot of weight!”\n\nZimmerman has been doing everything that he can think of to build on the infamy that he gained from killing Trayvon Martin. Public outrage forced the cancelation of the celebrity boxing match that Zimmerman was scheduled to participate in. Almost no one showed up at his autograph signing. The message being sent is clear. Society is not going to let George Zimmerman build a career out of being famous for killing an unarmed teenager.\n\nMost people if they were involved in an incident where they took the life of another human being would have the decency to express remorse. Most people would keep a low profile. Only the most sociopathic of individuals would look to take advantage of their notoriety. George Zimmerman is a killer without a conscience. He isn’t content with beating a murder charge.\n\nZimmerman expects to be treated like a hero. He is desperately trying to cash in on the innocent life that he took. The good news is that America isn’t going to give George Zimmerman the wealth and fame that he so desperately craves.\n\nGeorge Zimmerman wants to be praised and worshipped so badly that he was supposed to be a paying vendor at the gun show. He was going to give away autographs because according to the show’s organizer, he wanted to do an event with less negativity around him.\n\nWhat a fitting blow to this killer’s ego that so few people want his autograph.\n\nZimmerman is not a hero, or a victim, he is a cold blooded killer who deserves every failure that comes his way.', 'George Zimmerman is still trying and failing to cash in on shooting Trayvon Martin.\nVideo of Zimmerman signing autographs:According to The New York Daily News:Only a few handfuls of people showed up Saturday to meet a Florida gun show’s special guest of dishonor — George Zimmerman.\nSociety is not going to let George Zimmerman build a career out of being famous for killing an unarmed teenager.\nThe good news is that America isn’t going to give George Zimmerman the wealth and fame that he so desperately craves.\nGeorge Zimmerman wants to be praised and worshipped so badly that he was supposed to be a paying vendor at the gun show.']"

Not quite as well as the planners probably hoped. It kind of makes you wonder, with friends like Zimmerman, does the gun industry really need any enemies?\n\nApparently the backlash almost forced organizers to cancel Zimmerman\'s appearance. Instead, they moved it to a smaller venue. And when that happens, you know your honored guest is actually more of a liability. I mean, however you feel about the Trayvon Martin case, I can\'t imagine very many people consider Zimmerman much of a hero.\n\nThe event was supposed to raise funds for a local dog shelter, Zimmerman says. (Wha--??) About 200 people showed up. I guess that means there are 200 people in Florida and its environs who like Zimmerman enough to show up for his autograph. I\'m a little worried about those 200 people. I hope they have other, more worthy heroes.\n\nZimmerman also says he\'s still carrying a gun and wearing a bullet-proof vest for safety. But not for his own personal safety! He\'s thinking about the people around him.\n\nI walk around armed; I walk around with a bullet proof vest; it\'s not so much for my safety as it is so much for those around me. I can be around my family and something might happen to them. There\'s children around me, etc. Those threats… I have to be able to defend myself like any American.\n\nRight, if there\'s one thing that will protect the children who stand near Zimmerman, it\'s a bullet-proof vest around Zimmerman\'s body. There are so many children around Zimmerman, living in fear for their lives. Thank goodness Zimmerman is protecting them. With his bullet-proof vest.\n\nDid I mention he still doesn\'t understand why people are still so mad at him? ""No I don\'t, but I\'m willing to talk to everyone and try and answer their concerns or questions, and [have] them realize there\'s no need to be angry."" Okay, sure George. We should sit down for some coffee and crazy pills and talk about why there\'s ABSOLUTELY no reason for anyone to be angry with you. Sure.\n\nThere\'s another part in the interview where Zimmerman talks about the portrait of State Attorney Angela Corey. And you know what? I give up. There is too much George Zimmerman in George Zimmerman.\n\nHonestly, we could spend all day talking about the loony/dumb things Zimmerman says. The point is, I have no idea why anyone in the gun industry would want him anywhere near their event. He doesn\'t make gun ownership look good -- at all. When is he going away, finally?\n\nFOX 35 News Orlando\n\nDo you think George Zimmerman is a good spokesman for anything, or should he just stay under the radar?\n\nImage via Fox 35', ""George Zimmerman signed autographs at the New Orlando Gun Show.\nZimmerman also says he's still carrying a gun and wearing a bullet-proof vest for safety.\nRight, if there's one thing that will protect the children who stand near Zimmerman, it's a bullet-proof vest around Zimmerman's body.\nThere is too much George Zimmerman in George Zimmerman.\nFOX 35 News OrlandoDo you think George Zimmerman is a good spokesman for anything, or should he just stay under the radar?""]"

The trailer is nicknamed Vengeance and features a series of characters speaking about justice and avenging the deaths of lost loved ones. What are the clues we can gather about the story-lines in Season 4? And who will be going after who?\n\nThe trailer begins with Arya Stark relaying a list of characters she harbors a death vendetta against. We already know she harbors a grudge against Cercei and Geoffrey Lanister, but she\'s now added the names of Tywin, Cercei\'s father, and the ""Red Woman"" otherwise known as Melisandre. How does her new companion, the Hound, relate to her quest to annihilate his former masters?\n\nWe know all of the Stark family is seeking revenge for the brutal scourge of their bloodline acted out in the last three seasons. So few remain, and it seems unlikely there will be any justice for their family\'s plight. Sansa speaks to Tyrion about being haunted by her family\'s death. Jon Snow expresses some desire for justice, although it\'s not made clear whether it will be against the murderers of Robb Stark or attempted mutineers in the army of Mormont.\n\nDaenarys Targeres still wants justice for the great outrage of her family members exile after their father was dethroned. As she is of the original bloodline that sat on the iron throne, she is thirstily building a more and more impressive army to take over Westeros. Appatrently, she also has a jumbo-sized dragon now. But besides all that, there is a clip where a man talks to her about repaying injustice with mercy, intercut with scenes of the siege of a city. What is the specific injustice they are talking about?\n\nThe Red Viper is a new character in this season and makes appearance here alongside Cercei. He himself talks about vengeance to her. He is also seen fighting in an arena. It appears that he has aligned himself with the Lannisters fully. But what are his motives and what does he hope to achieve? Fans of the book say that it will be hard to know what the reasons behind his actions are and what he will wind up doing next.\n\nIf you\'d like to view the trailer in its entirety, you may do so here (WARNING: Link may contain strong content).\n\nThe new season of Game of Thrones is scheduled to premiere April 6th on HBO.', 'Game of Thrones Season 4 Spoilers, Rumors and News: Trailer Video Sparks Question, \'Who Will Get Vengeance?\'\nLouis Kahn Mar 10, 2014 10:22 PM EDTThe new trailer for ""Game of Thrones"" Season 4 has been released.\nThe trailer is nicknamed Vengeance and features a series of characters speaking about justice and avenging the deaths of lost loved ones.\nThe trailer begins with Arya Stark relaying a list of characters she harbors a death vendetta against.\nThe new season of Game of Thrones is scheduled to premiere April 6th on HBO.']"

But it raises another question. Who has the scheming Cersei been unable to protect? Up until now, she’s been someone that other characters needed protection from.\n\nTywin Lannister is sitting on the Iron Throne. What’s that all about? The Lannister patriarch always functioned best as the power behind the throne and never showed any desire to hold the title of king.

But is he no longer even a figurehead? Do tell, Tywin?\n\nDaenerys Targaryen has really big dragons. The Game of Thrones trailer wraps up with a shot of one of her pets — or children as the case may be — rising up and spreading its wings. And those are some wings. The kids sure have grown since the last time we saw them.\n\nThe Red Viper is here to help. Cersei Lannister is seen in the trailer confiding in this new character, Oberyn Martell.

The new Game of Thrones Season 4 trailer opens on a fairly melancholy tone, as Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) bitterly recounts the horrors that have been visited upon her and her family.\n\nUnfortunately for her but fortunately for us, the rest of the promo — along with some newly released plot synopses — suggest that Westeros’ troubles are far from over. Watch the Game of Thrones Season 4 trailer and get some new plot details after the jump.\n\nFirst, here’s the promo, which features some juicy new footage.\n\nAnd here’s the synopsis for the season as a whole (via Winter Is Coming).\n\nEncouraged by the Red Wedding slaughter in the Riverlands that wiped out many of their Stark nemeses, the Lannisters’ hold on the Iron Throne remains intact … but can they survive their own egos, as well as new and ongoing threats from the south, north and east? While an unbowed Stannis Baratheon continues to rebuild his army in Dragonstone, a more immediate danger comes from the south, as Oberyn Martell, the Lannister-loathing “Red Viper of Dorne,” arrives at King’s Landing to attend Joffrey’s wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and perhaps act on an ulterior agenda. In the north, a depleted Night’s Watch seems overmatched against the inexorable Wall advances of Mance Rayder’s army of wildlings, which in turn is being trailed by an even more formidable foe: the undead White Walkers. As if that weren’t enough, Daenerys Targaryen, accompanied by her menacing trio of dragons and army of Unsullied, is poised to liberate Meereen, the largest city in Slaver’s Bay, which could ultimately provide her with enough ships to sail to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne.\n\nHBO has also released shorter synopses for the first four episodes:\n\nEpisode #31: “Two Swords”\n\nDebut: SUNDAY, APRIL 6 (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET/PT)\n\nTyrion (Peter Dinklage) welcomes a guest to King’s Landing.

Episode #32: “The Lion and the Rose”\n\nDebut: SUNDAY, APRIL 13 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)\n\nTyrion lends Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a hand. Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and Margaery (Natalie Dormer) host a breakfast. At Dragonstone, Stannis (Stephen Dillane) loses patience with Davos (Liam Cunningham). Ramsay (Iwan Rheon) finds a purpose for his pet. North of the Wall, Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) sees where they must go.\n\nWritten by George R.R. Martin; directed by Alex Graves. Episode #33: “Breaker of Chains”\n\nDebut: SUNDAY, APRIL 20 (9:00-10:00 p.m.)\n\nTyrion ponders his options. Tywin (Charles Dance) extends an olive branch. Sam (John Bradley) realizes Castle Black isn’t safe, and Jon proposes a bold plan. The Hound (Rory McCann) teaches Arya the way things are. Dany chooses her champion.\n\nWritten by David Benioff & D.

Just recently, David Benioff and his team released a dark trailer that surprisingly revealed more information about the upcoming season than we had ever anticipated.\n\nThe clip began with a scene between Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) and Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) as she opens up about the death of her family members.\n\n“You know what they did to my brother and my mother,” she said referring to the bloody Red Wedding where Catelyn and Robb were unexpectedly murdered. Ironically, it’s Tyrion’s family who was behind the massacre. Tywin gave Lord Walder Frey his word that if he was to deceive the Starks after breaking bread (guest right) that he would protect the treacherous royal.\n\n“I lie awake all night thinking about how they died,” she continued. Tyrion looked empathetic as he listened to Sansa pour her heart out. But don’t expect Turner’s character to bawl her eyes out during Season 4. According to the “GoT” actress, Sansa will be cracking skulls and taking names in the upcoming season.\n\n“There’s a kind of a big evolution [for Sansa in Season 4],” Turner told Wet Paint about the development of her character. “She begins to kind of manipulate the people who have done wrong to her in her past. She becomes a good powerhouse character but in a very subtle way. It’s really good.”\n\n""I feel like I\'ve been waiting for a moment where I can manipulate the people that have come before me, so it was like I had been waiting for it for so long. It was a release,” Turner said.\n\nBut Sansa won’t be the only female character from “Game of Thrones” to be sharpening her sword. According to the promo, Cersei Baratheon (Lena Headey) will also be preparing for vengeance.\n\n“What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?” Cersei says. “We can avenge them,” she’s told.\n\nJon Snow (Kit Harington) then makes his way into the trailer on horseback.\n\n“All that time I was gone the world’s fallen apart,” he said. He’s right, things have gotten a bit crazy in the world of the Westeros. From undead icemen to territorial dragons, “Game of Thrones” is picking up the pace rapidly when it comes to drama.\n\n“Always keep your foes confused. If they don’t know who you are or what you want they can’t know what you plan to do next,” Little Finger advised in the Season 4 promo.\n\nOne of the most exciting scenes in the promo deals with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) who will be attempting to take on another slave city—Meereen. In Episode 1, “Two Swords,” the Mother of Dragons will be attempting take overrun Meereen, which would bring her one step closer to reclaiming the Iron Throne.\n\n“Sometimes it’s better to answer injustice with mercy,” Daenerys is counseled.\n\n“I will answer injustice with justice,” she responds.\n\nIt looks like the blond haired beauty will be even a bigger force during Season 4 as she tries to become more than the just the mother of dragons.\n\nOther scenes from the promo include Ygritte getting reprimanded for letting Snow ride off, Cersei locking lips with Oberyn and Bran attempts to survive north of the wall.\n\nAre you excited for Season 4 of “Game of Thrones”? What are you predictions based on the promo?

That has since gone on to be a huge hit as part of Matthew McConaughey’s “McConaissance”, so it seems fitting that a third trailer would air ahead of its season finale.\n\nSecrets\n\nThis trailer is titled “Secrets”, and the focus of the teaser does seem to be our favourite characters either discovering or hiding something from those around them.\n\nThe preview kicks off with the ever despicable Joffrey unveiling his new sword; a sword which is forged [Minor Spoiler Alert] from “Ice”, the weapon once held by Ned Stark. In the George R.R. Martin books that the series is based on, the Lannisters melt it down in order to forge new blades for Joffrey and his uncle/father, Jamie. Talk about adding insult to injury, especially after they used it to behead the heroic leader of House Stark back in season one! The season premiere of Game of Thrones is actually titled “Two Swords”, so it’s likely that this will be a big focus of the episode.\n\nWe're testing a new site: This content is coming soon\n\nMysterious Red Viper\n\nFollowing glimpses of Sansa adjusting to her miserable new life as Tyrion’s wife and Arya with her new guardian The Hound, the trailer teases the arrival of the mysterious Red Viper in King’s Landing, before picking up with Jon Stark. Having returned from beyond the wall, it appears as if he quickly learns about the fate of his half-brother and the mess that Westeros currently finds itself in. Of course, Jon has his own problems to deal with as The Wildlings continue to plan their attack against the men of the Night’s Watch.\n\nWatch the throne\n\n“Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy,” says Ser Barristan Selmy before Daenerys replies with the rather ominous, “I will answer injustice with justice.” It is then that we get a glimpse of her huge army (consisting of the slaves of Yunkai), as they attack a city she clearly means to take as part of her plan to return to Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne. Of course, Daenery isn’t the only one who has her sights set on taking it, and Stannis Baratheon can be seen still plotting how he will rise to power despite his crushing defeat during one of season three’s best episodes.\n\nLights, camera, ACTION!\n\nTalking of action, the trailer also emphasises just how much of that we’ll see in the fourth season of Game of Thrones, and after rapid shots of battles taking place all over Westeros, we’re left with the really quite disconcerting image of Tywin Lannister sitting atop the Iron Throne. That spells trouble for Tyrion (who unfortunately doesn’t get an awful lot of the spotlight here, but can seemingly once again be seen imprisoned), although it clearly isn’t worrying Jamie and Cersai as they can be seen wasting no time in reigniting their incestuous relationship.\n\nDid someone order a CGI dragon?\n\nWe're testing a new site: This content is coming soon\n\nPerhaps the most notable new snippets of footage however are those which focus on Daenerys’ dragons, and it’s clear that they’ve grown considerably since we last saw them. Fans of the books were concerned that a TV budget wouldn’t be able to ever do them justice, but HBO have clearly gone all out to make them look as real as possible, and their presence in the series moving forwards promises to be one of the most intriguing elements of season four.\n\nYet again, this is a trailer which has offered up only 90 seconds of footage, but still more than enough to get both the diehard fans of George R.R. Martin’s novels and causal viewers talking. In what might just be the most shocking and violent season of Game of Thrones yet (yes, even more so than the Red Wedding…just wait until the Purple Wedding!), there really are plenty of “Secrets” left to be uncovered.\n\n* Game of Thrones returns to Sky Atlantic on April 7 (just one day after it airs in the US) at 9pm"", 'SecretsThis trailer is titled “Secrets”, and the focus of the teaser does seem to be our favourite characters either discovering or hiding something from those around them.\nTalk about adding insult to injury, especially after they used it to behead the heroic leader of House Stark back in season one!\nThe season premiere of Game of Thrones is actually titled “Two Swords”, so it’s likely that this will be a big focus of the episode.\nIn what might just be the most shocking and violent season of Game of Thrones yet (yes, even more so than the Red Wedding…just wait until the Purple Wedding!\n* Game of Thrones returns to Sky Atlantic on April 7 (just one day after it airs in the US) at 9pm']"
2265,http://screenrant.com/game-thrones-season-4-trailer-preview/,entertainment,"['886 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\nGame of Thrones\' third season featured a whole lot of treachery, back-stabbing, and duplicitous action that gave rise to bloody murder, even by the ultra-popular HBO medieval fantasy/intrigue drama\'s standards. It\'s no wonder then that nearly everyone in Westeros is looking for some kind of vengeance, retribution or similar form of payback as season 4 picks up. (Well, unless you\'re King Joffrey, in which case you\'re waving around unearned bragging rights about having already won the war for the Iron Throne.)\n\nOf course, Tyrion Lannister has shared a few key words of wisdom on that subject: ""If you want justice, you\'re come to the wrong place,"" which is a hard lesson that remains to be learned by the remaining Starks, even as events conspire to reveal the true allegiances among King\'s Landing\'s residents - meaning that Joffrey could soon get the punishment he deserves, though it won\'t necessarily be for reasons that have anything to do with moral righteousness.\n\nThe list of those still playing the game grows shorter every season, though we still count Peter Dinklage (X-Men: Days of Future Past), Lena Headey (Dredd), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Oblivion), Emilia Clarke (Terminator: Genesis), Kit Harington (Pompeii), and Maisie Williams (Gold) among its contestants.\n\nNo one is truly safe on Game of Thrones this season, as even those who don\'t wind up kicking the bucket can suffer in other ways. For evidence of that, see the mounting emotional trauma that\'s been inflicted upon Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), or the permanent debilitating physical injuries that Jaime Lannister (Waldau) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) were dealt last season.\n\nMeanwhile, as the latest trailer and past-unveiled previews for season 4 alike have reminded us, there are far greater developments unfolding in the southern and northern portions of the Game of Thrones universe. Dany\'s habit of conquering every kingdom that crosses her path - coupled with her increasingly large (and uncontrollable) dragons - will eventually make the various machinations at King\'s Landing seem rather trivial. On the other side of the world, though, there\'s not just an army of Wildlings ready to storm The Wall, but also a legion of White Walkers lurking out in the bitter cold.\n\nQuestion is, by the time that winter does finally arrive (figuratively and literally), will there be so many players left standing? If not, well, at least all those invaders from the North and South will have all that lovely countryside to appreciate by themselves - and then fight each other to death while claiming it for themselves, naturally.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nGame of Thrones season 4 begins airing on HBO on April 6th, 2014.\n\nSource: HBO\n\n886 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied', ""(Well, unless you're King Joffrey, in which case you're waving around unearned bragging rights about having already won the war for the Iron Throne.)\nNo one is truly safe on Game of Thrones this season, as even those who don't wind up kicking the bucket can suffer in other ways.\nMeanwhile, as the latest trailer and past-unveiled previews for season 4 alike have reminded us, there are far greater developments unfolding in the southern and northern portions of the Game of Thrones universe.\n__________________________________________________Game of Thrones season 4 begins airing on HBO on April 6th, 2014.\nSource: HBO886 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied""]"

To make that wait all the more agonising, HBO have released yet another superb trailer for season 4, packed with swordplay, secrets, deception and, of course, dragons.\n\nHere’s the highlights from the latest trailer, as we don our armour (figuratively) in preparation for the return to Westeros…\n\n1. Boltons loom large\n\nRamsay Bolton (Picture: YouTube)\n\nSansa’s often been a frustrating character, but with her family brutally murdered at the Red Wedding, she’s got just cause to be a bit upset. And as a shot of Roose Bolton and his Theon-tormenting son Ramsay confirms, evil endures in Westeros while honourable families like the Starks are eliminated.\n\n2. A new ally for Cersei?\n\nOberyn alongside Cersei (Picture: YouTube)\n\nIt’s not novel to see Cersei scheming – Lena Headey could do herself an injury with such frequent scowling – but it’s certainly interesting to see Oberyn Martell conniving alongside her. It makes sense for the prince from Dorne to align with the powerful Lannisters, but who’s Cersei hoping to avenge?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Daario 4 Daenerys…\n\nDaario, the swaggering hero (Picture: YouTube)\n\nNashville’s Michiel Huisman has replaced British actor Ed Skein in the role of mercenary Daario Naharis and he’s clearly being positioned as a swaggering hero. Well, we viewers are fond of Daenerys, so we need to root for any man trying to win her heart. Though it means poor Ser Jorah remains firmly rooted in the friendzone.\n\nMORE: Game of Thrones season 4 trailer promises vengeance and justice\n\n4. Big battles, big budgets\n\nBig scenes await (Picture: YouTube)\n\nSeason 2’s climactic Blackwater episode famously cost HBO millions and judging by this thrillingly large shot of Daenerys’ Unsullied firing on a city, the network’s more than happy to pump cash into Game of Thrones. A later aerial shot of a statue above a settlement echoes the Argonath sculptures in The Fellowship of the Ring; showrunners David Benioff and DB Weiss have lofty ambitions.\n\n5. Dany’s children get hungry\n\nGrown up dragons (Picture: YouTube)\n\nWell, haven’t they grown? Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal – though their names haven’t actually been used in the show – have tended to behave, unless told otherwise by their ‘mother’. But judging by the savagery the dragons display in the new trailer, Daenerys will soon struggle to keep a leash on her boys. Fiery death from above could be imminent in the Seven Kingdoms.\n\n6. Tywin v Tyrion\n\nThe Iron Throne (Picture: YouTube)\n\n‘We mustn’t disappoint father,’ says The Imp, bitterly, as his father mysteriously sits on the Iron Throne. The elder Lannister has always been the power behind his grandson Joffrey’s reign as king, but has he now appointed himself as de facto ruler? And where’s Joffrey?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Jon’s regret\n\nWill Jon take a man’s life? (Picture: YouTube)\n\nThere’s a genuinely intriguing climax when sweet Samwell Tarly pleads with Jon Snow, only to be met with the reply ‘I’ve done plenty wrong’. The bastard might be referring to his ‘betrayal’ of the Night’s Watch while undercover with the wildlings. Or he could mean his carnal oath-breaking with Ygritte. But a blazing final shot suggests Jon is going to take a man’s life. Will it be a wilding or one of his ‘brothers’ among the watchers on The Wall? The answer could define Jon’s future.', 'Like a White Walker heading south to The Wall, the new season of Game of Thrones is edging ever closer.\nHere’s the highlights from the latest trailer, as we don our armour (figuratively) in preparation for the return to Westeros…1.\nOberyn alongside Cersei (Picture: YouTube)It’s not novel to see Cersei scheming – Lena Headey could do herself an injury with such frequent scowling – but it’s certainly interesting to see Oberyn Martell conniving alongside her.\nMORE: Game of Thrones season 4 trailer promises vengeance and justice4.\nBut judging by the savagery the dragons display in the new trailer, Daenerys will soon struggle to keep a leash on her boys.']"

Of course, this is the typical reaction following the final episode of a number of the premium network\'s shows including Game of Thrones , the one who will soon fill those aforementioned huge shoes. Don\'t worry, the fourth season will surely satisfy all your viewing needs and make the murder mystery a distant memory. No?

He probably is \'The Yellow King.\' Sorry, I\'m getting off track. Back to thepromo its new looks at the upcoming season.To be honest, this was probably the least satisfying trailer of the three so far mostly because of the heavy reliance on characters talking. I\'m as big a fan of the show\'s sharp dialogue as anyone but thepromos work best when they pick a few winning soundbites and pair them, and loads and loads of action, with a piece of music that sets the tone. And, after using Chelsea Wolfe\'s ""Feral Love"" and The Everlove\'s (cover of Siouxsie and the Banshees\') ""Cities in Dust"" for \'Trailers 1 and 2,\' respectively, the \'score\' for secrets added nothing. Remember the incredible Season 2 spot with ""Seven Devils"" by Florence + The Machine? That\'s how you cut a trailer to music.Still, ""Secrets"" did contain a few shots worth mentioning. I like how all the previews keep introducing Pedro Pascal\'s Oberyn Martell since he\'s probably the most significant new player in theand this time we get a glimpse of him walking and talking revenge with Cersei. The full scale attacks on Mereen and The Wall also get some screen-time with Dany\'s army looking to continue her advancement in the Free Cities while Jon is back at Castle Black just in time to battle the Wildlings he \'betrayed.\' Oh, and how about the shot of all three grown dragons? The rest of the promo played a bit of catch-up, making sure to show all our favorite characters in their current situations (Jamie re-learning to fight from Bronn will be too rad) as this is likely the last full length trailer before the premiere.The spots are far from the only push that Home Box Office is making for the return of their award-winning fantasy series with and an excellent Valar Morghulis poster campaign as well as a some cool teases from more magical points of view. Can\'t forget about the three-eyed ravens, dragons and direwolves. I especially like how the \'All Men Must Die\' poster made the raven\'s undercarriage resemble the Iron Throne.

Scared that she about to plunge hundreds of feet to her death, she screamed “Oh, my God!” — and started inching back from the abyss that yawned before her.\n\nBut in reality there was no abyss: The woman was on an inches-high platform at Austin Music Hall, where HBO has set up a virtual reality experience that transports users to Westeros, the fictional setting of HBO’s hit show “Game of Thrones.” And even if she did trip and fall, Tony Berger, CEO of Relevent, the experiential marketing agency partly responsible for the installation, was there to catch her.\n\nThe installation uses the popular Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and tactile cues to give users the sensation that they’re scaling The Wall, a several hundred foot ice fortification that prominently features in the show. The headset’s immersive display changes realistically along with the user’s head movements, allowing users to determine what they want to look at. Meanwhile the floor vibrates to make participants feel like they’re in a squeaky elevator and fans blow cool air to remind them they’re atop a giant block of ice.\n\nHere’s a video of this reporter experiencing the installation.\n\n\n\nThe installation took three months to create, Berger said, with Relevent working with visual production company Framestore to perfect it. (Framestore also worked on the visuals effects for “Gravity,” for which it won an Oscar.)\n\nWhen Framestore isn’t winning Oscars, it’s a digital agency, working directly with brands like Beats by Dre to create digital experiences.

Woods said automotive brands could use this kind of technology to stage virtual test drives while retail brands could show a digital mockups of different home furnishing styles. Media companies will be able to use the Oculus Rift to create media that was previously unthinkable. And while the Oculus Rift is typically viewed as a gaming device, the “Game of Thrones” experience hints that it may open new forms of video entertainment.\n\nThe installation also underscored how much more daring agencies and brands have become technology-wise, Woods said.

Fans enter the exhibit through black drapes and could peruse costumes worn by characters such as Bran Stark, Hodor, Arya, the Hound and Daenerys Targaryen.\n\n""We wanted to give fans a sense of what went into making the show,"" said Elana Loewenthal, HBO\'s director of international marketing, who oversaw the creation of the exhibition.\n\nThere are original costume sketches for the series, storyboards and props such as a Jaime Lannister\'s ""golden hand"" and the enormous severed head of the wolf Grey Wind. A glass case displays the various hatchets, daggers and swords used in the show, while volunteers encourage visitors to sit in the coveted Iron Throne for a quick photo opp.\n\nBut the centerpiece of the exhibit is the ""Ascend the Wall"" experience, a 90-second virtual immersion into the world of Westeros. Visitors climb into a wooden elevator and slide on an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset and a pair of headphones. Suddenly, snowflakes flitter about and the elevator rattles and starts to ascend. The visitor feels the lifelike sensation of being pulled up by the rickety lift to the top of the 700-foot iced Wall, used in the series to keep out Wildlings and other aggressors.\n\nAt its apex, the visitor turns and walks out of the elevator and down a snow-covered path to the edge of the Wall and a striking panoramic view. A cold breeze rustles through. Suddenly, a flaming arrow, shot from way down below, whistles nearby. Another one hits the user square in the chest and he tumbles down the face of the wall, just before the experience – mercifully – ends.\n\nThe immersive experience combines the latest in interactive technology and computer graphics generated by Framestore, winner of this year\'s Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for its work on the film Gravity, said Ian Cleary, of Relevent, which oversaw the production. The experience combines 40 different elements – including sound, sights, air blasts and physical movement – to create the immersion effect, he said.\n\n""It\'s very innovative,"" Cleary said. ""Basically, we\'re tricking your brain into thinking it\'s somewhere it\'s not.""\n\nTerrence O\'Brien, a journalist with engadget.com who tried the experience, said it was extremely lifelike, though didn\'t offer much connection to the show besides the environment. Still, it was nerve-rattling, he said.\n\n""For a guy who\'s afraid of heights, it was terrifying,"" O\'Brien said. ""Pretty realistic.""\n\nAustin is the second U.S. stop for the Game of Thrones exhibit, which spent time in New York City during the Super Bowl earlier this year, followed by a tour in Mexico City, said Janine McGoldrick, an HBO spokeswoman. Next, the exhibition will head to Rio de Janiero, Oslo, Toronto, Belfast and Vancouver.\n\nUnlike the New York exhibit, which was available only to Time Warner Cable customers, the Austin display is free and open to the public and runs through Tuesday.', 'The Austin Music Hall downtown has been transformed into a virtual Westeros, the fictional continent where Game of Thrones takes place.\nFans enter the exhibit through black drapes and could peruse costumes worn by characters such as Bran Stark, Hodor, Arya, the Hound and Daenerys Targaryen.\nBut the centerpiece of the exhibit is the ""Ascend the Wall"" experience, a 90-second virtual immersion into the world of Westeros.\nAustin is the second U.S. stop for the Game of Thrones exhibit, which spent time in New York City during the Super Bowl earlier this year, followed by a tour in Mexico City, said Janine McGoldrick, an HBO spokeswoman.\nUnlike the New York exhibit, which was available only to Time Warner Cable customers, the Austin display is free and open to the public and runs through Tuesday.']"

2327,http://dailytrojan.com/2014/03/10/reality-shows-shouldnt-exploit-their-subjects/,entertainment,"['Much of my identity has been shaped by Lindsay Lohan — or shall I say, the more wholesome Lindsay Lohan.\n\nAs a small child, I watched The Parent Trap almost every day until my mother, an onlooker with less exposure than I, could even recite the words. Freaky Friday marked my third-grade existence; I wanted to be just like Anna: in a band and resilient against snobby popular girls. I sported a black choker for months to emulate her style. Of course, the form of Lindsay Lohan that is most embedded in the very fabric of my life is her character in Mean Girls. I quote it an annoyingly frequent amount of times a day and hope that maybe someday I’ll embody as much grace as Cady when she won Spring Fling Queen, breaking off pieces of her tiara for everyone in the crowd.\n\nNowadays, the Lindsay we are all familiar with is the Lindsay that parties an exorbitant amount, the one that checks in and out of rehab and seems to always miss her various court dates. Her escapades in recent years have infiltrated all media outlets and her actions are sometimes bigger news than breaking international events. She has tried to reinvent her image countless times, and as someone who has followed Lindsay for years and even idolized her at one point, it was increasingly disappointing to see her repeated downfalls. Eventually, her news became tiring, and I just resorted to watching Mean Girls for the 100th time.\n\nOn March 9, Oprah Winfrey premiered a reality show on her channel, OWN, documenting Lindsay as she picks up the pieces of her life following her very public battles with substance abuse and the law. Clips from Lindsay show the actress saying she “felt like she’s in a prison” with the camera crew constantly surrounding her and Oprah intervening, telling Lindsay to “cut the bull” for missing work. The series is an extension of the Lindsay we have all been accustomed to in the media, yet it also explains her actions. She is perceived as a party girl, but there is a back story to go along with it. Without sounding too maudlin, this series allows the audience to understand her difficult childhood and the pressures of being a child star.\n\nThough I do commend Oprah for using her immense power to inspire change, I question, in this case, if her influence is used in the right way. Utilizing the documentary as a means of casting light on Lindsay’s flaws isn’t the type of programming one would expect from Oprah. People are curious about Lindsay’s life, and their curiosity generates ratings. Lindsay’s life — successes and failures — is used for capital gain. As a person whose life was put under a microscope, which ultimately was one of the factors that her career was put in jeopardy, Lindsay would not benefit from even more cameras in her life. Furthermore, reality television shows should be taken with a grain of salt, because sometimes the production entails for dramatic set-up.\n\nTechnicalities aside, Oprah’s new show does lead me to question why viewers, myself included, are interested in Lindsay’s not-so-shining moments at all. Is it because her life is so chaotic that it’s almost a source of entertainment for people to view it seemingly uncensored? Or is it because we want to support her as an underdog? Either way, discriminating against Lindsay’s troubles invites generalities about her life. Making these matters public allows people to focus on the trivial rather than expending their energy on something more useful.\n\nLindsay Lohan has had a past that is undoubtedly widely covered by the media. It is also a past that people have widely analyzed. Whether she decides to direct her path toward her Disney hey-day is not up to anyone, nor is it anyone’s business.\n\nBut if she were to make another film with the same brilliance as Mean Girls, that would be so fetch.\n\nDanni Wang is a freshman majoring in psychology. Her column, “Pop Fiction,” runs Tuesdays.', 'Much of my identity has been shaped by Lindsay Lohan — or shall I say, the more wholesome Lindsay Lohan.\nOf course, the form of Lindsay Lohan that is most embedded in the very fabric of my life is her character in Mean Girls.\nEventually, her news became tiring, and I just resorted to watching Mean Girls for the 100th time.\nFurthermore, reality television shows should be taken with a grain of salt, because sometimes the production entails for dramatic set-up.\nBut if she were to make another film with the same brilliance as Mean Girls, that would be so fetch.']"

While the pilot ep wasn\'t as jaw-droopingly intense as we thought it might be, it definitely set the stage for how the series is going to go. As she says on camera, Lindsay is hoping to show the world her truth, which is exactly what her life is like post-rehab. Read on to find out the most eye-opening moments from the series\' inaugural episode.\n\nLindsay\'s Devotion to Her Family\n\n""It\'s comforting to be around my family,"" Lindsay reveals to the camera. ""They\'re a big part of my recovery."" While Lindsay\'s home life has been notoriously unstable (her mom Dina is often seen as an enabler and her dad Michael has wreaked havoc on the actress\'s life), she is close with her mom and three siblings.\n\n""I hate hearing people that I love cry, especially my mom, because it kills me,"" Lindsay reads aloud from a diary she kept while in the Betty Ford clinic in 2012. Soon after, Lindsay gets angry when rehashing the incident that lead to her mom\'s tears, which was that Dina wasn\'t allowed to visit her daughter while in rehab. Still, there are happier moments with Lindsay\'s fam, like when she is beaming with pride (even getting choked up) when her sister Ali models in a fashion show.\n\nJust How Ruthless the Paparazzi Can Be\n\n""Look at my watch,"" one paparazzo proudly shows off to the camera. ""Lindsay paid for it.""\n\nOne good shot of the actress can make a paparazzo rich, but it leaves the actress with little privacy and, quite literally, a roadblock to her recovery.\n\n“We’ve been stuck in the [hotel] room all day because there’s like 40 paparazzi outside and I really don’t feel like dealing with them today,” she told the camera, adding that she feels like a ""prisoner all the time"" due to the intense scrutiny. The actress declined to go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting later that evening due to the paparazzi and her belief that it wouldn\'t be fair to the rest of the group.\n\nHer Experience With Jail and \'The Bling Ring\'\n\nIn 2008, Lindsay Lohan was a victim of \'The Bling Ring,\' the group of wealthy Los Angeles teens who burglarized celebrities\' homes, later made famous in the Sofia Coppola film. But while Alexis Neiers, the leader of the Ring, was serving a brief amount of time in jail for her actions, Lindsay was right next to her serving time for her own.\n\n""When I was put into jail,"" Lindsay recalls, ""I was put into solitary, obviously for safety purposes. The girl [Alexis Neiers] I guess was in the same pod next to me, and they released her,"" Lindsay said.\n\nHer Trust Issues\n\n""Once someone promises me something and they break that promise, I lose all trust in them,"" Lindsay says. ""That happened to me when I was a kid, with my dad.""\n\nIn the first episode, we see her trust issues shine through when she has a meltdown over a lingerie film shoot she agreed to help out with for a filmmaker friend. When the filmmaker changes the script on her (something they did not agree upon in their initial contract), Lindsay gets visibly upset and storms out of the room, crying and yelling about the incident and the sudden change in plans.\n\nWhat She Wants to Show Fans\n\nAt the beginning of the episode, Oprah asks the starlet what she wants out of filming this documentary. Lindsay responds that she wants people to see her for who she is.\n\n""I\'m here. I\'m showing up. I\'m sober,"" Lindsay claims at the end of the episode. ""And I\'m dealing with it.""\n\nWe\'re rooting for you, Lindsay!

2330,http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a556466/lindsay-review-docuseries-gives-little-fresh-insight-into-lohans-life.html,entertainment,"['We all know that Lindsay Lohan has lived the majority of her life in the public eye. Now 27, the actress bagged her first major film role - The Parent Trap - at just 11. We all know the rest - the drugs, the drink, the rehab, the prison, the driving offences, the parties, and now the attempt to turn things around... with the help of Oprah.\n\nLindsay was billed as an all-access look at Lindsay\'s path to recovery, but it wasn\'t afraid of looking at her past, either, with clips from the various news bulletins and flashes of her evolution on the red carpet and even unnecessary vox pops from members of the public discussing their personal takes on Lindsay. Everyone has an opinion on Miss Lohan, whether it\'s thinking that she\'s had her shot or wishing her a recovery with fond memories of Mean Girls (for what it\'s worth, we\'re in the latter camp).\n\nOprah Winfrey Network\n\n\n\nBut those wishing for new insight into Lindsay\'s life in this docuseries would be left feeling faintly disappointed. Lindsay - terrified of ruining what everyone keeps telling her is her last chance - speaks mostly in platitudes in her pieces to camera, speaking of her new ""inner peace"" and ""integrity"" and ""keeping calm amid chaos"" and similar pre-rehearsed phrases.\n\nOtherwise, we track her attempt to move out of a hotel into an apartment, where she\'s hoping for a new stability. So there are lots of shots of Lindsay sorting through her belongings - girl is a big hoarder - with the highlight obviously her discovery of a \'Fetch\' shirt at her mother\'s house.\n\nThat\'s not to say there aren\'t flashes of insight. At one point, trapped in her hotel by paparazzi, Lindsay sits on her floor, sorting meticulously through her jewellery. ""Do you ever feel like a prisoner?"" she\'s asked. Laughing, as if it\'s an idiotic question, she replies: ""Yes, all the time."" It\'s hard not to feel for her, as clearly it\'s going to be much harder for Lindsay to get her life back on track than for anyone else.\n\nSure, she might have a sober coach with her at all times, but she\'s unable to go to her AA meeting without a trail of paps (and that\'s hardly fair on the other attendees, she points out). Even searching for an apartment becomes a million times more difficult - which board is going to want Lindsay Lohan in their building?\n\n\n\nBut generally, it\'s hard to figure out what story Lindsay is trying to tell. When she doesn\'t go to Venice for The Canyons promo, is she ducking out of her commitments or doing what\'s best for her sobriety?\n\nIs Lindsay Lohan a diva who causes problems on sets, derails a search for an apartment with a trip to a clothes shop, berates her realtor for not trying hard enough, and forces her assistant to move her belongings from one hotel room to another before she gets back? Or is she a troubled woman trying to get her life back on track as people change things around on her, mess her about, use her and put her in situations that are dangerous for her health?\n\nEven Lindsay is confused. At one point, she says she\'s used to living amid the paparazzi and in the media spotlight - so much so that it doesn\'t affect her. At other times, it\'s clear that as she dodges the photographers or ends up stuck in her hotel room. It\'s not as simple as she made out.\n\n\n\nYes, the real picture is always more complicated than black and white, but the show makes it too easy to have two conflicting opinions about Lindsay at one time - for example, when she agrees to take part in a lingerie shoot for a friend, only to quit when they change the concept to something she\'s not comfortable with. While her running out in tears doesn\'t exactly scream \'ready to be back at work\', it\'s also clear that she\'s being mucked about. But instead of painting a complex picture of Lindsay, the show just feels muddled.\n\nUnderstandably, Lindsay seems to be trying to paint a picture of happiness - when she speaks about her family, for example, it\'s in glowing terms, despite their well-documented history of issues. She does nod to this only slightly - ""It really will be nice when that day comes when there\'s no more talking and there\'s only positive things being said"" - and she does later hint at her problems with her father.\n\nThere\'s always the sense that things aren\'t as great as she\'s making out. Instead of exploring this or helping her talk through what\'s going on, Lindsay seems content to accept her statements at face value. This isn\'t insightful for the viewer or, indeed, helpful to Lindsay.\n\nDamian Dovarganes / AP\n\n\n\nThe end of the episode comes with a preview for the rest of the season, complete with Lindsay cancelling filming, arguing with her father and being told to fix up by Oprah. But should we really be making drama out of this woman\'s struggles and difficult road back to health?\n\nWhile I\'ve complained about the lack of real insight into her life in the first episode, when the preview comes along it\'s hard not to feel uncomfortable. Lindsay\'s lived everything in front of the media\'s glare and it hasn\'t turned out so well for her. Is sticking her in front of a camera crew at one of her most vulnerable moments really a good idea?\n\nLindsay is very glossy and shiny and well-filmed and shot by an Emmy-nominated director in Amy Rice, but that doesn\'t make it any more of a docuseries and any less of a reality show. Unfortunately, it never scratches much further than the surface, making it hard to justify.\n\nI\'m hoping for the best for Lindsay - and have for some time now been banking on a comeback - but this show just seems like a potentially dangerous waste of her time.\n\nWhat did you think of Lindsay? Let us know below!', ""We all know that Lindsay Lohan has lived the majority of her life in the public eye.\nOprah Winfrey NetworkBut those wishing for new insight into Lindsay's life in this docuseries would be left feeling faintly disappointed.\nAt one point, trapped in her hotel by paparazzi, Lindsay sits on her floor, sorting meticulously through her jewellery.\nEven searching for an apartment becomes a million times more difficult - which board is going to want Lindsay Lohan in their building?\nBut generally, it's hard to figure out what story Lindsay is trying to tell.""]"

2341,http://www.papermag.com/2014/03/lindsay_lohan_reality_show.php,entertainment,"['Last night Oprah\'s OWN network aired the premiere of Lindsay Lohan\'s reality show, Lindsay, which documents the troubled star\'s attempt, fresh out of rehab, to get her career going again and stay sober. Nothing could go wrong when you ad a reality show to the mix, right? Join us below, we as review some highlights from the episode.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>1) Oprah\'s pre-interviews are intense. Before they film an interview that aired on OWN in August, days after Lohan had been released from rehab, Lindsay tells Oprah that she only wants to come across as herself in the interview. Oprah, smelling the bullshit, tells Lohan ""I\'m only interested in what is the truth."" Lohan gulps and nods and then lets Oprah talk her out of going on a potentially sobriety-derailing trip to Europe. It\'s kind of awesome. Shouldn\'t this show just Oprah following Lindsay around, tell her not to do things and not breaking eye contact until Lohan agrees?<br/><br/>2) Much is made of the fact that Lindsay <i>does not have an apartment </i>in in New York, and must live for like three weeks in a 5-star hotel until she can find a place with a co-op board that will accept her. At first I was like, ""get. over. it.,"" but it\'s understandable how disorienting and un-fun living out of a suitcase would feel for a person desperate for stability. Not a good idea. Kind of like doing a reality show fresh out of rehab. <br/><br/>3) Living out of a hotel means that she\'s living out of suitcases and boxes, with much of the show featuring her sorting through clothes, shoes and jewelry laid out in front of her as now sad reminders of her previous success. When she pulls a <i>Mean Girls</i> t-shirt with <br/>""Fetch"" on the front of it from a box at Dina\'s house, where most of her belongings are in storage, Dina stares blankly at it. Oh, oh, yes, that\'s right, <i>Mean Girls</i>. Cute, hon. Even crazy old Dina has moved on. <br/><br/>4) Lindsay\'s broker is named ""Cash Bernard."" Cash Bernard is, in Lindsay\'s opinion, not working as hard as he could to get her into an apartment. Cash Bernard is being ""lackadaiscal"" about the whole thing, says Lindsay of Cash Bernard. Cash Bernard.<br/> <br/> <iframe src=""http://www.oprah.com/common/omplayer_embed.html?article_id=48884"" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" scrolling=""no"" width=""640""/></p><p class=""shareTitle""><br/></p> 5) Lohan has trust issues, and herself admits that people are always trying to jerk her around. This makes sense, given who her parents are, but one gets the impression watching Lohan become weepier and more explosive during an argument with a director at a lingerie shoot she had agreed to appear, in only to have her role changed without her knowledge, her only defense mechanism in these situations is to explode and act like a huge, bratty baby.<br/><br/>6) On said lingerie shoot, the grim realities of life as a former child star become plainly obvious. There are depressing one-on-ones with models likely 3 to 4 years younger than Lohan, talking about as her like she\'s a decades-older old washed-up star who\'s now a novelty. ""I\'m excited to work with Lindsay Lohan,"" says a girl in a bra. ""<i>Parent Trap</i> was my favorite movie growing up."" This is, where the show shines and shows real potential. While there are certainly one or two awkwardly staged opportunities --going to a fashion show to see her model sister, who seems vaguely surprised to see her there, walk the runway, for one -- the show is seemingly more or less candid. No bullshit staged storylines a la <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> or <i>Real Housewives</i> -- it\'s all about true intentions. This is Oprah country, y\'all. <br/><br/>7) And for all of her own trust issues, people, unsurprisingly, don\'t trust Lindsay Lohan. When Cash Bernard does finally find her an apartment, she must also put down $10 million for an insurance policy. When Lohan is a no-show at <i>The Canyons</i> junket in Venice, director Paul Schraeder describes working with LL as like being ""held hostage by a talented but unpredictable actress."" Nope, nothing could go wrong with this Oprah reality show. Not at all.<br/><br/>8) Constant commercials for Cliffiside Malibu where Lohan did her latest rehab stints adds to the pressure on Lohan to not Totally Screw This Up. The ad\'s tagline: ""At Cliffisde, you should only have to do this once."" <br/><br/> <iframe src=""http://www.oprah.com/common/omplayer_embed.html?article_id=48882"" frameborder=""0"" height=""360"" scrolling=""no"" width=""640""/><p class=""shareTitle""><br/></p><p class=""shareDescription""/> 9) The paparazzi keep her prisoner in her hotel room, unable to go to an AA meeting, and it\'s pretty dark. She might not be getting work, but Lohan is still worth tons of paparazzi dollars, one photographer standing outside her hotel room flashing a watch at the camera that he brags Lohan paid for. <br/><br/>10) Despite showing flashes of self-awareness, freely talking about her tendency to self-sabotage, she\'s also totally oblivious at other times. In one scene, Lohan remarks that in her pre-rehab life she existed in a bubble where everything was done for her, but that now she\'s more independent and doing things for herself. And then she has her personal assistant scramble to move all of her belongings into a new room in her hotel because she feels like a change of scenery. <br/><br/><p/>', 'Last night Oprah\'s OWN network aired the premiere of Lindsay Lohan\'s reality show, Lindsay, which documents the troubled star\'s attempt, fresh out of rehab, to get her career going again and stay sober.\nCash Bernard is being ""lackadaiscal"" about the whole thing, says Lindsay of Cash Bernard.\n""I\'m excited to work with Lindsay Lohan,"" says a girl in a bra.\n<br/><br/>7) And for all of her own trust issues, people, unsurprisingly, don\'t trust Lindsay Lohan.\nWhen Cash Bernard does finally find her an apartment, she must also put down $10 million for an insurance policy.']"

2344,http://observer.com/2014/03/et-tu-oprah-lindsay-lohan-doc-just-more-exploitative-celebrity-garbage/,entertainment,"['Early on in Lindsay, OWN’s four part “docu-series” by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice, we see Oprah sit down with the former Mean Girls actress and ask her what she wants to get out of her experience.\n\n“Just to be,” Lindsay Lohan says. “Just to be honest and open and just…me.” It’s a cringe-worthy moment in a show filled with cringe-worthy moments, made all the more cringe-worthy because you know how bad you are for watching it. But what Oprah says next, to the woman who just came out of rehab and who she just paid $2 million to shoot a documentary about, is even worse.\n\n“Okay, because that’s my intention too,” says Queen O. “My intention is to serve as a path for you to be able to do that. And so if I know that’s what you really want to do, I’m going to call you on it when I feel like you’re really not.”\n\nYou see the problem here, right? Asking a celebrity whose public train wreck has led her to a sixth stint in rehab what she wants, or hey, put ANY person on the spot and ask them what they hope to achieve by being interviewed by Oprah, and you’re going to get a lot of nonsensical, pseudo-self-help nonsense answers. No one is going to say “damage control,” or “money,” or “self-promotion.” And yet Lohan’s meaningless response–“Just be?” Aren’t we all “just being” all of the time, whether or not we are on drugs or honest or in The Canyons or have shitty, terrible parents–is immediately validated by Oprah as being exactly the right answer.\n\nIn almost every scene of Lindsay, we watch someone validate Ms. Lohan’s addled world-view by agreeing to accept events on her terms. Her drug counselor (who looks exactly like Mike White from Enlightened) lets her stay in her room at the Soho Grand instead of going to AA meetings because there are paparazzi outside. Her personal assistant lets her make iffy arrangements with “friends” who want to use her for a lingerie shoot. The “friends” tolerate Lindsay’s whiny tantrum behavior (which eventually leads to her just leaving the photo shoot, because she doesn’t want to play an intellectual or doesn’t want to have to memorize lines, it’s unclear), because they are succubi hangers-on, just like everyone else in her life.\n\nLindsay Lohan frequently sounds paranoid as she spouts off all the ways every life interaction makes her feel “used” and “lied to,” but she’s not wrong. Shoving a camera in an addict’s face is one way to speed up bad behavior, and unlike other Oprah endeavors, this feels like it’s angling not for a redemption story, but for a massive meltdown. It’s such a blatant kind of transaction–OWN gets the ratings, Lindsay becomes relevant for half a second–that you almost start to not feel bad about watching it. After all, we watch the Kardashians and don’t feel like we are ruining anyone’s lives, right?\n\nThe difference is, and god help me for saying this, but Kim Kardashian is a wise old soul and a savvy businesswoman, at least compared to Lindsay Lohan, who has no filter for keeping the leeches away. If Oprah wanted to let her “just be,” she would do so not by offering massive amounts of cash in exchange for frontside tickets to the drama, but by…you know, letting her be. At no point does anyone ever tell Lindsay Lohan the truth: that the public is interested in her only as far as she can fall, not for how high she can climb. That it’s not in her best interest to publicize her struggle. That Oprah and her drug counselor and her mother don’t want what’s best for her; they want what’s best for them. And that’s for her to fail.\n\n“My family has so much love,” Lindsay Lohan says at one point. “I can’t wait till we get to the point where we don’t need to talk anymore.”\n\nNeither can we.', '“Just to be,” Lindsay Lohan says.\nLindsay Lohan frequently sounds paranoid as she spouts off all the ways every life interaction makes her feel “used” and “lied to,” but she’s not wrong.\nAfter all, we watch the Kardashians and don’t feel like we are ruining anyone’s lives, right?\nThe difference is, and god help me for saying this, but Kim Kardashian is a wise old soul and a savvy businesswoman, at least compared to Lindsay Lohan, who has no filter for keeping the leeches away.\n“My family has so much love,” Lindsay Lohan says at one point.']"

That, in turn, had been a substantially smaller audience than some other Oprah-exclusive sit-downs on her cable network. This, just a few days after Lohan’s visit to Jimmy Fallon on NBC’s Tonight show to plug the launch of the OWN series logged a preliminary 3.2/9 household rating, which will likely translate to about 4 million-ish viewers when Nielsen gets them crunched.\n\nEven so, OWN president Erik Logan calls the launch a success, noting Lohan’s opener achieved his network’s highest rating in the Sunday hour in 27 weeks with women 25-54 and that the series launch posted triple-digit gains in key demos versus the time slot’s prior six-week average (+178% in total viewers; +300% in women 25-54; +478% women 18-49), and double-digit gains versus the tim eslot one year ago (+57% in total viewers; +37% women 25-54; +73% women 18-49).\n\n“We had set out to try to attract a different type of viewer and audience to the network and we felt like we did that — especially young women demo which is up by triple digits,” he said, calling the demo “people who normally don’t come here.” “We thought this was a great opportunity for us — we feel great about the young end of the numbers, and the premiere in a time slot we never programmed before on a most competitive night of television.” He said the numbers for Lohan’s post-rehab sit-down with Oprah are “a little apples and oranges” because that interview occurred in a franchise that was two-years established — Oprah’s Next Chapter. “This is programming a brand new time period and not an easy place to go,” he said. The premiere episode of Lindsay\x9d will re-air on OWN tonight at 10 PM ET/PT.\n\nLast August, Oprah Winfrey‘s post-rehab interview with troubled star Lohan drew far smaller audience than some other of Oprah’s exclusive sit-downs. The Lohan interview on Oprah’s Next Chapter on Sunday, August 18, averaged 892,000 total viewers at 9 PM, only slightly above the show’s Sunday average (+7%). For comparison, Oprah’s interview with Whitney Houston’s daughter Bobbi Kristina drew 3.5 million viewers and her chat with disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong clocked 3.2 million. For the night, including the 10 PM rebroadcast, the Lohan sit-down averaged 1.8 million viewers.\n\nLast Thursday, La Lohan was a guest on Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to plug the debut of her OWN reality series, though she explained it away as doing all the reality -TV stunts, like making the most chaos of her move to New York, though she said Oprah herself has helped her a lot and that she sometimes does not pick up calls from Oprah just so she’ll have Oprah’s voice recorded on her voicemale.

It shows that the star is so hounded by the paparazzi that she can’t attend her AA meeting. She is striving for normalcy despite not being able to rent an apartment because of her reputation. But for now, at least, Lohan appears to be trying her best.\n\nWinfrey and OWN deserve some credit here. Lindsay is clearly a reality show, but it doesn’t romanticize tears and/or meltdowns: it focuses on Lindsay’s commitment to sobriety, and it uses recovery jargon to show just how all-encompassing her addiction treatment really is. The show sets Lohan up to succeed – it is not presented as an attempt to break her down.\n\nBut despite the positive intentions surrounding Lohan’s move from Los Angeles to New York, is watching what is undoubtedly one of the most challenging times in her life supporting her comeback, or enabling her downfall?\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the technicalities, or to frame them as part of the star’s now-infamous legacy. Four days out of rehab, Lohan is encouraged by Winfrey, who takes on a mentoring role, not to travel to Europe for the premiere of her Bret Easton Ellis-scripted movie The Canyons. Her sobriety coach repeats the point, which leads to her cancelling her appearance at the Venice film festival. She pulls out of a short lingerie film because the producers ask for dialogue, and explains that doing this would have “compromised her sanity and sobriety.” She gets angry because, when they find out who she is, she is charged a $10m insurance fee by a condo board, effectively eliminating her chances for an apartment.\n\nWhat Lindsay shows is that none of us can know what Lohan’s road to recovery looks, or should look, like, because her story is her own. Only she has Dina Lohan for a mother, only she has paparazzi bragging about how photos of her bought them expensive watches, and only she knows what this reality show is meant to do. Perhaps it will be part of an elaborate recovery process, or perhaps it is intended to prove to herself (and to potential employers) that she’s serious about working again.\n\nLindsay has a potential to give Lohan the platform she needs to convey the difficulties both of addiction recovery, and of being a famous woman in a fame-obsessed world. It can give her a mouthpiece aside from the occasional one-on-one interview or TMZ sound bit. The early signs are cautiously promising.\n\nThere are seven episodes left. If it becomes sensationalist; if it becomes a show that exploits Lohan more than media outlets already have, and romanticizes tragedy rather than strength, then it sets up both Lohan and viewers to fail: her, because she will be its victim; us, because we encouraged it.', 'It shows that the star is so hounded by the paparazzi that she can’t attend her AA meeting.\nShe is striving for normalcy despite not being able to rent an apartment because of her reputation.\nThe show sets Lohan up to succeed – it is not presented as an attempt to break her down.\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the technicalities, or to frame them as part of the star’s now-infamous legacy.\nWhat Lindsay shows is that none of us can know what Lohan’s road to recovery looks, or should look, like, because her story is her own.']"

From the trailer that came out last week, it seemed like the show wanted nothing more than to highlight the difference between those two: Oprah is the good influence on Lindsay, who is a bad influence on herself.\n\nThe first episode of the series didn’t show the real conflict between the woman responsible for the docu-series and its subject—that’s being saved for later episodes, we guess—instead the episode was about Lindsay’s big move to New York City after her latest stint in rehab. So we got scenes of Lindsay packing up her stuff at an L.A. storage facility; Lindsay driving around looking at apartments, stopping at her friend's store for a change of clothes; Lindsay dropping her stuff, which includes a Mean Girls “fetch” t-shirt, off at her mom’s house. We know who the villains are here: the paparazzi, the Los Angeles lifestyle, Lindsay's own persistent demons.\n\nIn the beginning of the episode, everything was mostly happy-go-lucky. Lindsay seemed intent on recovering, and her personal assistant explained how much he believed in her. It was only at the end that we began to see the whole operation unravel.

2384,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/03/10/lindsay-premiere-5-most-upsetting-moments-from-lindsay-lohans-reality-show/,entertainment,"['Four days after Lindsay Lohan left rehab last summer (her sixth stay in six years), she started shooting a reality show for the Oprah Winfrey Network; the eight-episode series, “Lindsay,” premiered Sunday night. Who thought this was a good idea?\n\nLots of people, apparently. Oprah’s network certainly needs the viewers and Lohan needs people to think her life isn’t a total trainwreck anymore. Presumably, the goal is to mutually help each other, but is it really smart to put an addict in front of a camera at all times?\n\nYeah, we know the answer, too. As a result, watching the “Lindsay” debut just felt wrong. Lohan is clearly still very troubled, and even though every celebrity docu-series is somewhat voyeuristic, this one was flat out sad and absolutely no fun. Most of the premiere involved Lohan, accompanied by a sober coach and personal assistant, talking to the cameras about this new transitional phase in her life and how much she’s changed; Lohan getting in and out of giant chauffeured SUVs as she searches for a new apartment in New York; and Lohan bailing on various scheduled commitments.\n\nIf you couldn’t stomach it, here are the five most upsetting moments in the hour-long premiere.\n\n1) The flashbacks to Lohan’s glory days.\n\nFor the last several years, most photos of Lohan show the actress looking miserable, usually on her way to court or after she’s been caught in some sort of trouble. That’s why it’s heartbreaking to flash back to Lohan’s earlier days. In the beginning of the episode there’s a short clip of adorable 12-year-old Lohan on the red carpet for the premiere of “The Parent Trap” remake, her first big movie, beaming with happiness as she answers questions about playing twins.Then we see Lohan grinning for the cameras at the “Freaky Friday” debut in 2003 (box office gross: $160 million) and later, posing for photos for her star turn in “Mean Girls” in 2004. Obviously, it all went downhill from there: DUI convictions, arrests, probation, violation of probation, theft charges, etc. Being reminded of her once-promising future is just sad.\n\n2) Lohan family time\n\nThe main storyline of the premiere is that Lohan is moving from Los Angeles to New York to make a fresh start and live closer to her family. After shipping a massive amount of boxes to her mother’s house on Long Island, Lohan pays a visit to go through some of the things, including a journal from her time at the Betty Ford rehab clinic. She reads some passages out loud, including one about being upset that her mother, Dina, was barred from visiting. Having been bombarded with headlines about the highly dysfunctional Lohan family relationships, it’s all way too invasive.\n\nThe saddest moment? Seeing Lohan hug her younger brother and tell her family she loves them in a feel-good moment that feels way too forced — underscored by the microphone pack clipped on the back of Lohan’s dress, a depressing visual reminder that they’re all playing for the cameras.\n\n3) Lohan promising she’s changed her unreliable ways, then bailing on everything\n\nThough Lohan swears she’s become a different person post-rehab, she bails at least three different times on various planned commitments through the course of the episode, making life difficult for others. Case in point: Lohan decides she’s too stressed out to fly to the Venice Film Festival to promote her latest film, “The Canyons,” (the subject of that fascinating “Here is What Happens When You Cast Lindsay Lohan in Your Movie” NYT article) and cancels her trip. The director, Paul Schrader, is blunt with the crowd in Venice. “Today I am a free man,” he says dramatically. For the last 16 months, “I have been a hostage of my own choosing by a very talented but unpredictable actress, and she was supposed to be here today. She said she would be, but she’s not.”\n\nOuch. Later, Lohan has signed on to appear in a “short film” to promote a lingerie brand (side note: what?) because she’s friends with the producers. Only once she finds out they want her to be involved in actual scenes with dialogue rather than a photoshoot, she angrily decides to drop out. The reason? They lied to her about her role, and she doesn’t trust liars. She acknowledges that she only agreed just so she could be on a set again — but that environment wasn’t good for her “sobriety or sanity.”\n\n4) The people who have to deal with her\n\nMatt, Lohan’s beleaguered personal assistant, has to keep up with her demands, erratic behavior, and general bad mood when she’s been living in a hotel for a month because she can’t find an apartment in New York. (By the way, Matt tells the camera that before Lindsay, he worked as an assistant to Sean Astin, Prince, Shaun White and Steven Tyler. Someone get this man his own show!) Lohan also chews out the real estate broker, Cash, for not finding her an apartment — especially when one building insists she have a $10 million rental insurance policy, because obviously that’s Cash’s fault. Her sober coach, Michael, is the most patient, even when Lohan decides she doesn’t want to go to an AA meeting because of the dozens of paparazzi staked outside her hotel.\n\n5) Oprah’s role in all of this\n\nYou know what, Oprah? We appreciate all you’ve done for a lot of other people, but it’s hard to have respect for you after seeing this show.\n\nWe see Oprah sitting down with Lohan at the beginning of the episode, grilling her on what she wants out of the experience. “Just to be honest and open and you know, just to be me,” Lohan says. Oprah replies that’s good, and just get ready, because she’s ready to call Lohan out on any bad behavior or lies throughout production. Lohan eagerly nods, and it’s sad because she so clearly wants approval from one stable adult in her life. Oprah is beyond condescending about it. “I’ll let you change into your pretty little dress,” Oprah says flippantly after their pre-interview chat, walking out of the room so Lohan can get ready for the day.', 'Four days after Lindsay Lohan left rehab last summer (her sixth stay in six years), she started shooting a reality show for the Oprah Winfrey Network; the eight-episode series, “Lindsay,” premiered Sunday night.\nIf you couldn’t stomach it, here are the five most upsetting moments in the hour-long premiere.\n2) Lohan family timeThe main storyline of the premiere is that Lohan is moving from Los Angeles to New York to make a fresh start and live closer to her family.\nHaving been bombarded with headlines about the highly dysfunctional Lohan family relationships, it’s all way too invasive.\nOprah replies that’s good, and just get ready, because she’s ready to call Lohan out on any bad behavior or lies throughout production.']"
2385,http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2014/03/lindsay-own-review.html,entertainment,"['But the real magic of this show is in its timing. Like most reality subjects, Lohan indicates at the top of the show that she\'d like to help people in some way by exposing her journey. Unlike most reality subjects, she\'s not bulls—ting. The whole ""if I can even make one person _____"" trope has been worn out by housewives and D-listers who, deep down, just want to be on TV.\n\nLohan\'s position is different. A teaser for the season ahead hinted at the sort of troubles we\'ve come to think of as characteristic for her—flaking on shoots, etc.—but the actress\'s power, in this series, doesn\'t hinge on her behavior record or even her intentions. The fact is: She\'s in a fragile place, as a young woman and as an addict, having seen a hell of a lot and needing to decide how to move on. How do you build a stable future when your past was all high glitter and major stumbles? How do you get excited about what\'s ahead when your former definition of excitement—both the substances and the circumstances that led to them—is now off-limits, by your own choice?\n\nThat\'s the question this series seems to be setting out to answer—and it\'s one addicts and nonaddicts alike can empathize with. The great thing about having Lohan in the question is we really care what happens to her. Not all of us (as I\'m sure someone\'s gonna tell me in the comments!)—but millions of us, in a way that can\'t quite be explained, except to say that maybe some people are born to be rooted for. Lohan is one of those people. If she\'s been dealt a mixed hand in life, that is her ace. Lindsay gives us a chance to watch as she plays her next card—and it knows we all want her to nail it.', ""Like most reality subjects, Lohan indicates at the top of the show that she'd like to help people in some way by exposing her journey.\nUnlike most reality subjects, she's not bulls—ting.\nThat's the question this series seems to be setting out to answer—and it's one addicts and nonaddicts alike can empathize with.\nThe great thing about having Lohan in the question is we really care what happens to her.\nLindsay gives us a chance to watch as she plays her next card—and it knows we all want her to nail it.""]"

Or something. Basically, Lindsay felt like she was getting jerked around and so she chewed out the director. And then she did the same to a real estate agent whom she felt ""lackadaisical"" and lacking in urgency when it came to securing her a permanent residence.\n\nAnd then she yelled at people a few more times in the trailer for the rest of the season of her show.\n\nTime will tell if Lindsay is quality, quality trash, or neither, but the first episode seemed to present an uncommonly complicated portrayal of its star. If it weren\'t completely candid, it was brilliantly constructed to appear so. Lindsay\'s capacity for sympathy ranges from scene to scene. She\'s sometimes bratty, but that\'s often when she feels like people are taking advantage of her (and as a former child star whose parents have fucked her over repeatedly in the harsh light of public, you see why she\'d be extra touchy about getting taken advantage of). But she also seems to demand so much of some people in her life that you wonder if she\'s not taking advantage of them, and if what she\'s fighting for is merely the upper hand. After she backed out of the lingerie shoot, Lindsay said it was ""like a filler thing"" and that, ""I was just doing it to do it and I shouldn\'t have done that, because I compromised myself and my sobriety and my sanity."" That\'s fair but also kind of disrespectful of one of the few jobs she had offered to her at the time of shooting.\n\n""I know that this is my last shot at doing what I love to do,"" she said at the beginning of the show, matter-of-factly aware that reality TV is where some careers go to die. That\'s a brutal self-evaluation.\n\nPaparazzi play a big role in the show—they irritate, they complicate, they make Lindsay feel virtually immobile at times. Below, she explains how they\'re preventing her from attending an AA meeting. They might be some irony to derive from that, given her relationship to fame, if she weren\'t a former child star who had a lot of attention foisted on her and no tools for comprehending whether that\'s what she actually wanted at the time. Lindsay seems like she can be a jerk, and her self-sabotaging can be infuriating for anyone rooting for her, but this prisoner-in-her-own-life stuff struck me as just plain depressing.\n\n[There was a video here]', ""[There was a video here]Lindsay Lohan was chainsmoking and braless for much of last night's premeire of her OWN reality show, Lindsay.\nThe show documented her move from Los Angeles to New York and, as she told Jimmy Fallon last week, her life's resulting chaos.\nBasically, Lindsay felt like she was getting jerked around and so she chewed out the director.\nTime will tell if Lindsay is quality, quality trash, or neither, but the first episode seemed to present an uncommonly complicated portrayal of its star.\nPaparazzi play a big role in the show—they irritate, they complicate, they make Lindsay feel virtually immobile at times.""]"

Oprah says that before the interview starts, she asks if Lindsay wants out of it. Lindsay says she wants to be honest and be herself. Oprah says that’s her intention: to provide a path for that and she will call her out on any BS. Oprah says she is really interested in the truth about her struggles and path to recovery. Lindsay recognizes that she’s an addict and that her drug of choice is alcohol.\n\nOprah says she has heard she plans to go to Europe. She says she doesn’t believe that because it’s just days after rehab. Linday says her brother is going with her because she is doing a yoga meditation program.\n\nOprah says she doesn’t think it’s a good idea. She says she questions it because she thinks Europe is the playground for fun and pleasure and that she might fall in the mindset “why not do this?” Lindsay says she won’t be going to parties. Oprah says she is not her coach, but she wants her to think if that environment would be the best for her sobriety as opposed to staying in NYC where her family is. At the end of the episode, they mention that two days later after the interview, Lindsay canceled her planned trip to Europe.\n\nBack in LA, 11 days out of rehab. Lindsay gets into a car and drives to get her stuff from storage. Amy Rice –who has been hired to direct the series — asked her how her days have been. She says the chaos of daily life doesn’t affect her anymore.\n\nWe see many boxes full of clothes. she’s moving everything she has accumulated over 9-10 years in LA to NY to her mom. We start seeing footage of fans, some of whom are optimistic while others have lost hope for her. Overall, they wish her the best. Throughout the fan footage, we see black background with messages referring to the multiple counts of her infamous DUI charges, theft charges, violation of probation, and reckless driving.\n\nLindsay says she knows this time is her last chance to come back. She says there’s nothing else in that party environment for her to do. So from here on now, she can only live on integrity.\n\nWe see Lindsay sorting though her boxes filled with clothing items and sort what will be going to NY. Next week we get part 2.

Which is one of the biggest reasons filming one’s recovery for display on national television is not standard practice among 12-step followers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn your path to sobriety, you aren’t special; you’re just another drunk with the same sort of issues as the guy sleeping in the doorway of whatever part of New York in which drunks are still allowed to sleep in doorways.\n\nIt was difficult not to wonder if you had, perhaps, rushed into this whole thing. You were only out of rehab four days when filming began and frankly, your explanation for doing the show -- “There’s something to be said about my being so public” -- is not the best one could have hoped for.\n\nYes, Lindsay, there are many things to be said and most of them will not be nice. So why on earth would you put yourself in this position, especially at a time when you should just be going to meetings, reading the Big Book and finding a sponsor?\n\nCelebrity is an addiction too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Oprah, well, it was hard not to be a wee bit concerned when she suggested that you not take the trip you were planning to Europe. “I’m wondering,” she said, “is that the best decision. ... There’s something about Europe, being the playground for fun and pleasure.”\n\nSo going to Europe, no, but moving from Los Angeles to New York, with a film crew and a famous director (Ann Rice) in tow, yes. Am I the only one who remembers when Kirstie Alley did a realty show so she could lose weight? Which didn’t work?\n\nStill, it is difficult not to love a girl who sorts through her endless vault of storage boxes wearing short shorts and knee-high black boots. You looked fabulous, Lindsay.\n\nYou do have way too much stuff, though. And possibly you shouldn’t have moved it all until you had found an apartment in New York. As you say yourself, living in a hotel means you can’t get a workout schedule or go to meetings or get a sponsor.\n\nI’m not sure why that is, precisely, but you said it quite convincingly and if that is the case, then surely you could have sent someone on ahead to find you a flat. If only so you didn’t have to dump all your stuff on your mom, which meant hanging with Dina. Something that hasn’t always gone so well. In the past.\n\nI’m certain your personal assistant, Matt, could have found you a place, or your sober coach Doug, a man who seems remarkably unfazed by your refusal to attend a meeting because of all the paparazzi who somehow knew to gather outside your hotel (first clue: film crew).\n\nFrankly, between the assistant, the coach, the driver (black SUV because nothing says “I just want my privacy” like a black SUV), the coterie of unnamed security guards and the film crew, you probably could have put together a small AA meeting in your hotel room. Heck, some of the paparazzi are probably sober, right?\n\nYou see, Lindsay? It’s difficult for even a sympathetic viewer to watch you shopping and smoking and complaining about how your last judge was “punishing me instead of helping me” without making a crack or two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ads for Cliffside Malibu also do not help.\n\nNor do the scenes in which you throw tantrums about a photo shoot that is not going the way you thought it would or a real estate agent who is not dropping everything to get you into the one apartment you finally decide you like. In one priceless moment, you were telling the audience, with obvious sincerity, that you were just trying to figure out how to live in a sane way and figure out how to do it yourself. You remember? You were wearing a Wonder Woman-like gold headband and a dress cut down to there to a Fashion Week event while, back at the hotel, Matt and your team raced around moving all your crap from one hotel room to another.\n\nAs a TV critic, I cannot deny it made for some great if painful television.

2407,http://www.collegenews.com/article/lindsay_lohan_turns_reality_star_in_oprahs_docu-series,entertainment,"['Lindsay Lohan’s new reality series debuted on the OWN network.\n\nLindsay Lohan is infamous for her hard partying, addiction, convictions and severe lack of common sense or self-control. Lindsay Lohan, a once-legitimately talented actress, has become a cautionary tale of young Hollywood. Lohan has six rehab stays, multiple arrests, convictions and probation violations under her belt, and every time the public starts to root for her, she goes and inexplicably puts herself back at square one. Lindsay Lohan has been given more chances than is seemingly acceptable and she realizes that—or so she says.\n\nLindsay Lohan’s docu-series premiered on OWN Sunday night. Many people were shocked that Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful women in the world, would put her faith in Lohan given the girl’s disaster of a track record. The episode opened with Oprah interviewing Lindsay Lohan, who claimed that she wanted to “show the real me” and “ to live life with integrity.”\n\nFor the most part, the show is pretty tame. It follows Lindsay Lohan and her wranglers (which includes her sober coach—who isn’t convinced that Lohan is sober) mere days after she was released from her latest rehab stay in Malibu. Lohan packs up her stuff and returns to New York, where she tries to find an apartment. She claims she needs to be settled and can no longer live in hotels, because the instability helps enable her behavior. It’s small gems of entitlement and inability to take responsibility for her actions like this that made viewers roll their eyes. The most telling part of the episode is when Lindsay Lohan complains that the judge refused to release her from jail even though there was overcrowding because “an example needed to be made” of her. Lohan fails to see that maybe her jail stay was extended because she committed a multitude of crimes and actually deserved jail time. It seems that thought never crossed her mind.\n\nAnother cringe-worthy moment came from Lindsay Lohan’s mother, Dina. As she helps Lohan unpack boxes, they come across a t-shirt with the word “Fetch” printed on it. “Fetch” has been a decade-long joke from “Mean Girls,” which was Lindsay Lohan’s biggest hit at the height of her career. However, Dina doesn’t get it. It’s painful to watch Lindsay Lohan explain to her mother that it’s a line from “Mean Girls,” as it is the most successful film her daughter has ever done and the success of the movie no doubt paid for Dina’s house. Moments like this make the viewers feel bad for Lindsay Lohan.\n\nAll in all, the episode was relatively dull. People expecting “Jersey Shore”-style debauchery are out of luck. However, Lohan’s unprofessional and selfish nature seems more prevalent in the preview for next week’s episode, as she refuses to film and enrages Oprah Winfrey. The problem is that Lohan seems to have finally run out of luck and the public just doesn’t care enough either way.', 'Lindsay Lohan’s new reality series debuted on the OWN network.\nLindsay Lohan is infamous for her hard partying, addiction, convictions and severe lack of common sense or self-control.\nLindsay Lohan, a once-legitimately talented actress, has become a cautionary tale of young Hollywood.\nLindsay Lohan has been given more chances than is seemingly acceptable and she realizes that—or so she says.\nIt follows Lindsay Lohan and her wranglers (which includes her sober coach—who isn’t convinced that Lohan is sober) mere days after she was released from her latest rehab stay in Malibu.']"

Lindsay Lohan's Diva Side Flares Up On New Show\n\nLindsay Lohan‘s self-titled reality TV show on Oprah Winfrey‘s OWN channel depicted the troubled star as an ornery prima donna in its’ premiere Sunday, and we’ve got all the details for you right here on RadarOnline.com.\n\nOn its’ first night, Lindsay — a documentary series about Lohan’s life after getting out of rehab — the actress was shown storming off the set of a lingerie shoot, ranting to her real estate agent, and forcing her personal assistant to get her a new hotel room after leaving her original one in shambles.\n\n“My intention is to just be me,” recovering alcoholic Lohan told Winfrey in starting her new TV journey.\n\nAnd was she ever!\n\nViewers were treated to scenes of Lohan claiming to be in a better place and “excited to start this new chapter” — but then reverting to her old hard-to-work-with ways.\n\nJust 34 days out of rehab, Lohan was shown making a cameo in a film to promote a lingerie line — and immediately having issues with producer Jeremy Frommer.\n\n“This is not the way I would show off lingerie,” Lohan told Frommer after hearing what she had to do.\n\n“I thought this was a photo shoot that was going to be filmed,” Lohan told OWN’s cameras. “And then they added this weird dialogue. I don’t like being lied to.”\n\nWhen Frommer tried to get to the bottom of what was bugging Lohan, she said, “When we discussed this … I was the girl that had the love story. That was interesting to me. That’s why I wanted to do this.”\n\nLohan’s personal assistant, Matt Harrell, told the cameras, “They wanted to change the script … that’s not what we agreed upon.”\n\nWhen Lohan told Frommer she’d rather be in London promoting her movie The Canyons, the producer got angry and blamed Lohan’s schedule for the problems.\n\n“Listen to me!” Lohan then said, pointing at shocked Frommer. “Now I’m getting p***** off. I canceled my f***ing trip! Don’t put words in my mouth.”\n\nLohan started to cry, then said, “This is not what I signed up for,” and stormed out of the makeup area.\n\nFrommer attempted to clear the air with the out-of-control star later, but Lohan said she felt uncomfortable with the shoot, and ultimately pulled out of it.\n\nAlso during the episode, viewers saw the drama of Lohan moving back to New York and looking for a new apartment in Soho.\n\nBut when Lohan finally found a place she liked, the recovering party girl was convinced her real estate agent, Cash Bernard, wasn’t working hard enough to seal the deal.\n\nIn a tense phone conversation with Bernard, Lohan said, “What EXACTLY is it going to take to get the keys?! I hear it in in the tone of your voice, how lackadaisical you are about it.”\n\nAfter finding out a $10 million liability policy had been put in her lease, Lohan went ballistic, shouting to Bernard over the phone, “They can’t just add that to the lease! How the hell can anyone have that?! I’m not Oprah. I can’t get that!”\n\nFollowing the apartment debacle on Sunday’s show, her assistant Harrell had to pick up the pieces.\n\nAfter living in a New York hotel for 36 days, antsy Lohan suddenly decided she had to get an entirely new room in the same hotel where she’d been staying.\n\nHarrell had to quickly transfer all of Lohan’s clothes and personal items into a new room before she came back from watching her sister, Ali Lohan, do a runway modeling job.\n\n“I was the lucky guy that got to switch everything over. This woman’s got s*** you couldn’t believe,” Harrell sighed as he cleaned the room, which looked like it belonged to a hoarder!\n\nWhile Harrell did all the dirty work, Lohan improbably told the cameras she remembered “being in this bubble where everything was done for me..

Lohan’s parents had a stormy marriage, and continued to battle publicly and privately even after their 2007 divorce.\n\nLohan’s career kicked off when she began modeling at just three years old, before doing dozens and dozens of commercials. Following a turn on the soap opera “Another World,” her big break came when she was cast in the dual lead roles for the 1998 remake of “The Parent Trap,” playing twins opposite Dennis Quaid. Lohan received high praise, and went on to star in a number of teen-friendly films, including “Freaky Friday,” “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,” and “Mean Girls.”\n\nIn 2004, Lohan released her first single, “Rumors,” and her debut album, “Speak,” which went all the way to number four on the Billboard 200 chart. But following several more films and another record, Lohan’s career started to derail in 2006 with personal and professional problems that led to a 30-day stint in rehab in early 2007. Just a few months later, the actress was arrested for DUI. She again entered treatment, was released after 45 days, and had a second DUI fewer than two weeks later, during which she was also caught possessing cocaine.\n\nAfter a guilty plea, Lohan was placed on three years probation, went to rehab for a third time, and while ordered to spend a day in jail, ultimately served just 84 minutes due to overcrowding. Lohan’s probation was extended in 2009 after she failed to complete required counseling, and her career continued to suffer due to sporadic projects that failed to find any success. In 2010, a judge determined Lohan had violated her probation, and ordered her to serve 90 days in jail, of which she only ended up behind bars for 14. She was also supposed to spend 90 days in rehab, but left after 23 days.\n\nAfter a failed drug test later that year, Lohan once again entered rehab, staying at the Betty Ford Center for three months. In early 2011, Lohan was arrested for allegedly stealing a necklace, and after pleading no contest, she was sentenced to 120 days in jail, but ended up doing 35 days of home detention instead. Months later, Lohan was again ordered to jail for a probation violation, but spent only five hours locked up.\n\nLohan seemed on the brink of a comeback in 2012, with a Playboy spread and a well-received turn as “SNL” host. But a car accident on her way to filming the TV movie “Liz & Dick” ultimately led to charges of reckless driving and lying to police. She pleaded no contest, and was sentenced to 90 days in rehab. Upon her release in 2013, Lohan filmed a reality show for Oprah’s OWN network, documenting her attempts to rebuild her life. It aired in 2014, and Lohan revealed on the finale that she had suffered a miscarriage in the months before.\n\nWith her last film, “The Canyons,” ripped by critics, Lohan set her sights on the stage, and made her West End debut in “Speed-the-plow” in the fall of 2014. She completed the run without incident. Lohan nevertheless remains a tabloid target, and is routinely romantically linked to various people, even though she hasn’t seriously dated anyone since Samantha Ronson.', 'Lindsay Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, the first child of Dina and Michael Lohan, who would go on to give the star three younger siblings, Michael Jr., Cody, and Aliana.\nAfter a failed drug test later that year, Lohan once again entered rehab, staying at the Betty Ford Center for three months.\nMonths later, Lohan was again ordered to jail for a probation violation, but spent only five hours locked up.\nLohan seemed on the brink of a comeback in 2012, with a Playboy spread and a well-received turn as “SNL” host.\nIt aired in 2014, and Lohan revealed on the finale that she had suffered a miscarriage in the months before.']"

Today\n\n""Lindsay"" was touted as a docuseries chronicling Lindsay Lohan\'s ""attempts to build a new life"" in New York City following her sixth stint in rehab.\n\nBut the premiere, which aired Sunday on Oprah Winfrey\'s OWN network, could just have easily been an episode of A&E\'s ""Hoarders"" or ""Intervention,"" or even Britney Spears\' ""Chaotic"" (the word pops up a lot in ""Lindsay"").\n\nEmmy-nominated director Amy Rice interspersed the shots with on-the-street interviews and the grim statistics of Lohan\'s career nosedive, from plummeting box-office numbers to her numerous arrests and stints in rehab.

With film crew in tow, she cherry-picked which items she planned to store at mother Dina Lohan\'s Long Island apartment in preparation for her move to the Big Apple. The cameras also captured the ""Liz & Dick"" star\'s nostalgia over the mementos she saved from her much-lampooned portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor in the Lifetime biopic.\n\n\n\nBut she also kept souvenirs from her glory days, like the ""Mean Girls"" ""Fetch"" T-shirt she brandished at her mom\'s place — now overrun with boxes of her daughter\'s possessions.

Whatever sympathy the LiLo had from viewers at the start of the show, it shrank noticeably when she whined, ""They were punishing me instead of trying to help me!""\n\nBlame game\n\nThe premiere didn\'t do any favors for Lohan\'s reputation for unreliable behavior. She ran out sobbing from a friend\'s film shoot, in which she was to cameo as an ""intellectual"" who ""gets absorbed into the world of beauty and lingerie.""\n\n\n\nThe filmmaker had to scrap an entire day\'s work when she pulled out, but Lohan insisted, ""I\'m not an actress turned model,"" adding, petulantly, ""My sister\'s the model in my family."" (Not that there\'s anything wrong with that. She did support Aliana during her first fashion show in another segment.)\n\nShe also canceled a London promotion for ""The Canyons"" (which, despite her friend gushing that ""it\'s gonna be a cult movie,"" made only $51,000) and the film\'s Venice Film Festival press junket — where the embittered director, Paul Schrader, told the press, ""I\'ve been a hostage of my own choosing to a very talented but unpredictable actress.""\n\nIt\'s a Catch-22: Lohan\'s potential landlords are requiring an astronomical $10 million insurance policy, but she can\'t (or won\'t) work — or workout, or get an AA sponsor — because she doesn\'t have a ""sanctuary"" to call home and help clear her ""headspace.""\n\nLohan in cars, getting coffee\n\nBut Lohan and her realtor, Cash Bernard (a name made for reality television), didn\'t give up. In fact, much of the hourlong program featured the actress, sipping Starbucks with her posse (which also included her PA and a ""sober coach"") and driving around the city. (Ten different shots involved Lohan entering, exiting or riding in a chauffeured SUV.)\n\n\n\nAnd yet, though Lohan pointed to her dedication to her sobriety as the reason for backing out of her professional commitments, she skipped AA meetings because of the paparazzi hounding her.\n\n""Look at my watch,"" one of the insensitive photographers bragged to the documentary crew. ""Lindsay paid for it.""\n\nOprah, as usual, said it best: ""The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,"" she warned Lohan in the previews for the rest of the season. Some highlights: The actress clashes with her assistant, bails on the docueries\' filmmaker and causes her coach to question her sobriety.\n\n""This is exactly what everybody said was gonna happen, and I believed differently,"" said Oprah. ""I believed she was ready.""\n\nBut not everyone is losing faith. Many fans tweeted their support during their show — and plan to keep watching Lohan\'s story unfold.\n\n\n\n', '""Lindsay"" was supposed to show the star\'s rebuilding her life in New York, but what the premiere revealed is what a mess her life still is.\nToday""Lindsay"" was touted as a docuseries chronicling Lindsay Lohan\'s ""attempts to build a new life"" in New York City following her sixth stint in rehab.\n""Lindsay"" offers a revealing glimpse into the troubled star\'s everyday life — and a closet full of skeletons.\nEnough to fill a cavernous warehouse — where we found the actress, 11 days out of rehab, when the series began.\nLohan in cars, getting coffeeBut Lohan and her realtor, Cash Bernard (a name made for reality television), didn\'t give up.']"

But seriously, who’s fooling whom? In the best Hollywood tradition, the Oprah Winfrey-Discovery network and the tabloid-plagued actress are using each other, the irony being that if Lohan stays on the straight and narrow, she’ll yield a show as boring as Sunday’s not-screened-in-advance premiere.\n\nFrankly, one appreciates Lohan’s efforts to stay clean and sober. But it shouldn’t come as a newsflash to anyone – starting with Oprah – that the dramatic needs of reality TV and straightening out her life are mutually exclusive.\n\nThe show picks up last August, right after Lohan has finished her sixth stint in rehab. While alcohol, she says, has been her drug of choice, it’s clear another kind of high comes from staying in the spotlight.\n\nThe opening runs through Lohan’s spotted history of arrests and slip-ups, while incorporating the “backstage” portion of her Oprah interview, before filming the series began.\n\nMostly, the show is filled with meta moments. There’s the spectacle, for example, of the cameras filming Lohan being photographed by the paparazzi staking out the hotel where she’s living (they become what amount to extras throughout); or her assistant, Matt Harrell, saying the actress knows the OWN project amounts to a last chance, and thus that she won’t screw things up.\n\nStill, it’s hard to see what screwing up would entail in this context, other than falling completely off the wagon, while Lohan’s sober coach, Michael Cormier, keeps a watchful eye on her.\n\nSo what’s left? Lindsay talking to the camera, without makeup; Lindsay visiting her mom, Dina; Lindsay trying on hats; Lindsay looking for an apartment; Lindsay having a minor meltdown at a modeling shoot.\n\nAt this rate, Linday watching paint dry is a pretty good subplot for episode three.\n\nFrankly, “Lindsay” says far more about OWN than it does about Lohan. Having already handed a fair amount of time over to Tyler Perry, the channel continues to drift farther away from the “Oprah” brand in pursuit of hits.\n\nThat’s worked, to a point, but it also dispels the notion that Oprah’s magic touch would somewhat make broccoli TV palatable.\n\n“The vultures are waiting to pick your bones,” Oprah tells Lohan in the “this season on” tease, as if – in this context – her channel isn’t taking a taste.

The show, which debuted Sunday on Winfrey’s OWN channel, got off to a far milder start, with the daytime talk show legend telling the star-crossed former child star, “I want you to win.”\n\nWinfrey, the world’s supportive TV friend, clearly cares about Lohan, whose interrelated problems with family, alcohol and the law have overshadowed her acting talent. But while anyone with a heart is rooting for Lohan to turn her life around, it’s far from certain viewers will stick around to witness the BS that began to unfold during Sunday’s initial installment.\n\nLohan says a lot of the right things to Winfrey and the cameras: She knows this is her “last shot.” She “feels different.” She’s finding “inner peace.”\n\nHer words, in the context of the show, offer the disturbing suggestion that Lohan is linking her public struggle for stability to the resurrection of her career nearly a decade after her peak in “Mean Girls.” It’s difficult to watch “Lindsay” without thinking she might be better off if nobody was watching.\n\nFor all her talk about “inner peace,” there are plenty of signs of outer chaos as Lohan uses the paparazzi as an excuse to miss an AA meeting. She makes her assistant move her heap of clothes and junk from one hotel room to another because she’s feeling claustrophobic. She breaks down and walks off a shoot when she decides – not unreasonably – that a friend is taking advantage of her.\n\n""Lindsay"" is billed as an eight-part ""docu-series"" in an apparent bid to separate the program – and Winfrey – from the often-exploitative Reality TV genre.

Still, “Lindsay” succeeds in capturing the sadness, confusion and fragility of Lohan’s post-rehab life. She’s striving to emerge from the too-high pile of troubled former child stars – a mound of misery that includes Michael Jackson, the most talented and most tragic of them all.\n\nAmanda Bynes, who experienced unfortunate public breakdown, recently tweeted to let her fans know she’s okay and in school. Hopefully, that’s last we’ll hear from Bynes for a while as she gets her life together.\n\nLohan, who, like Bynes, is 27, can’t keep away from the public eye: She’s set to appear on “Two Broke Girls” April 14, and is slated to start filming a movie next month. On Thursday, she promoted “Lindsay” on “The Tonight Show,” seeming in good spirits as she told Jimmy Fallon she takes comfort in knowing Winfrey is always just a call away. As for her many problems, Lohan told Fallon, “That’s the past.”\n\nThe past may not be as distant as Lohan would like. The cameras began following her just six months ago, days after she finished her latest rehab stint.\n\nPreviews suggest that Winfrey’s tough talk comes in the next episode.

The outside world or the actress herself?\n\nDirector Amy Rice followed the “Mean Girls” actress as she decided to relocate from Los Angeles to New York City. The actress felt that a change of scenery and being closer to her family would give her stability as she tries to stay sober. At one point, Lohan acknowledged that the next few months are important ones.\n\n“It’s my last shot,” the actress said of her career.\n\nSee video: Lindsay Lohan Gets Doused in the Face by Jimmy Fallon\n\nIn setting up the series, it shared Oprah Winfrey‘s pre-interview with the star ahead of the taping of her August interview on “Oprah’s Next Chapter.” Winfrey asked the question she poses to all her guests: What do you want from this interview?\n\n“Just to be me, be honest and open,” Lohan answered and Winfrey promised she’d call the actress out if she felt she wasn’t sticking to that path.\n\nThe truth is probably the hardest thing to discern on the premiere episode. We hear what Lohan wants, but we’re unsure what happens off-camera and just how much she participates in situations where she feels others have wronged her.\n\nAlso read: Lindsay Lohan to Guest Star on CBS’s ‘2 Broke Girls’\n\nThere are plenty of examples of this on the episode. She promised to be in London to do press for her movie, “The Canyons,” but pulled out because she’s worried about how the pressure will affect her sobriety and that the press will really only want to ask her about her recent stint in rehab. In turn, director Paul Schrader told reporters that he felt like he “was held hostage” by the actress during the shooting of the film, clearly disappointed she was skipping out on its promotion.\n\nYet, there are some real challenges to being Lindsay Lohan. The paparazzi are clearly out of control. They stood outside her hotel and followed her to events. One boldly held up his watch to OWN’s cameras and said, “Lindsay paid for it.”\n\nAt one point, she’s unable to attend her AA meeting because the paparazzi would follow her there and she’s worried about the other people at the meeting and their privacy. When Rice asked if she ever felt like a she’s a prisoner, Lohan answered, “Yes, all the time.”\n\nAlso read: Is Oprah Winfrey Exploiting Lindsay Lohan?\n\nShe also goes for more than a month in New York City unable to find an apartment. Lohan said that finding the place is the easy part, but then the building’s board finds out who she is and doesn’t want her as a neighbor or they raise the rent. At one point, she’s very close to signing a lease when a last-minute clause requiring her to purchase a $10 million insurance policy gets added – something her realtor said is a standard amount though Lohan argues that she isn’t your standard renter. Truth.\n\nAt other times, it’s clear Lohan may not know what she needs. She wants stability, yet she orders her personal assistant to switch her hotel room and move her belongings (which are strewn all over her hotel room like an episode of “Hoarders”).\n\nThe show shoots only her second visit with her mother since leaving rehab. Why has she only seen her mother once since rehab if her family is such a force for stability? And, her father? Well, he hasn’t quite been her best protector either and has yet to appear during Lohan’s first month in NYC.\n\nSee video: Oprah Winfrey Tells Lindsay Lohan to ‘Cut the Bulls–t’ in First Look at OWN Series\n\nShe’s a living example of contradictions. Lohan does come off as very courteous to others, greeting her drivers, the hotel staff who open the door for her, etc., though at one point she decided to change her clothes during a realtor appointment and literally goes shopping for new duds while the realtor stands outside on the sidewalk.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Lohan can herself begin to decipher during the course of the season ahead the difference between when others are gunning for her and when she’s holding the gun.\n\n“Lindsay” airs Sundays at 10/9c on OWN.', 'The much-anticipated OWN series starring Lindsay Lohan, titled simply “Lindsay,” already sets the season’s storyline on Sunday’s premiere episode: Who’s the biggest threat to Lohan?\nAlso read: Lindsay Lohan to Guest Star on CBS’s ‘2 Broke Girls’There are plenty of examples of this on the episode.\nYet, there are some real challenges to being Lindsay Lohan.\nWhen Rice asked if she ever felt like a she’s a prisoner, Lohan answered, “Yes, all the time.”Also read: Is Oprah Winfrey Exploiting Lindsay Lohan?\nSee video: Oprah Winfrey Tells Lindsay Lohan to ‘Cut the Bulls–t’ in First Look at OWN SeriesShe’s a living example of contradictions.']"

She\'s got her work cut out for her. ""I used to like her,"" is the general consensus from strangers interviewed on the street. Yeah, we all used to. Remember The Parent Trap? Mean Girls? And then the DUIs, thefts, more DUIs, car crashes, lying to the police, and solitary confinement? More what Lindsay is known for now. But coming out of rehab for the sixth (that\'s not a typo) time, Lindsay feels that this could be her last chance to get back some respect. Well, maybe not respect. But something? A paycheck, maybe?\n\nThe show starts off with Lindsay apartment hunting -- which is probably the single most stressful undertaking a human being can attempt if the apartment hunting is being done in New York City. Lindsay doesn\'t have it any better than your average schlub -- in fact, she may have it worse, given her reputation. For who really wants Lindsay as a neighbor? And when her broker breaks the news that the owner of the apartment she settles on wants a $10 million insurance policy -- which she is sure no one will give her -- well, let\'s just say Lindsay\'s post-rehab serenity immediately flies out the window. ""Who has that?"" she snaps at the broker. ""I\'m not Oprah!""\n\nThat wasn\'t Lindsay\'s only meltdown of the evening. There was her decision not to fly to the Venice Film Festival for the launch of her movie The Canyons. She very rightly concludes that the party atmosphere of a film festival isn\'t where she should be when she\'s trying to avoid champagne -- but that doesn\'t stop the film\'s director, Paul Schrader, from slagging her off at a press event.\n\n""I\'ve been held hostage to a talented but unpredictable actress who said she\'d be here today but isn\'t,"" he grouses. Sheesh, Paul, maybe don\'t hire Lindsay Lohan next time if it was predictability you wanted.\n\nWe also get a scene of Lindsay\'s famous temper when she quits a lingerie shoot rather than take on some dialogue she wasn\'t prepared for. ""This isn\'t what I signed up for!"" she hollers, before storming off set and refusing to shoot anything.\n\nBut behind the diva antics are some real issues -- and we get one real clue where all of this is coming from when Lindsay says in an off-guarded moment, ""I hate when someone makes a promise and breaks that promise. It makes me lose all trust in them. Just like when I was a kid with my dad.""\n\nA-ha! And for a moment you feel deeply, truly sorry for Lindsay.\n\nBut then she spontaneously makes her hapless assistant move all of her things out of her hotel room and into another -- for no particular reason.\n\nI look forward to Lindsay turning some of that venom on the person who really deserves it -- her father.\n\nDid you watch the show? What did you think about Lindsay\'s behavior?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Are People Saying About Lindsay?\n\nSome are loyal fans...and some know her only from sensationalized tabloid stories.

We know there\'s more Lindsay complaining, Lindsay angst and Lindsay anger. OWN\'s voice of reason needs to make another appearance, badly.\n\n11:00: To come this season on ""Lindsay"": more problems with shoots. An appearance from her dad, Michael Lohan, and problems with her assistant, Michael. Lindsay on a pole. Lindsay at a doctor\'s office or hospital(?). Oprah getting angry.\n\n""The vultures are waiting to pick your bones if you\'re not ready,"" Winfrey tells Lindsay. Ruh roh.\n\n10:58: Lindsay is stressed again. She can\'t get the keys to her new apartment. They want a $10 million dollar insurance policy added to the lease. ""How the hell could anyone have that?"" she tells her broker. ""I\'m not Oprah."" She\'s now been living in a hotel for 36 days. She requests a new room. She hates living in a hotel. It brings her back to a ""crazy"" time in her life, when she was also living in a hotel. She doesn\'t approve of much lately, except for her sister\'s walk in a fashion show.\n\n10:48: Lindsay\'s shooting a short film to promote ... lingerie! And she doesn\'t like the script. It\'s not what she expected. It\'s all very confusing. The models are waiting. She pulls out of the shoot. ""It just wasn\'t the right timing,"" she says. Compromising her sobriety, apparently.\n\n10:38: Michael, Lindsay\'s ""sober coach"" thinks it\'s a bad idea for her to travel, even when business calls. She also isn\'t too keen on the idea. So she misses at trip to the Venice Film Festival for the premiere of her movie ""Canyons."" She\'s not settled in a routine yet. They\'re stuck in a room all day because there\'s paparazzi outside. She\'s missing meetings because the photographers would follow her. She feels like a prisoner ""all the time."" Yet she thinks back to the time when a judge wouldn\'t let her out of actual jail (to make an example of her, Lohan supposes), and she was placed in solitary confinement. The hotel room is probably better.\n\n10:33: Lindsay explains the problems with finding an apartment when you\'re Lindsay Lohan. No one wants Lindsay Lohan in their building, and if they do, they bump up the price, she says. :( :(\n\n10:29: Back at Mama Lohan\'s house in New York, Lindsay sorts through her belongings. She\'s moving back in until she finds something more permanent. Mama Lohan looks a bit addled. Lindsay hugs her brother, Cody. They ""have a special bond,"" she says.\n\n""We have so much love in each one of us,"" Lindsay continues. ""It really will be nice when that day comes when there\'s no more talking and there\'s only positive things being said, and that will come.""\n\n10:25: Matt, Lindsay\'s personal assistant, sounds like he could have a show of his own, having assisted Shaun White, Steven Tyler, Sean Astin ... nevermind, Lindsay would probably deliver enough material.\n\n10:18: August 2013. Being back in New York is good for Lindsay, we learn. She\'s going shopping, trying on hats. Laughing, lighting up a cigarette.\n\n10:11: So far Oprah has given Lohan fair warning: We\'re both here to get the real you, meaning honest Lindsay, not lying Lindsay. Lohan tells Winfrey she\'s an addict, specifically an alcohol addict. With the actress just four days out of rehab, Winfrey thinks it\'s a bad idea for her to go on a trip to Europe for yoga. Lohan thinks better of it and decides to stay in the states. We\'re reminded that this ""docu-series"" is being directed by Emmy-nominated filmmaker Amy Rice. We get a short history of Lindsay, from bright-eyed star of ""The Parent Trap"" to beleaguered actress-addict.\n\n10 p.m.: ""Lindsay.""\n\nWill this prove better than Lindsay Lohan\'s performance in the Lifetime movie ""Liz & Dick?"" And by better, meaning worse, meaning better? Anyhow, this is quite a jarring transition from tonight\'s premiere of Neil deGrasse-Tyson\'s ""Cosmos.""

She earned her nickname, which she later made her legal name, after everyone would call her “Smiley.” The Cyrus family includes younger siblings Braison and Noah, older siblings Brandi and Trace, whom Billy Ray adopted from Tish’ previous relationship, along with a half-brother, Christopher, who was born to Billy Ray’s ex the same year as Cyrus. Country icon Dolly Parton is Cyrus’ godmother.\n\nPartially inspired by her father, Cyrus developed an interest in singing and acting early on. Following the debut of “Hannah Montana” in 2006, in which Cyrus played a pop star living a double life, she became one of the Disney Channel’s biggest successes. In 2008, Cyrus scored her first Billboard Top 10 hit with the song “See You Again.” She then slowly began experimenting with a more racy image, as seen on a controversial “Vanity Fair” cover with her father, and in her 2009 Teen Choice Awards performance, during which she pole danced.\n\nFollowing others hits like “7 Things,” “The Climb,” and “Party in the USA,” Cyrus debuted a new sound with her third studio album, “Can’t Be Tamed,” which was released in 2010, the same year she starred in “The Last Song.” The star continued to cause controversy after a leaked video showed her getting high. By the end of 2011, Cyrus was completely separated from the Disney brand.\n\nNo longer with the Mouse House-approved Hollywood Records, Cyrus signed with RCA and released her “Bangerz” album in 2013, with the hits “We Can’t Stop” and “Wrecking Ball.” At the MTV VMAs that year, she and Robin Thicke caused a huge firestorm with a sexually-suggestive performance, and Cyrus continued to push boundaries with nude photo shoots, outlandish concerts, and an outspoken love for marijuana.\n\nCyrus, however, spent part of 2014 sidelined with serious health woes. She began work on new music in 2015, which she rung in with new boyfriend Patrick Schwarzenegger. He was Cyrus’ first relationship since she and “Last Song” co-star Liam Hemsworth ended their engagement in 2013. However, they split up and Cyrus got re-engaged to Hemsworth, with whom she’s been for the past few years.', 'Miley Cyrus was born Destiny Hope Cyrus on November 23, 1992 to country singer Billy Ray Cyrus and wife Tish Cyrus.\nPartially inspired by her father, Cyrus developed an interest in singing and acting early on.\nFollowing the debut of “Hannah Montana” in 2006, in which Cyrus played a pop star living a double life, she became one of the Disney Channel’s biggest successes.\nHe was Cyrus’ first relationship since she and “Last Song” co-star Liam Hemsworth ended their engagement in 2013.\nHowever, they split up and Cyrus got re-engaged to Hemsworth, with whom she’s been for the past few years.']"

Don’t be ashamed for wondering. It’s natural.\n\n“The Bachelor”:\n\nIt’s one of those shows that everyone skewers, yet many of those very same people can’t stop watching. The finale airs Monday night from 8 to 11 p.m. on ABC. (Yes, three hours.) This is the network’s 18th season of its find-a-soulmate show and it remains a fixture in pop culture, even though ratings aren’t what they used to be. (Seriously — 18 seasons.) So far, two relationships have actually worked out long-term; one was Sean and Catherine, who married about a month ago. (Sister show “The Bachelorette” has had nine seasons, with two weddings and one engagement that still appears to be on. Not bad odds!)\n\nThe Bachelor:\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis, 32, single dad to a sweet four-year-old daughter. Unfortunately: Also the reason this season has been pretty much a disaster, even turning die-hard viewers away. He’s been pretty sleazy, hooking up with more women than is usually acceptable even for a show that is exclusively about hooking up with as many women as possible as a means of finding a soulmate. Two contestants have dramatically quit, and he drove another to tears after a late-night rendezvous in the ocean that he tried to pretend didn’t happen the next day. (And off-camera, there were those anti-gay comments that went viral.) Viewers have not been happy, and the tabloids are filled with stories about how even the show’s producers think Juan Pablo has been the “worst Bachelor ever.”\n\nThe finalists:\n\nAnd yet, there are two women still vying for his love. Or at least a giant diamond ring. Every finale, one of the tackiest scenes is when “Bachelor”-approved jeweler Neil Lane strolls out with a ginormous case of bling, while the Bachelor contemplates which one is the shiniest and also which of the two women he should propose to after knowing them for a few weeks.\n\nAnyway, the contenders are Clare Crawley, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki Ferrell, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City. They do not get along. (Meanwhile, Clare is the one who took that swim in the ocean with Juan Pablo that caused so much controversy — but obviously he wasn’t too upset about it.)\n\nThe actual finale:\n\nBuckle up, because this is a three-hour “journey,” to use one of the show’s favorite words. First, there’s the two-hour show where Juan Pablo will spend a lot of time gazing over the ocean (the finale taped in St. Lucia) and decide which woman he wants to marry, or at least pretend to marry for the purposes of this program. And after an agonizingly long process, both women — decked out in evening dresses — will stroll out to meet Juan Pablo, who will be standing in a forest or something, where he’ll either propose or dump them. It will be magical.\n\nThen, the real fireworks start at 10 p.m. with the “After the Final Rose” special. The actual “Bachelor” was filmed months ago, and now everyone (Juan Pablo, the finalists, other rejected contestants) joins together on live television to rehash the season and find out what everyone’s been up to. Translation: Are Juan Pablo and the winner actually still together? Chris Harrison will ask completely invasive questions. It will be awkward, in the most glorious way possible.\n\n“The Bachelorette”:\n\nAnother fun fact about the “After the Final Rose” special: That’s where we learn the identity of next season’s “Bachelorette,” almost always a reject from the previous “Bachelor” season. Rumors are that lawyer Andi Dorfman — the final three contender who stormed off and dumped Juan Pablo in a “shocking” twist a couple weeks ago — will get the honor, and have 25 eligible men competing for her.', 'Juan Pablo Galavis (Craig Sjodin/ABC)Whether you’ve seen angry rants about someone named “Juan Pablo” blowing up your Twitter feed or you’ve been roped into a “Bachelor” finale party on Monday night and haven’t seen a single episode, never fear — here’s a quick primer for everyone who is clueless about ABC’s hit reality show.\n(Meanwhile, Clare is the one who took that swim in the ocean with Juan Pablo that caused so much controversy — but obviously he wasn’t too upset about it.)\nThe actual “Bachelor” was filmed months ago, and now everyone (Juan Pablo, the finalists, other rejected contestants) joins together on live television to rehash the season and find out what everyone’s been up to.\nTranslation: Are Juan Pablo and the winner actually still together?\n“The Bachelorette”:Another fun fact about the “After the Final Rose” special: That’s where we learn the identity of next season’s “Bachelorette,” almost always a reject from the previous “Bachelor” season.']"

""This is what this show is about. We\'re on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.""\n\nBut the couple remained evasive and explained that although they have made plans for the future, they would not divulge the details.\n\nThe show ended with Harrison announcing Andi Dorfman as the next Bachelorette.\n\nThe new season of ""The Bachelorette"" will premiere on 19 May.', 'One of the most controversial seasons of ""The Bachelor"" came to an end on Monday with Juan Pablo Galavis giving the final rose to Nikki Ferrell.\nBut unlike the previous seasons, a proposal wasn\'t forthcoming as Galavis said he wasn\'t sure whether he wanted to marry Ferrell.\nSo, Nikki, will you accept my final rose?""\nBack in the studio live after the final rose segment, both Galavis and Ferrell looked awkward and refused to speak about their relationship.\nThe situation became even more awkward when ""The Bachelor"" host Chris Harrison asked Galavis if he loved Ferrell.']"

Of course, the answer was that she was “pretty sure” — probably not exactly the answer that she was looking for now that it’s down to the final two. She also sat down with Juan Pablo’s cousin for an awkward conversation about fighting, Juan Pablo’s attitude, and how she’ll deal with it. She said she thought they would “fight well” together. Whatever that means!\n\nJuan Pablo’s Final Dates: Nikki & Clare Want More\n\nFor his last date with Clare, he takes her away in a helicopter ride — and when they landed there was no cameras or lights, and Clare was, of course excited for a moment alone with him so he could whisper some sweet nothings in her ear. Instead though, he told her that that he didn’t know her at all as well as “some sexual thing” that she couldn’t even repeat. Naturally, she was heartbroken.\n\nHowever, she called him out on it and told him that if there were doubts, it needed to be open because to her it’s much more than physical and she’s much more than a hook up. After he spent some time begging her for a kiss, she finally told him she needed to know where his head was at, and he said all the right things — that he could see a future with her. He even played “No Better Lovers” by Josh Krajcik, which they danced to together earlier in the season. Of course, Clare said they can dance to it at their wedding.\n\nAfter all that awkwardness, we almost forgot he had to take out Nikki. Right away, she was explaining to the cameras that she too wanted to know how he felt. But, of course he said it was gonna be “okay.” It was clear that she really “wanted forever” as she put it, as she even framed a picture of them along with a super sweet card. After he left, she wasn’t happy — she sat and balled her eyes out.\n\nJuan Pablo Turns Down Clare\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever been so heartbroken before in my life. The moment that JP said “I have to say goodbye to you” to Clare, my heart seriously broke. After he told her, he went in for a hug — and she put her hands up — and the crowd applauded. Good for her! She called him out on saying that she could see himself with her in Sacramento, having kids with her, etc., and said that she “believed in us.”\n\n“I saved this moment for the man of my dreams, I thought that as you, I thought I knew what kind of man you were,” she said before COMPLETELY slamming him, saying “I would never want my children having a father like you.” Juan Pablo proved right there it wasn’t a match when he said, “I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”\n\nIt got even more intense when Clare said to the cameras, “Don’t tell me you loved f–king me.” Ouch!\n\nJuan Pablo Has A Ring . . . But Doesn’t Know How To Use It\n\nNext up was Nikki, who had no idea what just went down. However, she told Juan Pablo how much she loved him and he answered by telling her that there are many things that he loves about her. He also brought up the fact that Nikki’s father told him to be 100% sure if he was going to purpose!\n\n“I’m not 100% sure that I want to propose to you but I’m 100% sure that I don’t want to let you go,” he told her, adding, “I like you a lot. So Nikki, will you except my final rose?”\n\nOf course she did, but he still never said “I love you!”\n\nSo, are they still together– tune in to After the Final Rose to see! Were you happy with his final decision, HollywoodLifers?

In the season 18 finale aired on Monday, March 10, the soccer stud took Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley to meet his family before choosing one of them.\n\nClare was the first to meet Juan Pablo\'s family in St. Lucia. His father Saul gave his approval, telling Clare, ""I love you"" in Spanish. Juan Pablo\'s mother admitted her son was ""sometimes very rude,"" and Clare said, ""It made me cry."" Still, Clare felt that ""he gets me."" She also told Juan Pablo\'s cousin, Rodolfo, that she\'s ""falling in love.""\n\nThings, however, got awkward during their final date. Whisked on a helicopter, Clare claimed Juan Pablo whispered something offensive when they landed. ""What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth. And I was shocked,"" she said. ""He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. ... It was insulting. It was offensive and it just made me feel awful.""\n\nClare later confronted Juan Pablo, saying that she would leave if he felt their relationship was ""just a physical connection."" He managed to convince her to stay, telling the camera, ""We have had our ups and downs but I know that she could be the one. I just know it.""\n\nWhen Nikki met Juan Pablo\'s family, his mother thought, ""She\'s very strong. If he chooses this girl, I think she is going to say \'yes.\' "" Nikki was confident that he would propose to her in a few days, while Juan Pablo was seemingly torn between the two. ""Can I keep both?"" he said to the camera.\n\nFor their final date, they had a boat ride. Nikki wanted to hear him say, ""I love you,"" but he didn\'t. She admitted to Juan Pablo that ""it\'s kind of scary,"" and he told her, ""However it\'s gonna be, it\'s gonna be.""\n\nBefore he left, Nikki gave him a photo of them kissing and a note that says, ""I love you."" He kissed her and said, ""I\'ll see you tomorrow,"" leaving Nikki in tears.\n\nWhen it\'s time for the final Rose Ceremony, Clare arrived first in a long turquoise dress. Calling her ""such an amazing woman,"" Juan Pablo said, ""I got to follow what I think is best for me and I have to say goodbye to you."" He tried to hug her but she pushed him away.\n\nClare was clearly upset as she told him before leaving, ""I lost respect for you."" She added, ""I saved this moment for the man of my dreams and I thought that was you... What you just made me go through - I would never want my children having a father like you."" His response was, ""Whew! I\'m glad I didn\'t pick her!""\n\nNikki later showed up in a blue dress with a thigh high slit. She spoke first, telling him, ""I want you to be a part of my life. I\'ve never felt like this before. ... I\'ve waited a long time for this. ... I can\'t imagine spending my life without you. ... I love you.""\n\nJuan Pablo said, ""Nikki, I love so many things about you. ... You\'re like me, very honest. ... It\'s been a perfect time every time I\'ve been with you."" He continued, ""I have a ring in my pocket, but I\'m not 100|percent| sure that I want to propose to you. But I\'m 100|percent| sure I don\'t want to let you go. I like you a lot.""\n\nHe asked her if she would accept his final rose and she answered, ""Absolutely."" They kissed and he lifted her up.\n\nDuring the ""After the Final Rose"" special, Clare couldn\'t hide her anger. She didn\'t want to meet Juan Pablo and said before exiting, ""I don\'t want to sit here on this couch and get fed any more b.s.""\n\nJuan Pablo entered later, explaining his relationship with Clare, ""We had a roller coaster. We lived through it. It worked out the way it worked out. I have nothing bad to talk about Clare. She was there for a reason. I\'m not the guy.""\n\nJuan Pablo returned backstage when Nikki came out. She said she\'s still in love with Juan Pablo, but when asked if he loved her, she said, ""Um, I don\'t know."" Though he didn\'t say it, Nikki said, ""I know that he does. He wouldn\'t be here if he didn\'t care about me.""\n\nJuan Pablo then returned on stage and joined Nikki. He said they\'re ""very happy,"" but refused to say if he loved her when pressed by host %cChris Harrison%. ""I\'m not going to answer that question. People don\'t understand that this is real life... We\'re very happy We\'re done with the show. We are so done. We are happy we had the opportunity.. .It\'s been tough. You have been boxing with me.

The worst — and most bizarre — season of ""The Bachelor"" is finally over.\n\nAfter a rocky season filled with tears, anger and controversial comments, Bachelor Juan Pablo did not get down on one knee to propose to a lucky bride-to-be in Saint Lucia. Instead, he offered the last woman standing, Nikki Ferrell, just a rose.\n\n“I can’t imagine spending my life without you,” Nikki, 26, told Juan Pablo, clearly expecting a diamond ring. “I love you.”\n\n“I can see you as a good stepmom for Camilla,” Juan Pablo, 32, said. “It’s been a perfect time every time I’m with you.”\n\nThen it got awkward.\n\n“I have a ring here in my pocket and I’m not going to use it,” he said. “I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go. I like you a lot. So, Nikki, will you accept my final rose?”\n\n“Absolutely,” Nikki said.\n\nReally?\n\nRunner-up Clare Crawley’s departure was just as uncomfortable.\n\n“I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along,” Juan Pablo told Clare. “But I have to follow what I think is best for me. I’ll have to say goodbye to you.”\n\nClare is livid.\n\n“This entire time I’ve stuck around because I believed in you,” she said, fighting back tears. “I needed that reassurance [on our date last night] and I gave you that opportunity right then.”\n\nClare was alluding to an off-camera moment during the pair’s last date, when Juan Pablo told Clare he barely knew her at all.\n\n“He told me that he really doesn’t know me and then said some sexual thing,” Clare said the night before. “It was insulting and it made me feel awful. The words he used…I can’t even repeat it.”\n\nClare cited Sharleen Joynt and Andi Dorfman, two women who exited the show as soon as they weren’t feeling the relationship.\n\n“You had every opportunity like those other girls did to tell me how you felt,” she said. “I lose respect for you. I would never want my children having a father like you.”\n\nOuch.\n\nEven more ouch? Juan Pablo’s comment under his breath when Clare ran away in tears.\n\n“I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”\n\nThe show got even more bizarre during the live “After the Final Rose” special after the taped finale.\n\nJuan Pablo and Nikki made their first appearance in public together, and while most “Bachelor” couples gush about finally being able to appear together after three months of hiding, profess their love repeatedly and show off engagement rings, the mood was quite awkward and emotionless.\n\n“So you love her?” host Chris Harrison asked.\n\n“I’m not going to answer that question,” Juan Pablo said. “People don’t understand this is real life. We’re very happy and we are so done with the show.”\n\n“So….you’re not gonna tell us you love her?” Chris asked, obviously baffled. “This is what this show is about. We’re on this journey with you. This is your time to shine. You can express your feelings.”\n\nChris polled former “Bachelor” alums in the audience, newlyweds Catherine and Sean Lowe, who tried to explain to Juan Pablo that he signed up for a reality show and the spotlight is part of the deal.\n\n“Don’t bite the hand that fed you,” Catherine said, to loud applause from the studio audience.\n\n“This is a real relationship to us,” Nikki said. “We’re taking it very seriously. He has a daughter, he doesn’t just have himself to think about.”\n\n“Sorry the show didn’t end up like you guys wanted it to,” Juan Pablo said, to boos from the audience.\n\n“This is so awkward,” Chris said laughing, as he tried one more time to get just a bit of information from the couple by asking them their plans for the future.\n\n“We have our plans,” Juan Pablo said. “It’s something we want to keep private.”\n\n“Bachelor” fans breathed a collective sigh of relief when the show cut to a commercial break and Chris was able to announce the new Bachelorette — Atlanta assistant district attorney and fan-favorite — Andi.\n\nThe new season of “The Bachelorette” premiers May 19.', 'After a rocky season filled with tears, anger and controversial comments, Bachelor Juan Pablo did not get down on one knee to propose to a lucky bride-to-be in Saint Lucia.\n“I can’t imagine spending my life without you,” Nikki, 26, told Juan Pablo, clearly expecting a diamond ring.\n“I love you.”“I can see you as a good stepmom for Camilla,” Juan Pablo, 32, said.\n“I appreciate you being here and trusting me all along,” Juan Pablo told Clare.\n“We have our plans,” Juan Pablo said.']"

Galavis accused his host of repeatedly interrupting him, while refusing to go anywhere near saying he “loves” Ferrell, even though the 26-year-old woman has said multiple times that she has fallen “in love” with him.

If you haven’t yet seen the March 10 season finale of Juan Pablo Galavis’ season of the Bachelor, don’t continue reading!\n\nIn what will surely be one of the most contested, debated Bachelor seasons ever — so many tears! — season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis gave out his final rose to one, er, lucky lady. In the end, the polarizing 32-year-old Venezuelan-born hunk’s final choice was between hairstylist Clare Crawley and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell. So which “lucky” lady got the final rose? Let’s recap!\n\nPHOTOS: Juan Pablo's bachelorettes\n\nThe action begins in St. Lucia, with both Clare, 32, and Nikki, 26, meeting Juan Pablo’s straight-talking family. Clare’s up first, and she wastes no time before telling Juan Pablo’s mom, Nelly, that she’s in love with her son. Nelly, in turn, answers honestly when Clare asks if Juan Pablo has any ticks she should know about. “He’s hyperactive,” she replies. “He sometimes is very rude.” Juan Pablo’s cousin Rodolfo has some harsh truths for Clare, too, telling her that the man she’s in love with is the kind of guy who will walk away when things “get rough.” None of this changes Clare’s feelings, though; she maintains that it’ll be “the best day of [her] life” if Juan Pablo proposes.\n\nNikki gets more of the same from Juan Pablo’s family. “He’s not an easy guy,” Juan Pablo’s father warns her. “It’s always about what he wants.” To drive the point home, Nelly tells Nikki that the fantasies she has of their life together — game nights and family beach trips — are just that. “You feel he is the kind of guy you want?” Nelly asks. “You’re sure?” Nikki insists she is, but it’s kind of hard to believe, given that even Juan Pablo’s family doesn’t seem to like him all that much.\n\nPHOTOS: Bachelor proposals, promise rings and breakups\n\nMoving on to the final one-on-one dates! Clare’s up first again, and she happily joins Juan Pablo on a helicopter ride over St. Lucia. Somewhere between takeoff and landing, though, the “happily” part goes away. Once on solid ground again, Clare reveals Juan Pablo whispered something in her ear that she can’t bear to even repeat. “What I thought was going to be sweet, kind, loving words was not what came out of his mouth, and I’m shocked, she says. “He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. That he doesn’t know me and some sexual thing I don’t want to repeat. It was insulting and it was offensive…Maybe I have him all wrong. Maybe he’s not the man I thought he was.”\n\nLater that night, in her hotel room, she confronts Juan Pablo about what he said to her. He deflects any blame from himself and tries to gloss over the situation by saying that he’s just struggling with the decision he has to make between her and Nikki. He also assures Clare that she’s special to him, and even goes so far as to say that if they end up together, they’ll have a baby in no time. “Now it’s like I know it’s definitely a lot more than physical attraction between us,” she says in a confessional, apparently satisfied with his explanation. “Tonight, I know that he wants me here.”\n\nPHOTOS: Failed reality TV romances\n\nAh, but what about tomorrow? Nikki’s final one-on-one date is up next, and she and Juan Pablo can’t keep their hands off each other. There’s a lot of making out — but what Nikki really wants is for Juan Pablo to tell her he loves her. “I’m in love with this guy,” she gushes. “I want forever with him. I do!”\n\nThe question, of course, is whether he wants the same thing with her. Fortunately, she doesn’t have to wait long to find out. After a brief commercial break, the camera zooms in on Juan Pablo at the final rose ceremony, where he’s waiting to meet Clare. He feeds her some platitudes about how “unbelievable” and “amazing” she is, and then cuts to the chase: “I wish the earth sucked me today, because this is the hardest decision.” Clare is heartbroken — but more than that, she’s angry, and she rejects Juan Pablo’s goodbye hug. “I’ve saved this moment for the man of my dreams, and I thought that was you,” she says bitterly. “What you just made me go through — I would never want my children having a father like you.”\n\nPHOTOS: Bachelor stars' scandalous pasts\n\nJuan Pablo’s response? “Whoo! I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”\n\nSo how does he feel about the woman he did pick? Lukewarm, apparently. Though he “chooses” Nikki at the final rose ceremony, he’s not quite ready to tell her he loves her. “I love how much you care about other people,” he begins. “I love your honesty, so much…I can see you as a good stepmom for Camila.” That said, he’s not ready to see her as a good wife for himself. “I have a ring in my pocket, but I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you,” he confesses. “But I’m 100 percent sure I don’t want to let you go. I like you a lot. A lot.”\n\nGood enough! “Nikki, will you accept my final rose?” he asks. “Absolutely,” she replies.\n\nEnd scene!

Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.\n\nThe contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.\n\nThe first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.”\n\nThe series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.\n\nThough “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run.

They both meet Juan Pablo’s mother, father, cousin, brother, sister, daughter, and niece. Juan Pablo’s family is amazing in that they are not one hundred percent on #TeamJuanPablo. All of them express concern that Juan Pablo isn’t great in relationships and needs someone who will stick with him and not run because that’s what he tends to do. Juan Pablo’s mom tells Clare, “He is sometimes very rude.” Clare responds that he made her cry and the mom says, “Me too.” Basically, this guy is trouble and his family knows it. Juan Pablo’s mom has another great quote she tells to Nikki that sums everything up, “He is charismatic, but Juan Pablo is not easy.”This is when things start getting wild. Clare and Juan Pablo go for a helicopter ride around St. Lucia and we find out that there was a point, during landing, when the cameras and microphones were off and Juan Pablo told Clare something. We find out because even though the microphones were off, that doesn’t mean Clare isn’t going to tell in the confessional as soon as possible. She says that JP told her he doesn’t really know her and made a weird sexual comment. She is very upset about it and I’m like, “Oh snap! Another lady is going to leave!” But not so fast…Later, Juan Pablo arrives to Clare’s hotel room for the second part of their date — calm your jets, it’s a suite and they’re just hanging in the living room — and she brings up what he said in the helicopter. He says something along the lines of, of course they don’t know everything about each other because it’s been such a short time and he tells her that he can see having babies with her very soon. It’s not a convincing argument AT ALL, but Clare gathers that this is reassurance and feels better, doesn’t leave, and is totally on board again.Nikki and Juan Pablo go on a boat (helicopter was already taken) and it’s totally boring. Absolutely nothing of interest happens. During the night time portion, Nikki gives him a framed photo of them riding horses (That time when he said if she was riding the horse in a thong , he would ride behind her. Yuck!) and a card that professes her love. I thought that at the end of the date he whispered something in her ear, which caused her to cry when he left, but it’s never brought up again so I guess she just cried because she was overcome with emotion.Clare enters the Rose Ceremony very confident. I mean, they have already been through two fights in their brief time together and so obviously that means that they have a strong foundation and not ""OMG get out because no one should fight that much that soon!"" Juan Pablo rejects Clare and seems totally calm and collected about doing it. Clare gets very upset, as she should, and tells him that she gave him a chance to let her go the other night, but he reassured her that she should stick around. (Again, he did an undeniably poor job of this.) She tells him that she lost all respect for him and that she would never want a man like him raising her children. Go Clare! I never really cared for her, but she told it like it was in this situation and I was glad to see her escape his clutches.The poison cherry on the top of all of this is that as soon as Clare is out of sight, Juan Pablo says, “Woo! I’m glad I didn’t pick her!” He. Is. The. Worst.Nikki shows up for her portion of the Rose Ceremony and as she approaches, Juan Pablo is shown holding an engagement ring and then a single rose. Nikki says her spiel about falling in love and Juan Pablo brings up the point her father made during hometown visits about not proposing unless he’s 100 percent sure. He tells her that he is not going to use the ring, but says “I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t wanna let you go.” Never says, ""I love you."" She accepts the rose and they live happily ever after for two weeks until she inevitably realizes that he’s a horrible boyfriend and definitely not husband material.Or maybe you watched the after-show and already know what goes down. We’re keeping it to the proper episode of The Bachelor here, so that’s all folks!', 'They both meet Juan Pablo’s mother, father, cousin, brother, sister, daughter, and niece.\nJuan Pablo’s family is amazing in that they are not one hundred percent on #TeamJuanPablo.\nAll of them express concern that Juan Pablo isn’t great in relationships and needs someone who will stick with him and not run because that’s what he tends to do.\nJuan Pablo’s mom has another great quote she tells to Nikki that sums everything up, “He is charismatic, but Juan Pablo is not easy.”This is when things start getting wild.\nClare and Juan Pablo go for a helicopter ride around St. Lucia and we find out that there was a point, during landing, when the cameras and microphones were off and Juan Pablo told Clare something.']"

We listened to Chris Harrison try every trick in the book to get information on this season of the show from Juan Pablo Galavis, and was met with a rude, arrogant, entitled guy who refused to play any part of the game.\n\nSo where is what Juan Pablo did. He refused to say that he loved Nikki Ferrell on-camera, he didn’t really want to be there, and he didn’t want to even say where he was going to live or what he was going to do with her.\n\nWhy was he so upset? Here’s our feeling on it: He said two weeks ago that his plans changed drastically, and our theory on that is that he was probably going to be on “Dancing with the Stars,” and ABC at the last minute decided that they didn’t want him on the show. (We can only imagine why.) If this theory is right, he’s probably annoyed at the network and wanted to take it out on the network by not being anywhere close to the same guy that he was at the start of the show. He really did, to quote Catherine Giudici during this segment of the show, want to bite the hand that felt them. We don’t exactly think that “The Bachelor” is the land of all that is good and holy and that people are always on the show for love, but we do certainly think that more often than not, they are at least open and accepting of what the duties are. We felt for Chris Harrison, and it’s not often that we feel for him.\n\nThis whole hour was a complete disaster, and ironically, we would have so much more sympathy for Juan Pablo if he was a guy who went through the experience, and realized after the fact while watching it that he doesn’t like the concept of fame and what has happened to him. Instead, he came across as a guy who was bitter that he didn’t get what he wanted from it, who said homophobic comments that he blamed on “culture,” and rather than actually raising good points about the parts of the “Bachelor” process that are clearly wrong and staged, looked like the biggest villain of all. We’re all relieved that this is now over, and we can move on. Hey look, Andi Dorfman’s the new “Bachelorette”! Let’s talk about her instead! Grade: F-, or something worse.

Perhaps that will come later.\n\nNikki told El Bachelor how much she loved him and he replied by thanking her and telling her that there are many things that he loves about her.\n\nHe then recalled how her father told him to be 100 percent sure before issuing a proposal.\n\n“I’m not 100 percent sure that I want to propose to you, but at the same time, I’m 100 percent sure that I don’t want to let you go,” he told her, adding, “I like you a lot. A lot. So Nikki, will you except my final rose?”\n\nShe nodded and said, “Absolutely.”\n\nHis decision left Clare Crawley, 32, the sensitive hairstylist from Sacramento, out in the cold — and very, very bitter.\n\nAfter breaking the bad news to Clare (“I have to say goodbye to you”), he moved in for a hug, but she fended him off — a move that drew cheers from the in-studio crowd watching a feed of the finale.\n\n“I saved this moment for the man of my dreams,” she said. “I thought that was you. And I thought I knew what kind of man you were.”\n\nThen she drove in the final dagger, hissing, “I lost respect for you. … What you just made me go through, I would never want my children having a father like you.” More cheers.\n\nAfter Clare stormed off, El Bachelor breathed a sigh of relief: “Hooo. I’m glad I didn’t pick her.”\n\nClassy guy.\n\nEarlier in the episode, Clare admitted that she was “falling in love” and said she could envision herself as part of J Pab’s family “forever.”\n\nOr not.\n\nActually, there were bad signs for Clare during her final date with J Pab. On a helicopter ride, with the cameras off, she said he told her something “insulting and offensive” that made her feel like an “object.” It was a “sexual thing,” she added. (Apparently about how he enjoyed hooking up with her).\n\nAlso on Monday, we learned who will be our next “Bachelorette.” During the “After the Rose” special, it was announced that Andi Dorfman, the 26-year-old district attorney from Atlanta will be handing out the roses. She became a fan favorite after she told off J Pab and left the show.\n\nDorfman made the final 3, but decided to leave after her overnight date in St. Lucia, where J Pab told her she made it to this stage by “default.”\n\nLike we said, classy guy.\n\nJuan Pablo was deemed by many fans to be the “worst” Bachelor ever. During the turbulent season, he stirred controversy by making intolerant remarks about gay people, and he was occasionally rude and dismissive toward some of the women. Many fans considered himself too blunt, too complacent, too arrogant, and worst of all, too boring.\n\nDuring Monday’s finale, even some members of El Bachelor’s family raised red flags about him. His brother, for one, spoke of how he tends to walk away from relationships when things get “rough.”\n\nBut how do you feel? Do you think J Pab and Nikki have what it takes to form a lasting partnership? And do you believe she’d be a good mother to his young daughter, Camila?

Clare confesses that it is really hard for her to re-watch the Bachelor finale, and she felt that Juan Pablo led her on by telling her he wanted to have kids and move away with her. She really thought he was going to propose to her, and instead he sent her home. Chris asks her what Juan Pablo said to her in the helicopter that was offensive, and Clare says she doesn’t want to repeat it. Clare admits she should have left after the disastrous helicopter date, and she wishes she had listened to her gut because it was “right on.” Clare “trusted the process of The Bachelor though” and hoped that she would find someone that wanted to fall in love and get married.\n\nChris Harrison asks Clare if she would like Juan Pablo to come out and speak to her right now about what happened in St. Lucia. Clare says that cursing Juan Pablo out in Saint Lucia was all of the closure she needed, and she has no desire to “get fed any more BC from Juan Pablo.”\n\nNext Chris Harrison brings Juan Pablo out to discuss Season 18 of The Bachelor. Chris asks Juan Pablo if he regrets his good-bye with Clare, but Juan Pablo is confident with his decision and says “it is what it is.” He knew that Clare would be hurt after he said good-bye to her, but it just “wasn’t there between them.”\n\nChris Harrison brings Nikki Ferrell out next to discuss her take of Season 18 of The Bachelor. According to Nikki, she and Juan Pablo are still together and they are very happy. She also confesses to Chris that Juan Pablo still has never told her that he loves him. She does say it has been difficult to make their relationship work, because they have had to stay in hiding until the season finale.\n\nJuan Pablo comes out on stage and joins Nikki and Chris. Chris asks Juan Pablo what his “big surprise is” and Juan Pablo has no idea what he is talking about, he says that there is no surprise. Chris asks Juan Pablo if he is going to tell Nikki that he loves her, and Juan Pablo says “that’s private.” Juan Pablo tells Chris Harrison that he appreciates the opportunity to appear on The Bachelor, but he and Nikki “are done with the show” and they are ready to live their own private lives. Chris tries to ask Juan Pablo another question and Juan Pablo tells Chris to “stop interrupting him.” Juan Pablo tells Chris that he is “sorry the show didn’t end the way everyone wanted, but they are taking their relationship slow and this is real life.”\n\nChris asks Nikki how long she is going to stick around waiting for Juan Pablo to tell her he is in love with her. Nikki says that as of right now “it feels right” so she doesn’t mind waiting. Chris asks her what their plans are now that the show is over, and Juan Pablo says “that’s private.”\n\nCatherine Giudici chimes in and says that “she is happy for them that they are happy, but she is confused. She doesn’t understand what is going on with Juan Pablo and Nikki.” She also adds that Juan Pablo needs to “stop slapping the hand that fed him,” she doesn’t like the way that Juan Pablo keeps dissing The Bachelor franchise.\n\nChris Harrison is speechless, he claims he has been doing this for 12 years, and this episode is by far a “Bachelor first.”\n\nChris adds that he is happy to move on from Season 18 of The Bachelor. Chris also announces that the 2014 Bachelorette is…Andi Dorfman. Andi joins Chris Harrison on the stage, Chris jokes and tells Andi that she shouldn’t be afraid to tell anyone on the show that she is in love with them (since Juan Pablo obviously had a problem with it). Overall Andi is excited to start her journey as the next Bachelorette, and she can’t wait to find her future husband.\n\nAndi Dorfman’s season of The Bachelorette will premiere on May 19th.\n\nTHE END!!!', 'In light of Andi’s allegations and her early departure, did these final two women see a different side of Juan Pablo or did they both find a true connection?\nDid Juan Pablo find love and hand out a final rose?\nBoth women are back to sit with Juan Pablo to talk about the shocking outcome of the show.\nTo kick off the After The rose episode, Chris Harrison brings Clare Crawley out to discuss the Bachelor Finale.\nChris asks Juan Pablo what his “big surprise is” and Juan Pablo has no idea what he is talking about, he says that there is no surprise.']"

In probably the series most awkward Final Rose Ceremony, Juan Pablo revealed that he did not want to get engaged to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse because he wasn’t 100% sure. But he claimed he was 100% that he didn’t want to let her go, meaning that Nikki uncomfortably accepted JP’s final rose with him stating that he did not love her, but instead “liked her a lot.” In direct comparison so Juan Pablo’s lack of emotions, before receiving the final rose from Juan Pablo, Nikki delved into a tender monologue professing how much she truly adored him and admitted that she does love him. Even though it’s becoming more and more obvious that Juan Pablo did not come to “The Bachelor” to find a wife, and a stepmother to his daughter Camila, Nikki unfortunately did look truly in love. She was nervous and could barely breathe as Juan Pablo revealed that she would not be able to call her mom and say she was engaged because he was not “going to use” the enormous diamond engagement ring.\n\nAs for the Clare and Juan Pablo interaction in this finale episode, the most controversial “Bachelor” shows once again that he is not to worlds most sensitive of leading men. When Clare arrives on the beach to meet with Juan Pablo, he does actually look nervous. While at first we thought that his nervousness was due to his genuine attraction for Clare, but now we are assuming it was more because he had led her on for too long and he was worried of her reaction. Clare’s voice over is actually even sweeter than Nikki’s she discuss her father, who tragically passed, however she is hopeful for what’s to come with Juan Pablo. When she first sees him, she speaks first revealing how she trusts him and believes him, but it seems Clare may have put her eggs in the wrong basket because Juan Pablo does not return her sentiments. Juan Pablo states that she is an amazing woman but that he must say goodbye, her goodbye is much more abrasive and we loved it! Clare looks devastated and doesn’t let him hug her as she turns to leave St. Lucia, but not first without telling him she lost respect for him and would never want to have a father like him for her kids. Juan Pablo reacts in his typical way, by being completely rude stating, “Whew! I’m glad I didn’t pick her,”\n\nWe are thinking that Clare really dodged a bullet with this one, because Juan Pablo is really proving himself to be rather heartless. We truly wish Nikki good luck however just from the Final Rose Ceremony and Nikki’s clearly deflated acceptance of the rose; we are assuming that the relationship won’t last. Juan Pablo seems to have never really expected to fall in love on season 18 of “The Bachelor.”', 'In probably the series most awkward Final Rose Ceremony, Juan Pablo revealed that he did not want to get engaged to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse because he wasn’t 100% sure.\nClare’s voice over is actually even sweeter than Nikki’s she discuss her father, who tragically passed, however she is hopeful for what’s to come with Juan Pablo.\nJuan Pablo states that she is an amazing woman but that he must say goodbye, her goodbye is much more abrasive and we loved it!\nJuan Pablo reacts in his typical way, by being completely rude stating, “Whew!\nJuan Pablo seems to have never really expected to fall in love on season 18 of “The Bachelor.”']"

There is nothing left for her to say as the video of that final day is closure enough for her…it is likely that comment he made after she left in addition to her standing up to him which she says was liberating.\n\nAfter the break, Juan Pablo enters the studio in the hot seat expressing relief and stating prayers for what is going on in Venezuela. At the “Women Tell All” Juan Pablo did not have any regrets. Does he now have any? He is defensive trying to get the point “It’s fine” is the comment about Clare and he has no regrets about what he said in the helicopter and glosses over his final remarks to Clare during his goodbye and afterwards but it should be no surprise to the television audience. Juan Pablo has not really taken responsibility for anything adverse this season.\n\nNikki comes out to talk about where things stand with Juan Pablo. She confirms there is a relationship with the bachelor but there is still no confirmation about his feelings for her. For her, it is okay that his actions speak louder than the words she desires to hear. Chris Harrison makes a point about the fact the words have not yet been uttered on Juan Pablo’s part. How long will she be willing to wait?\n\nWhat is Juan Pablo’s surprise? Is he finally going to propose to Nikki or will he break it off with her on national television? It is Nikki onstage with her beloved Juan Pablo. Chris Harrison mentions he stated there is to be a big surprise to which Juan Pablo says it is that they are happy and can now be out in the open after months of waiting for this final show.\n\nChris keeps prying to get the bachelor to open up about his feelings which he continues to run around the bush. Chris asks “Do you love her?” which Juan Pablo remains unable to state the words. Juan tells Harrison he interrupts him as his defense starts to show once more. Shawn Lowe jumps in and states when he knew he was in love with Catherine, he could not wait to tell her with a comment of “to each his own” aimed at Juan Pablo along with the clarifier people handle things in different ways.\n\nChris Harrison does not know what he is looking at; it is a dating situation. Clare defends Juan Pablo and the fact others have been onstage and declared love not there – which is a great point – and the relationship they have is real and progressing at the pace they are comfortable. Should audiences judge with suspicion not knowing what is behind closed doors away from the microphones and cameras?\n\nHarrison asks Nikki how long she will wait for the words. She says she will remain as long as it feels right. The relationship changed drastically before “Women Tell All” but it is not elaborated on and plans are to change beginning now but they are not expressed. Juan Pablo is extremely guarded, defensive, and demeaning to the public which is commented on by Catherine who says “Don’t slap the hand that feeds you.”\n\nIt is confusing and Juan Pablo remains completely oblivious to the dynamics of reality television and delusional, according to Shawn, he is now done with the show and is going to move on with his private life.

He also asked her to accept his final rose, and she said yes.\n\nWomack, who actually chose not to continue dating either of the final two women in his first season, went on to propose to Emily Maynard in his second season three years later, but that engagement didn\'t last.\n\nOther Bachelor stars who didn\'t propose include Alex Michel in season one, Bob Guiney in season four, Jesse Palmer in season five, Charlie O\'Connell in season seven, Travis Stork in season eight and Lorenzo Borghese in season nine.

He didn\'t propose to her, though.\n\n(ABC)\n\nJuan Pablo Galavis has spent weeks trying to find the perfect woman to be a stepmother to his 5-year-old daughter, Camila.\n\nHe thinks he has found her in Nikki Ferrell, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo. El Bachelor — so named because he is the first-ever Latino to star on the ABC reality show — gave Nikki the last rose of the season. But because he\'s not 100 percent sure he wants to marry her, he didn\'t give her the diamond ring in his pocket.\n\nJuan Pablo sent Clare Crawley, the 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., packing.\n\nJuan Pablo ""broke up"" with Clare before giving the last rose to Nikki. Clare was understandably heartbroken and shocked. She said Juan Pablo is not the man she thought he was.\n\nShe wished that he hadn\'t strung her along this entire time if he had known his feelings for her weren\'t there. Earlier in the episode, Juan Pablo apparently said something very insulting to her off-camera, while on a helicopter ride in St. Lucia.\n\nAs Wetpaint reports, Clare apparently asked Juan Pablo if he loves her.\n\nHis response? ""I really loved f---ing you."" Clare even repeated the phrase in her reaction to being dumped. That\'s pretty low, Juan Pablo.\n\nClare said she doesn\'t even care about his reasons for not choosing her. After she left, Juan Pablo said he was happy he did not choose her.\n\nNikki fully expected a proposal from Juan and seemed ready to accept it. Looks like her own dad\'s advice — that he shouldn\'t propose unless he\'s totally sure — really resonated with her man.\n\nIt\'s probably for the best. Do you think they\'ll actually end up tying the knot? Will Nikki be a good stepmom to Camila? Only time — or the hour-long special following the finale — will tell.\n\nUpdate following ""After the final rose"" special:\n\nJuan Pablo and Nikki are still together, but there has been no proposal. Juan Pablo hasn\'t even said he loves her yet, even though he feels as if he\'s in love. He seems to have an issue with how public ""The Bachelor"" wants their relationship to be — does he know he was just on a TV show?\n\nAnd Andi, the district attorney from Atlanta, is the next ""Bachelorette."" Everyone seemed happy to have the spotlight shift from the awkward Juan Pablo and Nikki to her bubbly, hopeful face. I thought Andi would have been smarter than to accept such an offer, but when you\'re desperate for love (and see a gigantic check waved in front of your face), I guess it\'s hard to resist.\n\nFOLLOW STAR-LEDGER ENTERTAINMENT: TWITTER • FACEBOOK', 'Juan Pablo sent Clare Crawley, the 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., packing.\nJuan Pablo ""broke up"" with Clare before giving the last rose to Nikki.\nEarlier in the episode, Juan Pablo apparently said something very insulting to her off-camera, while on a helicopter ride in St. Lucia.\nAfter she left, Juan Pablo said he was happy he did not choose her.\nEveryone seemed happy to have the spotlight shift from the awkward Juan Pablo and Nikki to her bubbly, hopeful face.']"

While his chemistry with Clare was off the charts, they clashed after a late night swim that he called a ""mistake"" — leaving her in tears.\n\nThen, in the finale, things turned rocky again when Juan Pablo made an offensive, off-camera comment to Clare. She confronted him in the evening, asking if their relationship was entirely physical. He assured her that he liked many aspects of her personality and talked Clare off the ledge.\n\nBut when it came to proposal day, Juan Pablo said goodbye to Clare. Angry and hurt, she lashed out at him.

Why would they even be at the finale in the first place? Obviously, ABC wanted to have a success story there, and possibly a distraction from what was a pretty terrible season.\n\nThis discussion was led by Chris Harrison, who put Catherine on the spot and asked her what her thoughts on Juan Pablo were. Her response? That she thought he was a “great guy” … and then tried to get some other words together. It’s a pretty bad position to be in for her, since she doesn’t want to completely bash someone on the show. Sean is basically the same way. They’re more ambassadors of good will and peace for ABC, and we have a feeling that so long as they stay married, they will continue to make the occasional appearance on the show to share a few thoughts here and there and updates on their marriage.\n\nAs for Juan Pablo, we have a much harder time thinking that he will be used for a lot of “Bachelor” promotion.

There was no deliberation from Juan Pablo Galavis on who to pick, a fight between him and Clare Crawley, and also the guy’s family practically warning the women that this guy may not be right for them.\n\nYet, this show has a way of doing funny thing to people. It gets in their head and distorts your opinion. It really makes you think that you are in love with someone who doesn’t really know you that well, and may make you feel better than you would about them in the real world. That is why it is so much easier to feel bad for some of the women on this season.\n\nDo we have a ton of sympathy for Clare Crawley right now? Yes and no. While her rejection of him was all kinds of awesome, she did ignore everything that was going on in her head for so long. She’s a victim of her own decision-making, since both Sharleen Joynt and Andi Dorfman were smart enough to walk away when they had a chance to do so. But, this guy was a TOTAL d-bag beyond question when he acted with no sympathy at her getting mad, and then said “glad I didn’t pick her” after she left.\n\nThis only left one woman in contention for Juan Pablo’s heart, and it was Nikki Ferrell … who we actually felt bad for tonight for the first time to date. She was getting completely strung along most of the episode, and while we understand “Bachelor” protocol is to not disclose your feelings for as long as possible, he could have at least done something more.\n\nSo did Juan Pablo actually propose to her in the end? Nope! Somehow, ABC tried to make a romantic moment out of the fact that he didn’t give Nikki a ring despite the fact that she wanted one, and he still barely talked about his own feelings. As a trainwreck, this was a big one; but as a romantic experience, what a disaster that was all drawn-out and ridiculous.

2585,http://news.lalate.com/2014/03/10/who-wins-the-bachelor-2014-did-juan-pablo-get-engaged-to-nikki/,entertainment,"['\n\nLOS ANGELES (LALATE) – Tonight, the woman who wins the Bachelor 2014 might not exactly get what she had hoped for. Did Juan Pablo get engaged, who wins the Bachelor 2014 tonight, and is there an After the Final Rose engagement surprise? When you tune into tonight’s Bachelor Final Results telecast, and sit back to learn who is the Bachelor 2014 winner, don’t flip your remote control. Bachelor spoilers before tonight’s telecast tell news that the Bachelor final results for March 10, 2014 may have a bigger surprise in the After the Final Rose telecast than in the Final Rose episode itself.\n\nDetails about who wins the Bachelor were revealed last winter. No, Juan Pablo did not get engaged. Yes, Nikki is allegedly the Bachelor 2014 winner. And finally, Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together. RealitySteve spoilers claim that, early on in the season, it was clear that Nikki was headed to becoming the winner. But when Juan Pablo picks Nikki in the final minutes of the telecast, he delivers, at least to her, a shocker. According to RealitySteve, Juan Pablo picks Nikki but does not propose. There is no engagement during the final rose, claims RealitySteve, and there is no engagement in the weeks after that episode aired as well.\n\nSo are Juan Pablo and Nikki still together? RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo and Nikki are still together officially. But reports have claimed that Juan Pablo has been allegedly dating other women, prompting claims that Juan Pablo was cheating on Nikki. Nevertheless, coming into tonight’s After the Final Rose, Juan Pablo is expected to tell ABC viewers that he is happy that he picked Nikki, and that he was reluctant to propose at that time.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 9\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 10\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 11\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 12\n\nBut what about this After the Final Rose Juan Pablo secret engagement? RealitySteve claims that an alleged “offer” was made to Juan Pablo to propose during tonight’s After the Final Rose. So does the Juan Pablo secret engagement happen, does Juan Pablo and Nikki get engaged in the After the Final Rose tonight? RealitySteve claims to know that the alleged offer has been made but does not know if the alleged offer has been accepted. That will be revealed tonight.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 13\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 14\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 15\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 16\n\nFor now, the big surprise may tonight be in the After the Final Rose telecast. But before the season started, RealitySteve said “When it’s all said and done, I think you’re going to hear a lot of things come out about this season, whether it be on my site, or in the tabloids, or coming from some of his girls Twitter and Instagram accounts, that presents overwhelming evidence to the fact that this guy … was never interested in finding a wife”. Juan Pablo has been called the worse Bachelor ever, even though his ratings have been strong.\n\nBut that could all change tonight with a possible surprise engagement. RealitySteve tweeted moments ago “The first 90 min of tonight’s show is basically pointless. As is every finale. Just get us to the ending since that what it boils down to.”\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 4\n\nSo will RealitySteve be correct tonight? “Yes, I’m aware I had the wrong ending last season. So if you already think that this ending is wrong, there’s nothing I can say or do to convince you otherwise. It is what it is.” He adds “Over the next three months, tabloids will run stories, people will email me saying they think I’m wrong, people will have theories on why this happened or that happened. And to that, I’ll take it all in and say ‘Thank you’ and just move on. Without giving up my sources and where I got this info, I can’t convince anyone who doesn’t want to believe it that this is the correct ending.”\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 5\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 6\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 7\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 8\n\nHe adds “Some will choose to harp on last season being wrong, and some will choose to look at my track record over the long haul and know I had the previous 7 seasons correct. It’s all what you choose to believe. This is how the show ends this season and I’ll leave it at that.”\n\nLALATE ABOUT THIS AUTHOR || Editor in Chief: Maria Stabile | Maria in ten years has propelled LALATE to become a leading news authority in sports, entertainment, and national news, LALATE has been cited in countless international newspapers (including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and LA Times), international television news broadcasts including ABC News, books including The Iraq War: Origins and Consequences, tv programs including MTV News, and magazines.

So will it be for Juan Pablo, either Clare, the 32-year old hairstylists from Sacramento, California or Nikki, the 26-year old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Missouri. Only time will tell, but both of the women have made serious impact on the Latino single father. So much so that Juan Pablo even introduced his daughter Camila to Nikki while the pair were in Miami.\n\nBut does the family introduction mean that Nikki is the winner of season 18 of “The Bachelor” and Juan Pablo’s heart? Most likely yes- multiple spoiler reports claim that tonight Nikki goes home with the final rose while Clare only goes home with her bags packed. But the one thing we have heard over and over again is that Juan Pablo didn’t actually propose to Nikki, something that according to Wetpaint, ABC wasn’t too happy about. So even though there is a winner in tonight’s “Bachelor” finale, there will most likely be no ring! However, I wouldn’t full rule out Clare just yet. In a deleted scene from tonight’s episode Clare and JP are seen relaxing sweetly together, when the romantic bachelor begins to play a special song for Clare, the moment between the pair is so sweet and tender that she actually starts crying. Then the couple go on to discuss playing the song at their wedding….hmm certainly sounds like she still has a shot at that final rose.\n\nNo matter who walks away with Juan Pablo and the final rose on the season 18 finale of “The Bachelor” you know it will be an entertaining one! That's why you must watch the finale tonight on ABC at 8 p.m. or if you can’t watch live on the TV be sure to tune in and watch “The Bachelor” finale online available via live stream after the live airing on WatchABC.com!"", 'Season 18 of “The Bachelor” has been a wild ride for Juan Pablo, but tonight it all comes to an end with the Final Rose Ceremony.\nSo much so that Juan Pablo even introduced his daughter Camila to Nikki while the pair were in Miami.\nMost likely yes- multiple spoiler reports claim that tonight Nikki goes home with the final rose while Clare only goes home with her bags packed.\nSo even though there is a winner in tonight’s “Bachelor” finale, there will most likely be no ring!\nNo matter who walks away with Juan Pablo and the final rose on the season 18 finale of “The Bachelor” you know it will be an entertaining one!']"

RealitySteve’s Bachelor spoilers claim that Juan Pablo does not propose to Bachelor 2014 winner Nikki Ferrell in tonight’s finale episode. You allegedly won’t see a Juan Pablo engagement during the final taped episode tonight. But RealitySteve tells news that Juan Pablo might propose to Nikki Ferrell on the After the Final Rose telecast, and there might be a surprise engagement.\n\n\n\nAfter the Final Rose telecasts usually deal with subjects like “are they still together”,” are they still dating”, and of course “are they still engaged”. But RealitySteve recently revealed a shocker about tonight’s telecast. “According to my sources, there is a …. offer on the table for Juan Pablo to propose to Nikki on the After the Final Rose show.”\n\nStrangely, RealitySteve tells news that he knows that the alleged offer to Juan Pablo was made but does not know if it was accepted by Juan Pablo. “That fact absolutely cannot be changed. As for what happens at the live ATFR, I don’t know. I know they are still together and they will be together when you see them on the ATFR.” But he adds “Will he propose?

Should be interesting.”\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 5\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 6\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 7\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 8\n\nTonight’s After the Finale Rose could leave more questions than answers. “I’m sure people will have their thoughts regarding the finale, the ATFR show, and what the future holds.” But Bachelor spoilers have yet to indicate if an engagement has been in the works.

Namely, RealitySteve says that Juan Pablo during the season, and in the finale, never wanted to propose to Nikki or any other contestant. “Regardless of if he proposes on the live show or not, the point is… He’s never going to marry Nikki. Nothing has changed with this guy since the very beginning. He doesn’t want to be married to her, he never wanted to be married to her”.

RealitySteve Bachelor 2014 spoilers claim that Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo are still together, they are still dating 2014, but that they do not get engaged in the finale episode tonight on ABC. The question is whether Juan Pablo will propose to Nikki on After the Final Rose.\n\nNikki and Juan Pablo were together, and dating, right after tonight’s episode was filmed. But there might not be anything more to that. RealitySteve tells viewers that false tabloid reports have been heating up this month. RealitySteve suggests in his spoilers that are not any real surprises tonight. The episode was filmed without much drama. Juan Pablo didn’t choose Clare. And while Nikki was expecting a ring, she does not get one. “The overnight date portion of this season took place at or near Sugar Beach, which was where the rose ceremony was. Then for the final rose ceremony which took place Tuesday, November 12th, I originally reported it was going to be at The Landings resort.” RealitySteve adds “That was mistaken. The final rose ceremony took place at or near the Cap Maison Hotel. Both Clare and Nikki showed up, he didn’t send one home early or anything like that. And in the end. Juan Pablo chose Nikki, but he did not propose”.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 5\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 6\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 7\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 8\n\nBut the real confusion tonight won’t be over who wins, but how they win.

Only Juan Pablo knows the true answer. And hopefully he will be asked that in After the Final Rose. But RealitySteve claims an alleged motive by Juan Pablo. He asserts that Juan Pablo allegedly never wanted to propose to any of the women in this case. “However, for Juan Pablo, I’d say it’s more about him never wanting to propose to any of these girls in the first place before he even started this journey.”\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 13\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 14\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 15\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 16\n\nBut the vacuum of confusion remains on the future of Nikki and Juan Pablo.

(Cue the Chris Harrison voiceover).\n\nIt\'s understandable when all of us viewers (whether you love or hate the show) complain about Juan Pablo\'s annoying idioms and utter lack of emotional attachment to anyone other than his daughter, Camila. But, you know it\'s bad when Juan Pablo agrees …\n\n""The Bachelor"" star tweeted to promote the series finale on Monday, March 10, and said what we\'ve all been thinking:\n\nThe day has COME...

For once, Juan Pablo seems to really know what he\'s talking about!\n\nSo, on that note, let\'s take a look back at Season 18 -- in all its melodrama -- from the beginning.\n\nOne of the girls, Clare, was crazy enough to fake a pregnancy right off the bat and still made it to the final two.\n\n\n\nThe stress of it all lead one girl to drink a little (or a LOT) too much and put on quite a show.\n\n\n\nOne man dating 27 women is asking for confusion and heartbreak, like the time Kylie thought her name was called, but it wasn\'t.\n\n\n\nThere\'s always the character who is a bit more open with her body. Gotta spice things up …\n\n\n\nJuan Pablo has always made sure to push the girls to the edge of their comfort zone and a bit into the panic range. Remember when he asked Andi to pose naked?\n\n\n\nAs in any good soap, alliances formed and rivalries blossomed, notably between our final two, Nikki and Clare.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo cement the similarity, it\'s been impossible to tell who is actually the crazy one.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Juan Pablo is just going along his merry way -- confused as ever. Whether it\'s the girls, his grasp of the English language or his unwillingness to emote, our protagonist is always a few steps behind.\n\n\n\nOf course, this lead him into a few muddy situations: for one, the time he had a late night ""swim"" with Clare and blamed her for inappropriately coercing him.\n\n\n\nOr the time he eliminated Cassandra on her birthday, which led to her breakdown about how long she\'s been waiting to find the love of her life. (Keep in mind that she was turning 22 years old.)\n\n\n\nOf course, not everyone blindly swooned over Juan Pablo\'s Latin charm. His obvious favorite, Sharleen, turned the tables and disappointed our main man.\n\n\n\nOthers, like Renee, fell in love before getting sent home.\n\n\n\nAs our soap comes to an end, tensions are high and drama begins to unfold … like the time Andi gave up and pointed out all of Juan Pablo\'s obvious flaws.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day though, there is only one thing any of us can say.\n\n\n\nTune in for the season finale of the Bachelor Monday, March 10, at 8/7c.', ""UNIVERSAL CITY, CA - JANUARY 07: Juan Pablo Galavis visits 'Extra' at Universal Studios Hollywood on January 7, 2014 in Universal City, California.\nFinally TODAY the soap opera comes to an END... 😃 — Juan Pablo Galavis™ (@JuanPaGalavis) March 10, 2014So, let's get this straight.\nEven THE Bachelor himself thinks this whole season (and debatably the whole show) is one, big soap opera?\nFor once, Juan Pablo seems to really know what he's talking about!\nMeanwhile, Juan Pablo is just going along his merry way -- confused as ever.""]"

Even though we haven’t yet watched the final rose ceremony, multiple spoilers reports claim that this season’s front runner did not end up winning Juan Pablo’s heart, instead Nikki Ferrell home the final rose. So why after several one on one dates, steamy make outs and, of course, their infamous moonlight ocean dip did Juan Pablo not choose Clare Crawley as the season 18 winner? Well because there are many more factors at play involved in choosing the final lady then just the amount of time JP and Clare spent together.\n\nThe main reason as to why Clare will not win Juan Pablo’s heart is mainly because Clare was too smart for her good, and unfortunately treated the dating competition as just that— a competition. Clare knew exactly how to get Juan Pablo’s attention, not because he was actively seeking her out, but more due to the fact that Clare knew how to put himself on his radar at every opportunity. Some simple examples of Clare’s tactics include her refusal to eat the octopus and then only tasting it “for him,” or the more well known and controversial ocean swim that led to Clare and Juan Pablo engaging in the earliest intimate night in the history of “The Bachelor.” Even though Clare was on the receiving end of most of Juan Pablo’s attention, she never really got to know him instead continually one-upped her fellow contestants.\n\nEven when they attempted to further their relationship, it was all based on psychical attraction rather than an emotional connection. Like Sharleen who notably eliminated herself from season 18, Juan Pablo and Clare have a serious magnetism to each other but it seems like that wasn’t enough for JP to choose to spend the rest of his life with her. More over the most important piece of evidence indicating that Nikki will receive JP’s final rose instead of Clare, is Camila. Juan Pablo introduced his young daughter to Nikki in Miami, and that is most likely the most important clue into telling us whom JP truly cares for.', 'Tonight’s finale of “The Bachelor” will finally conclude the sad chronicle of Juan Pablo on season 18 of ABC’s hugely popular series.\nEven though we haven’t yet watched the final rose ceremony, multiple spoilers reports claim that this season’s front runner did not end up winning Juan Pablo’s heart, instead Nikki Ferrell home the final rose.\nSo why after several one on one dates, steamy make outs and, of course, their infamous moonlight ocean dip did Juan Pablo not choose Clare Crawley as the season 18 winner?\nThe main reason as to why Clare will not win Juan Pablo’s heart is mainly because Clare was too smart for her good, and unfortunately treated the dating competition as just that— a competition.\nMore over the most important piece of evidence indicating that Nikki will receive JP’s final rose instead of Clare, is Camila.']"

Last fall, RealitySteve’s Bachelor 2014 spoilers announced who Juan Pablo picks. Final results for The Bachelor tonight March 10, 2014 reveal if the Bachelor 2014 winner is in fact just as RealitySteve predicted, and if Juan Pablo makes his pick consistent with months of RealitySteve spoilers.\n\nTonight the mystery over who wins the Bachelor 2014 is resolved. And if Reality Steve’s spoilers are correct, tonight ABC viewers will watch the Bachelor 2014 name Nikki Ferrell as your winner. The question remains, however, what happens thereafter. Details about why Juan Pablo picks Nikki, how he picks Nikki, and more important, what happened to Juan Pablo and Nikki after filming ended, remain uncertain.\n\nRealitySteve tells news today 3/10/14 that viewers should ignore tabloid reports about Juan Pablo. Does Juan Pablo live with his parents, is Juan Pablo broke, and does Juan Pablo deliver an engagement to Nikki in the finale tonight? For several seasons, tabloids have historically delivered fake spoilers in advance of the finale. These “faux spoilers”, as LALATE called them last year, involve tabloids telling readers that they have juicy spoilers about the season finale, when in fact the tabloids know that the spoilers are actually untrue.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 1\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 4\n\nSteve says Juan Pablo picks Nikki, Juan Pablo does not propose to Nikki, Juan Pablo and Nikki are still not engaged, but that they are still together. However, RealitySteve has been telling readers allot lately that “it means nothing.” But has not yet clarified what he means. For example, on Monday he tweeted “As four tonight spoiler, nothing has changed since St. Lucia. Ignore the tabloid reports. Juan Pablo. & Nikki still together, even though it means nothing.”\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 2\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 5\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 6\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 7\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 8\n\nBut could RealitySteve be wrong? He has been wrong before. Last season on the Bachelorette, it appeared in the penultimate episode that RealitySteve’s spoilers were going to be wrong. Reaction heated Twitter the night of that episode. But RealitySteve defended his predictions. In the end, his Bachelorette spoilers were wrong. And yet, Steve has never truly told viewers how, where and why those spoilers turned out to be wrong, very wrong.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 3\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 9\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 10\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 11\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 12\n\nAlong with tonight’s episode have come other predictions about the finale’s editing. “ABC is gonna have to do one h–ll of a spin/editing job this season. First, knowing that the spoilers are out there, they’ll edit the show to throw people off in any way they can”, Steve told news. But that has not exactly happened.\n\nNikki Ferrell Pictures Set 4\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 13\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 14\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 15\n\nNikki Ferrell Photo 16\n\nSteve adds that “And secondly, to convince America this guy is sincere … let’s just say the light isn’t even on upstairs and nobody’s home.” Steve did correctly predict backlash about Juan Pablo this season. So far Juan Pablo has appeared on several magazine covers being called the worse Bachelor ever. That type of reaction was predicted by RealitySteve last winter. “But this notion that this is the best Bachelor they’ve ever had and what a great season it’s going to be is all propaganda.

2633,http://nypost.com/2014/03/10/the-seven-best-moments-from-this-years-bachelor/,entertainment,"['It will be a battle of the blondes on the season finale of “The Bachelor” Monday night, when 32-year-old Venezuelan single dad Juan Pablo Galavis will have to choose between hairstylist Clare Crawley and pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell. Whom will he choose? Will the two women, sworn enemies, utter a single word to each other? It’s anyone’s guess, but it’s certainly been a crazy season. Here are our favorite moments from this season of El Bachelor:\n\nBaby bump alert!\n\nWhen Clare arrived at the opening-night ceremony wearing a prosthetic baby bump. Gentlemen, when a woman shows up for a first date pretending to be pregnant, you can’t say you haven’t been warned about any manner of crazy that ensues. Points awarded to Clare for truly bizarre humor, though.\n\nMeet Lucy: the “free spirit”\n\nContestant Lucy — whose occupation was listed as “Free Spirit” — and her inability to keep her clothes on. Whether she was happily strolling down the street nude to promote animal adoption or flashing everyone in the pool, Kate Upton BFF Lucy Aragon seemed far more interested in having fun than in pursuing any great love connection with blond, bland Juan Pablo. For this, Free Spirit Lucy, we salute you.\n\nThe Vietnamese Beach Incident (a.k.a. Juan Pablo slut-shames Clare)\n\nGetting caught up in the spontaneity of a moment, Clare knocked on JP’s door and invited him for a midnight swim; he happily accepted, and there was a wild makeout session in the water. We didn’t hear any complaints until the following day, when JP announced that the hookup had been a mistake — he has a 4-year-old daughter, after all. Clare was ashamed; tears flowed, and “I have a 4-year-old daughter” was firmly established as JP’s favorite convenient excuse (followed closely by “English is my second language”).\n\nAndi’s dad\n\nHy Dorfman became the toast of Bachelor Nation during the show’s “Hometown Visits” episode, wherein Juan Pablo visited four contestants and their respective families. When asked if he would give his blessing to Juan Pablo and Andi, Hy turned the question on Juan Pablo, asking him how he would feel if his own daughter came to him with a man who was dating several other women. “If I seemed over-protective on the show, it is because I am protecting the most spectacular, special, amazing daughter in the world,” Hy tweeted after the show. The best part? If Andi Dorfman becomes the next Bachelorette, as has been widely speculated, we’ll get to see more of Hy.\n\nChris Harrison’s barely concealed disdain for Juan Pablo\n\nThe host’s normally jovial demeanor has been cool this season; it’s clear from his flinty-eyed glances that he thinks Juan Pablo is a huge tool. In that estimation, he is far from alone; the hashtag “WorstBachelorEver” had plenty of entries on Twitter, and E! News published a recent story saying that Juan Pablo would not be cast on season 18 of “Dancing With the Stars” (he was reportedly seriously being considered at one point). It didn’t help when Juan Pablo said a gay “Bachelor” doesn’t belong on TV because gays are “more ‘pervert’ in a sense.” He blamed it on the language barrier. Nice try.\n\nSharleen says bye-bye to ‘The Bachelor’\n\nProfessional opera singer Sharleen Joynt was a breath of fresh air on the show, a gorgeous, smart woman who, while physically attracted to Juan Pablo, felt she was missing that “cerebral connection” she needed. “I wish I was a little dumber,” she said, frustrated with her tendency to “overthink” situations (not a problem shared by Juan Pablo). She mystified many of the other women, who seemed truly baffled that Juan Pablo was intrigued by the brunette. (Ladies, a hint: It could have had something to do with the fact that she wasn’t falling over herself to date him.) Sharleen eventually left of her own accord, a refreshing change from the usual tearful rose ceremony rejection with the guy calling all the shots.\n\nAndi dumps Juan Pablo and ‘es okay’\n\nFellow gorgeous smart woman Andi was another contestant to feel that Juan Pablo’s charms were only surface level; after a night in the Fantasy Suite that was anything but fantastic, she elected to leave as well. Juan Pablo’s response to this breakup? “Es okay,” he said, shrugging. And then, several more times throughout the farewell conversation: “Es okay.” We hope he’s looked into copyrighting this phrase; while “DWTS” doesn’t look like it’s going to pan out, there are always T-shirts and coffee mugs to be sold.', 'Meet Lucy: the “free spirit”Contestant Lucy — whose occupation was listed as “Free Spirit” — and her inability to keep her clothes on.\nAndi’s dadHy Dorfman became the toast of Bachelor Nation during the show’s “Hometown Visits” episode, wherein Juan Pablo visited four contestants and their respective families.\nIt didn’t help when Juan Pablo said a gay “Bachelor” doesn’t belong on TV because gays are “more ‘pervert’ in a sense.” He blamed it on the language barrier.\n“I wish I was a little dumber,” she said, frustrated with her tendency to “overthink” situations (not a problem shared by Juan Pablo).\nShe mystified many of the other women, who seemed truly baffled that Juan Pablo was intrigued by the brunette.']"

He may be one of the better looking bachelors, but he’s definitely one of the least liked — which means this season of ‘The Bachelor’ was one of the most explosive ever.\n\nDuring Juan Pablo‘s search for love, he encountered many (and we mean many) hilarious OMG moments. Somehow, we cut down the tons of crazy Bachelor moments down to six — and with the finale taking place March 10, we’re reminding you of the best, worst, and just all-around awkward moments on season 18. Click through our gallery to relive each and every one.\n\n‘The Bachelor’ Craziest Moments\n\nWhile I’ll let you click through the gallery of the best moments, I have to run down some of most shocking moments of the season that I still can’t believe even happened. [hl_ndn videoid=”25661214″]\n\nThe best moment of the entire season was when Andi Dorfman told JuanPabs exactly what he needed to hear — it’s not ok to only talk about yourself on every single date, it’s not okay to just kiss when you’re not talking about yourself, it’s not okay to bring up your overnight date with Clare on your overnight date with Andi, and it’s not ok to to tell someone they “barely” made it this far. Oh, and most importantly, it’s not ok to say “ees ok” after every statement. Then she tells him she’s over it. Even at the Women Tell All special, she said that she pretended to be asleep that night so the overnight date would be over. Ouch!\n\nHowever, Andi wasn’t the first to leave voluntarily. Sharleen was a favorite of JP’s all along, but since day one, she wasn’t sure she was totally into it. While their sexual chemistry was apparently really good (and the kissing was really bad to watch) , she pretty much told Juan Pablo she couldn’t see him as the Juan for her. She also told the cameras continually that pretty much, she was too smart for him. She actually said at one point, “I wish I was dumber.”\n\nThey definitely had a connection, as did Juan Pablo and Andi — but both the girls (in my opinion) took the right route and got out of there!\n\nNikki Rocks ’70s Cowgirl Look\n\nOne more moment I’ve got to mention is that outfit that Nikki Ferrell rocked before she spent the night with Juan Pablo. They went horse back riding, so she wore pants, and they swam in the ocean, so she paired the pants with a bikini top — sounds ok? Well, we have to mention that the pants looked like a uniform from Woodstock, as they were wide-leg and floral print, and the bikini top had tassels all over it . . . Maybe she was going for ’70s cowgirl? The only thing more uncomfortable was that Juan Pablo told her if she wanted to just wear a thong, he’d be fine with that. Ugh!\n\nHollywoodLifers — click through the gallery of all the craziest moments on this season of the Bachelor, and then let us know which was the most shocking!

2635,http://www.ibtimes.com/bachelor-2014-spoilers-why-juan-pablo-was-worst-bachelor-ever-his-7-most-controversial-moments,entertainment,"['Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is coming to a close on ABC on March 10, and needless to say the 2014 season has been a complete mess. Rumor has it that the producers and crew members have dubbed Juan Pablo “the worst bachelor ever,” and in honor of that, we’re looking back at his seven most controversial moments this season:\n\n1. Not Kissing Lauren … And Then Kissing Clare\n\nJuan Pablo started off the season by making and breaking some rules. In episode 4, Lauren tried to kiss the bachelor but was immediately shot down. Juan Pablo tried to console her, but Lauren ended up in tears.\n\n“I know that you’ve kissed other girls,” she told him. But all Juan Pablo would tell her is that it’s not an easy situation. He proceeded to tell the cameras that he’s not on the show to kiss everybody … but then went on to kiss Clare shortly after.\n\n“I know I said I’m not going to kiss anybody,” Juan Pablo explained to the cameras. “But she’s sexy. She’s hot.”\n\n2. Juan Pablo’s Anti-Gay Remarks\n\nWhile doing an interview to promote his season of “The Bachelor,” Juan Pablo made an extremely controversial comment about the possibility of a future gay bachelor. The 32-year-old reportedly told The TV Page’s Sean Daly: “I respect [gay people], but, honestly, I don’t think it’s a good example for kids.” “The Bachelor” star continued that he finds gay people to be “more ‘pervert’ in a sense,” and that the show would be “too hard to watch.”\n\n“Bachelor” host Chris Harrison later told the Hollywood Reporter that he was “disappointed” in Juan Pablo’s comments and that they don’t reflect his feelings or thoughts on the subject. Juan Pablo ended up being confronted by rejected bachelorette Kelly during the “Women Tell All” special, and told her that they would discuss it after the show.\n\n3. Clare’s Ocean Drama\n\nFrom the start of the season, Juan Pablo shared a steamy connection with Clare – and things escalated between the pair in episode 5. After a group date in Vietnam ended up with the two in his private pool, Clare decided to pay the single dad a visit in his hotel room … at 4 a.m. Asking him to jump in the ocean with her, Juan Pablo stripped off his shirt in a blink of an eye and ran after the 32-year-old California native. Clare told the cameras that the two “just went for it” and that it was “pure bliss … in every way.” But Juan Pablo didn’t feel the same way.\n\nThe next day he pulled her aside and told her that he made a mistake. However Clare stood by her actions, telling the cameras that “there was no misunderstanding.”\n\n4. Sending Cassandra Home On Her Birthday\n\nJuan Pablo made a promise to single moms Cassandra and Renee that he would let them know immediately if he didn’t feel a connection with them so that way they wouldn’t be separated any longer from their children. And he did just that with Cassandra … on her 22nd birthday.\n\n“I’ve been thinking a lot,” he told her. “It’s been so hard for me because you’re so gorgeous, you’re funny, you’re so nice … I wish we were in the same chapter.”\n\nIt may not have been “controversial” that he dumped her on her birthday, but “Bachelor” fans did find it cruel.\n\n5. Sending Renee Home After Meeting Her Son In Hometown Dates\n\nAll season long Juan Pablo has called Renee and Cassandra his “special ones” because they are single moms. However after deciding to go on a Hometown date with Renee and meeting her son, he ended up dumping the 32-year-old. The move seemed hypocritical after he insisted throughout the season that he moved slow with her and was respectful of kissing her because he had her 8-year-old son, Ben, in mind. His decision to dump her after meeting Ben became even more controversial when he revealed a story about how Ben had been devastated over his mom’s last breakup.\n\n6. The Fantasy Suite ‘Nightmare’ With Andi\n\nAndi made it into the top 3, but when time came for her and Juan Pablo to spend some time away from the cameras in the fantasy suite things began to fall apart. While Andi stayed the night in the suite, in the morning she told the cameras that she couldn’t leave fast enough. According to the 26-year-old assistant district attorney, Juan Pablo spent the night “name dropping” and talking about his overnight date with Clare. She continued to tell the cameras that their evening was “unbelievable” and inappropriate” due to his inability to filter. “He thinks that he could say whatever he wants to say,” Andi explained, saying that it’s “just offensive.”\n\n7. The ‘Default’ Dilemma\n\nAndi chose to have a heart-to-heart with Juan Pablo about her decision to leave, and things proceeded to blow up. Juan Pablo told her everything was “OK” and that he respected her decision, but that wasn’t what Andi wanted to hear.\n\n“It’s not OK,” she fired back at him. “I put myself out there … it bothers me when you say it’s okay.”\n\nThe bachelorette then brought up the fact that Juan Pablo allegedly told her that she made it into the top 3 by “default.” However Juan Pablo told her that he didn’t say “default” because it’s not in his vocabulary … instead he told her that he may have said “you barely made it here.”\n\n“She put words in my mouth by saying that I used the word ‘default,’” Juan Pablo later wrote in his blog for People. “It was because of her comments in Atlanta about wanting badly to fall in love that I almost decided to bring Renee instead of her, but I followed my heart and feelings instead.”\n\nThe season finale of “The Bachelor” airs on March 10 on ABC at 8 p.m. EDT.

Even though this season is by most estimations terrible, and Juan Pablo Galavis is not exactly the most sought-after man in America (let alone his in Miami), people still watch.\n\nAs of right now, the biggest question for many is whether or not we are going to actually see him still with the person he picks, and we’ll find that out during the live “After the Final Rose” special tonight. If there is a woman still by his side, maybe she can give a much better explanation about why he comes off some badly than Juan Pablo has been able to give himself.\n\nAt this point in time, there’s not really even that much of a debate to us: Nikki Ferrell is almost surely winning the thing. Her relationship with Juan Pablo is so much more natural than anything that Clare Crawley has with him; there just seems to be a whole lot more there when it comes to drama, and we have already seen from him that this is not a guy who is particularly down for that. With his attention on his daughter, he probably just wants to say “it’s okay” to end every argument under the sun.\n\nAs for if Nikki (if this prediction is correct) is still with him, there are only three possible explanations as to why she would:\n\n1. She genuinely loves him, regardless of what any of the tabloids say about him and some of the things that he has said.\n\n2. She recognizes that there is more value in being with him when it comes to her career, or appearances that they could make together. (Then again, we don’t feel like that is necessarily true in this case.)\n\n3. She wants to put on a good face tonight, and then potentially end the relationship a little ways down the road.\n\nOf course, we want to hear all of your responses to these in the comment box below!

The evidence is a recently released deleted scene from season 18 of ABC’s hugely popular dating series, and the two subjects in the scene are none other than Juan Pablo and Clare, and like the rest of this couple’s alone time the moment captured on film is tender and romantic.\n\nThe competition has come down to just two women, Clare and Nikki, and tonight’s finale episode will have Juan Pablo choosing one of them to marry while the other one just sent home with just her bags in tow. But way back before the competition was narrowed down so severely Juan Pablo and Clare made waves in the literal waves by becoming the first “Bachelor” couple to how should we say this, take a “dip in the ocean” so early on in the competition. They were immediately attracted to each other from the gecko with the pair enjoying the first intimate one-on-one date for the season. During the date, Juan Pablo and Clare enjoyed a private concert from Josh Krajcik. Like many other couples after enjoying his music and show, they have come to consider Krajcik’s “No Better Lovers” their song. Before listening to it in the tender moment that was deleted from the season, they have danced to it before during another one-on-one date.\n\nJuan Pablo plays the sweet song off his cell phone while the pair are just lounging on the couch, the thoughtful gesture takes Clare by such surprise that she even begins to cry. The pair does begin their signature make out, with a bit of candid lip-syncing in between, before Clare announcing, “We should just play it when we get married.” While Juan Pablo does not immediately respond to her request for the wedding song, he does belt out a cute “baby” right in tune with the song, so we are assuming he agrees.\n\nObviously we are basing our assumption of who Juan Pablo picks off of spoilers, and while the king of TV spoilers Reality Steve claims that JP ends up picking Nikki Ferrell in the final rose ceremony, this exclusive video is making us second guess. JP and Clare had an immediate connection, and the pair are obviously attracted to each other physically, what we thought was lacking was their emotional connection. However, after watching them relaxing together and then JP produce a romantic surprise for Clare, we are thinking that these two are more in love than we first assumed. Clare obviously feels comfortable enough to openly discuss marriage with him, so much so that she is already planning the playlist.', 'The most controversial season of “The Bachelor” is finally coming to a close on tonight’s highly anticipated finale, but before we get rolling on our countdown and predictions there is a new piece of Juan Pablo evidence that we must consider.\nDuring the date, Juan Pablo and Clare enjoyed a private concert from Josh Krajcik.\nLike many other couples after enjoying his music and show, they have come to consider Krajcik’s “No Better Lovers” their song.\nJuan Pablo plays the sweet song off his cell phone while the pair are just lounging on the couch, the thoughtful gesture takes Clare by such surprise that she even begins to cry.\nClare obviously feels comfortable enough to openly discuss marriage with him, so much so that she is already planning the playlist.']"

Oh, who are we kidding? We knew it was Nikki since before the show even started, thanks to the spoilers populating the Internet. It just proves – the Bachelor may look unscripted, but there are things on the show that are decided by the network brass long before the fans even get a look in.\n\nIt’s now been a few months of Juan Pablo ‘searching for love‘, a.k.a. being a douche to the contestants and becoming the most hated Bachelor to ever grace our television screens. Although he’s sent home contestant after contestant every week on the show, Reality Steve has already confirmed that Nikki Ferrell will win the show, much before it even premiered. Since she did, indeed, end up in the final two, it’s hard to imagine that all the spoilers were inaccurate.\n\nNikki’s attitude and behavior might have also raised eyebrows, and nobody suspected that she would manage to make it to the final two – but alas, here she is. So even if the show is rigged, at least its consistent? Clearly, the brass doesn’t change its mind if they’ve decided that someone is going to win the show.\n\nHowever, with that being said, rumors have been abounding about the possibility of NO proposal at the end of this season. Not only that, but Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell apparently broke up months ago – either that, or Juan is still dating her as well as numerous other women at the same time.

Viewers of the ABC dating series might be … but it doesn’t sound like Juan Pablo and his lucky lady are.\n\nAfter weeks of group and one-on-one dates, Juan Pablo has finally narrowed down his search to two women – Nikki and Clare. But with the 2014 “Bachelor” season finale set to air on March 10, reports are surfacing that Juan Pablo and the winner are not going to have their “happily ever after.”\n\nAccording to E! News, Juan Pablo and the Season 18 winner have been fighting … a lot. “Producers are hopeful that they’ll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,” a source revealed to the site. “If they are together at the finale, it’s probably just an act.”\n\n[WARNING: Do NOT continue reading unless you want to find out who reportedly won Season 18 of “The Bachelor.”]\n\nBut who is the woman that Juan Pablo is struggling with? Who Juan Pablo chooses will not be unveiled until the end of the season finale, but Reality Steve (the all-knowing reality-TV blogger) revealed on his site that the Season 18 winner is none other than … Nikki! However Juan Pablo doesn’t reportedly propose to the 26-year-old pediatric nurse. Instead, Reality Steve claims that the 32-year-old single dad will simply “choose” to be with her.\n\nAs we previously reported, Season 18 of “The Bachelor” is set to come to a “shocking conclusion” as Juan Pablo prepares to make “one of the most difficult choices of his life.” However viewers will see that Juan Pablo isn’t the only one with a decision to make. Andi’s early departure could potentially throw both Clare and Nikki into a tailspin as they contemplate what went wrong, and if the same thing could happen to them.\n\nBut the real drama will come in the “After The Final Rose” special, which is set to air after the finale at 10 p.m. EDT. The special episode will feature a live sit down with Juan Pablo and host Chris Harrison as they discuss the final two women – Clare and Nikki. The bachelor will explain what was going on in his mind during his final few days in St. Lucia, all leading up to the “shocking outcome” of the 2014 “Bachelor” season. It’s during the “After The Final Rose” episode that Juan Pablo will finally be reunited with Clare or Nikki … and fans will be able to see whether tension between the two exists.\n\nCatch the Season 18 finale of “The Bachelor” on March 10 at 8 p.m. EDT on ABC.

First there were remarks he made in January that having a gay Bachelor would be “too perverted,” a comment that prompted ABC to respond that “Juan Pablo’s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show’s producers or studio.”\n\nThen there have been instances on the show the paint him as a womanizer, including a fantasy suite date with Andi where Juan Pablo seemed not too interested in learning about her. That ended with Andi calling out Juan Pablo for his behavior before taking herself off the show.\n\nThe Bachelor finale spoilers indicate an even bigger twist to end the show.\n\n[WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD]\n\nFor one, the blogger Reality Steve seems to think that Juan Pablo is more interested in himself than either of the two remaining women. While Steve does say that Juan Pablo ends up picking Nikki, but not actually proposing to her.\n\nSteve, who has successfully predicted the ending of all but one season so far, wrote:\n\n“Make no mistake about this season, and you can choose to believe me or not – this was a complete cash grab for Juan Pablo. He never had any interest in finding a wife on this show, or a step mother for Camila, or whatever else line of BS ABC will run at you all season. This guy wants to act, he wants to be in commercials, he wants to model, and he wants to be on Dancing with the Stars. Come the spring season, you can pretty much bet your a** that Juan Pablo will be on DWTS, even though he can’t dance a lick.”\n\nReports from after The Bachelor finale seem to bolster the idea. In February, Juan Pablo was seen at a Miami Heat game with singer Mayra Veronica, with witnesses saying the two were acting very much like a couple.\n\nAnother source told Life & Style magazine that Juan Pablo has been seen cozying up with at least three different women since the show wrapped, and none of them were the final two women on the show. The source also said that Juan Pablo doesn’t seem to have much direction in his life.\n\n“The cash is running out – fast,” the show insider told Life & Style magazine. “Nobody seems to know how Juan Pablo makes a living. During the week he spends his time going to the gym or the beach. His life in Miami seems rather mundane.”\n\nFans who want to see if The Bachelor finale spoilers come true can tune in to the episode, which airs Monday at 8 pm ET on ABC.', 'Though Juan Pablo started out as a fan-favorite pick to serve as the latest Bachelor, some of his actions this season have worn thin with viewers.\nThat ended with Andi calling out Juan Pablo for his behavior before taking herself off the show.\nThe Bachelor finale spoilers indicate an even bigger twist to end the show.\nWhile Steve does say that Juan Pablo ends up picking Nikki, but not actually proposing to her.\nIn February, Juan Pablo was seen at a Miami Heat game with singer Mayra Veronica, with witnesses saying the two were acting very much like a couple.']"

Unfortunately, that is because Juan Pablo will then sink his teeth into either Nikki or Clare, two unsuspecting women who came on a television show looking for a soulmate. Their national nightmare is just beginning. Claire had an early lead with all that ocean sex, and that deleted scene with the suggested wedding song might be a sure sign Clare is going to win. [Or a feint to distract us from Nikki’s success! ONLY TIME (and ratings) WILL TELL.] We’re not covering this, because Juan Pablo is a name we’d rather forget as soon as possible. We’d rather Clare and Sharleen hooked up and ditched Juan Pablo for the nearest tropical resort. But that’s why they don’t let us write about The Bachelor anymore—too much slashfic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nALSO NOTED\n\nRegular Show (Cartoon Network, 7:30 p.m.): We’re tickled because Regular Show is doing an honest-to-goodness Daylight Saving Time-themed episode—Mordecai and Rigby have to change all the clocks in the park.

Good, right? Not really! Brandon Nowalk reviewed the pilot for us pre-air, and he thinks it’s not good yet, but could be, ONLY IF YOU BELIEEEEVE! Read his review (AND BELIEVEEEEE) here.\n\nRick And Morty (Adult Swim, 10:30 p.m.): Back after a long hiatus is Dan Harmon’s animated spectacular, featuring a hapless kid and his alcoholic grandpa.

He & She laid the foundation for The Mary Tyler Moore Show, but the network didn’t always know what to do with the show.

In between his attitude on the show and his feelings on homosexuality and the r-word (which stirred up a lot of conversation earlier this week online), the folks over at public relations have been working overtime. Also, you have the editors desperate to still try and show that he is a good guy that should actually be sought after.\n\nAccording to a report from E! News, here are a laundry list of reasons why some powers that be are counting down the minutes until they can move forward and focus fully on “The Bachelorette” (which is likely to star Andi Dorfman from this season).\n\n1. The blatant statement from a source that most everyone involved “cannot wait for the season to be over.”\n\n2. There are rumors already that he and the woman that he picked at the end of the show are not getting along, which would hardly come along as a surprise. We know that it behooves ABC if the two are still together for the live “After the Final Rose” special, but at the same time, there’s a sadistic part of us interested more in a complete trainwreck where they break up in front of everyone. We don’t want to see heartbreak, but at the same time, it’s been hard to see how emotionally invested anyone really is with this season so far.\n\n3. Producers were extremely upset over how Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici’s wedding was at times overshadowed in the press by the comments Juan Pablo said about a gay Bachelor: “His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici’s wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine’s special weekend.” This quote sounds a little dramatic since the wedding special still seemed perfectly fine for the bride and groom, but maybe this quote is more of the smoking gun into why Juan Pablo, who was at one point invited to the wedding, was not in attendance.\n\nYou can get some more evidence about the disdain for Juan Pablo’s decision-making from Chris Harrison here, as he chided him earlier this season for flip-flopping on Clare Crawley.

Bachelor Nation has been tuning into the reality television show since January, and has watched Juan Pablo send home potential bachelorettes one by one, narrowing down his search for true love.\n\nBlogger and Bachelor spy, “Reality Steve” announced pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell would win this season of The Bachelor long before the season premiere on ABC. At first Bachelor fans thought he may be wrong after witnessing Nikki’s negative attitude and rude comments, it was hard to believe Juan Pablo would want to spend the rest of his life with Ferrell, let alone another week. Weeks went by though, and everyone seemed to either be eliminated or quit on their own behalf, and before we knew it the season was nearly over and Nikki Ferrell was in the Final Two. So, it appears Reality Steve was right after all, Nikki Ferrell will win Season 18 of The Bachelor.\n\nIf you were hoping to see Juan Pablo get down on one knee and propose to winner Nikki Ferrell during the season finale, then you are going to be seriously disappointed. Rumor has it there was no proposal at the end of this season, the winner Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo broke up months ago! They may take the cake for shortest Bachelor relationship ever. Since the season premiere of Season 18 of The Bachelor in January, Juan Pablo has been linked to numerous women, and none of them are Nikki Ferrell. If they are still together, then someone seriously needs to sit Nikki down and open her eyes to Juan Pablo’s wandering eye.\n\nNow that The Bachelor is almost over, how did you feel about Season 18? Were you as disappointed in Juan Pablo’s stint as The Bachelor as everyone else was?

This is the guy who has been at the center of everything, and to call him a letdown would be being far too kind. Instead, he has sank the show like a lead balloon, blamed his language barrier and culture differences for everything, and also apparently even annoyed a guy in Chris Harrison who is almost always on the side of his leading men and women.\n\nSo what did Juan Pablo do in this case that was so egregious? Entertainment Weekly posted a new behind-the-scenes video recently from earlier this season, and it is intense enough to stand out even in the midst of all the other crazy stuff that has happened as of late. Harrison is none too pleased about the fact that Juan Pablo completely told off Clare Crawley for making out with him in the ocean. The horror! This was a PG-rated romantic comedy compared to what Ben Flajnik did with Courtney Robertson.\n\nHarrison actually comes off better in this video that he does most of the time on “The Bachelor,” and it’s quite a bummer that this didn’t make it on the broadcast itself. It shows that he is a little more fair to the women than some of the we-don’t-watch-the-show-but-still-criticize-it pundits would like you to think. It also helps to further along the idea that most people with this season probably cannot wait for this to be over. Sean Lowe at this point may as well be Sir Galahad in comparison.\n\nRegardless of whatever we think about this season, it is still our duty to give you more scoop! Plus, we cannot help ourselves.

What Juan Pablo is perhaps missing is that not only was his word choice offensive, the indication that all those with mental disability lack the competence to read and not feed themselves crayons is just completely outlandish. Juan Pablo needs a stern lesson in the way of the world, and even is defense of his tweet was lacking claiming the difference in language to be the major cause for concern. The implication and insensitive nature of the joke is offensive, in addition to his use of the r-word.\n\nJuan Pablo’s apology/defense of this joke continued throughout the day with the singe dad also tweeting, ""Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture."" His hastags may be the most telling pat of this apoplgy, which truly shine light on the issue of jokes of this nature. By urging most likely Americans and fans of The Bachelor” to “learn culture” Juan Pablo should take a piece of his own advice and realize that America is a very politically correct country that actively works to openly accept all people. Moreover the insistence to “open your mind” is truly laughable considering Juan Pablo himself is too ignorant to see what hurtful words and comments can do to those who are perhaps already suffering. Do I think he intentionally meant to offend anyone? No-but he should perhaps take some of his own advice and open his mind to the culture of the US and learn acceptance.', 'The joke, which to clarify was not written by Juan Pablo, but was retweeted to his Twitter profile read, ""Not every flower can save love, but a rose can.\nAfter posting the tactless poem to his profile, Juan Pablo added “""JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..."" however since the backlash his comment of intense laughter and praise has since been deleted.\nBy urging most likely Americans and fans of The Bachelor” to “learn culture” Juan Pablo should take a piece of his own advice and realize that America is a very politically correct country that actively works to openly accept all people.\nMoreover the insistence to “open your mind” is truly laughable considering Juan Pablo himself is too ignorant to see what hurtful words and comments can do to those who are perhaps already suffering.\nNo-but he should perhaps take some of his own advice and open his mind to the culture of the US and learn acceptance.']"

On Monday, Juan Pablo will be forced to choose between Clare, a 32-year-old hairstylist from Sacramento, Calif., and Nikki, a 26-year-old pediatric nurse from Kansas City, Mo. And while viewers of the ABC series are dying to know who the single dad will choose, the main focus of the after-show will be on the next “Bachelorette.”\n\nAs we previously reported, “The Bachelor’s” season finale will run three hours instead of the normal two. But the third and final hour of the show won’t be dedicated to the final rose ceremony. Instead it will be the “After the Final Rose” special.\n\nAccording to a synopsis from ABC, “After the Final Rose” will feature a live sitdown with Juan Pablo and host Chris Harrison as they “discuss his final two women of the season, Clare and Nikki.” Juan Pablo will explain what was going on in his mind during his final few days in St. Lucia, all leading up to the “shocking outcome” of the 2014 “Bachelor” season.\n\nSpecial guests Chelsie, Kat, Kelly, Renee and Sharleen from Juan Pablo’s season of “The Bachelor” will be in the audience, along with former “Bachelor”/ “Bachelorette” success stories Sean and Catherine Lowe, and Desiree Hartsock and Chris Siegfried. And “After the Final Rose” will feature another mystery guest – the next “Bachelorette.”\n\nWhile the new “Bachelorette’s” name has yet to be released, many “Bachelor” viewers are speculating (and hoping) that Andi Dorfman will be named Juan Pablo’s successor. Andi quickly became a fan favorite in season 18, despite being the last girl to land a one-on-one date. Making it past hometown dates, Andi’s relationship with Juan Pablo went downhill after her overnight fantasy suite date with him turned into a nightmare. Andi accused Juan Pablo of “name dropping,” not listening to her, and telling her that she was in the final three by “default.” The pair had a nasty showdown in St. Lucia before Andi eliminated herself from the competition.\n\nAnd fans aren’t the only ones of Team Andi for “The Bachelorette.” Desiree Hartsock, who was “The Bachelor” in 2013, wrote on her blog that she believes the Atlanta woman will take the torch.\n\n“Andi stayed true to how she felt about Juan the day she decided to go home and [stood by her story of] what happened in the fantasy suite,” Des write. “Since she has been a fan favorite throughout this season, I am speculating that she will be the next Bachelorette.”\n\nDo you think Andi will be announced as the next “Bachelorette”?

You have to admit though, her break-up with Juan Pablo was really convenient. If she hadn’t ditched him after her Fantasy Suite date, then he may have chosen her for the Final Two, and then her chances of being the next Bachelorette would have been shot.\n\nAndi Dorfman appeared to be smitten with Juan Pablo after her home-town date. Then, everything came to a screeching halt after she spent the night talking to Juan Pablo in the Fantasy Suite, and realized he was arrogant, cocky, and inconsiderate. It seems suspicious that Andi traveled around the world with Juan Pablo for weeks, and appeared completely clueless that he was any of those things until the Fantasy Suite date.\n\nWe all realized it by the second episode of The Bachelor, it’s doubtful Andi didn’t pick up on it until the Fantasy Suite date. Also, the morning after Andi’s Fantasy Suite date, Juan Pablo gushed about how well it went, completely clueless that Andi was upset. Juan Pablo brought up a good point in interviews after the Fantasy Suite date aired, as much as I hate to admit this. If Andi was so upset during the Suite date, why didn’t she mention it while the cameras were off and air her concerns while they were in the room privately? Why wait until the next morning to bombard him with the news on camera and stage a very public break-up?\n\nNobody disagrees with Andi Dorfman, Juan Pablo is all of the things she said he was when she dumped him. But, you have to admit it is pretty convenient that she was perfectly okay with Juan Pablo’s arrogance, harsh honesty, and language barrier issues, until she realized she had an opportunity to be the next Bachelorette and could find somebody better.\n\nSo Bachelor fans, do you think the Bachelor producers took Andi Dorfman aside and offered her the position as the next Bachelorette if she dumped Juan Pablo before the finale? (Not that we really blame her.) You have to admit it, her sudden change of heart about Juan Pablo was really conveniently timed, and came out of nowhere.

While Renee and Sharleen had nothing but nice things to say about the 32-year-old single dad, some of the other girls had less than stellar reviews of the Season 18 bachelor.

In the Women Tell All episode Juan Pablo’s ex-bachelorettes ganged up on him and slammed him for multiple things. Two women weren’t present at the Women Tell All episode though, Juan Pablo’s Final Two Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell. Once the season finale of The Bachelor airs next week on ABC, they will be able to share their thoughts and opinions on Juan Pablo, and that is when the real fireworks will start. SPOILER ALERT!!\n\nIt’s unanimous, America (and Reality Steve) are certain Nikki Ferrell will be chosen as the winner of the Season 18 of The Bachelor. The real question is, what happened to the happy couple after the cameras stopped rolling? Were they ever a couple? Nikki and Juan Pablo were never engaged, and were already broken up before The Bachelor began airing on ABC. Since The Bachelor premiered Juan Pablo has been linked to several different women, and none of them have been Nikki. If anyone deserves a Tell All episode, it’s Nikki Ferrell. And, once can only imagine the horrible things the scorned ex-Bachelorette will have to say about Juan Pablo once the finale is aired and her contract is up with ABC.\n\nFriends of Nikki Ferrell have already confirmed that Nikki has some compromising nude photos in her possession of Juan Pablo, it is only a matter of time before she leaks them out of spite. But, Nikki is a smart girl, considering all of the negative press Juan Pablo has received, she should hold on to the pictures and publish them in an exclusive tell all book, exposing Juan Pablo for the arrogant and ignorant sham of a Bachelor he was this season.

Money must be tight, because he lives in a three-bedroom apartment with his mom and dad,” the source said, adding that he came on the show to make some money.\n\n“The reason he was so interested in being the Bachelor was to make money and become more famous. He’s always actively looking for money and work.”\n\nShedding light on Galavis\' career, the source said that currently he works as a sports consultant for the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame. He has active work only during baseball season, and monetary situation becomes a bit tight once the season is over.\n\n“During baseball season, he has to travel to different ballparks and try to get Venezuelan players to sign memorabilia he can bring back to the Hall of Fame,” the source said.\n\nIt is not immediately known if Ferrell and Crawley are aware of Galavis’ reality.

That’s not for me to answer.”\n\nAs alluded to above, you may recall that this season’s bachelor, Juan Pablo Galavis, got into hot water when he claimed in an interview that a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show would be “too perverted.”\n\nHe subsequently apologized to anyone he may have offended, suggesting that his comments were taken out of context. He also noted that English is his second language, “and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself. What I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept. The show is very racy as it is and I don’t let my 5 year old daughter watch it. Once again, I’m sorry for how my words were taken. I would never disrespect anyone.”\n\nIn a slight digression, Harrison — who also has hosted The Bachelorette since 2003 — revealed that unlike the norm for reality television, this season’s Bachelor installment involved minimal boozing. Juan Pablo is a teetotaler (or at least didn’t drink during the entire filming) and successfully encouraged the women to avoid drinking as well, explained Harrison.\n\nThe Bachelor 2014 season finale will air on March 10 during which Juan Pablo will supposedly decide between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell.\n\nAre you a fan of Chris Harrison and The Bachelor?

Hosted by Chris Harrison, the show has The Bachelor go on a series of dates with groups of women, as well as on individual dates, all in the hope of finding a wife. The elimination process consists of a rose ceremony, in which roses are handed out to the women who The Bachelor chooses to keep on the show. Those who don’t receives flowers at each week’s “rose ceremony” are sent home. At the end of each season, “The Bachelor” must choose between two women, with the expectation that he’ll propose to one of them.\n\nThe contestants live in “Villa De La Vina,” a mansion in Agoura Hills, California, for the first two weeks of filming. The remaining episodes typically consist of the participants traveling to romantic and exotic locations to go on dating excursions. Whether in the mansion or on the road, the show is often beset with conflict between the women vying for The Bachelor.\n\nThe first “Bachelor” was Alex Michel. At the end of the first season, Michel had to chose between Amanda Marsh and Trista Rehn, better known now as Trista Sutter. Michel, who selected Marsh, did not propose at the end of the show’s inaugural season. And Rehn would later go on to become the first “Bachelorette.”\n\nThe series has featured a slew of hunky and memorable Bachelors over the years including, Andrew Firestone, Lorenzo Borghese, Charlie O’Connell, Bob Guiney, Brad Womack, Jason Mesnick, Jake Pavelka, Sean Lowe, Juan Pablo Galavis and Ben Higgins. It has has also spawned three spin-off series on ABC. “The Bachelorette” debuted in January 2003 with Rehn as its inaugural star. “Bachelor Pad,” where previous contestants competed for a cash prize of $250,000, debuted on August 9, 2010. And “Bachelor in Paradise,” which also features previous contestants from both “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” in an exotic locale, first aired on August 4, 2014.\n\nThough “The Bachelor” has earned a reputation for not having the relationships work out, there have been a few high-profile weddings during its run.

And to me the show would be too strong… too hard to watch.”\n\nAlthough the Venezuelan star has since backtracked and explained that his comments were the result of a language barrier, the same pressing question is not going away any time soon, and this time, Harrison is in the firing line.\n\nHowever, the 42-year-old TV host was far more diplomatic in his answer, and during his interview with The New York Times Magazine, he confessed he was hesitant about whether there should be a gay Bachelor.\n\nHarrison told the publication, “The question is: Is it a good business decision?”\n\n“I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this — Look, if you’ve been making pizzas for 12 years and you’ve made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, ‘Hey, you should make hamburgers.’ Why? I have a great business model and I don’t know if hamburgers are going to sell.”\n\nAnd although the dating show host may be on the fence about having a gay star on The Bachelor, he definitely is against having a chubby one. When asked if the show would consider a heavier star, Harrison said, “No. You know why? Because that’s not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I’m old and unattractive.”\n\n“Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don’t have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don’t do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don’t eat 50,000 egg whites.”\n\nAnd when asked if Harrison himself would ever like to be a star on The Bachelor, he replied, “Now that I’m divorced, it’s feasible.”\n\n“But there needs to be a level of innocence and naïveté when you come in to be the Bachelor, and I have none. I have seen how the sausage has been made for 12 years now, and I helped make that sausage and so it just wouldn’t work.”', 'Chris Harrison has seen many Bachelors come and go, and whilst he may be on the fence when it comes to having a homosexual one, he definitely does not want to see a chubby leading man!\nChris Harrison has seen a lot of Bachelors come and go because of his job as the host of ABC’s hit series The Bachelor.\nHarrison told the publication, “The question is: Is it a good business decision?”“I just spoke at U.S.C.\nWhen asked if the show would consider a heavier star, Harrison said, “No.\nI live a healthy life, but I don’t do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to.']"

This year it\'s different.\n\n""It\'s definitely changed,"" said Cannon, a vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz here. ""I\'m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It\'s just, \'Sally, the engineer.\'""\n\nAs startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female-focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what traditionally has been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\n\nThe shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook\'s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.\n\nStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year\'s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named ""breakout app"" in 2011.\n\nThis year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Ore.-based Palo Alto Software, was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry\'s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as ""brogrammers.""\n\n""Part of that is the \'bro-gramming\' and too-cool-for-school attitude that goes on,"" she said in an interview before her meeting. ""What women have to push really hard about is you don\'t have to be successful in a man\'s world - it\'s just the world.""\n\nParsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference\'s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.\n\nHugh Forrest, the symposium\'s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.\n\n""If I had a dime for everybody who said that\'s a great rule but there just aren\'t enough qualified women I\'d be rich, rich, rich,"" he said. ""My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It\'s impossible for me to believe that you can\'t find a female speaker in the world who isn\'t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.""\n\nAmong the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women\'s issues this year was a March 7 talk ""Starting Up in a Man\'s World"" that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.', 'Austin, Texas - Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women\'s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference.\n""I\'m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that.\nThe shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook\'s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change.\nStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year\'s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications.\n""If I had a dime for everybody who said that\'s a great rule but there just aren\'t enough qualified women I\'d be rich, rich, rich,"" he said.']"

She’ll meet with the Future of Music Coalition — individuals involved in music production, distribution and sales, television and radio, music directors, composers and more.\n\n“I thought this would be a good opportunity to put our toe in the water,” Hunt said.\n\nCCI also is co-sponsor, with the Colorado Tourism Office, of the 30-band Colorado Music Party on Thursday and Friday. The unofficial showcase, also sponsored by OpenAir, Reverb and SpokesBuzz, will feature such local bands as You Me & Apollo, Rose Quartz, Gungor and Wheelchair Sports Camp.\n\nWhile CCI supports a wide spectrum of creative industries — fine arts, dance, writing, publishing and more — Hunt sees music as a key area to develop.\n\n“You look at music festivals and events, the number of venues, the number of recording artists — and Colorado is up there with the cities known for music, like Seattle and Austin,” Hunt said.\n\nSXSW, which runs through Sunday, is considered the premier music industry showcase and festival in the country. The event draws more than 25,000 official participants, including bands and industry professionals.\n\n“We’re approaching this as an industry team to market and brand Colorado,” Hunt said.\n\nCCI, which has an annual budget of $2.7 million, provides grants to arts and cultural organizations and public art programs, funds the Creative District Program, and supports artists and creative entrepreneurs through the Denver Music Summit, youth arts education, and public school programs.\n\nMajor players in Colorado’s music industry see the SXSW investment as an important gesture of support.\n\n“It sends the message that the state is more and more committed to helping this place become even more of a mecca for music,” AEG Live Rocky Mountains CEO Chuck Morris said. “The more people that want to move here, the more studios that open up, the more interest from musicians and songwriters is a great thing for our state, our economy and music community.”\n\nYou Me & Apollo vocalist Brent Cowles said state backing of the Colorado Music Party means a lot to him and his indie-rock band.\n\n“There’s a lot of music coming out of Colorado that’s getting attention,” he said, “and this means (the state is) going to invest in it and believe in it.”\n\nKendall Smith, from The Denver Post’s Underground Music Showcase, and Dani Grant, who runs the Fort Collins band incubator SpokesBuzz, approached Hunt to get the state involved in music efforts at SXSW.\n\n“They recognized that Colorado Creative Industries and the state had a role to play in advancing the music industry,” Hunt said.\n\nAs the Colorado contingent hits Austin this week, it will be among the likes of Doritos, Converse, Spotify, iTunes and countless other brands trying to be heard in the marketing scrum — a challenge for any brand pushing its product at SXSW.\n\n“There’s no question that SXSW is loud,” said Elaine Garza, an Austin-based marketing and PR expert who has worked with brands at SXSW for 15 years.\n\n“There’s so much going on and there’s always the question: Is it worth the investment to come?”\n\nGarza said she knew of no other state being represented at SXSW, and since Colorado isn’t pitching a consumer brand, like an energy drink or jeans, the message might resonate with fans and industry pros.\n\n“It kind of makes a bigger statement that Colorado is investing in the music scene and spending money to promote that,” she said.\n\nMatt Miller: 303-954-1785, mrmiller@denverpost.com or twitter.com/official_mattm', '“Colorado Creative Industries‘ goal is to meet with industry leaders and explore what’s happening in music and the future of the music industry to help position Colorado in the forefront,” said Hunt, whose office is a division of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.\nCCI also is co-sponsor, with the Colorado Tourism Office, of the 30-band Colorado Music Party on Thursday and Friday.\nSXSW, which runs through Sunday, is considered the premier music industry showcase and festival in the country.\nMajor players in Colorado’s music industry see the SXSW investment as an important gesture of support.\n“They recognized that Colorado Creative Industries and the state had a role to play in advancing the music industry,” Hunt said.']"

""You\'re competing with thousands of other bands"": John Patterson of the Grates. Credit:Edwina Pickles This year\'s record attendance by local artists owes to a surge in up-and-coming dance and electro acts, following the breakout success of Flume, Flight Facilities and Gold Fields at previous SXSWs. Of the 55 Australian artists, 21 are dance and/or electro acts. Australia\'s electro scene has boomed so much that last year\'s flagship, the Aussie BBQ, expands this year to include a night dedicated to the dancefloor. ""Beat Pie"" caters to the demand for Australian electro, dance and hip-hop acts.\n\nFor relatively new Brisbane indie electro producer Danny Harley, who plays under the moniker the Kite String Tangle, SXSW will be his first gig overseas. He says the chance owes to the breakthrough success of his electro hit Given the Chance. The track has amassed almost 900,000 Soundcloud plays since its release in August and charted at No. 19 in Triple J\'s Hottest 100 – a solid achievement given Harley is yet to release an EP or album. “The success of my current track is largely due to international blogs,” Harley said, adding that “the online buzz was really valuable for spreading the word about my song. But it will be interesting to see if any of that word has actually made it [to SXSW]”. More than 1700 acts will play at SXSW, but thousands more promoters, managers and labels will lurk behind the scenes, looking out for the next big thing. “For the most part the acts with the most buzz heading in to the conference are the ones that are most likely to come away from it with success,” Ms Millgate said, pointing to the importance of social media and blogs in building a successful SXSW campaign. It wasn\'t always like this.\n\nBrisbane indie rocker John Patterson, guitarist for the Grates, described their first trip to SXSW at the start of their career in 2005 as “a bit of a gamble”. At the time, the three-piece had just signed on to their record label in Australia following a handful of homemade EPs and grassroots shows, and going overseas was a financial risk. “SXSW is such a huge event,"" Patterson says. ""There are so many opportunities for things to get seen and things to get missed . . . you\'re competing with thousands of other bands."" But their wager paid off, and through their first SXSW appearance the group landed a US record deal. They have since returned twice, in 2006 and 2009, to promote new material. The sentiment is shared by fellow Brisbane indie four-piece the Jungle Giants, who are making their SXSW debut.\n\nWhile they have gained renown at home after touring with the Big Day Out, Splendour in the Grass and the Falls Festival, they\'re cutting their teeth overseas. “It\'s only now become financially feasible to head over to America, so it\'s all culminated to this point,"" frontman Sam Hales said. As an unsigned band he hopes the Jungle Giants will meet international labels and garner the release of their debut album, Learn to Exist, overseas, as well as an American tour. Even established Australian bands are jumping on the opportunities of SXSW. ARIA chart toppers Boy and Bear will head to the conference for their second time, and as drummer Tim Hart said, it\'s almost like starting again with their new album Harlequin Dream.\n\n“It\'s a really interesting thing over there,"" Hart said. ""You\'re just another band because there are so many other artists. But this is where all the promoters, festival owners and everyone go to and they\'re looking for acts."" As a more experienced and mature band, Boy and Bear are ready to make the most out of the SXSW experience, Hart said, and look forward to the networking opportunities.', 'Of the 55 Australian artists, 21 are dance and/or electro acts.\n""Beat Pie"" caters to the demand for Australian electro, dance and hip-hop acts.\nBut it will be interesting to see if any of that word has actually made it [to SXSW]”.\nBut their wager paid off, and through their first SXSW appearance the group landed a US record deal.\nEven established Australian bands are jumping on the opportunities of SXSW.']"

Her latest album Burn Your Fire For No Witness is out now on Jagjaguwar.\n\nJamestown Revival\n\nJamestown Revival is essentially Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance, two guys from a little town called Magnolia, Texas who have been singing together since they were kids. They have a fresh take on classic twang and their harmonies are as tight as any Everly Brothers recording.\n\nNo\n\nThis L.A.-based rock band draws comparisons to The National thanks to the deep baritone of Bradley Hanan Carter and lyrics like “We make some noise inside a room and call it art” on their dramatic new single “Leave the Door Wide Open.”\n\nThe Preatures\n\nHailing from Sydney, Australia the band’s latest album Is This How You Feel? is out now on Harvest Records. Isabella Manfredi and Gideon Benson trade off vocal duties over a beat of rhythm-focused ’70s pop.\n\nJetta\n\nAs a backup singer Jetta has been on the road with Paloma Faith and Cee Lo Green. Now, we get to hear her commanding voice as she steps forward to perform her own songs. “Feels Like Coming Home” is the powerful single on her debut EP Start A Riot, out now on Universal Republic Records.\n\nCloud Nothings\n\nThe first single from their next album (due in April), “I’m Not Part of Me” strikes a balance between noisy pop punk and hummable hooks.\n\nNikki Lane\n\nThe country singer’s sophomore album (out May 6), produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, is an eagerly anticipated way for the sweet and sour singer to croon that it’s “always the right time to do the wrong thing.”\n\nFuture Islands\n\nThere’s been a lot of buzz for the combo of cool synth pop and Samuel T. Herring’s dramatic vocals. Along with a Coachella appearance and a number of sold out headlining dates, the band played The Late Show and will release its new album Singles on March 25.\n\nThe Autumn Defense\n\nSince 1999, this has been a side-project for John Stirratt, the bass player in Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, as he collaborates with multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone on ’60s rock and pop. Their fifth LP, cleverly called Fifth, was released this past January on Yep Roc.\n\nSpeedy Ortiz\n\nThis Massachusetts band, led by Sadie Dupuis, brings ‘90s-style lo-fi guitar and Liz Phair-esque vocals in to the 21st century. The quartet is preparing for the release of a full-length album this year.\n\nJust because we love the name: Potty Mouth\n\nAnd a few Los Angeles-based acts we’d like to get to: Avi Buffalo, The Blank Tapes, Eleni Mandell, Kelela, Dum Dum Girls, Holly Conlan, Banks, and Fever the Ghost.', 'Her latest album Burn Your Fire For No Witness is out now on Jagjaguwar.\nThey have a fresh take on classic twang and their harmonies are as tight as any Everly Brothers recording.\n“Feels Like Coming Home” is the powerful single on her debut EP Start A Riot, out now on Universal Republic Records.\nSpeedy OrtizThis Massachusetts band, led by Sadie Dupuis, brings ‘90s-style lo-fi guitar and Liz Phair-esque vocals in to the 21st century.\nThe quartet is preparing for the release of a full-length album this year.']"

I’m going to write about South by Southwest.\n\nThis will be my third year attending and covering the festival, and I apologize because I’ve grown a sense of guilt about it. Mocking SXSW is about as common and easy as mocking Coachella or Miley Cyrus. The other thing those three have in common, though, is that they’re actually fun if you can manage to not be an eye-rolling, better-than-thou contrarian.\n\nLook, I’m not clueless and neither are most people who go to Austin in March. The festival isn’t what it used to be, it’s too corporate, it’s over-hyped, it’s not the real Austin, etc. They’re valid issues, but there are valid reasons not to do a lot of fun things. If you have the press pass and/or the financial means, why not? And if you don’t, why not pay attention, even peripherally?\n\nSXSW’s music festival is still a great place to find bands. Last year, I caught shows from the Whiskey Shivers and Ringo Deathstarr. In the year since, I brought them both into Second Story Garage. Oddly enough, the first time I ever saw some Colorado bands was at SXSW two years ago. Just following the coverage might give you a handful of new bands to check out.\n\nAustin is weird, as any souvenir T-shirt will tell you, and SXSW acts as an amplifier. The weirdness isn’t even coming from locals half the time, for the month of March. Maybe you have to be of a certain age or disposition to enjoy wading through a litter-strewn and crowded Sixth Street, enjoying dancing sousaphone players or dancing skeleton marionettes. That’s cool. Enjoy it emanating from your computer screen instead.\n\nThis sounds like a pitch, and I guess in a way it is, but mostly it’s an argument in favor of chilling out and enjoying something. Maybe SXSW has a confused purpose or significance, but so what? Enjoy the party.\n\nI’ll be back at it this year, and by “it” I mean following local bands, discovering new ones, subsisting on beer, eating a lot of pulled pork and not sleeping.\n\nHere’s the actual pitch: It’s all going on SecondStoryGarage.com, as well as ColoradoDaily.com. Last year’s highlights included Big Freedia twerking, The Yawpers’ Nate Cook getting a little dark and profane on camera, and me drunkenly talking about pizza. Much like SXSW, it’s a messy grab bag of stuff.\n\nHope you like it, and as always, happy South By.\n\nContact Ashley Dean at 303-473-1109.

The City of Toronto should have made a big splash at this year’s South by Southwest … It looks like my city dropped the ball. Both (cities) are just losing this great opportunity. Nothing’s been done.”\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nCohen isn’t being a totally negative Nelly. He concedes Toronto is “making headway” with its Austin alliance, “but it’s at a turtle pace.” And that’s much the same refrain one hears from his fellow industry compatriots down here for SXSW.\n\n“I’m happy that the City of Toronto is moving ahead with stuff like the music advisory committee and clearly it’s on their radar screen as something that should be aided and abetted and supported,” says Mike Tanner, director of operations for Toronto’s North by Northeast festival.\n\n“On the other hand, in my North by Northeast capacity, I know how big the city bureaucracy can be and, in the interests of getting things right and making sure that proper policies and procedures are followed it can take a long time to get stuff done ….\n\n“I think it’s kinda down to the industry to do things in a tangible way that has an effect on the street, so that you see musicians or venues or fans or other people benefitting so it’s not just a piece of paper that was signed by two elected politicians, that it actually has a meaning and an impact that people can feel.\n\n“I think a lot of times bureaucracies like to work from the top down, but with something like this I think it might be more effective to work from the foundation up, from the actual events and the actual people and the guys on the ground making stuff happen.”\n\nTo that end, Tanner and the NXNE crew will work on their own to strengthen their long-held ties with SXSW this year to make that connection “a lot more evident and obvious” in light of the new alliance.\n\n“We’ve been in much closer contact with them, sharing some info and some best practices,” he says. “And there may be something that comes to fruition at our festival. I don’t know yet.”\n\nLikewise, Amy Terrill of the industry lobby group Music Canada and Toronto’s recently minted “4479: Music Meets World” music-marketing campaign will be conducting business with movers and shakers in the Austin scene on “a more informal basis” during SXSW.\n\nGet more movies in your inbox Get the latest film news and reviews with our New Movies newsletter.

Certainly, in Toronto, it’s taken a little while to get the advisory committee set up. But there are necessary foundational pieces, and while we may wish the process went a little bit faster, the committee that Toronto has established is a fantastic committee and there’s gonna be a lot of great people on there and it’s gonna do a lot of great work.\n\n“It’s just that some things take a little bit longer.\n\n“I think the industry-led initiative is where the real magic is gonna happen.

It\'s one of the best conventions/festivals/trade shows to be found anywhere in the world. It\'s well organized, well run (well, except for the wifi) and it\'s mindblowingly diverse and forward-thinking. But it may have already outgrown its host city, Austin. We have the conventions space and the rentable venues and hotel space (barely, in the latter). What do not have are the roads to keep the festival from becoming a major irritant for the people who actually live and work in Austin.\n\nWhen SXSW isn\'t in town, Austin\'s population is about 850,000. When SXSW is in town, that number swells to about 1,050,000. Those people bring a lot of money to town, so there\'s no question in the grand scheme things that SXSW\'s visitors are welcome.\n\nThe roads around the city aren\'t even built to handle its everyday population. When the city swells by about 25% for SXSW\'s fortnight, the city\'s infrastructure simply cannot handle the influx. Despite the fact that Austin\'s total footpring -- about 272 square miles -- dwarfs Manhattan\'s 23 square miles, there just isn\'t room on the roads to deal with such a sudden population surge. And city decisions are making things worse, not better.\n\nToday was a good case in point. I-35 is the main artery running through Austin north to south. It doesn\'t just serve Austin, it leads north to Waco and eventually to Dallas and beyond. South, it hits San Antonio and other arteries that lead to points south including the Texas-Mexico border in Hidalgo County. It\'s a major trade artery for the state and nation, 24/7/365. But because it only gets to eight lanes maximum as it goes through Austin, and four of those lanes are in the dark, dangerous Death Star trench on the bottom deck, 35 is far too easy to disrupt. Today a pair of what appeared to be minor fender benders shut the whole thing down southbound, backing up traffic and trade for miles.\n\nNow, I-35 is federal/state and Austin isn\'t solely to blame for its thinness. But Austin is to blame for leaving drivers up on 35 with nowhere to go. The city has already been shutting down some of its interior road lanes for bus and bike traffic. Those shutdowns have in turn closed off some parking lots. And with SXSW in town, the city shut down even more interior roads to create a street festival atmosphere. The gridlock on 35 soon became gridlock downtown. There was nowhere to go, nowhere to park. SXSW on-foot attendees probably had little idea that the town around them had gone sclerotic, but for locals who already tend to resent the traffic increase, gridlock became misery.\n\nI-35 clearly needs to be dealt with, but so does Austin\'s habit of going left and fooling around with old ideas. Mayor Lee Leffingwell\'s big idea is to keep adding bike paths and bus lanes plus ""Rail or Fail,"" essentially, expanding Austin\'s Metro rail system. Whether you build roads or rails taxpayer dollars will be used and public debt will be increased, but rail is a favorite, and very expensive, rolling obsession of folks of a leftist bent like Leffingwell. Once you build trains, unless they become efficient systems (which they hardly ever do -- see AMTRAC), they become a permanent public expense over and above the roads. Never mind that this is Texas, a sprawling state with sprawling cities where rail tends to be under-used, and never mind that nearly every time a city gets going on a rail project, they go way over budget and end up getting years behind schedule, just to build something that relatively few people use. And never mind that Austin\'s Metro has been both over budget and behind schedule and still doesn\'t offer much in the way of flexibility or speed. Or just getting you from Point A to Point B in the time that the rail system promises. Never mind that rail hasn\'t really worked in either Houston or Austin, at least not yet, both because of the culture here but also because the cities are just so physically spread. Austin\'s leaders see none of these problems, they just think they haven\'t told their dazzling story about trains (a 19th Century way of thinking, to be honest) articulately enough.\n\nNever mind all that. Austin is already host to major events like SXSW, Austin City Limits and every Longhorn home football game. It\'s also now the host for F1 racing, though the Circuit of the Americas is located far enough outside downtown to produce less of an impact than events like SXSW. It\'s the capital of Texas, which is larger than most countries by itself. Austin needs to stop shutting down roads meant for cars in favor of turning them into bike paths or giving them over to bus use as a means of forcing residents and visitors onto public transportation. It should also stop kowtowing to the taxi industry via its misguided crackdown on Uber. If it wants to be a major destination and a big star on the map, then Austin really needs to grow up.', ""But it may have already outgrown its host city, Austin.\nWhen SXSW isn't in town, Austin's population is about 850,000.\nAnd with SXSW in town, the city shut down even more interior roads to create a street festival atmosphere.\nAustin is already host to major events like SXSW, Austin City Limits and every Longhorn home football game.\nIf it wants to be a major destination and a big star on the map, then Austin really needs to grow up.""]"

Although the festival has already kicked off the film portion of the festivities, this week marks the beginning of its SXSW Music festival, which will showcase more than 2,000 independent acts in over 100 of Austin’s venues.

Here are some of the acts we’re most anticipating:\n\nThankfully, hip-hop and rap are sporting healthy guests lists this year, as B.O.B, Childish Gambino, Nas, Mobb Deep, Big Sean, and more will be performing in the Austin bar scene for the week. I’m mostly curious to see Schoolboy Q in the aftermath of his first “Billboard 200 Albums” sweep. Fellow “Top Dawg Entertainment” label mates Kendrick Lamar, Isaiah Rashad, and Ab-Soul will also be performing under the hip-hop/rap bill, along with fellow R&B crooner SZA, whose inclusion in the festival strikes another point for the TDE camp. Additionally, Chicago’s growing presence on the SXSW circuit is one to be noted: KatieGotBandz, Lil Bibby, Chance the Rapper, and Lil Mouse will all take the stage to feature some of the best of Chicago’s rap scene.\n\nOther favorites include the Queen of Bounce Big Freedia, whose return to Austin will mark one of many, fellow bounce pioneer Nicky Da B, New York’s A$AP Mob, Atlanta’s trap powerhouse Migos, and Trinidad James. Expect stellar performances from Dallas favorites as welll: Dorrough, Sam Lao, Blue the Misfit, The Outfit, TX and more will all bring a little of Triple D with them to the Austin metroplex.\n\nAdditionally, R&B’s biggest and brightest will be in Austin for the week, such as nu-soul/chillwave singer-songwriter 8th Grader, as well as Tinashe, Tweet, electro-R&B songstress Kelela, and singer/songwriter Solange.\n\nDance fans should take delight in the appearance of local dance-pop outfit Ishi and DJ-producer Ynfynyt Scroll, who will join the likes of drag superstar performer Sharon Needles, The Hood Internet, and Little Boots on the dance music circuit. Similarly, ASTR, Gobby, Giraffage, Keys N Krates, A Tribe Called Red, and Machinedrum will take the stage for the SXSW electronic showcase.\n\nPop music fans and general celebrity enthusiasts rejoice: Lady Gaga will be making her first SXSW appearance after all. The good news follows the city’s decisions to shut down the pop star’s appearance on the Doritos, 56-foot-tall vending machine-style stage, and which will instead place her at Stubb’s. London singer-songwriter Charli XCX, rising producer and solo act The GTW, Capital Cities, K-Pop princess HyunA, Kelis, Swedish singer-songwriter and frequent Diplo collaborator MØ, disco/New-Wave mashup band Pompeya, and indie pop favorites Tennis will all be making appearances in Austin venues.\n\nFor a complete list of future performances, visit the South by Southwest’s official website.\n\nImage: Big Freedia performing at Fun Fun Fun Fest, 2013.

2832,http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/sxsw/5930332/sxsw-2014-10-artists-to-watch,entertainment,"['Tomorrow (March 11), thousands of bands, journalists and music fans descend onto Austin, Texas for the annual SXSW Music Conference. Like always, there will be tons of parties, lines, food, and too many decisions to make about which acts to catch. Here are Billboard\'s 10 best bets for the week -- acts that have a strong buzz going and could have a breakout year after the madness ends.\n\nSXSW 2014: Full Coverage\n\nReal Estate\n\n\n\nReal Estate are quickly becoming the preferred purveyors of sunny jangle-pop in the indie-rock world. Their new album, ""Atlas"" (Domino) was recorded at Wilco\'s Chicago studio The Loft and finds the band continuing down the path of well-crafted songs that evoke a romantic, yet nostalgic vibe that\'s always warm and inviting. As simple, refined pop song writers, it\'s hard to beat these guys right now.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud Nothings\n\n\n\nCleveland\'s Cloud Nothings have gained a steady following over the last few years with a raucous live show and a never-ending supply of post-punk songs. Their fourth album, ""Here and Nowhere Else"" (Mom + Pop/Carpark) is due out on April 1 and frontman Dylan Baldi has promised that the music within the eight songs is ""more positive"" this time around.\n\n\n\n\n\nChance the Rapper\n\n\n\nThis time last year, Chicago hip-hop artist Chance the Rapper was relatively unknown on the national scene, as he was prepping his throwback, breakout mixtape ‘Acid Rap.’ 12 months later, he\'s recorded with Justin Bieber, James Blake and Lil Wayne to name just a few.\n\n\n\n\n\nHurray for the Riff Raff\n\n\n\nMost music that comes out of New Orleans tends to lean towards the Crescent City\'s funk roots, but Hurray for the Riff Raff hone in on the south\'s gothic-folk traditions that would sound at home in any club on Music Row. Centered around Alynda Lee Segarra’s charming, southern voice, the band\'s new album ""Small Town Heroes"" (ATO) is an excellent take on classic country traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDum Dum Girls\n\n\n\nThe promise of the Dum Dum Girls has existed for years, but the L.A. band\'s new album, ""Too True"" (Sub Pop) is a strong leap forward. It combines the group\'s love of fuzzed-out distorted guitars and vintage \'80s goth the Cure and Siouxsie Sioux, as lead Dum Dum Girl Dee Dee Penny blurs the line between tortured artist and confident rock-star.\n\n\n\n\n\nRAC\n\n\n\nRAC used to stand for ""Remix Artist Collective"" where it was just that -- a few DJs that did fancy mash-ups. Nowadays, it\'s just the solo project of original RAC member André Allen Anjos, a master-mixer from Portland, Oregon. He\'s releasing his debut album ""Stranger"" (Cherrytree/Interscope) in two parts this spring, with guest spots from Tegan and Sara, Penguin Prison and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros\' Alex Ebert. It\'s EDM-tinged pop ready to break into the Top 40.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharli XCX\n\n\n\nCharli XCX broke out in 2013, but not with her album ‘True Romance.’ Instead, she saw a song she wrote, ""I Love It,"" top the charts for Icona Pop. She\'s currently at work on her third album, which she describes as ""very punk inspired."" For dance artists these days, that could mean anything. She recently lit up the internet with Iggy Azalea in a video they did for Azalea\'s new single ""Fancy,” in which they brilliantly reenacted the 1995 Alicia Silverstone film ""Clueless."" For those in search of the next Ellie Goulding, Charli\'s poised to rise up.\n\n\n\n\n\nEagulls\n\n\n\nOn Eagulls\' self-titled debut (Partisan), the Leeds, UK five-piece blend a sound that evokes the Pixies\' melodic brand of punk rock and the Horrors gloomy vocals. The band is just two years old, but write music that\'s emotionally charged with powerful guitars and a rather brash attitude. Punk purists can take solace in the fact that their clip for ""Nerve Endings,"" which won the NME award for ""Best Music Video,"" featured a rotting pig brain.\n\n\n\n\n\nTy Dolla $ign\n\n\n\nWiz Khalifa protégé Ty Dolla $ign has hustled well-received singles and mixtapes out for the last several years and is currently prepping his debut album ""Free TC"" (Taylor Gang Records/Atlantic), due out later this year. But fans got a taste of Ty in January, when he released ""Beach House EP,"" a 7-song official introduction that features a slew of top-notch guests including B.o.B., French Montana, DJ Mustard, Trey Songz, and of course, Wiz. Right now, he\'s angling to be rap\'s next big thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimber Timbre\n\n\n\nTimber Timbre is the musical project of Canadian musician Taylor Kirk and on his sultry new album, ""Hot Dreams"" (Arts & Crafts), he expands on the dark humor and sparse rock arrangements that lined his previous four albums. It sounds like Nick Cave soundtracking a romantic date night, but not in a creepy way. In the past, the band has supported Feist and Laura Marling and their music has been featured in ‘Breaking Bad.’ It\'s only a matter of time before the cool kids latch on.\n\n\n\n', 'Tomorrow (March 11), thousands of bands, journalists and music fans descend onto Austin, Texas for the annual SXSW Music Conference.\nSXSW 2014: Full CoverageReal EstateReal Estate are quickly becoming the preferred purveyors of sunny jangle-pop in the indie-rock world.\nDum Dum GirlsThe promise of the Dum Dum Girls has existed for years, but the L.A. band\'s new album, ""Too True"" (Sub Pop) is a strong leap forward.\nIt combines the group\'s love of fuzzed-out distorted guitars and vintage \'80s goth the Cure and Siouxsie Sioux, as lead Dum Dum Girl Dee Dee Penny blurs the line between tortured artist and confident rock-star.\nHe\'s releasing his debut album ""Stranger"" (Cherrytree/Interscope) in two parts this spring, with guest spots from Tegan and Sara, Penguin Prison and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros\' Alex Ebert.']"

2837,http://business.financialpost.com/2014/03/10/geeky-women-breaking-up-bromance-culture-at-south-by-southwest-conference/,entertainment,"['Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women’s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it’s different.\n\n“It’s definitely changed,” said Cannon, an Austin, Texas- based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP. “I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It’s just, ‘Sally, the engineer.’”\n\nAs startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female- focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male- dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\n\nI’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that\n\nThe shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.\n\nBro-gramming Culture\n\nStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year’s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named “breakout app” in 2011.\n\nThis year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry’s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as “brogrammers.”\n\n“Part of that is the ‘bro-gramming’ and too-cool-for- school attitude that goes on,” she said in an interview before her meeting. “What women have to push really hard about is you don’t have to be successful in a man’s world — it’s just the world.”\n\nLook Harder\n\nParsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference’s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.\n\nHugh Forrest, the symposium’s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.\n\n“If I had a dime for everybody who said that’s a great rule but there just aren’t enough qualified women I’d be rich, rich, rich,” he said. “My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It’s impossible for me to believe that you can’t find a female speaker in the world who isn’t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.”\n\nMan’s World\n\nAmong the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women’s issues this year was a March 7 talk “Starting Up in a Man’s World” that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.\n\nThe lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere. Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.\n\nParsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.\n\nThe number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers\n\nEllen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.\n\nC-Suite Women\n\nStill, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book “Lean In” to inspire other females.\n\nCarley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers — like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.\n\n“The number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,” she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum. “They have the ideas, but they don’t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code.”\n\nwww.bloomberg.com', 'Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women’s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference.\n“I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that.\nAbout 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\nBro-gramming CultureStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year’s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications.\nCarley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers — like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.']"

(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg)\n\nAn app that translates text within photos, an online mental health service and a teched-out motorcycle helmet all claimed a spot among the nation’s hottest new technologies on Sunday, each earning top honors at the premier startup competition at the South by Southwest convention in Austin.\n\nNarrowed down from 48 on Saturday, 18 entrepreneurs pitched their startups to a panel of judges during the final round of the SXSW Accelerator on Sunday, vying for the grand prize in six different areas of technology. The winners each received $4,000, an invitation to next year’s convention, and most importantly, a prestigious and historically lucrative title in the world of technology startups.\n\n“It’s fantastic for us, and what’s most important is the exposure that comes with it,” Connor Dickie, whose Canadian company won in the competition’s innovative world category, said in an interview following the event. “It shows people what we’re doing and where biotech is heading.”\n\nDickie’s company, Synbiota, offers an online, crowdsourced platform where scientists can share information and streamline the research and development stages in the production of new foods, fuels and medicines. Some of the funding the company received Sunday will go toward a “hackathon” the company plans to host in Ontario bringing together Internet wizards and biotech scientists.\n\nIn the wearable technology category, Skully Helmets of San Francisco won for its motorcycle helmet that displays information like driving directions inside the visor and features a rear-view camera that allows riders to see directly behind them without turning their head.\n\nAnother San Francisco company, ThriveOn, came out on top in the health category for an app that provides an online, personalized program meant to improve mental health. And Israeli company Samba.me landed the grand prize in social technology for a video messaging app that captures video of recipients watching the original video and adds their “reaction” footage to the original.\n\nIrish startup Trustev won in the big data category for online identity verification software intended to help merchants combat e-commerce fraud. And lastly, in the the entertainment and content contest, Rhode Island-based Waygo came out on top for its mobile app that lets users scroll over text in, say, Chinese or Japanese characters and see in real-time the translation in English.\n\n“The $4,000 is just icing on the cake,” Ryan Rogowski, one of the founders of Waygo, said in an interview, noting that the company will likely use some of that capital to explore new marketing tactics and distribution channels. “Meeting these other teams and introducing ourselves to new potential investors, that’s the real benefit” he added.\n\nSXSW Accelerator boasts an impressive lists of pasts participants, many of whom were first introduced to the world at South by Southwest. Siri, which was later acquired by Apple for its now-famous voice-to-text technology, Bump, which was later acquired by Google for its touch-to-share technology, and social media company Klout all passed through the SXSW Accelerator in Austin.\n\nIn fact, since the competition debuted six years ago, the 208 finalists have collectively raised more than $580 million in funding.\n\n“Here, it’s all about developing relationships and making new ones,” Rogowski said.\n\nThanks for following our ongoing coverage of startups, entrepreneurs and technology at South by Southwest 2014.

There’s a fair amount of non-weirdness here. Even during the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival—going on now through March 17—it’s business as usual for much of Austin. In fact, if you’re not downtown, where more than 100,000 people will converge during the 11-day festival, Austin might even appear sleepy. The schools—including the University of Texas—are on spring break, and lots of residents try to get out of town during SXSW, or “South by,” as some call it.\n\nSome people have started to question whether SXSW has lost a bit of its culture-making mojo. The festival is actually three events in one. It started as a music event. Movies came soon afterward. Now, the festival begins with a trade show, South by Southwest Interactive, which kicked off on Friday.\n\nSXSW Interactive has been around since 1997, when it had such prescient sessions as “So You Want To Make A CD-ROM” and “The Internet Is Dead.” Becky Worley of Yahoo Tech has taken a look back at “The Ghosts of South-Bys Past” and found SXSW Interactive’s record pretty spotty when it comes to introducing game-changing innovations. But she noted some undeniable hits. “In 2007, Twitter put up TV monitors in the halls of South by Southwest Interactive, scrolling tweets from attendees,” she wrote. “The founders credit that move with catapulting the service to its current status of 241 million active users.” Siri and Airbnb, the on-line house-sharing service, both also got big boosts at Southwest by Southwest.\n\nBut those outsized hits have caused most people to forget the misses. Worley noted that in 2009 “some of the big hits in the interactive competition were TubeMogul, Popcuts, and Project Miso. What? You haven’t heard of them? Yeah, me neither.” In fairness, TubeMogul still exists, though in a different form than the one debuted at SXSW five years ago. Popcuts and Project Miso?

Based on recent history, I expect some winners, some losers and a Texas-sized load of marketing bull to wade through before I crown a game-changing disruptive technology star.”', 'Even during the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival—going on now through March 17—it’s business as usual for much of Austin.\nIn fact, if you’re not downtown, where more than 100,000 people will converge during the 11-day festival, Austin might even appear sleepy.\nSome people have started to question whether SXSW has lost a bit of its culture-making mojo.\nNow, the festival begins with a trade show, South by Southwest Interactive, which kicked off on Friday.\n“In 2007, Twitter put up TV monitors in the halls of South by Southwest Interactive, scrolling tweets from attendees,” she wrote.']"

Unlike traditional festivals, which take place on fairgrounds over a small handful of stages, SXSW is defined by its sprawl. Over a thousand bands from all over the world come to Austin and from noon to 2:00 a.m. play hour-long sets at every available venue, bar and open lot. Epitomizing the idea of an event where there is something for everyone, it would seem statistically impossible for two festival-goers to have identical experiences.\n\nNonetheless, besides aching feet and sleep deprivation, there are some communal experiences:\n\nAt some point over the course of the week, you will have a small mental breakdown and pitch a notable hissy fit due to the exhaustion and physical strain of standing for hours on end. You just need to hope it will pass quickly and offend the least number of people.\n\nYou will sit down on the ground in an area that is not designed for sitting. You will be so happy to get off your feet that you will not care about social convention. Someone will appreciate your initiative and sit down next to you.\n\nYou will see bands play spaces smaller than you are used to seeing them play. The Hold Steady will play Cedar Street Courtyard and Red 7, Lady Gaga will play Stubb’s and Coldplay and Soundgarden will play ACL Live at the Moody Theater.\n\nYou will go see someone from a bygone era simply because you can. This year, Gary Numan, Blondie and Spandau Ballet will be putting their years of experience on display. (In fairness, Numan has continuously released albums since the ’80s and Blondie has a new album coming out this year).\n\nYou will gain a healthy respect for Lone Star beer. This will be unrelated to the little men Matthew McConaughey can make with the cans.\n\nAt least one band you’ve never heard of before will absolutely blow you away and revive your love and excitement of live music. At times, that band will be White Denim; at others it will be Brothers & Sisters or Built For The Sea.\n\nJust because of their name, you will be tempted to see a band like Lindsay Lowend, Raw McCartney, Death By Unga Bunga or Ringo Deathstarr. Despite wondering why no one had the foresight to put Raw McCartney and Ringo Deathstarr on the same bill, you will not actually go see any of these bands.\n\nYou will eat a meal that has been prepared inside a truck and it will be one of the best things you have ever eaten.\n\nSomeone like Prince, Justin Timberlake or Kanye West will announce a show with little notice and surprisingly, you will have little interest in battling the crowds it will attract.\n\nYou may spend an entire week without being in the same room as a vegetable.\n\nNo matter how many bands you catch, there will be another two to three dozen you will regret not seeing.\n\nDavid Schultz will be documenting his SXSW experience for a future Hitting The Trunk Road column. Follow along on Facebook for live updates from Austin. JamBase will present a pair of Les Claypool Duo de Twang “Pop-Up” sets on Thursday followed by our Official Showcase that night and a Day Party on Friday.\n\nWritten By: David Schultz', 'Unlike traditional festivals, which take place on fairgrounds over a small handful of stages, SXSW is defined by its sprawl.\nEpitomizing the idea of an event where there is something for everyone, it would seem statistically impossible for two festival-goers to have identical experiences.\nYou will see bands play spaces smaller than you are used to seeing them play.\nAt least one band you’ve never heard of before will absolutely blow you away and revive your love and excitement of live music.\nDavid Schultz will be documenting his SXSW experience for a future Hitting The Trunk Road column.']"

(Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images for SXSW)\n\nBy Karen Brooks\n\nAUSTIN, Texas, March 9 (Reuters) - It\'s OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so.\n\nAs a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, ""Neighbors,"" that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.\n\nPacked with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes - including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump - the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron.\n\nBut as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film\'s biggest battle turns out to be internal.\n\nIt is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to ""get-off-my-lawn"" adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear.\n\n""When you have a kid, that\'s great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,"" Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters on Sunday in an interview after the movie\'s first public screening. ""That\'s probably good in some ways, but it\'s also a bummer in some ways.""\n\nEarly reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie\'s nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as ""lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid"" than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theaters on May 9.\n\nThe audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.\n\nMac and Kelly\'s frantic debate over how to say ""keep it down"" in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?\n\n\'I KNOW THESE GUYS\'\n\nThe inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O\'Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are - not to mention their own fans.\n\n""All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,"" Rogen said with a laugh. ""That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that\'s when the movie, I think, took a great shape.""\n\nByrne\'s likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the ""Bridesmaids"" actress.\n\nKelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy\'s girlfriend to betray him.\n\nEfron, characterized by Variety\'s Barker as giving ""one of his most credible and intriguing performances"" as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character.\n\nWhere Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying - and that gives him depth, Efron said.\n\nHe credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy\'s multi-faceted character.\n\n""We were able to kind of find the heart in it,"" Efron, 26, said. ""I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I\'ve felt those feelings.""\n\nIt is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up.

Here’s 10 things that everyone’s bound to be talking about between guzzling margaritas and chowing down on BBQ.\n\nUPDATE: Jay Z and Kanye West also will perform together at SXSW on Wednesday March 12\n\nColdplay preview new material…\n\nRecently, Chris Martin’s Coldplay dropped a surprise new track, ‘Midnight’. Produced by Jon Hopkins, it hints at a cooler, more electronic approach to their forthcoming new album, ‘Ghost Stories’, due for release on May 19. SXSW should be the first chance to hear more from that record; the band are playing an iTunes Festival gig out in Austin, which will be live-streamed across the world so even if you’re not in Texas, you don’t have to worry about missing out.\n\n… And so does Julian Casablancas\n\nLast week, The Strokes frontman shared a video teaser for his new solo album. It prompted a few questions for us and, come next Saturday (March 15), he should be answering at least one or two. His new backing band The Voidz will likely join him, revealing their identities, while it seems inevitable he’ll play some fresh tracks in between material taken from his 2009 debut ‘Phrazes For The Young’.\n\nLady Gaga is this year’s Keynote speaker\n\nDave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen and the late Lou Reed have all taken a break from playing music to speak at SXSW and, this year, Lady Gaga will join that list. We don’t know what she’ll talk about yet but, as one of music’s more eccentric characters, it’s bound to be interesting. The night before, the singer will perform an intimate gig at the Stubb’s venue.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jarvis Cocker will be on hand to help out songwriters\n\nThe Pulp frontman is one of the finest lyricists of modern British music and he’ll be offering songwriting tips at a SXSW lecture on Wednesday, using his own lyrics to show his development as a musician, explaining the “meaning of artistic vision” and giving advice to budding stars. Sounds like one lecture you’ll want to take notes at.\n\nJungle will be a must-see band\n\nSure, we still don’t know what Jungle actually look like (think the pictures you’ve seen are actually them? Think again) but they’re shaping up to be one of the most talked about bands of the festival if the rabid reaction to their recent shows in the UK is anything to go by. The whole enigmatic schtick might be a bit tiresome these days but when you’ve got the tunes to back it up – just check out Jungle’s latest single ‘Busy Earnin’- you can almost get away with it. We’d suggest getting in the queue for their Austin shows now.\n\nGreen Day’s side project will play\n\nThe Californian punks formed their garage rock side project Foxboro Hot Tubs in 2007 and released their debut album ‘Stop Drop And Roll’ the following year. They played under the name at a secret show in Oakland, California last year and now they’ve promised to do a two hour set at SXSW. Expect songs from their one and only LP plus tracks from Green Day’s 2012 record, ‘¡Dos!’.\n\n50 Cent’s comeback\n\nIt’s been five years since the rapper released any music but he’s set to make his comeback this year with new record ‘Animal Ambition’, due June 3. What better place to preview his new tracks? 50 Cent should have plenty of material to choose from too – he’s also got another LP, ‘Street King Immortal’, done and dusted although he’s yet to confirm any concrete details about that record.\n\nKelis’ food truck\n\nAs well as playing a show at the festival, Kelis will be previewing her new album ‘Food’ by serving up dishes from her very own food truck during the event. On the menu, she’s promising jerk ribs (obviously), duck confit sliders, shredded beef and wild cherry BBQ sauce and coleslaw. Sadly, it doesn’t look like milkshake’s on the menu.Trick well and truly missed.\n\nFat White Family take their riotous live show to the US for the first time\n\nAnother band bound to be causing a stir at SXSW is Radar Award winners Fat White Family. They had to sell their services to get themselves over the Atlantic (they raised money via PledgeMusic, offering massages, meals and private gigs in return for cash) so expect them to make that hard work worthwhile. Just how America will react to their sleazy, ramshackle punk remains to be seen but we’d bet our houses on them starting some sort of controversy.\n\nMusic films screened for the first time\n\nSXSW isn’t just about music – there’s film and technology portions to the festival too. Bands and cinema collide for some of it though, with some hotly anticipated music flicks showing in Austin. Festival-goers will be able to catch the premiere of ‘Pulp’, a documentary about Pulp, and A$AP Rocky’s SVDDXNLY film, while the long-delayed André 3000-starring Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is By My Side is also screening.\n\n<!–\n\nBy use of this code snippet, I agree to the Brightcove Publisher T and C\n\nfound at https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/.\n\n–>\n\n<!–\n\nThis script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon\n\nas the line is read by the browser.

2854,http://wraltechwire.com/women-breaking-up-the-bromance-at-south-by-southwest/13464834/,entertainment,"['Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women’s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it’s different.\n\n“It’s definitely changed,” said Cannon, an Austin, Texas- based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP. “I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It’s just, ‘Sally, the engineer.’”\n\nAs startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female- focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\n\nThe shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.\n\nBro-gramming Culture\n\nStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year’s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named “breakout app” in 2011.\n\nThis year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry’s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as “brogrammers.”\n\n“Part of that is the ‘bro-gramming’ and too-cool-for- school attitude that goes on,” she said in an interview before her meeting. “What women have to push really hard about is you don’t have to be successful in a man’s world — it’s just the world.”\n\nLook Harder\n\nParsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference’s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.\n\nHugh Forrest, the symposium’s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.\n\n“If I had a dime for everybody who said that’s a great rule but there just aren’t enough qualified women I’d be rich, rich, rich,” he said. “My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It’s impossible for me to believe that you can’t find a female speaker in the world who isn’t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic.”\n\nMan’s World\n\nAmong the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women’s issues this year was a March 7 talk “Starting Up in a Man’s World” that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.\n\nThe lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere. Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.\n\nParsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.\n\nEllen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.\n\nThe Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.\n\nC-Suite Women\n\nStill, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book “Lean In” to inspire other females.\n\nCarley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers — like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.\n\n“The number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,” she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum. “They have the ideas, but they don’t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code.”', 'Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women’s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference.\n“I’m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that.\nAbout 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.\nBro-gramming CultureStarted in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year’s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications.\nCarley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers — like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.']"
2855,http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/1284260/sxsw14-day-three-technology-now-next-beyond,entertainment,"['It’s busy here in Austin . Thirty thousand delegates have come together for SXSW Interactive 2014, and the breadth of sessions, topics and speakers is vast. In just one hour, Eric Schmidt will talk about the new digital age, alongside sessions about content and commerce, crowd-funded start-ups and music for video game marketing.\n\nIt’s inspiring but also a bit of a sensory overload, as sessions about the ‘big’ trends in technology (e.g. crypto currencies, robots, genetics or connected objects) rub up against topics that marketers and agencies are grappling with now (e.g. retail, content, mobile).\n\nSo, what, as a marketing community, should we take away from SXSW and put into practice? What ideas, themes, trends or technologies should we invest our time in? Here’s my take on how approach and prioritise the key areas I’ve seen emerge from SXSW Interactive this year:\n\n1 - Now\n\nThere are four topics I’ve seen across the schedule at SXSW this year which we are all grappling with now: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing. Perhaps surprisingly, the conversation around these topics has not focused on the new and shiny, but on how to approach them in more mature ways.\n\nThere are four topics Iwhich we are all grappling with: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing.\n\nFor example, as the ‘mobile majority’ becomes a reality, Richard Ting of R/GA put forward a more strategic view of mobile marketing: not mobile screens as spaces for advertising, but planning for mobile to enhance product and user experiences, of which ads may be one part. This requires building mobile services and assets over the long-term (such as the excellent Nike Tricktree), not necessarily one-off ‘campaign hits’ for the sake of ticking a mobile box.\n\nContent and real-time marketing have been two of the most prolific topics here at SXSW. And the key questions are being tackled: should every brand ‘do’ real-time marketing? What’s the strategic value of content? A particularly highlight was Kristina Halvorson, of Brain Traffic, who accuses the marketing community of being ‘drunk’ on the buzz of agile and real-time content - the ""Oreo effect"".\n\nTo whoops of support, she called on brands and agencies to focus their content efforts on serving customers at their points of real need, and to have clearly defined content strategies that focus on making content that really counts, not chasing every new opportunity that arises.\n\nIn fact, putting customer experience first is a big theme across SXSW. On this count, the marketing community and the developer community have something in common: to remember that we’re designing digital services for customers, not ourselves, and their needs are always paramount. Adobe’s ‘pipeline’ development team revealed how they build new products, and at the heart of their process is one key principle: that the customer experience of any prototype defines success or failure. We need to put customers (and their behaviours) first, and the technology second.\n\n2 - Next: the near future\n\nYes, there are plenty of sessions about wearable technology. But there is one underlying, and more significant, trend here at SXSW that will play out over the next 2 years: what the Internet looks and feels like when it moves beyond phones, tablets and computers.\n\nWe are all familiar with responsive design. But in a session about next generation responsive, Sarah Rotman Epps of Forrester spoke compellingly about the need go beyond ‘responsive’ as a way to show webpages on 3 screens, to a new marketing design paradigm which cuts across any potential screen: digital signage, watches, in-car systems, connected TVs and others. When many more new screens are connected, design of marketing must be truly responsive: tailored to a customer need and the context they’re using a particular device in.\n\nIn fact, contextual user experience is another recurring theme of SXSW 2014. Partly driven by data, partly by new connected ‘ things’, and partly of the ubiquity of Internet access, designing how services (and marketing) help users in a particularly context and moment of need, is going to be a big challenge moving forward. Cliff Kuang of Wired sums it up by calling for ‘more context, less complexity’. By understand what people are doing on their devices at any point in time or place, we should tailor brand experiences that make life a little easier for them.\n\n3 - Beyond: new waves of disruption\n\nStaring into the distant future here at SXSW is exciting, and a little bit scary. The most fundamental trend I have seen is how technology reshapes manufacturing and our expectations of what products are. Ideo and Joi Ito of MIT Media Labs painted a picture of this potential new reality, where already in places like Shenzen, product designers are effectively ‘A/B testing’ physical products at scale by using advanced production and 3D-printing techniques.\n\nThey predict that everyday products will be embedded with sensors, such that almost anything, including our clothes, may respond to our emotional need-states. This points towards a future where mass customisation of products becomes a reality - where we expect the things we buy and use to respond to us. At this point, marketing really does meet user experience design.\n\nThere is one common thread I have seen that cuts across the now, next and beyond of SXSW: whether its content, context or customisation, the place is to start is with the needs of customers (and users) and build messages, experiences and products that improve their lives, even if just a little bit.', 'Thirty thousand delegates have come together for SXSW Interactive 2014, and the breadth of sessions, topics and speakers is vast.\nIt’s inspiring but also a bit of a sensory overload, as sessions about the ‘big’ trends in technology (e.g.\nretail, content, mobile).\nThere are four topics Iwhich we are all grappling with: mobile marketing, content, real-time communication and the evolution of social media for marketing.\nAnd the key questions are being tackled: should every brand ‘do’ real-time marketing?']"

(Jack Plunkett/AP Images for Dell, Inc.)\n\nIf you think you can just fit in at SXSW Interactive, you are wrong. Unless you normally only wear plain clothing with things like “Wordpress” or “Google” written across them, clear framed glasses and leather boots, you will stand out like a hipster in a Microsoft store.\n\nReally the only thing you can do to prepare yourself for the SXSW Interactive experience is practice your buzzwords. This way you can at least communicate with everyone else around you in the Austin Convention Center.\n\nThis is a list of the five words you need to know before leaving your apartment to go mingle with the #TechNerds downtown.\n\n1. Disrupt, verb: interrupt by causing a disturbance or problem\n\nSXSWi definition: new technology that unexpectedly displaces an already established technology\n\nSentence: “Man, online video is one disruptive technology that really changed the whole television game, bro, man.”\n\nIf you don’t know this one, go home. Really, go home. It is apparently the most important word in the TechBro language. If we’re lucky, one of the dudes with spiky hair trying to find a cute little TechBabe to settle down with will invent the next form of disruptive technology soon. Personally, I hope it has something to do with pants that can produce identification cards when you lose yours downtown during SXSW.\n\nSXSWi panel: Disruption of TV and the Future of “Online” Video\n\n2. Wearable, adjective: able to be worn\n\nSXSWi definition: some piece of technology that can be worn as clothing\n\nSentence: “This wearable is great for making calls but totally makes my wrist look fat.”\n\nThe Google Glassholes are only the beginning. From what I’ve heard walking around the Convention Center, there are big things coming the world of technological things you can wear on your actual body. Even Mindy Kaling is in on it — she talked about owning a calorie counter that can be worn on your bra.\n\nSXSWi panel: Wearable Devices: The Future of Healthcare?\n\n3. Platform, noun: a raised surface on which things or people can stand\n\nSXSWi definition: some public service through which you can spread your personal brand\n\nSentence: “I used to love Facebook, but now Twitter is definitely my favorite platform.”\n\nIf you haven’t heard of platforms by now, you’re doing it wrong. How are you even ON the Internet at all? You probably don’t even have a ***Brand*** (see below).\n\nSXSWi panel: Platforms vs. Publishers: A Big New Theory\n\n4. Brand, noun: a product made by a certain company under a certain name\n\nSXSWi definition: a person or company’s personality, essentially, presented in a marketable way\n\nSentence: “I don’t know, I just don’t think eating seven Cronuts in a row fits my Brand.”\n\nIf I’ve learned anything in three days of SXSW panels, it’s that you are nothing without your Brand. I’m in the process of figuring mine out, so you could say my Brand is “just trying to figure out my Brand.”\n\nSXSWi panel: Life’s a Breach, Don’t Burn Your Brand\n\n5. Startup, verb: the process of setting something in motion\n\nSXSWi definition: a small, decently innovative company made up of mostly 20-somethings who don’t need real jobs\n\nSentence: “I was in a pretty good startup at last year’s SXSW, but we kind of ended a few weeks after the festival.”\n\nIn a few years, SXSW might start requiring all attendees to be a part of some kind of startup. That might actually be a requirement now and I’m just missing out. There hasn’t been a single day I haven’t heard someone mention their startup. The strange thing is, none of them seem to exist anymore.

He and Gabriela broke up because she put academics before true love; she\'s cured cancer already, but she\'s still insufferable — and refuses to take her lab coat off even for the dance numbers. Gabriela\'s best friend Taylor is also insufferable, mostly because she never left East High where she now takes out her frustrations on students in the athletic decathlon team she still runs as a teacher.\n\nDespite what Sharpay\'s Fabulous Adventure may have suggested, everyone\'s secret favorite Sharpay Evans\' career showbiz career never really took off — but she did appear on a recent season of The Bachelor. (Note: this allows for a cameo appearance from real-life Bachelor crazies like Erica Rose from that season with Prince Lorenzo.) She doesn\'t speak to her twin brother Ryan any more because he\'s big into the gay party circuit and so is basically never not at the gym. Corbin Bleu\'s character Chad is also really buff now, but that\'s about all the character development he\'ll get. And Troy Bolton is buff too, despite the pill-popping, did I mention that?

The most exciting Mac’s day now gets is having sex in a room other than the bedroom, but he’s happy with his lot in life. And wouldn’t you be if your wife looked like Rose Byrne?All that changes when a fraternity moves in next door however. Initially shocked, Mac and his missus Kelly decide that their best tactic is to welcome the youngsters with open arms. And so they launch a charm offensive, stopping by to say hi, and even offering them a joint in an effort to be cool and neighborly.And initially things go well, with frat head Teddy (Zac Efron) bonding with Mac and flirting with Kelly. But the honeymoon period is brief, with Delta Psi’s parties becoming increasingly loud and raucous, so much so that the couple are forced to call the police. And that’s when the real fun begins.As war is declared, the frat boys endeavoring to ruin life for the couple and Mac and Kelly giving as good as they get.It starts with simple pranks, the lads making a mess on the couple’s lawn, the retaliation involving Kelly stirring things up between the brothers at one of their parties. But the battle quickly escalates, with proceedings turning both nasty and hilarious, most notably during Delta’s insane end of year blow-out.Efron excels as the douchebag daddy of the frat, all cocksure arrogance in the film’s early scenes before becoming increasingly insecure as proceedings progress. Indeed you’re never quit sure exactly where he's coming from throughout the film, which is a testament to Efron’s talents and makes Teddy the film’s most interesting character.Seth Rogen is as good as ever as Mac, his inherent likeability ensuring you root for the character in spite of his stupidity. And Rose Byrne is something of a revelation as Kelly, with many of the film’s best moments revolving around the nasty plans that she concocts.Dave Franco, Chritopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael also bring the laughs as frat-boy fools, while Submarine star Craig Roberts delivers a wicked turn as a pledge who is simply referred to as Ass-Juice.All of which makes for a very silly film that that has little in the way of depth or substance, but enough jokes to ensure that such superficiality doesn't really matter."", 'The frat-house comedy is a movie sub-genre that has spawned some of the most entertaining, immature and hilarious films of all-time.\nLoadingLoadingLoadingAnd Neighbors Rogen plays Mac Radner, who moves to suburbia with his wife and new-born baby in an effort to embrace the quiet life.\nThe most exciting Mac’s day now gets is having sex in a room other than the bedroom, but he’s happy with his lot in life.\nAnd wouldn’t you be if your wife looked like Rose Byrne?All that changes when a fraternity moves in next door however.\nInitially shocked, Mac and his missus Kelly decide that their best tactic is to welcome the youngsters with open arms.']"

Fairly or not, my excitement for Neighbors was seriously tempered (Efron is the only connective tissue betwee the two pics, but I didn’t think he was great in Moment).\n\nThat’ll teach me to whimsically equate unrelated productions.\n\nTo a sold out crowd, Neighbors made its premier Saturday night at SXSW, and it wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to say it had us literally rolling in the aisles. It’s no exaggeration to say this is one of the funniest and freshest R-comedies since The Hangover. Now if they can just avoid the impulse to serialize it to death.\n\nThe story follows two threads: Seth Rogen and Rose Byre as a couple with a new baby trying to come to terms with the realities of responsible adulthood, and a frat cohort led by Zac Efron and Dave Franco trying to make fraternity history by doing something epic, something on the level of say, inventing beer pong…and just maybe trying to cope with the impending conclusion of college as well. After burning a prior house down, the frat moves in next door to Teddy and Kelly (Rogen and Byrne), and through a series of events that I won’t go into here (but are pretty damn funny to watch), the two households begin an epic feud.\n\nIf that all sounds a little crazy, it’s because it is. But the movie absolutely nails the tone it’s trying for, consistently asking the audience not to suspend their disbelief entirely, but only to push the bounds of believable out a little ways. It’s what allows the movie to isolate Teddy and Kelly from the rest of the neighborhood by saying the frat bought out the rest of the block, but Teddy and Kelly can’t move because, being next to a frat, their home value has now plummeted. This is where the real fun of the movie is found. It gives itself license to do just about anything, but restrains itself just enough that the audience isn’t pulled in too many directions. It’s a lot like The Hangover, actually, by way of Home Alone. You want to believe all the craziness these characters do, and so it flies.\n\n\n\nA big part of that is the way the characters themselves are drawn. As the old adage goes, keep it simple, stupid, and although I never thought I’d celebrate character arcs so skinny they’re practically anorexic, it’s exactly that this movie calls for. What sets it apart is that is that it doesn’t forsake its characters. Rogen is the formerly partying everyman he plays so well, taken to a new high here when he’s forced to couple that with actual responsibility for a wife and child. Byrne’s Kelly is a woman struggling to stay sane while staying home all day. Efron is the king who knows his reign must end. And Franco is the sidekick who points him the way. There’s not very much, but the way little bits of personality are sprinkled throughout the film contributes the grounding that the picture has. But those are also easy character arcs to complete. The most heavy-handed it gets is Efron confronting his own college mortality, and even that gets broken up by an amazing series of bros before hoes jokes.\n\nBecause really, that’s what we want from this movie – jokes – and thank goodness the script and the actors are good enough to give us an abundance of hilarity. Rogen, of course, is a known comic quantity, but Efron proves very capable and Franco fits his sidekick role well, although it does seem like some of the awkwardness of his character is less acting and more pure awkwardness. Byrne gets a chance to leave behind the stuck up nature of her character in Bridesmaids, and absolutely owns it as the desperate-for-a-party Kelly. And finally, a discussion of the cast cannot conclude without mentioning the sublime comic supporting turn of Ike Bairnholtz as Teddy’s friend from work, as well as an all-too-brief performance from Lisa Kudrow.\n\nThe Verdict: 4 out of 5\n\nThis review has ended up somewhat shorter than normal, but that’s because there’s a very limited amount to say. This movie knows what it is: an R-comedy the vein of Knocked Up, Superbad, The Hangover, etc., but it’s smart enough to remain engaging and well executed to a high degree. My patience for this kind of film can be limited, but Neighbors knows what it’s doing. It doesn’t outstay its welcome, it’s hilarious throughout, and it has all the character development it needs without an ounce more. Your enjoyment of this film is going to be entirely contingent on your enjoyment of others of its kind, as it is directly out of the Apatow circle of influence, but rest assured – this is among the better films this subgenre has to offer.\n\nFor more on Neighbors, check out our impressions from the SXSW World Debut.', 'Fairly or not, my excitement for Neighbors was seriously tempered (Efron is the only connective tissue betwee the two pics, but I didn’t think he was great in Moment).\nThis is where the real fun of the movie is found.\nThe Verdict: 4 out of 5This review has ended up somewhat shorter than normal, but that’s because there’s a very limited amount to say.\nMy patience for this kind of film can be limited, but Neighbors knows what it’s doing.\nFor more on Neighbors, check out our impressions from the SXSW World Debut.']"

Over the weekend, a reporter for E! asked the actor if he would ever return to the sacred (?) halls of East High — home of Disney’s High School Musical franchise. And instead of shooting down the rumors, Efron replied, “We’re all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do…there’s just this look between us.”\n\nRight off the bat, I’ll acknowledge that while this isn’t a “no,” it’s also not confirmation of a reunion. But also: At this point, would a reunion be the worst idea? It’s not exactly surprising that Efron may be in, even though a year or two ago he wanted to graduate from East High for good. (UPDATE: When EW asked Disney Channel for a response to Efron’s comments, they sent this statement: “Everyone at Disney Channel takes pride in knowing that our wonderful ‘High School Musical’ cast has fond memories about their days as ‘Wildcats,’ and that each year, new audiences are introduced to the movies through our telecasts around the world, but we have no ‘new news’ to report.”)\n\nIf Efron did decide to return and give us “Scream Pt. 2,” it’s easy to see the rest of the cast following suit. They wouldn’t even have to carry a full movie: For a long time, Disney was developing a fourth High School Musical for TV. (And no, I’m not talking about SNL‘s High School Musical: New Senior Class.) The movie, called High School Musical: East Meets West, supposedly would have starred a new cast, and would have told a West Side Story-esque story about East and West High. (Real talk: What was Troy and Gabrielle’s love if not a millennial, significantly less high-stakes version of Maria and Tony?) The project keeps getting pushed back, but it hasn’t been canceled — Disney just put out Teen Beach Movie instead. But what if it got revved up again — and the original HSM gang came back for a little alumni number? (Efron has long said he would consider doing something like that.)\n\nA return from the original six could give HSM4 enough buzz for the movie to get off the ground. After all, Efron — while clearly the star of the bunch — has seen his last couple projects disappoint (RIP, That Awkward Moment). And while he’ll still have no trouble booking future films, it could be in Efron’s best interest to remind people why they love him in the first place. Specifically, I’m talking about this:\n\nWas this whole post of hypothetical teen movie hype just an excuse to embed the video above, so you can start your week off right? Bet on it.', 'halls of East High — home of Disney’s High School Musical franchise.\nI continue to see all the guys from High School.\nThey wouldn’t even have to carry a full movie: For a long time, Disney was developing a fourth High School Musical for TV.\n(And no, I’m not talking about SNL‘s High School Musical: New Senior Class.)\nThe movie, called High School Musical: East Meets West, supposedly would have starred a new cast, and would have told a West Side Story-esque story about East and West High.']"

""She can do every kind of character and none of them are like who she is exactly. From the very beginning, when we were talking about this couple, she was at the top of our list.""\n\nByrne and Rogen star as that aforementioned couple, Kelly and Mac, new parents who have their lives thrown into further disarray when a fraternity house run by Efron and Franco moves next door. ""Neighbors"" tracks the escalating war between the two residences, as well as Byrne and Rogen\'s slow realization that they are no longer young and cool. (A hilarious conversation between Rogen and Efron\'s characters about whether Batman is most associated with Michael Keaton or Christian Bale puts the generational divide in pop-culture context.) Within that setup, Byrne\'s character is allowed to express just as much immaturity and confusion as her onscreen husband, yanking ""Neighbors"" out of the familiar pool of male-driven, arrested development comedies which have risen to prominence in the last decade.\n\n""When I had my first baby, I had a nervous breakdown. As did my wife,"" said Stoller, who also directed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""The Five-Year Engagement."" ""It wasn\'t like she was fine with it. When I asked all my friends, they said the same thing: everybody has a nervous breakdown. Usually in movies, just the guy does. It\'s unrealistic.""\n\nEschewing those expected norms, however, may have an unintended consequence: exposing how audiences are now conditioned to expect the worst when it comes to the portrayal modern-day wives and girlfriends in studio comedies.\n\n""There was a funny thing where we had a test screening, and there was a focus group afterward. Rose\'s character always tests really high. We were talking to the focus group and asked, \'Why do you like Rose?\' And this guy was like, \'Because she was, like, not just yelling at her husband,\'"" Stoller said before breaking into laughter. ""That\'s the lowest fucking bar. Rose does a great job, but we could do anything. Just be nice to Seth and we would get accolades.""\n\nAs Stoller recalled, crafting Byrne\'s character was a collaborative effort, one that started with Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O\'Brien\'s script and extended to the actress herself.\n\n""Rose helped us, too,"" Stoller said of making sure that Kelly was never, in his words, a ""shrew."" ""There was still even a little bit of that in the draft as we got closer to shooting. It was actually when they go over to the frat on the first night. We only had Seth sneaking out and lying about it to Rose. She was like, \'I think I would go.\' We were like, \'Okay, you\'re right.

2928,http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/09/sxsw-2014-neighbors-review-seth-rogen-zac-efron,entertainment,"['Seth Rogen’s being a grown-up again. Fear not, those who remember Ro-Bro’s crying scene in Take This Waltz – this time the relationship stuff is played way down in the dirt. Bad Neighbours – writer-director Nicholas Stoller’s smart, disgusting gutter-dweller – has little time for the intricacies of long-term love and commitment. Instead it crashes Project X into a Joe Swanberg movie, invites it to chug the drinks and throw up all over the rug.\n\nRogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, new parents who go to war against the college fraternity that have moved in next door. Head of the frat pack is Zac Efron as Teddy, a sweet-natured lunk who doesn’t want to keep the couple’s baby awake, but can’t pass up an opportunity to party.\n\nStoller – the long-term Apatow collaborator who also had a hand in 2011’s Muppets revamp – has always been good at mixing profanity and pathos. His directorial debut, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, hid a sincere romantic drama behind all the dick jokes. Neighbors is far less subtle, barely bothering to check if its dignity’s in place before leaping into the next filthy setup.\n\nRogen and Byrne have great chemistry as the thirtysomethings anxious to do right by their daughter, look cool in front of the kids and still get invited to party like they used to. Byrne’s role is meatier than most comedies – even Apatow comedies – allow their female stars. Kelly is as conniving as Mac, equally keen to get one over the college kids by doing something moronic. They’re a very likable couple, both as tempted by the hard partying lifestyle of Teddy and co as they are dismissive of it.\n\nEfron is strangely blank for the alpha-male leader of a group of marauding teens, but his support – including Dave Franco as his big-brained lieutenant, Pete, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as “blessed” numbskull Scoonie – pick up the slack. Submarine’s Craig Roberts pops up in a charming little role as a wannabe frat member. He’s full of conflicted emotions about his place in the all-male society, unsure how the house’s intensely homo-social heirarchy chimes with his need for independence. His character is called Assjuice.\n\n\n\nBad Neighbours needs a tuck. The pacing is wobbly, the targets are too big. There are some lazy gags about post-natal sex (“she’s got these huge tits, but she insists on wearing a wife-beater. It’s like fucking Tony Soprano!”) and too much focus on Scoonie’s schlong. But it’s also an extremely funny comedy that pushes Rogen’s instinctive good nature to the limit. His stoner schtick helps to take the edge off much of the film’s crassness and gives it back some charm.\n\n• This review was first published to coincide with the SXSW premiere of Bad Neighbours', 'Bad Neighbours – writer-director Nicholas Stoller’s smart, disgusting gutter-dweller – has little time for the intricacies of long-term love and commitment.\nRogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, new parents who go to war against the college fraternity that have moved in next door.\nKelly is as conniving as Mac, equally keen to get one over the college kids by doing something moronic.\nSubmarine’s Craig Roberts pops up in a charming little role as a wannabe frat member.\n• This review was first published to coincide with the SXSW premiere of Bad Neighbours']"

First was the rain, which wasn’t quite “roaring” but was plenty cold and wet enough to be despised by all in line. Second was Neighbors, a comedy of young couple meets frat house starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron. There are definitely traces of Judd Apatow influence, which makes sense given that the writer, director, and at least a plurality of the producers have been involved projects from the Apatow circle of friends, but Neighbors is probably the freshest, funniest R-comedy to appear since the first Hangover. The packed Paramount theater where the film was screened, not a small venue, was roaring through basically the whole debut.\n\nAnd this was technically just a public debut, not a premier, because the version we were shown was called a “work in progress,” but some color and sound balance aside, this looks pretty much done. Some of the cast and production team did a short Q&A after the screening, and they said there are still a couple minor cuts to be made, but my guess is this is as much about cleaning up transitions as it is cutting material.\n\nA full review is incoming in the near future, but for now suffice it to say that Efron and Rogen seem perfectly cast. That douche Efron was playing in That Awkward Moment? This is his funnier, dumber (literally, but also in a good way), crazier college doppelganger, and he actually fits the narrative this time around. Rogen is also treading somewhat familiar territory here as the adult who still wants to party every now and then, but he does it really well. Rose Byrne is a great addition as Rogen’s wife, as is Ike Bairnholtz as Rogen’s friend and coworker who absolutely steals a few of the scenes he’s in. Also a shout out to the baby as one of the cutest, most emotive film babies I can ever remember.\n\nThis movie strikes exactly the ridiculous tone you’d expect from a film with the premise of a war between a frat house and their slightly more…well, no not any more responsible neighbors, but that’s a really good thing. The production leans into the just-beyond-believable ridiculousness of it all, and – I can’t believe I’m saying this – should be commended for keeping its requisite character development and associated somber moments to a minimum and mostly out of the way. Guys, this was a really fun film.\n\nFun fact: of all the principle cast, none of them went to college, and of the main production team, only one was actually in a frat.', 'First was the rain, which wasn’t quite “roaring” but was plenty cold and wet enough to be despised by all in line.\nSecond was Neighbors, a comedy of young couple meets frat house starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron.\nThe packed Paramount theater where the film was screened, not a small venue, was roaring through basically the whole debut.\nA full review is incoming in the near future, but for now suffice it to say that Efron and Rogen seem perfectly cast.\nAlso a shout out to the baby as one of the cutest, most emotive film babies I can ever remember.']"

2939,http://www.thewrap.com/zac-efron-shops-dildos-neighbors-proving-hes-far-disney-star/,entertainment,"['Don’t call Zac Efron a Disney star anymore.\n\nIn “Neighbors,” an irreverent comedy directed by Nick Stoller, Efron continues his transition from teen idol to mature actor — with a big push from Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. Efron plays Rogen’s neighbor, the president of a fraternity hellbent on making history by throwing the greatest party his college town has ever seen. He’s more than a just Rogen’s co-star, he’s the comedic foil to Rogen, one of the most successful comedy writers and actors of the past decade.\n\nAlso read: Shirtless Zac Efron, Seth Rogen Tease ‘Bound 4’ Parody (Photo)\n\n“These actors that grow up through the Disney system have insane chops,” Stoller told TheWrap Saturday. “[Zac’s] very funny and knows what makes him funny. He’s not afraid to play the straight man and he has some of my favorite impov scenes.”\n\nAlso read: Zac Efron Tells Jimmy Kimmel Seth Rogen ‘Wanted to Hate’ Him (Video)\n\nThe movie drew a raucous applause after a “work in progress” cut of the film premiered Saturday night at South By Southwest. Though Rogen taunted a few members of the crowd, labeling one “self-serving,” Stoller deemed the festival “the best place to play a movie.” He was in Austin six years ago with the crowd-pleasing “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” his directorial debut. That movie, which features a naked Jason Segel in an early scene, is tame compared to “Neighbors.” Rogen and Byrne play a married couple horrified by the arrival of a frat next door. Yet neither is ready to grow up — as in so many recent comedies — so they get caught up trying to fight their new enemy with juvenile hijinks.\n\nThe story was born when Brendan O’Brien’s wife described some youths in the neighborhood by telling a cop “I don’t’ know what they’re doing, but they’re up to no good.”\n\n“We became old at that moment,” O’Brien, who co-wrote the movie with Andrew Jay Cohen, told the crowd.\n\nSee photos: 15 Gotta-See SXSW Movies: Zac Efron Bros Out and Jeremy Sisto Balls Out\n\nThe movie takes this concept to the extreme. During a friendly night of partying at the neighboring frat house, Rogen takes mushrooms and “crosses streams” with Efron — a bonding mechanism of sorts. Yet the relationship deteriorates from there as Efron and his buddies, including Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, exact retribution after Rogen and Byrne call the cops about a party. When Rogen retaliates by flooding the frat house with water, Efron devises a scheme to save it by having his brothers craft dildos from their own members and sell them. They get a hot tub out if it. All of these shenanigans are still tamer than the final party, which Stoller said was designed to be the “craziest party you’ve ever been at.”\n\nSee video: SXSW: Watch Live Interviews With Seth Rogen, Robert Duvall, Emmy Rossum, Paul Wesley, Kathryn Hahn and More\n\nThe writer-director learned a lot about shooting party scenes from “Get Him to the Greek,” his follow-up to “Sarah Marshall” starring Jonah Hill and Russell Brand. “Neighbors” features numerous memorable performances from comedy mainstays Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Franco, among others, but the two standouts are Byrne and Efron. Byrne plays a woman every bit as ferocious as her husband, defying the comedic trope of the controlling, bleating wife. She rejects Rogen when he tries to tell her she’s supposed to keep him in check. She even facilitates a fraternal betrayal by feeding shots to Efron’s girlfriend and Franco — and then kissing both of them. The next morning Rogen is obligated to milk Byrne’s inflated breasts.\n\n“It was important to her that this character not be a nag in any way,” Stoller told TheWrap. “Usually the woman in these movies is not that fun. My movies have gone away from that. I’ve made the female characters as funny as the guys.”\n\nAlso read: Can Naked Zac Efron and ‘That Awkward Moment’ Revive Rom-Coms for the Sexting Age?\n\nAs for Efron, he’s been on a mission to erase the Disney stigma and demonstrate his versatility, whether by flirting with Nicole Kidman in “The Paperboy” or palling around with Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan in “That Awkward Moment.” Kidman already peed on him in “The Paperboy,” but “Neighbors” takes the raunch to a new level. When an audience member asked him about the transition from Disney star to comedic foil, he gave the following reply, “When you get a call from Seth Rogen, you’re in a good spot.”\n\nPictured below: Zac Efron, Seth Rogen and Dave Franco at SXSW premiere of “Neighbors”', 'Don’t call Zac Efron a Disney star anymore.\nAlso read: Shirtless Zac Efron, Seth Rogen Tease ‘Bound 4’ Parody (Photo)“These actors that grow up through the Disney system have insane chops,” Stoller told TheWrap Saturday.\nSee photos: 15 Gotta-See SXSW Movies: Zac Efron Bros Out and Jeremy Sisto Balls OutThe movie takes this concept to the extreme.\nI’ve made the female characters as funny as the guys.”Also read: Can Naked Zac Efron and ‘That Awkward Moment’ Revive Rom-Coms for the Sexting Age?\nWhen an audience member asked him about the transition from Disney star to comedic foil, he gave the following reply, “When you get a call from Seth Rogen, you’re in a good spot.”Pictured below: Zac Efron, Seth Rogen and Dave Franco at SXSW premiere of “Neighbors”']"
2940,http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/neighbors-review-sxsw-2014/,entertainment,"['Based on the merits of being a “How To” guide for aspiring parents, Neighbors is a one star movie about two adults selfishly putting their own insecurities before the well-being of their newborn baby. We’re talking some gratuitously debaucherous middle-aged partying including magic mushrooms, sword fighting, shot ripping, and every other fraternal stereotype possible. Wildly inappropriate, of course, but with Nicholas Stoller’s outlandish direction, Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien watch their screenplay turn into a riotous Greek life comedy that’ll make you question every responsible decision you made throughout your college career. Stoller himself admitted that only one member of his production team actually lived a fraternity life in college, so you can imagine the generalizations and stereotypes blown wildly out of proportion, but it’s all in the name of comedy – and the most epic rager that frat life could possibly imagine.\n\nMac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are new parents enjoying their more modest suburban lifestyle, embracing early nights and child care instead of raves and late night diner trips. Their life is your simple blue-collar affair, and their neighborhood equatable to Anywhere, USA – until a fraternity moves in next door. Led by President Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and his Vice President Pete (Dave Franco), this is your Animal House style fraternity with the dial cranked even higher, as it’s Teddy’s mission to earn his rightful place on the frat’s Hall of Fame board, along with the supposed inventors of the Toga Party and every college kid’s best friend, the Boot and Rally. This doesn’t bode well for the Radner’s humble lifestyle, so they decide to fight back. Can Mac and Kelly party hard enough to infiltrate the frat and get them evicted? If there’s one brotherhood you should avoid starting a war with, it’s an immature, vengeful frat – something that the Radners are about to find out.\n\nGraduating from High School Musical heartthrob to full-blown college douche, Zac Efron was meant to play the testosterone-charged frat superhero Teddy Sanders. Efron has never been funnier, and getting away from his “good guy” persona creates a completely embellished caricature that’s entirely too much fun to ignore, pairing nicely with his second-in-command played by Dave Franco – another young actor who pops his collar and leaves us in stitches. The chemistry between these two is highlighted by a scene I can only dream was improvised on set, recording Teddy and Pete’s genius reinventions of the phrase “bros before hos” – only to have Pete heartbroken later when Teddy doesn’t acknowledge the “bropology” that took place, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT RHYMED! Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael round out our alpha dogs, one a certifiable porn star and the other a hopeless pothead, but it’s Teddy and Pete who ultimately win us over through wicked epicness – that’s what the kids say these days, right?\n\nAs for Rogen and Byrne – where do I start? Again, for any aspiring parents at home, you’ll have to understand the fact that Neighbors is meant to be nothing but drunken fun, and it succeeds mightily. The Radners leave their child at home for an entire night full of fraternity partying, and get sufficiently intoxicated, but everything is alright because Rose has her baby monitor. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME – but please witness the utter hilarity that our bored couple creates.\n\nNeighbors is essentially pornography for adults who fantasize about reliving their glory years, now unable to slug Jager and take two story bong rips, as those viewers can live vicariously through Rogen and Byrne – a comedic dream couple. Whether it’s Rogen dancing his ass off while wearing a goofy gansta’ hat or Byrne turning from innocent housewife into manipulative female she-demon, these two talents riff off one another with perfect comedic ease, again aiding Stoller’s admittedly overplayed mentality. Oh, and Byrne – please stick to only horror and comedy from here on out. Please?!\n\nAs for the party-hearty shenanigans throughout Neighbors, Stoller and company create every college boy’s fantasy while also somehow addressing fears that come along with leaving college – albeit nothing but surface recognition. You’re here to laugh, and watching Rogen attempt to keep up with Efron delivers “first pot brownie” hilarity. Blacklights, kegs, drugs, sorority girls, bro bonding, tank tops, Robert De Niro themed parties – Neighbors goes for broke and succeeds in creating one of the funniest fraternal comedies since Animal House – the Holy Grail of college humor. Stoller’s complete disregard for reality is his greatest weapon, subduing audiences with masculine hugs and spot on sight gags that again live in some fantasy world where airbags can hide in chairs, launching unknowing victims into crumbly tile ceilings. Nothing will make you miss college more until you realize your college life was nothing like Teddy’s – and then you’ll just want to pull an Old School.\n\nNeighbors is like walking into a frat party and witnessing a game of beer pong between Willie Nelson, Kenny Powers, and the Coors Light commercial twins – it’s probably just a hallucinogenic tease brought on by some “party favors” you popped earlier, but for the time being, it’s nothing but pure, entertaining bliss. Attacking “bro” culture with the energy of a ‘roided out grizzly bear, Stoller pushes comedy farther than he’s ever attempted, an easy achievement with such a star-studded comedic cast. Efron is a pastel plastered revelation, and has honestly never been funnier – the same goes for Byrne, minus the abs and plus a maternal surprise. Sure, there’s a paper-thin story that doesn’t really strike the serious notes of maturing, growing older, and accepting a more “normal” life – but with non-stop laughs and gut-busting highlights, Neighbors is a death cup victory on Team Stoller’s first pong shots.', 'We’re talking some gratuitously debaucherous middle-aged partying including magic mushrooms, sword fighting, shot ripping, and every other fraternal stereotype possible.\nTheir life is your simple blue-collar affair, and their neighborhood equatable to Anywhere, USA – until a fraternity moves in next door.\nGraduating from High School Musical heartthrob to full-blown college douche, Zac Efron was meant to play the testosterone-charged frat superhero Teddy Sanders.\nAgain, for any aspiring parents at home, you’ll have to understand the fact that Neighbors is meant to be nothing but drunken fun, and it succeeds mightily.\nNothing will make you miss college more until you realize your college life was nothing like Teddy’s – and then you’ll just want to pull an Old School.']"

2942,http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/03/neighbors-sxsw-premiere-recap,entertainment,"['""Who here is a little bit drunk?""\n\nAnd to that question, damn near everyone in attendance at last night\'s Neighbors world premiere screening at the SXSW Film Festival broke out in thunderous applause. And we\'re talking upwards of 1,000 rowdy cinephiles, too, being that Neighbors was unveiled at Austin\'s Paramount Theatre, a 1,100-seat venue that resembles one of those old-school opera houses, complete with side balconies and an upper seating level.\n\nThe man asking the question: director Nicholas Stoller, getting the crowd hyped up for his new movie\'s first-ever screening. Stoller\'s back at SXSW after the successful 2008 premiere of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his directorial debut prefacing Get Him to the Greek. Where Sarah Marshall was a raucous but often tender look at failed love and loneliness, Neighbors is a totally different beast. Foul-mouthed, kinetic, and lean (clocking in at a just-right 95 minutes), it\'s consistently hilarious—come May 9, when Neighbors officially opens theatrically, it will be the funniest movie a major Hollywood studio (in this case, Universal Pictures) will have released since 2012\'s Jump Street.\n\nThere was hardly a quiet moment throughout the screening, due in large part to the film\'s loaded cast, all of whom are on the entire time. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Mac and Kelly Rdner, a happily married couple trying to keep the flame going despite the fact that they\'re raising an infant girl, Stella (a natural born scene-stealer if there ever was one). To complicate their domestic life, Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity made up of mostly dim-witted meatheads, moves into the house next door, turning Teddy and Kelly\'s neighborhood into a 24/7 reenactment of National Lampoon\'s Animal House. Led by president Teddy (Zac Efron) and his VP, Pete (Dave Franco), the frat dudes go to the extremes of partying—at one point, they turn their entire home into a ""hotbox house,"" which, yes, is close what it sounds like, only much more set-design ambitious. It doesn\'t help Mac\'s situation that Teddy\'s beyond ripped, with arms that, as Mac puts it, look like ""two big veiny dicks.""\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNeighbors is, for the most part, a tightly connected series of sight gags and profane one-liners, but unlike most Hollywood comedies, very few of the film\'s jokes miss. It\'d be too obvious to single out Rogen\'s performance, even though he hasn\'t been this funny on-screen since Knocked Up. An ensemble piece, Neighbors features two unexpected MVP performances from Dave Franco and Rose Byrne. Franco, playing off of the similarly impressive against-type Efron, gets just as many strong punch-lines as Rogen, while Byrne never lets the dominant comedic force who\'s playing her fictional other-half overshadow her. In fact, she got the premiere\'s biggest round of applause, coming after a set-piece in which Mac and Kelly strategically turn Teddy and Pete against each other by challenging the old ""bros before hoes"" conceit.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nByrne\'s big moment happens in the midst of one of the film\'s many frat house raves, all of which radiate with flashing neon lights, energetic handheld camerawork, and unruly close-ups and camera angles. During the post-screening Q&A, for which the entire cast minus Rose Byrne participated, Stoller cited the 2009 French head-trip film Enter the Void as a ""visual touchstone"" used by he and director of photography Brandon Trost for the Neighbors party scenes, and it shows.\n\nNot that Stoller or any of his cast were able to bring any personal experiences to those sequences, though. While introducing the film, Stoller dedicated it to producer James Weaver, the only person involved with Neighbors who was ever in a fraternity. ""The rest of us,"" said Stoller, ""were Jews and child stars. Thank you, James, for explaining to me what an elephant walk is.""\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOnce the movie ended, Stoller hopped back on stage along with the entire cast. Unsurprisingly, that\'s when Seth Rogen took over the proceedings. The first question came from one rather enthusiastic audience member, a guy who stepped into one of the aisles to make sure Rogen and company could clearly see him. ""That was one of the best movies I\'ve ever seen,"" he said, spending a solid 60 seconds repeating that sentiment with different phrasings. At his final ""best movie ever"" exclamation, Rogen didn\'t waste a second. ""I\'m gonna fuck the shit out of that guy! The second this is over!""\n\nThe only time one of Rogen\'s responses earned a larger outburst of clapping than that? When another audience member cited a bit in Neighbors where Rogen and Efron\'s characters, both excessively drunk and high, discuss their personal favorite Batmans—the older Mac prefers Michael Keaton and the much younger Teddy likes Christian Bale. The question for Rogen was, simply, ""Who\'s Batman to you?"" Showing love to Keaton, he asked the crowd, ""Who here like the George Clooney Batman? Absolutely no one.""\n\nThe Q&A as a whole, not unlike Neighbors itself, maintained that kind of random humor. Barely any of the audience\'s questions pertained directly to the movie. One obnoxious guy, for shame, asked the cast and crew if they\'d take an ""epic selfie"" like Ellen Degeneres\' at the Academy Awards—fortunately, Rogen quickly shot that request down.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe last question of the night: ""Will there be a sequel?""\n\n""No,"" said Rogen. ""First this one needs to make money, and none of you paid to be here, as far as I know.""\n\n""So, basically,"" continued Stoller, ""it hasn\'t made any money yet.""\n\nWritten by Matt Barone (@MBarone)\n\nFor more of Complex Pop Culture\'s SXSW coverage, click here.', ""And to that question, damn near everyone in attendance at last night's Neighbors world premiere screening at the SXSW Film Festival broke out in thunderous applause.\nThe man asking the question: director Nicholas Stoller, getting the crowd hyped up for his new movie's first-ever screening.\nStoller's back at SXSW after the successful 2008 premiere of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his directorial debut prefacing Get Him to the Greek.\nWhere Sarah Marshall was a raucous but often tender look at failed love and loneliness, Neighbors is a totally different beast.\nPOST CONTINUES BELOWOnce the movie ended, Stoller hopped back on stage along with the entire cast.""]"

Presented as a work-in-progress at SXSW (though aside from missing credits and a few continuity quirks, it appears largely finished), “Neighbors” is an unchecked riot that should go a long way toward selling antagonist Zac Efron as a credible adult actor, though as with anything involving the Greek system, a bit more moderation from the start might have prevented a few headaches afterward.\n\nRogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, a young married couple whose infant daughter has prompted a move into the suburbs. Aside from the disruption to their sex and social lives — their efforts to organize “baby’s first rave” notwithstanding — the couple seem to be managing the transition to parenthood well, until the property next door is taken over by the Delta Psi Beta fraternity, led by peacocking president Teddy (Efron) and his brainy, just barely sublimated love interest, Pete (Dave Franco).\n\nThe frat’s arrival forces Mac and Kelly to confront their own accelerating decline into old fogeydom, as they frantically debate the least-uncool way to deliver the phrase “could you keep it down?” to their new neighbors. The two parties extend some initial olive branches, with Teddy inviting the couple over for some magic mushrooms and Mac strenuously attempting to use the word “trill” in conversation, but when Mac and Kelly finally call the cops on one of the frat’s weeknight ragers, the two houses declare all-out war.\n\nWhile the film’s first 15 or so minutes bear a notable resemblance to Stoller’s shaggier, more amiable previous efforts like “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” and “The Five-Year Engagement,” at this point the director allows chaos to reign supreme, with the pic quickly turning into “Revenge of the Nerds” by way of “Spring Breakers.” Mac and Kelly’s meeting with the university dean (Lisa Kudrow) reveals that the frat has only two disciplinary strikes left before it will be disbanded, and the couple instigates an elaborate campaign of sabotage, with Delta house responding in kind.\n\nThere’s little here that makes much sense from a narrative standpoint — indeed, Rogen’s 2013 hit, “This Is the End,” might as well be Bergman by comparison — yet only occasionally does it matter. Subplots involving Mac and Kelly’s best buddy (Ike Barinholtz) appear to be missing key establishing scenes. At times the film abandons all pretense of sketching a real dramatic arc altogether, simply lining up one outlandish, frenzied setpiece after another. And at the end of the day, there’s no real reason for Efron and Rogen to stage an epic kung fu battle using plaster casts of the Delta house members’ members. But sticklers will be few and far between.\n\nRelegated to middling girlfriend roles for far too long, Byrne is here cast as the most foul-mouthed matriarch this side of “August: Osage County,” and she attacks the role with almost maniacal enthusiasm. But it’s the eternally shirtless ex-teen idol Efron, surprisingly, who delivers the film’s most intriguing performance, crafting a dime-turning combination of brotherly earnestness and Mephistophelean sadism that will ring true to anyone who ever found themselves on the losing end of a wooden paddle.\n\nIn some of the film’s best scenes, particularly a hysterical coda outside an Abercrombie & Fitch store, Rogen and Efron’s characters seem less nemeses than distorted reflections of one another. (On some level, Teddy seems to realize it’s only a matter of years before he’ll find himself on the other side of the fence, tormented by a jerk exactly like himself.) It might have been interesting to see a somewhat deeper, more Apatovian take on this theme, though “deeper” is not a direction the film ever seems interested in navigating.\n\nThere are a number of missed marks, however. A gag about infant HIV really needs to be funnier than this one is to justify its existence, while a woefully pointless breast-pump fiasco sequence feels almost cynically engineered just to give the film a “Bridesmaids”-style bodily function conversation-starter. (It may as well have been referred to in the script as “that scene.”) It’s an unnecessary but unsurprising move for a movie that values volume over consistency.\n\nTechnically speaking, the pic is much better shot and edited than a college comedy really needs to be, with the frequent party scenes in particular taking on an almost surrealistic timbre.', 'Rogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, a young married couple whose infant daughter has prompted a move into the suburbs.\nThe frat’s arrival forces Mac and Kelly to confront their own accelerating decline into old fogeydom, as they frantically debate the least-uncool way to deliver the phrase “could you keep it down?” to their new neighbors.\nSubplots involving Mac and Kelly’s best buddy (Ike Barinholtz) appear to be missing key establishing scenes.\nAt times the film abandons all pretense of sketching a real dramatic arc altogether, simply lining up one outlandish, frenzied setpiece after another.\nIt might have been interesting to see a somewhat deeper, more Apatovian take on this theme, though “deeper” is not a direction the film ever seems interested in navigating.']"

2953,http://time.com/19350/netflix-comcast-speed/,entertainment,"['Comcast broadband subscribers are already enjoying better Netflix streaming performance just two weeks after the companies struck an agreement to directly connect their networks — and Netflix says even better performance is on the way.\n\nIn its latest ISP speed index released Monday, Netflix said that prime-time video streams on Comcast averaged 1.68Mbps in February, up from 1.51Mbps in January, reversing months of steady declines and boosting Comcast’s ranking by two spots on the list. Prior to February, the average performance of Netflix streaming video content delivered to Comcast subscribers declined by more than 25% over the last few months. As recently as October of last year, Netflix was streaming at 2.07Mbps.\n\nAs part of the deal — known as a paid-peering or transit agreement — Netflix gained a direct connection to the Comcast’s network, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as third-party intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms. Financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed. The pact was announced on February 23 and the improved connections began several days before that, but the performance increases will take some time before they’re fully felt by all Netflix users with Comcast service.\n\n(MORE: Comcast’s Traffic Pact With Netflix Is Shrouded in Secrecy)\n\nDespite the boost in performance, Comcast remains below the U.S. streaming average of 1.95Mbps, but further improvements are on the way, per Netflix. “We do expect to see Comcast’s performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data as a result of the recent agreement between Netflix and Comcast,” Joris Evers, director of communications at Netflix, wrote in a company blog post.\n\nGoogle Fiber, the tech giant’s gigabit broadband service, remains by far the fastest U.S. provider of Netflix streaming video, with average performance of 3.74Mbps, according to the company. In the blog post, Netflix called Google Fiber “the guiding North Star for broadband performance in the country.” Google has already launched fiber initiatives in Kansas City, Austin and Provo, and last month announced plans to work with nine more metro areas to expand the service.\n\nAmong major U.S. broadband providers, Verizon DSL is the slowest, with average performance of 0.93Mbps. Verizon’s high-speed FiOS service is slightly faster than Comcast at 1.76Mbps, but that service continues to decline in the rankings, as does AT&T U-verse, which clocked in at 1.66 Mbps.\n\nIn the wake of Netflix’s deal with Comcast, Verizon and AT&T both acknowledged that they are seeking to reach an agreement with the streaming video service. As high-bandwidth services like Netflix have exploded in popularity, the broadband companies are increasingly seeking compensation in exchange for direct connections to improve performance.\n\nNetflix says its ISP speed index is “based on data from the more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide who view over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix each month. The listed speeds reflect the average performance of all Netflix streams on each ISP’s network and are an indicator of the performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network.

In Hollywood terms, the arrangement might not be anything remarkable – just a new way of syndicating reruns. But cutting Netflix out of the picture for its signature show sends a clear signal that the entertainment and cable industries aren\'t about to let some Northern California tech company change television without exacting a price.\n\nThanks to the company\'s aggressive marketing, House of Cards is known as a Netflix show just as much as The Sopranos was an HBO show. But even the $100 million it reportedly spent didn\'t buy Netflix all the rights to Frank Underwood\'s Machiavellian rise. Apparently, that money gave Netflix only the exclusive right to stream two seasons online first, and it didn\'t even cover the total production costs of the first 26 episodes. The rest of the costs fell on Media Rights Capital, the independent studio that actually made House of Card, and it is free to sell other rights.\n\nTo make its money back, the studio has a deal with Sony to handle distribution of House of Cards internationally and for ""home video,"" a term that in the Netflix streaming-video era seems meaningless. In practice, it means Sony gets to sell House of Cards DVDs and other ways for couch surfers to pay a la carte for the show, such as on Amazon Instant Video. That appears to be the kind of agreement Comcast struck with Sony, which also lets the cable provider offer access to Sony movies such as American Hustle ahead of other video-on-demand services.\n\nFor Comcast, the movies seem like the meat of the deal, while the House of Cards arrangement is more about sending a message to Netflix and the general public. The rise of Netflix and other streaming services have encouraged the rise of ""cord-cutting,"" which threatens the cable business, and Comcast isn\'t taking this laying down. Recently, Comcast exercised its own leverage by getting Netflix to pay for more direct access to Comcast\'s network, and now, the cable giant to making another move with its House of Cards deal, showing that it can cannibalize Netflix\'s business right back.\n\nNot that a swarm of Comcast customers are about to go out and spend money to watch House of Cards somewhere other than Netflix – or at least they shouldn\'t. It\'s not clear how much Comcast plans to charge. But on Amazon, for instance, high-definition episodes are $2.99 a piece, or nearly $39 for the whole season. That\'s almost as much as five months of Netflix, which also includes season two, as well as Orange Is the New Black, another Netflix hit coming to Comcast soon. But just by making House of Cards an option, Comcast is eating into the brand identity Netflix is trying to establish for itself as the only place to watch ""its"" shows.\n\nOriginal programming has become crucial to Netflix\'s business model. By getting House of Cards, Comcast sends a subtle signal to Netflix non-subscribers that maybe they don\'t need to spend that extra eight dollars a month after all. They might not actually pay Comcast to watch House of Cards either, but just knowing they could get the show there might be enough.

That’s according to a report from Variety, which notes that Comcast made a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, thereby giving Comcast the rights to sell the series through its newly launched Xfinity Store.\n\nWhile Netflix owns exclusive streaming rights to House of Cards, Sony is in charge of international and home distribution.\n\nComcast also made a deal with Lionsgate that will give it rights to sell Netflix’s other highly acclaimed original series Orange is the New Black in May.\n\nComcast has confirmed the report, but Netflix could not be reached for comment.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that Comcast subscribers can stream Netflix free of additional costs. It’s the digital equivalent of buying the DVD set when it hits the shelves months after the season airs. Non-Netflix users have been able to watch House of Cards since season one was released on DVD last June. It’s also available in other digital stores, such as Amazon Instant Video, Walmart.com, and Verizon Fios.\n\nA Comcast spokesperson says that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store within the next 30 days, and that it will only be the first season of the show. The second season will presumably become available in the Xfinity Store some time around or after it’s made available on DVD.\n\nPreviously, Netflix was in discussions with Comcast about the possibility of bringing a Netflix app to Comcast set-top boxes. Those discussions were reportedly put on hold (as were Netflix’s talks with Time Warner about the same thing) when Comcast acquired Time Warner for $45 billion. Meanwhile, Comcast has reportedly been working on a video-on-demand service that could “out-Netflix Netflix.”\n\nLast month, Netflix and Comcast announced a deal in which Netflix will pay for direct access to Comcast’s subscribers. Net neutrality rules are meant to ensure that all digital content companies receive equal access to bandwidth. The problem is that Netflix is a notorious bandwidth hog, so Netflix’s deal with Comcast is not actually paying for prioritization. Rather, Netflix is paying to deliver its content directly to consumers rather than going through middlemen, like Cogent Communications. Essentially, it’s getting a direct route to Comcast Internet subscribers rather than driving on the same crowded freeway with all the other schmucks.', 'Comcast subscribers will soon be able to watch House of Cards via their cable set-top box sans Netflix subscription.\nThis doesn’t mean that Comcast subscribers can stream Netflix free of additional costs.\nPreviously, Netflix was in discussions with Comcast about the possibility of bringing a Netflix app to Comcast set-top boxes.\nMeanwhile, Comcast has reportedly been working on a video-on-demand service that could “out-Netflix Netflix.”Last month, Netflix and Comcast announced a deal in which Netflix will pay for direct access to Comcast’s subscribers.\nThe problem is that Netflix is a notorious bandwidth hog, so Netflix’s deal with Comcast is not actually paying for prioritization.']"

It’s not a huge leap, but it’s the first sign of improvement after Netflix began paying Comcast for a direct connection late last month. Netflix said in a blog post that it expects Comcast to move up in the rankings starting next month.\n\nNetflix has become noticeably slower on major Internet service providers, amid escalating disputes over how Netflix’s huge amounts of traffic should be handled. In many cases, Netflix pays third-party transit providers to deliver traffic from their networks to ISPs such as Comcast. Typically, no money changes hands in these “peering” arrangements between transit providers and ISPs, but because Netflix is responsible for so much incoming traffic, ISPs feel they should be paid by Netflix’s transit providers to add more capacity.\n\nUnder Netflix’s deal with Comcast, Netflix servers sit in the same data centers that connect to Comcast’s network, effectively cutting out the third-party transit provider. Although Netflix traffic doesn’t get special treatment on the network, the direct connection should still result in better service. (Dan Rayburn at StreamingMedia.com has an detailed explanation of how this works. He also points out that Netflix isn’t paying a new cost, but is simply paying a different provider, so the overall cost to Netflix may be negligible.)\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix’s average speeds continue to decline on Verizon FiOS, Verizon DSL and AT&T DSL, while AT&T U-Verse speeds improved slightly.

Simply put, ________ is a monster, and a king of monsters.\n\nSome may want to stamp Errol Childress with the label of redneck, or hillbilly trash. I fear those crude words cannot capture him. His proper introduction in the finale is a medley of contradictions. He is intelligent and crude at the same time. Beastly and— when it amuses him— urbane.\n\nLet us focus a moment on his voice— or rather, voices. Thomas Harris\' own Clarice Starling did everything in her power to lose her West Virginia accent, afraid it would paint her as white trash. Errol dances from voice to voice without apparent effort. While his scars are unfortunate, he has no problems passing as pleasant, humble, and likable in public. He is a chameleon. He chooses to remain where he is, the Yellow King of Carcosa. And that choice makes him horrifying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErrol is in good company with fictional killers that seek transformation. But the quests of Jame Gumb and Francis Dolarhyde (again, from the works of Thomas Harris) have urgency. They\'re possessed of a pressing need to complete their task. Childress speaks of his own journey with fondness— almost as an errand he\'ll get to when he finds the time. Gumb and Dolarhyde were desperate to change, to grow, to be something other. Childress has been working toward his ascension for years, if not decades. He has all the time in the world.\n\nOn the state of his house: While his home is cluttered with filth, yes, think about his needs: He has very few. He has a lover who tends to his needs and fears him. His own personal labyrinth is in walking distance. His day job makes him all but invisible, and keeps him close to his prey. He wants for nothing.\n\nBeyond the damage done to him in his formative years, consider the possibility that everything about this creature is a deliberate choice. The state of his house, his sloven appearance. He lives in a veritable sty, but strides through it like royalty. For all intents and purposes, it pleases him to be this. Such low beginnings make his ""ascension"" all the more meaningful.\n\nOur minotaur delivers his last words to his father— a man he has every reason to hate— with dissonant serenity. He leads his prey into his labyrinth where he taunts them with a voice from the depths of hell. He unnerves them with his works. He very nearly kills them both.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nErrol Childress is a masterpiece of foulness. I sincerely hope we do not see his like again anytime soon. He will linger in nightmares— Rust Cohle\'s, Martin Hart\'s, and mine.', ""The first season of True Detective has wound to a close, and we've been introduced to a villain who almost defies definition.\nErrol dances from voice to voice without apparent effort.\nHe chooses to remain where he is, the Yellow King of Carcosa.\nBut the quests of Jame Gumb and Francis Dolarhyde (again, from the works of Thomas Harris) have urgency.\nHe leads his prey into his labyrinth where he taunts them with a voice from the depths of hell.""]"

As we approached the end of the saga of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart, tensions ran high. Would they finally solve the mystery of the Yellow King? Was last week’s revelation a confirmation of the killer’s identity, or a red herring? Could it be that the whole thing just one of Rust’s acid traps? And of course, the most important question of all: CARCOSA WTF? Well, the season is over. And now we know everything…or at least, as much as we’ll ever know. SPOILERS FROM HERE:\n\n(UPDATE: Click here for our critic Jeff Jensen’s take on the finale.) Did True Detective have a happy ending? That might sounds like a strange description of an hour of television that prominently featured one of the freakier psychopaths to grace the small screen, the final revelation of Carcosa the Terror Temple, a druggy vision of what appeared to be an Event Horizon wormhole to hell, and both protagonists stabbed with various stabby weapons. But given the season of gloom that preceded it, the season finale of True Detective ended on a note of veritable optimism. “Once there was only dark,” said Rust Cohle The Nihilist Anti-hero as a closing line/epitaph. “You ask me, light’s winning.”\n\nIt took some time to get there. The boys finally managed to track down Errol Childress the Lawnmower Man. (With a hat tip to Marty: He’s the one who finally connected the whole “green-eared spaghetti monster” description to a new coat of green paint on a house from the old Dora Lange case.) That led Rust and Marty out to Errol’s house, which he shared with his aunt/girlfriend and his decaying dead father.\n\nThey chased him into what appeared to be some kind of overgrown ruined temple — or maybe there was some actual infrastructural use for it, in the days before it became a palace of all manner of satanic terror. “This is Carcosa,” intoned Errol. Rust had a vision straight out of a Guillermo Del Toro movie of a cosmic event in the darkness…and then Errol attacked. He stabbed Rust, and would have killed him…if Rust hadn’t used his Nihilist Headbutt Super Attack. That gave Marty enough time to shoot Errol a couple times. At which point Errol threw what appeared to be a tomahawk Marty’s chest. Marty barely survived — but Rust finally put the bad man down, shooting him in the head.\n\nRust looked halfway dead, and Martin not much better. But shockingly, they both survived. Rust seemed disappointed. They hadn’t tracked down every member of the Tuttle family, after all. “We ain’t gonna get them all,” said Marty. “That ain’t the kind of world it is. But we got ours.” Rust, despondent, explained that he didn’t think he belonged on this world. When he was near-death, he had a vision — of his daughter, his father, his dead loved ones. “It was like I was a part of everything I ever loved,” he said, near tears and then beyond them. Was this whole show about Rust learning to accept his daughter’s death? Learning to be human again? Marty guided him away from the hospital, half-carrying him.\n\nIt was a lot to take in — an hour that veered more towards philosophy than final-act thrills (although it had plenty of that, as well.)

Cohle spoke to him ever so briefly back in 1995 when he was mowing a school yard, but missed the clues he needed to connect him at the time because A) he was sitting down – Cohle couldn’t see his height – and B) his face was too dirty for the scars to be noticeable. The fact that Hart was leaning on his horn while Cohle spoke to the man in ’95 didn’t help him focus on the fact that the suspect was right under his nose, either.\n\nDuring the finale, the two detectives finally catch up with Errol after Hart connects the color of his “ears” in the sketch with the color of a house in a photograph from one of their files. After speaking to the woman who owned the house at the time, they dig into her tax records to find the business who did the paint job. They then make a few more connections and are led to the serial killer’s home.\n\nThey head to Errol’s house and try to call the new detectives investigating the case but there’s no cell phone service. Hart goes to the main house to ask for the phone. He’s greeted by Errol’s woman who says they have no phone, so he breaks in. He still has no luck making a call.\n\nCohle goes to the smaller house, where Errol’s just killed the family dog, and spots his man. A chase leads them deep into Errol’s massive compound, and Cohle gets directions thanks to a voice in his head. “Come die with me, little prince,” he hears.\n\nCohle enters a final, tall room with a hole at the top letting light in. He starts seeing a vision in the form of a night sky. Errol suddenly comes out and stabs him with a serious blow to the stomach, but Cohle’s still got his physical strength about him and head-butts Errol several times. Hart comes in and shoots him. It doesn’t do the trick, and Errol replies with a hammer to Hart’s chest. Cohle, on the ground, then delivers a bullet to Errol’s head. Moments later, cops arrive at the scene.\n\nWe flash forward to the hospital where Hart is being briefed by the ’12 detectives. Several pieces of evidence at the scene were linked to the various murders. Hart’s family comes in for a visit too which brings him to tears.\n\nCohle is alive, miraculously. He realizes that the man he saw riding the lawnmower in ’95 was his man all along, and he wishes he nabbed more of the people who were at fault (like the Tuttles). Hart reminds him that they got their man, and that’s all that matters.\n\nWith a few sweeping shots of locations we’d seen over the season, we jump to Hart – who’s healthy again – wheeling Cohle out of the hospital. The latter has something bothering him: When he was on death’s door, he could feel his father and his daughter with him. The people he loved were close to him. “All I had to do was let go” to see them again. And now? He can still feel his daughter’s love there. “Even more than before. Nothing but that love.”\n\n“Dark has a lot more territory,” Hart says when admiring the night sky at the end of the episode. Cohle disagrees. “Once there was only dark. You ask me, the light’s winning.” The two leave the hospital for hopefully greener pastures.\n\nTrue Detective’s eight episode season ended with a little bit of peace for both Hart and Cohle. The former was in good spirits as he wheeled his friend out of the hospital, while the latter was thinking on the bright side after feeling the love of his daughter and father beside him for the first time in a long, long while.\n\nWhat did you think of the ‘True Detective’ finale?', 'True Detective’s season finale brought the right amount of closure to one of television’s best new dramas.\nThey head to Errol’s house and try to call the new detectives investigating the case but there’s no cell phone service.\nCohle goes to the smaller house, where Errol’s just killed the family dog, and spots his man.\nTrue Detective’s eight episode season ended with a little bit of peace for both Hart and Cohle.\nWhat did you think of the ‘True Detective’ finale?']"

To me, the challenge was to not only let these guys live, but show true character change through this journey.

3007,http://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/true-detective-review-form-and-void-season-1-episode-8/,entertainment,"['It is hard to recall the last time a television series has gripped the cultural consciousness so quickly, spawning memes, a sprawling amount of Internet speculation and commentary, as well as divisive conversations about gender roles on television (check out Emily Nussbaum’s harsh, but terrific piece in The New Yorker for more on that) as much as True Detective has. At that rate, a season finale that was anything less than the finest 60 minutes of television would be doomed to succeed. Alas, the last of eight episodes from Nic Pizzolatto’s first anthology is a solid, but not quite shattering hour of television. Nevertheless, it is filled with the key elements that any True Detective viewer would hope for: strong acting, haunting music and art direction, sublime camerawork, unbearable suspense and a smattering of dark humour.\n\nSince its start, True Detective has done so much to thwart our expectations of what a crime series can be that the rather conventional ending is bound to disappoint just about everybody. But, even if the episode does not fulfill the lofty hopes of its fans, I cannot imagine any Killing-like rage directed at HBO for failing to tie up some loose ends. One must remember that these eight episodes have always been more about uncovering the truth behind Hart and Cohle, rather than the suspect of Dora Lange’s murder. As a conclusion to suit the show’s character-driven nature, it was deeply satisfying.\n\nThe foreboding figure at the end of episode seven is Errol William Childress. He has burns in his back, scars on his face and a beer belly. He lives in a shackled home in the middle of the lurid Louisiana wasteland with his bedraggled aunt/lover (played by Ann Dowd) and his dead father. Glenn Fleshler, who plays Errol, is tense and terrific, able to show menace and vulnerability in a single glance during a scene when he peeps on some children at play during recess.\n\nThe first anti-climax that True Detective reaches in this hour is the brisk amount of time it takes Hart and Cohle to realize his identity. In a colourful drawing shown of Childress last week, the “spaghetti monster” had green ears. Well, in one of the case files connected to the Dora Lange case, one of the homes that was investigated was freshly painted green. One quick interview and a couple of web searches later, our detectives have an address. It may have been more gratifying for the duo to figure out his identity through a more labyrinthine process, but at least give Pizzolatto credit for, somewhat unpredictably, making Hart the one who connects the dots together.\n\nHowever, as flat and formulaic as some of this procedural becomes, it all leads up to another tour de force sequence directed by the great Cary Joji Fukunaga that is almost as remarkable as that tracking shot from episode four. (Fans of the show should check out Fukunaga’s breathtaking debut feature, Sin Nombre, if they haven’t already.) Few sequences in small-screen memory have such a visceral atmosphere. We can almost feel the chill of the graveyard-like entrance, as barren, dry trees loom over the road. We can smell the foul stench that Marty breathes in as he moves deeper into Childress’s home.', 'At that rate, a season finale that was anything less than the finest 60 minutes of television would be doomed to succeed.\nAlas, the last of eight episodes from Nic Pizzolatto’s first anthology is a solid, but not quite shattering hour of television.\nNevertheless, it is filled with the key elements that any True Detective viewer would hope for: strong acting, haunting music and art direction, sublime camerawork, unbearable suspense and a smattering of dark humour.\nSince its start, True Detective has done so much to thwart our expectations of what a crime series can be that the rather conventional ending is bound to disappoint just about everybody.\nThe first anti-climax that True Detective reaches in this hour is the brisk amount of time it takes Hart and Cohle to realize his identity.']"

3010,http://www.elle.com/news/culture/female-sexuality-on-true-detective,entertainment,"['In some ways, True Detective is a great love story. Much like Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale on The Wire, Rust (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty (Woody Harrelson) find in each other an adversary, a counterpoint, and a literal, and figurative, partner in crime. ""You\'re obsessive,"" Marty informs Rust. ""You\'re obsessive, too,"" Rust retorts, ""just not about the job."" Marty\'s obsession, of course, is women other than the mother of his children, Maggie (Michelle Monaghan). At the beginning of True Detective, we are introduced to Marty\'s first mistress, Lisa (Alexis Daddario), a court reporter who, as Rust later observes, pretty much looks like a younger, bustier version of Mrs. Hart.\n\nAs critics have argued all over the \'net, True Detective is either infuriatingly, brutishly misogynistic (The New Yorker) or purposefully misogynistic, and therefore, thoughtfully dismissive of its female characters (Slate). Regardless of intention, creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Fukunaga have made a blanket statement regarding their purview on female sexuality. And it\'s pretty judgmental. A woman seeking sex is playing with fire. Over the course of the show\'s blistering eight episodes, we see a a variety of sexual situations, but none that resemble a realistically intimate moment. On True Detective, a woman who succumbs to sexual advances (or seeks physical satisfaction) is asking for humiliation, dismissal, or emotional ruin. If she wasn\'t asking for it, the show seems to suggest, she shouldn\'t have worn such a short skirt.\n\nRelated: \'Nymphomaniac\' Makes Me Proud to Be a Woman\n\nPhoto: HBO/Lacey Terrell\n\nWhether we\'re privy to a spectacularly nubile young woman throwing herself at the paunchy, married Marty or a mentally disturbed woman begging her own deranged half-brother to ""make flowers"" on her, the women of True Detective have a uniformly peculiar relationship with the opposite sex. Even Maggie—who, based on her interactions with Detectives Gilbough and Papania has enough agency to withhold information, use deductive reasoning, and even drop the occasional feminist pronouncement regarding the uniform idiocy of men—falls victim to a familiar male gaze sex trope. After she\'s all but gotten a confession out of her philandering husband, Marty begins to whimper about being ""all fucked up."" Sure, he\'s cheated on her, several times and with sociopathic abandon, but he\'s also seen things on the job that he simply can\'t forget. Fucked up things. He\'s having a hard time reconciling his professional life and his work life. He\'s just, hell, he\'s just having a really hard time, Maggie! She can see the hurt in his eyes, and the evidence of too many long nights on the underarms of his threadbare wife beater, and feels compelled to soothe his pain with a flurry of passionate kisses. What about this scenario screams sympathy sex? Am I missing something?\n\nPhoto: HBO/Lacey Terrell\n\nThen, there\'s Maggie\'s tryst with Rust. After making eyes at each other all season, Rust, who seems to appreciate and value Maggie\'s intelligence and sophistication, violently takes her from behind in perhaps the heartbreakingest seven seconds of TV sex. It was an especially gutting moment because, despite his erratic behavior and willingness to cover up for Marty\'s indiscretions, we think Rust is a good guy. We see him turn down advancements from drug-addled prostitutes; he drinks to drown out the memory of his slain daughter; and when he engages Maggie in conversation, it feels like her adores her. Until he degrades her. And then accuses her of Black Widow-ing her way between him and his partner. She\'s scarcely pulled up her underwear before she is cast out of his apartment like a leper. ""Get the fuck out of here!"" he bellows, any hint of tenderness and longing drained from his red-rimmed eyes. Et tu, Rust?\n\nRelated: Why Changing Your Hair Makes You a Sundance Cliché\n\n""I like something wild. I always did,"" Marty tells Rust of his penchant for ""crazy"" women. ""Feels like it smoothes out the other parts of my life."" I\'m sorry, but we\'re supposed to believe that an over-the-hill cop is a magnet for insanely gorgeous but totally unstable women? That, in the back country of Louisianna, there exists an enclave of job-holding psychowhores, who simply cannot resist Marty\'s butter blonde mop and Jameson breath? ""You\'re a good man,"" Lisa, a former teen prostitute who now works at a local T-mobile store, impresses upon Marty. He and his badge had, after all, come to her bunny ranch looking for a missing girl. Between swigs from a pony neck beer, he tries on a look of chagrined humility for size. Bingo. She becomes obsessed and sooon starts sending scantily-clad selfies and begging her married lover to ""put it in her ass."" Again, Where do these women get this stuff?\n\nPhoto: HBO/Lacey Terrell\n\nThe icing on the cake is Marty\'s own teenage daughter, Audrey (Erin Moriarty) who gets busted trying to attempt a threesome with two of the ugliest, strung out dudes south of the Mason-Dixon. Upon discovering what she\'s done, Marty slaps her and calls her a ""whore."" Whether the irony that his daughter is precisely the kind of woman he\'s been sleeping with is lost on him or suddenly glaringly obvious, all I could think was, She wanted to have a threesome with those guys? For real? In what world are these women falling victim to these men? What kind of dog-eared, graphic novel served as Pizzolatto and Fukunaga\'s sex ed primer? Despite their varying lots in life—incest-friendly love interest of a child murderer, suburban housewife, reformed sex worker, attention seeking high schooler—there\'s really only one type of woman on True Detective: the blow-up doll.\n\nPhotos: Ann Dowd: Jim Spellman/WireImage; Lili Simmons: C Flanigan/FilmMagic; Erin Moriarty: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic', ""In some ways, True Detective is a great love story.\nAs critics have argued all over the 'net, True Detective is either infuriatingly, brutishly misogynistic (The New Yorker) or purposefully misogynistic, and therefore, thoughtfully dismissive of its female characters (Slate).\nRegardless of intention, creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cary Fukunaga have made a blanket statement regarding their purview on female sexuality.\nOn True Detective, a woman who succumbs to sexual advances (or seeks physical satisfaction) is asking for humiliation, dismissal, or emotional ruin.\nDespite their varying lots in life—incest-friendly love interest of a child murderer, suburban housewife, reformed sex worker, attention seeking high schooler—there's really only one type of woman on True Detective: the blow-up doll.""]"

3012,http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mother-605009-ted-detective.html,entertainment,"['I hate when a good series ends, not just because I will miss the show, but because I so rarely like the endings.\n\n“True Detective” became the latest series to complain about, as HBO’s wonderfully tilted mystery series came with a finale that seemed to have little to do with the show we had been watching for the previous seven episodes.\n\n(Spoiler alert: If you are not up to date on “True Detective,” skip to the next item.)\n\n“True Detective” had been the best new series of the year so far, a bizarre and engrossing tale that took the framework of a highly conventional police drama and overlaid it with flowery speech and philosophical ideas, most of them coming from Matthew McConaughey’s character, Rust Cohle, a person so badly damaged psychologically as to be almost non-functional.\n\nThe storytelling used parallel time tracks and unreliable narration to give the story extra layers of mystery. It was baffling and sometimes hard to follow, but it was always intriguing.\n\nBut it came in the guise of a police-buddy drama we had seen 1,000 times before. Cohle’s partner, Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), was a hard-working, philandering, family-ignoring homicide detective. Cohle and Hart were the mavericks, bucking the chain of command for ultimately noble causes. They tracked down a serial killer and – of course – found the trail leading through “respectable” society.\n\nWe assumed, all along, that at some point the archetype would be shattered in a new and clever way. Instead, we found Sunday that it was our assumptions that would be shattered, and convention would triumph because the show didn’t really know how it wanted to end.\n\nBad guy Errol Childress – there was no last twist – seemed almost laughably absurd and certainly not the sort of villain one expected at the end of the twisted road we had traveled. Worse, the post-climax sequence brought a happy ending and a rescued Rust, a transformation that seemed to come out of the blue.\n\nThe story of Cohle and Hart is over and McConaughey and Harrelson have moved on to other projects, but HBO may bring “True Detective” back next year, with a different cast and story altogether. Let’s hope creator Nic Pizzolatto thinks that one all the way through to the end.\n\nYOUR ‘MOTHER’ SHOULD KNOW\n\nThe ending of another series, “How I Met Your Mother,” has been stirring up the fans before it even has happened.\n\nThe March 3 episode appeared to confirm a long-held but faintly embraced hypothesis about the Mother of the title: She’s dead.\n\nThe conceit of this mild-mannered sitcom is that the show takes place in 2030, and Josh Radnor’s character, Ted, is recalling the events of today for his children, explaining to them the torturously long process of how he met their mother. Some fans have speculated that the reason Ted is telling the story is because the mother recently died or is dying.\n\nLike most such theories, it is internally consistent but doesn’t make a lot of sense in context. Why would such a light-hearted comedy spend nine years getting to the point of introducing Ted to the mother – whose name we still don’t know – just to reveal that she’s dead? In the all-time ranking of bad sitcom ideas, that would go near the top, somewhere between “My Mother the Car” and letting Joanie and Chachi have their own show.\n\nCristin Milioti, who plays the mother, poured a big pitcher of ice water on the notion, bluntly telling the Hollywood Reporter, “That’s crazy.”\n\nAny show that has been telegraphing a surprise ending for nine seasons is bound to generate some theories about its finish. We’ve also heard that Ted is the one who is dead/dying, that there will be some switcheroo with the identity of the mother (it’s really Robin!) or that there is some other major twist regarding the veracity of Ted’s storytelling.\n\nMost likely, though, is that Ted’s longing has to do with being separated from the Mother somehow, and she will return to him in the next-to-last scene, right before they meet for the first time on that train platform, in the rain.\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-7724 or mhewitt@ocregister.com or @WatcherofTV on Twitter', '“True Detective” became the latest series to complain about, as HBO’s wonderfully tilted mystery series came with a finale that seemed to have little to do with the show we had been watching for the previous seven episodes.\n(Spoiler alert: If you are not up to date on “True Detective,” skip to the next item.)\nWorse, the post-climax sequence brought a happy ending and a rescued Rust, a transformation that seemed to come out of the blue.\nThe story of Cohle and Hart is over and McConaughey and Harrelson have moved on to other projects, but HBO may bring “True Detective” back next year, with a different cast and story altogether.\nYOUR ‘MOTHER’ SHOULD KNOWThe ending of another series, “How I Met Your Mother,” has been stirring up the fans before it even has happened.']"

There will be a True Detective season 2 and I’m already jonesing for it. I keep looking over old trailers and teasers and getting ready to compare the unfinished versions I got against the ones I can watch on HBO Go.\n\nThe true detectives got their perp. They didn’t get everyone, but they repaid their debt. That was some sick sick shit they were dealing with and now that it’s over, what’s next and how are they going to top what they’ve given us already? True Detective’s creator Nic Pizzolatto has been throwing down hints. And one is that he’s got to keep pumping out the weird. He’s good with weird. He says “my wife read a comment the other day that said I live out in the desert, and I run some kind of cult. He says all the talk on the net ""informed exactly one thing. It\'s that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don\'t play the next one straight.""\n\nHe’s right. It was the supernatural suspense that kept me coming back hungry for a little of Carcosa’s time. Pizzolatto says “I\'m interested in the atmosphere of cosmic horror, but that\'s about all I have to say about weird fiction. I did feel the perception was tilted more towards weird fiction than perhaps it should have been. “\n\nTrue Detective\'s lead actors Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey aren’t coming back. Their commitment and easy rapport is going to be hard to replace. Pizzolato says his stories are usually heavy on the female characters and that next season is going to be about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.” The transportation system has an occult history? Did they put the Mass in Mass Transit?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nfurther reading: True Detective Season 3 Review\n\nI can see Pizzolatto pouring over old train manuals, finding the symbolic significance of the third rail. The way he referenced Robert W. Chambers’ King in Yellow and works by H.P. Lovecraft and the M-Theory. Or did we all read too much into that ? Pizzolatto says, “look, it\'s all good … my only interest in the Chambers stuff is as a story that has a place in American myth. And it\'s a story about a story that drives people into madness. … I wouldn\'t tell anyone to go buy Robert Chambers. It\'s not that great a book. Joseph Conrad and William Faulkner I think are in there far more than Chambers or Lovecraft.”\n\nPizzolato talked about the strange in the past season. That James Mason voice that Errol Childress slips into after seeing Cary Grant on TV in North by Northwest showed us that “he learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies. And that brings us back to the idea of storytelling, right? At one minute he can affect this Andy Griffith good ol\' boy voice, the next he can sound like James Mason, and when he wants to use his real voice, he sounds like something wounded and damaged. And then when Cohle is in Carcosa, he sounds like something entirely different.”\n\nTrue Detective returns to HBO next year. I’m watching.

In scene after scene over eight episodes, Marty mocked Rust\'s nihilism and showed impatience with his anti-religious rants. One, in particular, took place at a rural church, where McConaughey heaped scorn on the believers. I thus saw the final scene as McConaughey trying to establish a closer connection with Harrelson, and taking a step towards the latter\'s less cynical view of the world. None of this means that either man is going to become an optimist or a believer (or that, per Nussbaum, we are supposed to believe that Marty\'s ""fine"" line means all is in fact swell).\n\nMoreover, it\'s not as if McConaughey is in the process of becoming a full-blown fundamentalist. It is thus odd for Spencer Korbhaber, on The Atlantic\'s excellent roundtable, to write that ""Rust scoffed at tent worshippers, and the Carcosa cult’s belief in the supernatural had terrible consequences, but Rust ends up joining all of them by buying into comforting, irrational mumbo jumbo."" So saying you are slightly optimistic about the course of humanity is the same as being a fundamentalist Christian at a (presumably very strict) church, or joining a cult that kills children?\n\nTo return to Nussbaum\'s complaint about the tidy wrap-up of Hart\'s personal journey, I also think many of the critics have been much too hard on the brief, awkward scene in which Hart\'s estranged family comes to see him in the hospital. It\'s true that this was another instance of peripheral, female characters given very little to do; but it was also sad and moving because it displayed the ways in which, even in his heroic moment, Harrelson\'s prior behavior left him wounded and alone.\n\nFor those who found the wrap-up too tidy and light (as opposed to dark, to use Rust\'s formulation), it is worth remembering that the show had one other ""light"" wrap-up three episodes earlier, in which the supposed killers were caught, the cops were heroes, and all seemed briefly well with the world. And how long did that last? It is certainly relevant that the creative team behind the show chose to end it on the note that they did, but I don\'t think we are meant to read too much into these final nice moments. This is still a dark show with two characters who are not going to be permanently cured of their difficulties.\n\nStill, the more I read about the actual plot makes me think that the critics do have a point about the laziness of the wrap-up. The clue that led to the men cracking the case open was pathetically unbelievable; the actual details of what the cult was up to, and to what degree it interacted or steered clear of the central murders, was hazy in the extreme; and the personal story of the killer\'s connection to the Tuttle clan was underexplained. Not only did this slightly dampen the effect of the last half hour, but it will also, I think, make the idea of rewatching the series less compelling.', ""In scene after scene over eight episodes, Marty mocked Rust's nihilism and showed impatience with his anti-religious rants.\nOne, in particular, took place at a rural church, where McConaughey heaped scorn on the believers.\nI thus saw the final scene as McConaughey trying to establish a closer connection with Harrelson, and taking a step towards the latter's less cynical view of the world.\nThis is still a dark show with two characters who are not going to be permanently cured of their difficulties.\nStill, the more I read about the actual plot makes me think that the critics do have a point about the laziness of the wrap-up.""]"

HBO’s live ratings have never really been a full indication of their shows’ success, but this is especially true in this instance. The finale drew a series-high 3.5 million viewers, but when you look at the average gross audience, which combines repeat viewings and streams on the HBO GO app (which gave some viewers trouble last night), the show brought in a pretty impressive haul of over 11 million viewers an episode. That’s the best for any HBO show in a first season since “Six Feet Under.” Pretty darn impressive when you remember that “Game of Thrones” and “True Blood” are also both in the network’s stable.\n\nAs for some other important ratings news:\n\n1. Who expected that “Resurrection” was going to be the enormous beast for ABC that it was? Despite airing against “The Walking Dead,” the show brought in a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demographic and also 13+ million viewers. Let’s hope that the network sticks to keeping this a limited series, since that is probably what gets so many viewers to actually tune in.\n\n2. “Once Upon a Time” delivered a solid 2.3 in its return to television, a sign that ABC got the scheduling right this time. “Revenge” also managed to actually win the 10:00 p.m. hour in its first go of things there with a 1.9, which was probably helped by its lead-in.\n\n3. “Cosmos” on Fox delivered a solid 2.1 in its premiere, which was also yet another sign that Fox really loves anything on Sunday night that has Seth MacFarlane’s name on it.\n\nWant more TV news that is delivered right to you?

Would that it had not. The series was not oblivious to questions of female representation—the show’s writer and creator Nic Pizzolatto has said as much—but women remained ancillary to the end. The women who appeared in the finale were Errol Childress’s damaged half-sister, a backwoods creature in lust to Errol—a man who, despite being a horrifying monster, was shown to be more than adequate at pleasuring her—and also Marty’s family, who appeared at his hospital bed, mostly as an excuse to give us a long close-up on Marty’s sobbing face. Like almost all the supporting characters on this show, the women were just sketches—occasionally naked ones—compared to our full-bodied detectives. The show’s major crimes involved endemic brutality against women and children, and victims is all that the women of this show remained, people against whom various wrongs were committed.\n\nNo TV show has an obligation to be everything to everyone. True Detective is a series I admired and enjoyed, and its treatment of women is not even the thing that irked me most about the finale, which left a number of niggling questions unanswered and finished on a ""let there be light"" riff. But it’s worth lingering on True Detective’s woman problem in part because that problem is closely, if not intentionally, tied to the show’s massive success: When it comes to prestige TV, there has yet to be a downside to out-bro-ing yourself.\n\nIn eight short weeks, True Detective has been granted greatest-show-on-television status on an extremely accelerated schedule. I understand why: McConaughey and Harrelson have been outstanding, their characters indelible. It looks great. It has been enticingly plotted, bread crumbs of Carcosa thick on the ground. If Rust’s banter hewed toward the dorm room, it felt authentically dorm-room: pretentious, sure, but also intelligent. And yet, there are other shows out there that traverse much of the same territory as True Detective—Top of the Lake, The Americans, Broadchurch, The Fall, to name a few—and none of them have gotten the frenzied attention of True Detective. None of those shows are on HBO. None of them feature movie stars. None of them seem explicitly built to appeal to Reddit users. But also—not unrelatedly—they are about women.\n\nLast week, Mo Ryan published a piece about the number of dramas for premium cable that have been made by women. The number is completely laughable (except that it made me want to cry). Premium cable dramas, the prestige category par excellence, are shows created by men that are largely about men, the rare exceptions—Buffy, Battlestar Galactica, and Homeland—only proving the rule. (See also Brett Martin’s Difficult Men, a history of the recent golden age of television that makes this point with its title.) The “best dramas of all time,” that four-way race between Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Wire, and The Sopranos, with Deadwood or Twin Peaks or Buffy tossed in for variety on occasion, are all exceedingly male shows, playing around with male-centric cop, mobster, and druglord genres.\n\nTrue Detective slots into the great drama conversation because it, too, is a great-looking, beautifully acted show that expands upon genre pleasures with very heady themes. But it also takes the machismo even further. The antihero may be played out, but he is an indictment of a certain kind of masculinity. We are drawn to Walter White and Tony Soprano (and Frank Underwood for that matter) even though we know we should be disgusted by them. Antihero shows are an enactment of unthinking hero worship, one that implicates its audience. But Rust and Marty are not antiheroes, whatever Rust says about being a “bad man.” They are just heroes. In the visual language of the finale, Rust is basically Jesus Christ. True Detective is not an interrogation of masculinity, it is a celebration of one, with none of the squishy girl stuff getting in the way. (There is no conversation to have about how the viewers of True Detective wrongly disparaged Maggie in the way that Breaking Bad fans misogynistically denigrated Skyler because True Detective never even let Maggie be enough of a character to get in Marty or Rust’s way.)', 'In eight short weeks, True Detective has been granted greatest-show-on-television status on an extremely accelerated schedule.\nTrue Detective slots into the great drama conversation because it, too, is a great-looking, beautifully acted show that expands upon genre pleasures with very heady themes.\nIn the visual language of the finale, Rust is basically Jesus Christ.\nTrue Detective is not an interrogation of masculinity, it is a celebration of one, with none of the squishy girl stuff getting in the way.\n(There is no conversation to have about how the viewers of True Detective wrongly disparaged Maggie in the way that Breaking Bad fans misogynistically denigrated Skyler because True Detective never even let Maggie be enough of a character to get in Marty or Rust’s way.)']"

3046,http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/03/the-disappointing-finale-of-true-detective.html,entertainment,"['Two weeks ago, I published a critical article about HBO’s “True Detective” in which I argued that, as stylish and as well acted as the series was, it had a hollow center. Beneath its auteurist trappings, the show boiled down to bickering cops hunting a sinister “rape club”—a plot that has been done to death, so to speak, on many better shows. “True Detective” also had a funky gender problem: it was about the evil of men who treat women as lurid props, but the show treated women as lurid props. And, though the dialogue was deeply, sometimes deadly serious, those layers of Lovecraft and nihilism just felt like red herrings.\n\nWell, as of the finale, I’ve changed my mind about one thing, at least: Rust Cohle’s monologues weren’t window dressing. They were the whole point—but I don’t mean that in a good way. In the finale, we discovered that the Spaghetti Man—a.k.a. the lawnmower man, a.k.a. the hulking guy with scars—was indeed our serial killer. A perverted mastermind with a cave full of skulls and thorns, he was diddling his disabled sister inside their Grey Gardens wreck of a mansion; he also had some serious elder abuse going on, a plot that gave me flashbacks to the hilarious movie “Cold Comfort Farm” (“I saw something nasty in the woodshed!”). I relished this surreal, sick, and frankly nasty opening sequence, which led deep into the territory of the notorious “X-Files” episode “Home,” but after that everything went downhill.\n\nTo summarize: Our boys intimidated a corrupt cop with a videotape (he howled upon seeing the un-seeable, then screamed “Chain of command!”). They Googled documents and visited witnesses and had Sherlockian insights about green paint. There was a meeting with one of the African-American cops, who turned out to be the good cop. There were endless conversations in the car, about issues like whether Rust held back in that fistfight, and about Rust’s argument that Marty should be blamed for “pushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me.” (Of course, Maggie couldn’t have actually wanted to screw Rust, out of revenge or because the man had been flexing his arms at her for years; that would mean she had desires beyond being a plot device.)\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way into the hour, there was an extended game of Marco Polo in the ruins, a truly ridiculous head butt, two stabbings, and a gunshot. No involvement of Marty’s father-in-law; no payoff on the goth daughter angle; no payoff on a lot of things, actually, like that mysterious convict who died in his cell. “Errol” was behind all the show’s central crimes: he’d participated in drugging a prostitute and decorating her in antlers; he’d helped organize the “Eyes Wide Shut” club with the girls in blindfolds; he was behind the kiddie-porn preschool molestation in the school basement; and then, of course, there was that ancient incestuous family to tend. He also got solid ratings as a housepainter. The masked figures behind the larger conspiracy went free, including the powerful Tuttle family—although I haven’t entirely sorted out the details, maybe because so many of them didn’t make any sense.\n\nThere was a hospital scene between Marty and his wife and kids that was so abstract, it might as well have featured a silent-movie card reading “Forgiven!” And, over the show’s last twenty minutes, as in the finale of “Lost,” the series became a meditation on how our heroes healed from their psychic wounds and became buddies again. Marty was “fine, just fine,” recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness. They were able to move on, to forgive themselves for their own mistakes (Marty) or find optimism in their nihilism (Rust).\n\nI am certain there are people who found all this experimental and profound. To me, it was a near-total wash. And what was most striking was that every one of show’s gross-out victims—the dead “prosts,” the raped little girls with the blindfolds, the genderqueer hooker who had been raped as a boy and filmed for porn movies, Marty’s own screwed-up daughter—were just there to ease our heroes into these epiphanies. After all that talk about how the two men hadn’t “averted their eyes” to evil, the show did just that. And it ends with stories told in the stars? We’re in Successories territory here, and even great actors can’t pull that off.\n\nAs I said in the review, it’s no fun to pan a show that people love (pleasure is an argument for itself, after all). But I’ll certainly be relieved when this series stops blocking people’s view of the other television that’s out there, including the mysteries I touched on in my piece, like “Top of the Lake” and “The Fall,” as well as “Broadchurch,” “Spiral,” “The Returned,” and the terrific new season of “The Americans”—varied and excellent thrillers that got far less press than “True Detective,” in part because they didn’t have the imprimatur of HBO and manly movie stars. The second season of “Orange Is the New Black” is on its way, and so is “Game of Thrones.” Fingers crossed that there’s some other drama in my pile of screeners to show me fresh possibilities! Just spare me anything atmospheric: I’ve had enough hot air.', 'Two weeks ago, I published a critical article about HBO’s “True Detective” in which I argued that, as stylish and as well acted as the series was, it had a hollow center.\n“True Detective” also had a funky gender problem: it was about the evil of men who treat women as lurid props, but the show treated women as lurid props.\nAnd, though the dialogue was deeply, sometimes deadly serious, those layers of Lovecraft and nihilism just felt like red herrings.\nWell, as of the finale, I’ve changed my mind about one thing, at least: Rust Cohle’s monologues weren’t window dressing.\nThey were the whole point—but I don’t mean that in a good way.']"

Many suspected that this forecast death for Cohle in the final episode. In a very real sense, that theory proved correct but it was a different type of death.\n\nAs it turns out, True Detective is the story of a seeker of truth. Rust Cohle\'s moment of enlightenment in episode 8 came after years of searching and suffering.\n\nThe most elegant and revealing statement of Cohle\'s struggle and revelation is, in my opinion, the sermon delivered by Joel Theriot in episode 3, The Locked Room. The seemingly less than sophisticated preacher and an audience of those at the margins of life in rural Louisiana hide the profound message delivered for those willing to listen. Episode 3 shows only a portion of the sermon. The entire sequence is available on YouTube and is well worth watching (several times).\n\nThe sermon represent a narrative map for the broader story told throughout the series, which reaches a climax at the end of the season finale. Of note, preacher Theriot is of the evangelical school of Christianity. He both delivers the sermon to and experiences it with the congregation as indicated by their frequent, fervent interaction. There are no strictures, admonitions, or rules; just the presentation of a higher wisdom and path to inner peace available to everyone with ears to hear. Theriot\'s sermon is in italics along with my comments.\n\nHe saw you in those dark corners. He heard you. Oh brothers, he heard those thoughts.\n\nThe question, are you there?\n\nSince the death of his daughter, Cohle has suffered unrelenting guilt for failing to protect her. For years, Cohle has been the only person listening to his thoughts. No one else is there. He is alone without comfort.\n\nWould that we had ears to hear, because every moment, every now is an answer. Every beat of every heart, every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, every hour of every day is an answer.\n\nAnd the answer is yes, yes, yes.\n\nTheriot has a forceful answer to the question Are you there? He is and he is with us every moment. But what does he represent. Everything in the scene tells us that he is Jesus. But we don\'t hear the name Jesus until four minutes into the six-minute sermon. Cohle and partner Marty Hart are seen at the back of the tent watching Theriot preach. Cohle\'s nonchalant attitude, leaning against the tent post is more than disinterest. It represents contempt from the Cohle we know up to this point. (In the final airing of this episode, he says to Marty: What do you think the average IQ of this crew is? I see a propensity for obesity, poverty and fairy tales.)\n\nYour sorrows pin you to this place. They divide you from what your heart knows. "" We bandaged our soft selves in hardness and anger. You are a stranger to yourself and yet he knows you. And, when your hard heart made you like unto the stone and broke you from his body - which is the stars and the wind between the stars - he knew you. He knew you yet and forever. Because I ask you, how could a father forget his children?\n\nCohle became a stranger to himself as a result of hardness and anger due to the death of his daughter. He was so hardened to the world, so profoundly skeptical and alienated, it broke Cohle from his body; separated him from the embrace and protection of the peace surrounding him at the time of his greatest need.\n\nIf ever your sorrow becomes such a burden that you forget yourself, forget this world, I want you to remember this truth""\n\nThis world is a veil and the face you wear is not your own.\n\nNext Page 1 | 2', ""Preacher Joel Theriot delivers the message, episode 3(Image by HBO screen capture) Details DMCATent preacher Joel Theriot's full sermon from episode three of True Detective provides a preview and explanation of detective Rust Cohle's conversion from a laconic nihilist extraordinaire who can barely live with himself to an enlightened soul with some prospect for peace.\nIn episode 7, Cohle laments his long journey through violence and depravity then says I'm ready to tie it off.\nRust Cohle's moment of enlightenment in episode 8 came after years of searching and suffering.\nThe most elegant and revealing statement of Cohle's struggle and revelation is, in my opinion, the sermon delivered by Joel Theriot in episode 3, The Locked Room.\nOf note, preacher Theriot is of the evangelical school of Christianity.""]"

3053,http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/221108/hbos-true-detective-was-a-perfect-short-term-tv.html,entertainment,"['by Ed Martin , March 10, 2014\n\nadvertisement advertisement\n\nThe effectiveness and overall impact of HBO’s “True Detective” -- the first-arc finale of which proved such a draw last night that it crashed HBO Go -- should be a signal to the television industry that there is success to be had in exploring new programming models. Audiences seem less interested in prolonged seasons of any series, especially when they are presented with perpetual preemptions, or in fall and spring seasons with a prolonged break in between. That break is an annoyance that stalls the momentum a show may have built up from September through December or January before the annual scheduling challenges begin.That wasn’t a problem for “True Detective,” episodes of which premiered at 9 p.m. ET in mid-January and ran on eight Sundays with only one interruption (to avoid the Super Bowl) but otherwise without concern about such competitive programming blockbusters as the Grammy Awards, the Academy Awards or AMC’s “The Walking Dead.” HBO made one of the smartest scheduling moves in recent memory, running a drama series starring Matthew McConaughey right through an awards season punctuated by his many nominations for his role in the theatrical film “Dallas Buyers Club,” not to mention the added benefit of all the interviews and press opportunities that resulted from all the actual awards he received. (I suspect he’ll pick up a couple more for “True Detective.”)\n\nThis show ran for only eight episodes -- but they had a running time of approximately one hour each, which roughly equals ten episodes of a broadcast or basic cable series when factoring in time lost to commercial pods. That was just enough to build and maintain interest without the show becoming a chore to stay with, as sometimes happens with even the best series. It also made for easy catch-ups during the season and for comfortable aftermath binges. Eight hours might kill one day, but it won’t destroy a weekend. To look at it another way, with its episodes strung together the first arc of “True Detective” could be thought of as an eight-hour movie.\n\nRegardless, series formats and models are suddenly in play as never before. One can forgive anybody who is feeling a sense of confusion about the issue. Perhaps this guide will help, especially as the Upfront season approaches and dozens of networks suddenly dump hundreds of new programs of many kinds into a massive heap that advertisers and critics are supposed to process with unlimited interest. (That worked in the old days of a three- or four-network Upfront, but now May has a madness all its own.)\n\nA mini-series has always been -- and should continue to be -- a one-time closed-ended series that plays over several consecutive nights or weeks. Sundance’s “Top of the Lake” and BBC America’s “Fleming” are perfect recent examples, even if they were considerably shorter than such legendary miniseries of the past as “Rich Man, Poor Man,” “Roots” and “North and South.”\n\n“True Detective” and FX’s “American Horror Story” are looked upon as mini-series simply because that is the most convenient definition, and I suppose it fits. But each season of “AHS” continues to build an over-arching brand, as I’m certain future seasons of “Detective” will also do. I think these are the true “event” series of our time, rather than mere “minis,” because the return of the brand each year does qualify as something new and special.\n\nOngoing broadcast series that are scheduled outside of the traditional broadcast season -- like CBS’ “Under the Dome” and “Extant” and Fox’s upcoming “24: Live Another Day” -- are currently being referred to as “event” series. But as long as they continue season to season with the same characters and continuous story lines they should be regarded as “regular” series -- as they would be on basic and pay cable -- and nothing more. (I haven’t seen it, but I’m already thinking of “Live Another Day” as a ninth season of “24,” rather than some kind of stand-alone “event,” even if it is only twelve episodes, a dramatic departure from its past model -- which, we shouldn’t forget, had gotten stale).\n\n“Regular” series continue to be reshaped and rescheduled in all kinds of ways. I consider BBC America’s superb back-from-the-dead drama “In the Flesh” to be a regular series, because it has seasons that continue the same story lines with the same characters. It matters not that the first season was only three episodes long (which, minus commercial time, comes out to one longish theatrical movie). The same is true of BBC America’s “Broadchurch” and Sundance’s “The Returned” (a French import) with their eight-episode cycles of ongoing stories or new stories with ongoing characters.\n\nStreaming series like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black” are “regular” series masquerading as “events” because that’s exactly what they are for most people who adjust their lives around them to consume them in their entirety as quickly as possible. So, for now anyway, Netflix gets to have it both ways. I suppose it can be argued that any series anywhere can be gobbled up in so hurried a manner, making anything a potential event, but that’s not the intent of the original scheduling, which still counts for something, or ought to. I don’t think networks are ready to concede that their first-run prime-time real estate is nothing more than a shelf on which to display fresh product intended to be enjoyed at some non-specific future time, like DVDs on a shelf at Target or anything in a Netflix queue.', 'That break is an annoyance that stalls the momentum a show may have built up from September through December or January before the annual scheduling challenges begin.That wasn’t a problem for “True Detective,” episodes of which premiered at 9 p.m.\nTo look at it another way, with its episodes strung together the first arc of “True Detective” could be thought of as an eight-hour movie.\nBut each season of “AHS” continues to build an over-arching brand, as I’m certain future seasons of “Detective” will also do.\nI think these are the true “event” series of our time, rather than mere “minis,” because the return of the brand each year does qualify as something new and special.\n“Regular” series continue to be reshaped and rescheduled in all kinds of ways.']"

According to HBO, it’s because too many of you were trying to watch True Detective at the same time.\n\nDue to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014\n\nTo watch HBO Go, whether it’s viewing new episodes as they premiere or combing through the back catalog of HBO original programming, you’ve got to subscribe to the pay cable service—in theory. In practice, if you borrow the login information of a willing accomplice, you can watch HBO Go to your heart’s content. And you know what? HBO really isn’t going to stress about that.\n\nPaying customers, however, may feel differently after Sunday night’s streaming snafu. An article on Hypable (which I spotted thanks to the Washington Post) wonders if it’s not time for HBO to start tightening up the rules for its streaming app, which is available on mobile platforms as well as set-top boxes and gaming consoles. Specifically, the Hypable article suggests that HBO think about restricting the number of people who can log into any one HBO Go account at a given time. After all, this is the second high-profile season finale where HBO GO went belly up—last year’s Game of Thrones season-ender suffered similar issues.\n\nIt’s also the second consecutive weekend in which your plans to stream a popular television broadcast may have gone awry. If you thought finding out the identity of the Yellow King was complicated, you should have tried streaming last week’s Oscar ceremony. Despite limiting the first-ever Oscar live stream to a handful of markets, ABC couldn’t deliver the telecast to viewers tuning in on mobile devices. The circumstances behind the Academy Awards and True Detective streaming failures are very different, of course, but both incidents go to show that traditional broadcasters are going to have to put in a lot more effort before streaming becomes as seamless as simply pressing the power button on your TV remote.\n\nHBO did have some good news on Monday, though:\n\nThe issues affecting HBO GO last night have been resolved.

Ghost trains? Devil-worshipping conductors? The satanically slow speeds on Amtrak? We’ll leave Nic Pizzolatto to his scripting, but in our eyes, what matters about True Detective season two isn’t so much the plot or the cast—it’s the genre. Season one captured the internet’s attention partly through its heady plumbing of Lovecraftian mythos and blending it with Southern Gothicism. There’s no use trying to repeat that formula, so where else can the show turn to capture lightning in a bottle?\n\nIdea one: ‘70s conspiracy-theory thriller\n\nSeason one had a grand, governmental conspiracy weaved into its plot. Police reports were altered, Louisiana’s Senator was implicated, Rust Cohle was always fighting the system in one way or another. But as the show wound towards its conclusion, the big-picture stuff mostly fell away, and we were left with our two heroes going up against Errol in Carcosa. That’s fine, but why not go full Parallax View next time? Set it wherever you want—Washington, City Hall, some backwater town in Alaska. Get twisty and convoluted, but with that edgy, almost psychedelic element of madness that should come with any paranoia-based thriller. It really just sounds like I’m asking for HBO to produce season two of Rubicon. Well, that’s fine by me.\n\nIdea two: Classic Poe\n\nThe Following did its best to ruin Edgar Allen Poe for everyone by having its chief villain, Joe Carroll, worship the macabre author and base a cult around his writing. His acolytes wandered around in Poe masks setting people on fire, and then Kevin Bacon would show up, point at a crime scene, and say, “Classic Poe.” This offense must be corrected, and while I’m sure Pizzolatto will feel the topic is overplayed, I wish he’d step in to draw from Poe’s writing in a much more thematically appropriate matter. The man wrote some of the earliest detective fiction, after all, and had the sense of atmosphere that proved so crucial to True Detective’s first season.\n\nIdea three: The Wicker Man (but, y’know, good)\n\nSeason one of True Detective revolved around a Satanic Voodoo cult. What if next year we just go full pagan? The original 1973 Wicker Man is a deceptively creepy, shattering horror story disguised as a mystery, with a policeman investigating the disappearance of a girl on a remote British island. A bunch of no-good sex druids immediately start making trouble. It all sounds silly, and Neil LaBute’s horrendous Nicolas Cage-starring remake didn’t help that reputation, but there is something genuinely frightening and fascinating about being stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere. As long as there’s no Smoke Monster.\n\nIdea four: Cyberpunk\n\nAlright, this is as far-fetched as it gets. But a man can dream. If you really want to shake things up, nothing’s further from Carcosa than cyberspace, and there’s plenty of philosophical debate to plunder from the works of William Gibson or Neal Stephenson. Matthew McConaughey is coasting to a career revival partly on the back of True Detective—maybe it’s time for Keanu Reeves to enjoy the same renaissance? I look forward to much talk of “jacking in” and the “Metaverse.” Who am I kidding, there’s more of a chance that season two just ends up being about Rust Cohle and Marty Walsh chasing tail in an old folks home.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.', 'this interview) suggest that season two of True Detective is going to be about “hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system.” Whatever that means.\nWe’ll leave Nic Pizzolatto to his scripting, but in our eyes, what matters about True Detective season two isn’t so much the plot or the cast—it’s the genre.\nThe man wrote some of the earliest detective fiction, after all, and had the sense of atmosphere that proved so crucial to True Detective’s first season.\nIdea three: The Wicker Man (but, y’know, good)Season one of True Detective revolved around a Satanic Voodoo cult.\nThe original 1973 Wicker Man is a deceptively creepy, shattering horror story disguised as a mystery, with a policeman investigating the disappearance of a girl on a remote British island.']"

The surprise survival of both Rust Cohle and Marty Hart at the end of Season 1 suggested at least one could return, someday. But McConaughey has said he never planned to stay beyond one season. “It was a 450-page film, is what it was,” McConaughey said of the show\'s first season during a January Television Critics Association panel. “It was also finite. It didn\'t mean we had to come back this year, next year if we were under contract. It was finite. So in that way it was exactly a 450-page film script.”\n\nCohle and Hart are probably not coming back, but Pizzolatto has retained the literary rights to his protagonists. ""So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility,"" he told EW.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAnd it\'s not just the cast and story that will change -- the entire directorial style, overseen in Season 1 by Cary Fukunaga, is likely to change, too. Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed via email:\n\nWe don’t have any plans to work with one director again. It would be impossible to do this yearly as we need to be able to do post while we’re still filming, like any other show. There’s some great guys I’ve consulted, and we’re all confident we can achieve the same consistency. Going forward, I want the show’s aesthetic to remain determinedly naturalistic, with room for silences and vastness, and an emphasis on landscape and culture. And I hope a story that presents new characters in a new place with authenticity and resonance and an authorial voice consistent with this season. Dominant colors will change. South Louisiana was green and burnished gold.\n\nIt seems like the freshman show is already being gutted, left with skeletal remains that, once filled in again, might not even resemble its original form. One thing that we do know about Season 1 that will carry over from season 2 -- perhaps the most important thing -- is that the philosophical detective drama will continue with the same spirit -- ""keep being strange.""\n\n""Don\'t play the next one straight,"" Pizzolatto told HitFix.', 'But that\'s what ""True Detective"" is doing -- at least, that is what it seems to be doing, based on the few clues that show creator Nic Pizzolatto has shared with television critics in recent interviews.\nThe surprise survival of both Rust Cohle and Marty Hart at the end of Season 1 suggested at least one could return, someday.\n“It was a 450-page film, is what it was,” McConaughey said of the show\'s first season during a January Television Critics Association panel.\nPizzolatto told BuzzFeed via email:We don’t have any plans to work with one director again.\n""Don\'t play the next one straight,"" Pizzolatto told HitFix.']"

He was basically a nightmare come to life. His sprawling estate was home to his mentally unstable half-sister-turned-lover, and he clearly had a thing for baby dolls and talking to his dead father who was tied up on a mattress in the shed.\n\nAfter confirming that Childress was the man they\'d been looking for all season, they ambushed Childress\' home and interrogated his half-sister-turned-lover. Rust chased after Childress and was lured into the center of Carcosa, a perverted underground maze built by the serial killer.\n\nOnce he reached the end of the winding maze, Rust was momentarily distracted by a vision. \u200bChildress suddenly appeared from behind and stabbed Rust in the stomach. A fight ensued, giving Marty time to catch up to his partner and, hopefully, shoot Childress dead. Marty did get a few rounds off but it didn\'t stop Childress altogether. In a stunning move, he threw his tomahawk straight into Marty\'s chest. However, as he stood over Marty, ready to finish the deed, a bleeding Rust shot Childress in the back of the head.\n\nOkay, we won\'t give away everything.

That line, [\'If ] you ask me, the light\'s winning,\' that was one of the key pieces of dialogue that existed at the very beginning of the series\' conception. For me as a storyteller, I want to follow the characters and the story through what they organically demand. And it would have been the easiest thing in the world to kill one or both of these guys.""\n\nHe also said: ""Considering what these characters had been through, it seemed hard to me to work out a way where they both live and they both exit the show to live better lives beyond the boundaries of these eight episodes. Now they are going to go on and live forever beyond the margins of the show, and our sense, at least, is they haven\'t changed in any black-to-white way, but there is a sense that they have been delivered from the heart of darkness.""\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nYours truly was intrigued to read the ""heart of darkness"" reference, it being a continuing theme of my interpretation of the series. As it turned out, True Detective, if not a direct parallel to Joseph Conrad\'s Heart of Darkness, was in the end about encountering the darkest side of human nature, about stowing darkness in your heart – as Rust had done throughout in his cynicism – and transcending it.\n\nTo some it was an oddly uplifting ending – the killer caught, the heroes injured but surviving, and the most hard-hearted of the duo softened in his final, drawled remark: ""Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light\'s winning.""\n\nYes, it was odd and disappointing: a conclusion so conventional that it seemed the previous abundant weight gave way to whimsy, an ending calculated to not disturb viewers who always saw the show as two cops on the trail of a killer who would be caught in the end, with the cops feeling good about it. The evaporation of Cohle\'s nihilism felt like a swindle in the story\'s end. The ending diminished Rust\'s cynicism to mere glumness and it seemed to suggest he was glad to be alive – even high on his almost-sunny new philosophy.\n\nHere\'s the key thing about True Detective – the journey was more compelling, complex and fascinating than the destination it arrived at. For all the vacancy in the final scene, the series had heft in its probing of darkness. It brooded on the perversity that exists beneath the surface of religious belief; it dwelt on corruption, not just among the powerful but among the powerless. It presented male rage in all its stark, selfish obstinance and offered insight into the sort of society that nourishes that rage.\n\nIn his remarks about the finale, Pizzolatto didn\'t mention the ""post-industrial, end-of-empire thing"" in America that he articulated in January regarding the series\'s thematic substructure. But it was a relentless theme right to the end.\n\nThe episode opened at the killer\'s almost-inaccessible, backwoods family home of people off the radar, gone rogue, distant from civilization both literally and figuratively: a place where, we were much reminded, there\'s no cellphone service.\n\nThe warren of buildings and cave-like structures was overgrown with grass, a signal of decay and of a post-wealth, post-industrial situation. It all looked like the remnants of some ancient society now forgotten, near-buried by nature.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd what the crime came down to, in the end, was the work of people existing in the squalor of decay and in caves, limited to finding significance in structures made of sticks and in putting daubs on a wall: profoundly primitive, near-Stone-Age people in their limited sophistication.\n\nWe saw a landscape gorgeously rendered but desolate, some of it ravaged by hurricanes and floods, some of it destroyed by the end of old industries. It\'s that set of images and leitmotifs that we can take away from the eight hours of True Detective.\n\nThe creator of the series may well have planned the concluding flash of optimism from the beginning. But he ensured that getting to that point was an unforgettable encounter with pessimism and the negative, with sour themes and a grim view of a society receding to primitivism.\n\nIn that context, the ending remains disappointing, with its uplifting touch. And yet, from the journey to that point, we know how flimsy the optimism is.\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @MisterJohnDoyle', 'Before the finale of the first season of True Detective aired on Sunday, creator Nic Pizzolatto granted an interview about the ending to critic Alan Sepinwall of the website HitFix.\nFor me as a storyteller, I want to follow the characters and the story through what they organically demand.\nAnd it would have been the easiest thing in the world to kill one or both of these guys.""\nHere\'s the key thing about True Detective – the journey was more compelling, complex and fascinating than the destination it arrived at.\nIt\'s that set of images and leitmotifs that we can take away from the eight hours of True Detective.']"

But atmospherically, things sure got spooky.\n\nObviously if you haven’t watched the episode yet and are intending to do so, consider this a SPOILER ALERT. If you have seen it, I wonder if you’ll agree with me that there were a few subtle surprises on the one hand, but no big surprises on the other.\n\nOkay, first of all, the biggest pleasing subtle surprise for me came with the final line, when Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) displayed some optimism.\n\nFittingly if neither of them were going to die, the season ended with Rust and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) continuing their love-hate relationship by engaging in another one of their deep conversations. This one occurred outside Lafayette General Hospital.\n\nTrying to cheer up the seriously injured but apparently on-the-mend Rust, Marty brought up the subject of how Rust used to gaze at the stars and make up stories when he was a boy in Alaska. But Rust replied he had come to believe there’s only one story, the oldest: “Light versus dark.”\n\nMarty, glancing at the Louisiana night sky, made the cynically comical observation, “I know we ain’t in Alaska, but it appears to me the dark has a lot more territory.”\n\nBut then just a little bit later, Rust circled back. Rust ended the season by saying to Marty, “You know, you’re looking at it wrong, that sky thing. Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light’s winning.”\n\nThat is a great line.\n\nI had to rewind three or four times to make it out, because Rust mumbled the words. But they’re in my brain for good now. I just know it.\n\nA side comment I’ll make about that final scene: Was that not the quietest hospital you’ve ever witnessed? No activity just outside it, no ambulances, not even any sirens in the distance. Yes, it was night, but most hospitals are hubs of activity 24 hours a day. Not a criticism, just an observation. Hey, it’s TV, I get it.\n\nAs for the lead-up to that final scene, there really were no big surprises in the True Detective finale, as far as bizarre plot twists or sharp turns out of nowhere. That actually was kind of refreshing.\n\nThe most dramatic scene of the whole season, of course, was the final scene of the second-last episode, when the camera moved through the early-evening sunshine to reveal the scars on the face of the creepy dude who had been on the riding mower. As we now know, that was serial killer Errol William Childress.\n\nThe strange, isolated place where Childress was living, which we got to see throughout the final episode, was where the afore-mentioned memories of American Horror Story came into it for me. Honestly, that abode would have fit snugly into any of the three seasons of American Horror Story that have aired so far.\n\nTrue Detective’s violent climax with Rust, Marty and Childress wasn’t particularly inventive. It was sort of standard stuff, to be honest. But I really liked the denouement. It was poetic and artistic.\n\nSo nothing crazy happened, but everything crazy happened.\n\nObviously you can just hand the Emmy to McConaughey. And with all due respect to his signature slogan, “All right, all right, all right,” I think his character’s last line in the first season of True Detective will stick with me far longer.\n\nBill.harris@sunmedia.ca\n\n@billharris_tv', 'True Detective ended its first season with a line I don’t think I ever will forget.\nAside from that line, the first-season finale of True Detective, which aired Sunday night on HBO Canada, kind of turned into American Horror Story.\nA side comment I’ll make about that final scene: Was that not the quietest hospital you’ve ever witnessed?\nAs for the lead-up to that final scene, there really were no big surprises in the True Detective finale, as far as bizarre plot twists or sharp turns out of nowhere.\nTrue Detective’s violent climax with Rust, Marty and Childress wasn’t particularly inventive.']"

The serial killer’s lair, dubbed “Carcosa,” makes The Blair Witch Project‘s witch house look like a page in a Pottery Barn catalog.\n\nIn the short stories that inspired True Detective, Carcosa is a cursed city in an alien world. Until the finale, Carcosa is a mysterious part of the show’s elaborate mythology, a place mentioned reverently by various doomed and deranged characters. In the finale, Carcosa is finally revealed: an overgrown chamber of horrors used for all sorts of violent devil worship.\n\nTo build Carcosa, New Orleans-based artist Joshua Walsh created a satanic altar from human skulls, antlers, oyster shells, burnt driftwood, and, for an extra sinister touch, cutesy children’s toys. He rubbed the skulls with yellow turmeric and carved them with what’s essentially the killer’s logo–an angular spiral that will forever haunt our dreams. What Walsh calls “spirit bundles” hang from the altar like evil cocoons. “To distort the figure with a beast quality, I incorporated the spine of a cow,” Walsh writes on HBO Go’s site. He also noted that the oyster shells mixed with turmeric helped create a “spicy death smell.”\n\nThe serial killer at the heart of the show is a particularly artistic one–he leaves visual clues like eerie twig sculptures called “Devil’s Nests” and chilling graffiti on the walls of his decrepit haunts. Instead of using an in-house production team to create the show’s art, as is standard in Hollywood, the producers decided to cast an individual artist as the unseen killer’s hand in order to make the aesthetic consistent and authentic. They’d asked several artists to provide samples of their vision of the killer’s work, but none fit the bill.\n\nIt wasn’t until the producers noticed a sculpture of a hummingbird made from sinew and twigs on the desk of set decorator Cynthia Slagter, a gift from her friend Walsh, that they pinpointed him for the job. Walsh, an avid hunter and taxidermist and the son of a family who ran a funeral home, had to channel a killer’s mindset and imagine what sort of artistic slug trail he would leave in his wake. He worked full-time for nine months to create a collection of about 100 murals, paintings, and sculptures. It will take weeks of watching nothing but cute cat videos to get Carcosa out of our heads.', 'Those of you who missed last night’s finale of True Detective— thanks a lot, HBO Go !–should actually feel thankful; you were spared nightmares about perhaps the creepiest set design in television history.\nThe serial killer’s lair, dubbed “Carcosa,” makes The Blair Witch Project‘s witch house look like a page in a Pottery Barn catalog.\nIn the short stories that inspired True Detective, Carcosa is a cursed city in an alien world.\nUntil the finale, Carcosa is a mysterious part of the show’s elaborate mythology, a place mentioned reverently by various doomed and deranged characters.\nIn the finale, Carcosa is finally revealed: an overgrown chamber of horrors used for all sorts of violent devil worship.']"

""It\'s that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don\'t play the next one straight.""When asked for more specific story details, the creator replied, ""Okay. This is really early, but I\'ll tell you (it\'s about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.""Of course, in text it\'s difficult to tell whether he\'s joking or not, so this synopsis should be taken with a grain of salt. Though, Pizzolatto did say that his prose is typically ""populated with rich female characters,"" so it might make sense for him to create a story based on women when the female characters in Season 1, like most characters this season, existed as ""mirrors to reflect some aspect of Rust (McConaughey) or Marty (Harrelson).""

Who would you like to see on the show next year?\n\n(HBO)\n\nIt\'s over. HBO\'s massive watercooler drama ""True Detective"" was a multi-layered wonder not seen since their other must-watch series ""The Wire.""\n\nAs an anthology, we know by now that Rust Cohle and Marty Hart won\'t be back (although we\'d die to see a series about their detective agency. Right??). And sure, the charisma between Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson was an effortless asset to the show, the entire audience is probably playing armchair casting director today and we\'re no different.\n\nWhile he was sketchy on details, series creator Nic Pizzolatto told Hitfix that season 2 was about ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system. More occult? Oy...\n\nWe\'re also wondering if the show, which crashed its popular HBO GO app Sunday night, will keep its parallel narrative structure. If so, there\'s a multitude of scenarios Pizzolatto can draw from. That said, we figured it would be fun to whip up a short list of possible contenders as well as locales for next year.\n\nJon Hamm/Damian Lewis\n\nJon Hamm and Damian Lewis\n\nThe heat and horror of Hells Kitchen in \'77 is the primary backdrop where our cops are dumped a case investigating an unsolved gang murder of a Westie which leads us to present day Madison Avenue. In the era of post 911 fear and trauma, red tape may be the biggest adversary to our gumshoes, especially when one of them can\'t play nice with big city brass.\n\nAlexander Skarsgard/John Cusack\n\nJohn Cusack & Alexander Skarsgård\n\nWhat looks like a routine murder of a showgirl in Las Vegas in 1982, goes way deeper. As gangsters move on to greener pastures and corporate entities take over the hotels, there\'s a new threat that looms in the desert. When one of our heroes has hidden mob ties, everyone is a suspect in this Sin City tale.\n\n\n\nEd Norton/Robert Downey\n\nRobert Downey Jr. & Edward Norton\n\nSomeone is killing Hollywood A-listers and two veteran cops are thrown a lead by a studio mogul who may or may not be involved. From the backroom editing bays of the early \'90s to modern studio backlots, our heroes try to weed out who\'s telling the truth in a town filled with professional liars.\n\nMichelle Williams/Jessica Chastain\n\nJessica Chastain & Michelle Williams\n\nBy now, everyone knows that meth is sweeping our nation. Walter White and ""Breaking Bad"" made sure of that. Our story here, though, kicks off in Portland, Oregon where two cops work the same case in different parts of the city. When they eventually pool their resources, they\'re shocked to find not only where their investigation leads, but who is behind it.\n\nHilary Swank/Elisabeth Moss\n\nHilary Swank & Elisabeth Moss\n\nAs the Golden State ramped up for one of the biggest tech booms in history, two police officers in 1999 unveil a real estate scandal in the heart of San Francisco that leads them all the way to Silicon Valley. The more they dig, the uglier it gets, especially when an emerging tech giant makes sure none of their questions are answered. Flash forward almost 15 years and the company is bigger than ever but that doesn\'t mean our two heroes didn\'t forget and when a new clue shows up, their case is reopened.\n\nQuestion: Do you have a dream cast for next season?

3093,http://gothamist.com/2014/03/10/true_detective_finale_form_and_void.php,entertainment,"['After weeks of frenzied speculation and argument and, let\'s face it, temporary insanity, True Detective\'s debut season finally climaxed last night (for some of us, anyway). Did episode 8, ""Form and Void,"" tie up all the loose ends spun out by writer Nic Pizzolatto\'s intricate script? Nope. But the finale brought resolution on its own terms, and was satisfying despite (or maybe even because of?) the plot questions it left unanswered.\n\nNo, Maggie wasn\'t involved in the horrifying kidnap pedophilia cult. Neither was her father, which some True Detective theorists were absolutely convinced of. Further, all of Audrey\'s childhood sexual turmoil apparently had nothing to do with the case, except insofar as her father Marty was a largely absent human tampon. The Five Horsemen theory remains a theory, and the sprawling depth of the conspiracy remains unplumbed. And the painting above Marty and Maggie\'s bed that matched the mural in the hospital was not as significant as we thought. It wasn\'t significant at all, in fact. Heh, we kind of lost it back there for a bit, didn\'t we?\n\nIt was a fun way to get lost, though, albeit highly disturbing. I don\'t think I\'ll be rewatching episode 8 any time soon—that whole opening sequence with Errol Childress\'s dead ""daddy"" chained to a bedframe followed by him fingerbanging his sister on his lap as she recalls the first time their grandfather raped her... yeah, I\'m all set on that. I did however savor seeing ""that cocksucker"" rummy Steve Geraci eat dirt in a barrage of sniper bullets. (""L\'chaim fat ass!"") And how about that gorgeous exterior shot of that overgrown Civil War-era fort that Childress turned into Carcosa? I\'ve also got no complaints about the harrowing final confrontation between Childress and the detectives, which delivered a terrifying chase through dark tunnels.\n\nAnd Cohle\'s last hallucination as he gazes up at a circular opening in the ceiling was breathtaking.\n\nPizzolatto has said in interviews that he\'s only interested in the serial killer aspect of True Detective in so far as it illuminates the relationship between Rust and Marty and their flaws, and Form and Void was certainly proof of that. As they pursue their Spaghetti Monster, their begrudging friendship is reestablished, coming full circle and then some with more of their classic carpool banter. (Don\'t these guys ever want to listen to some Creedence or something?)\n\nMarty: It\'s hard to find something in a man who rejects people as much as you do, you know that?\n\nRust: I never told you how to live your life, Marty.\n\nMarty: No, you just sat there and judged me.\n\nRust: Look, as sentient meat, however illusory our identities are, we craft those identities by making value judgments. Everybody judges, all the time. Now, you got a problem with that, you’re living wrong.\n\nMarty: What\'s scented meat?\n\nBut it\'s the ending\'s ending that really delivers, and that I will rewatch. Matthew McConaughey\'s emotional breakdown outside the hospital is incredibly powerful stuff, and watching him talk about love with such vulnerability after eight episodes of stoic pessimism is astonishing. Rust has touched the darkness, the darkness touched back, and he reemerged transformed. He claims he shouldn\'t be there, but there he is, staggering away from the hospital with the help of his partner, and now he\'s the one sounding optimistic. When Marty remarks that the sky\'s darkness seems to be overwhelming the stars, Rust says, ""You\'re looking at it wrong, the sky thing. Once there was only dark. If you ask me, the light\'s winning."" Light: kicking ass for 14 billion years and counting. It is one hell of a story.\n\nSo Marty and Rust hobble off into the sunset together in life-affirming defiance of all our darkest expectations. The monster at the end of their story was not a particularly compelling one in the annals of fictional serial killers, but it was their journey to him—and the intelligent yet passionate way their journey\'s story was told—that made the show so engrossing. Cary Fukunaga\'s masterfully sumptuous direction gave Harrelson and McConaughey all the room they needed to untangle Pizzolatto\'s dense narrative, with a pair of raw, pitch-perfect performances that will no doubt be seen as career peaks.\n\nPizzolatto\'s career is just getting started, and while last night marked the end of Marty and Rust\'s story, we can now start the countdown for True Detective\'s second season, which Pizzolatto says will concern ""hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.""', 'After weeks of frenzied speculation and argument and, let\'s face it, temporary insanity, True Detective\'s debut season finally climaxed last night (for some of us, anyway).\nDid episode 8, ""Form and Void,"" tie up all the loose ends spun out by writer Nic Pizzolatto\'s intricate script?\nBut the finale brought resolution on its own terms, and was satisfying despite (or maybe even because of?)\nNeither was her father, which some True Detective theorists were absolutely convinced of.\nSo Marty and Rust hobble off into the sunset together in life-affirming defiance of all our darkest expectations.']"

Please try again soon. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the HBO Go service, it\'s essentially HBO\'s streaming service. For the most part, HBO original programming and movies that HBO has the exclusive broadcast rights to do not appear on NetFlix of Hulu, but customers who subscribe to HBO through their cable or satellite television provider gain access to the service for use on other devices, like personal computers, tablets and phones.\n\nSo as to not put themselves in the position of competing with the partners from whom they collect massive fees and payments, the GO service is not ""stand alone"" like NetFlix or WWE Network. In theory, the only people it is available to are customers who subscribe to the television service through Comcast, Verizon, Dish and similar providers.\n\nThat\'s the idea, anyway.\n\nLike WWE Network, HBO Go is accessed with a user name and password. A user name and password that can be, and frequently is, shared by many members of the same household. Or circle of friends. Or neighborhood.\n\nThere was already some concern raised about the service\'s ability to handle a large audience for a single event when NXT ArRIVAL hiccuped during it\'s live debut on WWE Network on Thursday, February 27th. That was just a few days into a launch that had more than a couple of bugs, though. And it was coming from a small venue that may had limited external bandwidth. And the company and their partners had six weeks to fine-tune and trouble shoot the service before WrestleMania 30.\n\nAll of those things are still true, and Vince McMahon\'s team and their partners at MLB Advanced Media are no doubt burning the midnight oil working to ensure that WWE Network is as stable as possible for April 6th.\n\nThe HBO issue raises another concern, though. WWE Network users have been openly discussing the sharing of login information on social media. Some of the launch troubles were due to international users trying to find ways into the system that wasn\'t yet scheduled for international support. Folks can still be found discussing ways that they have accessed the Network from overseas, almost two weeks since official word was that those holes had been patched.\n\nAre WWE and MLBAM readying themselves for the million subscribers that they hope to have signed up to watch WrestleMania online? Or are they getting ready for the less predictable number that might hit their servers on that first Sunday in April with their friend\'s password, or from overseas via a proxy?\n\nWall Street and the press love what they have seen or heard about WWE Network so far. Early buzz has Vince at the forefront of a change in the way viewers consume sports and entertainment, as he was when the first WrestleMania birthed the modern pay-per-view (PPV).\n\nBut the launch of a new service was always going to be a risk, and having the biggest show in history be the first largely promoted event to air on it compounds that risk. The issue that HBO ran into last night (which was corrected in short order, but is still the subject of a fair amount of press coverage today) could prove an ugly black eye to the new service when it will not even be two months old.\n\nA stressed and tired development and quality testing team probably just got a whole lot more stressed and tired when the HBO Go log-on wheel spun like a flat circle into the underneath last night.\n\nFor fans and investors of WWE, WrestleMania 30 and beyond may depend on their solving the case.', ""— HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014For those unfamiliar with the HBO Go service, it's essentially HBO's streaming service.\nLike WWE Network, HBO Go is accessed with a user name and password.\nWWE Network users have been openly discussing the sharing of login information on social media.\nWall Street and the press love what they have seen or heard about WWE Network so far.\nFor fans and investors of WWE, WrestleMania 30 and beyond may depend on their solving the case.""]"

The actor confirmed this at the 2014 Oscars last week. It’s not necessarily a surprise because the series is an anthology, meaning the show will have new characters and stories every season. Chances are that Woody Harrelson won’t be back either. Or anyone else for that matter.\n\n2) The story may be set in Southern California. Pizzolatto hinted at this in an interview with BuzzFeed when he said he’s been “reading about the last 40 years of Southern California government.” With the new location will also come new colors. “South Louisiana was green and burnished gold,” he noted.\n\nWe’ve also heard that the show will use a few directors for season 2. This is a departure from season 1 which was entirely under the direction of Cary Joji Fukunaga. Time will tell if this is a good decision or a bad one.

They say, why aren\'t you doing enough? And the answer is, I always want to do more because people should always be doing as much as they can, but my full-time job is not casting The Mindy Projec-t,"" Kaling said. ""My life is constantly disappointing people, politically or something."" Kaling is the show\'s director, writer and producer. She is also its star, playing obstetrician Mindy Lahiri. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, her father is Tamil born and was raised in Madras while her mother is Bengali and was raised in Mumbai. Kaling identifies as an Indian-American, although she told the panel at South by Southwest that she tried not to focus on that. ""I think one of the things that\'s been helpful to me is [that] I try not to think that much about how I\'m an Indian-American,"" she said.\n\n""I can\'t think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive. It\'s a distraction. I don\'t want to stop being who I am, but I can\'t rely on it."" However, she said that being an Indian-American woman in the comedy world was not without challenges. ""People think that you\'re not funny because of the way that you look, [but] you can get so hung up and say, am I the victim of this situation? Or be like, I\'m in charge of it."" A study compiled by the University of California, Los Angeles and released last year at the 27th annual National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications conference found that ethnic minorities and women remained ""woefully under-represented"" on cable and broadcast programs as lead actors, writers and show creators. The same study revealed, ironically, that shows with more diverse casts generally drew larger audiences.\n\nTo the credit of Fox – the US network that airs The Mindy Project – it has been a long-time advocate of diversity on television. The network\'s chief operating officer, Joe Earley, told a 2013 executive conference that more diverse programming was financially beneficial. ""Not only are you going to have more chances of a show being made here, more chances of a show being a success on TV, more chances of making it into syndication, more chances of a show selling globally and making you millions of dollars, but you are going to bring more viewers to our air and keep us in business,"" Earley said. In an interview given to the online publication Jezebel in 2011, Kaling said that gender and race were connected. ""Even though casting for pilots and movies are open to most ethnicity for parts, there\'s just a scarcity of female parts in general in stuff,"" she said.\n\n""And then, if one of the cast members is a minority, there\'s such a relief with producers that there\'s very little incentive to cast two people of colour, if that makes sense? ""I wish there were more women of colour on-screen in comedy, for sure. But I do think that\'s changing. All my favourite shows now compared to, say, even 10 years ago, have more diverse casts. It\'s slow, though."" The Mindy Project was renewed for a third season last week.

3132,http://www.austinmonthly.com/Austin-Amplified/March-2014/SXSW-2014-Day-3-Recap/,entertainment,"[""Here are some things we saw and experienced on the third day of SXSW 2014.\n\nRunning the Show: TV’s New Queen of Comedy\n\nMarie Claire editor-in-chief Anne Fulenwider hosted this panel with actor, writer and producer Mindy Kaling and her fellow The Mindy Project cast members Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally. The ballroom was already half-full an hour before the panel, which speaks greatly to Kaling’s general popularity. Fulenwider and Kaling chatted about the fun-factor of Twitter, her creative process and how NBC, who she had worked for during her tenure as a writer for The Office, passed on her show before FOX picked it up. After a few question, Barinholtz and Pally were invited on stage to talk about how Kaling is as a boss, to which Barinholtz jokingly quipped that she’s like Kim Jong-un, but then said “she’s the best boss I’ve ever had.” The three castmates on stage together gave the audience a peek of what it’s like in the writing room and on set of The Mindy Project—they had the whole crowd cracking up with every one-liner and spot-on impression. A more serious moment came during the Q&A session when a audience member asked why the show doesn’t have more female doctors (Kaling plays an OBGYN) or doctors of color. Kaling was clearly frustrated with this question and said, “I know this is going to sound defensive, but I’m going to say it anyway: I’m a f**king Indian woman, who has her own f**cking show,” which elicited cheers from the audience and a regretful reply from the asker. Kaling also announced that The Mindy Project would be returning for a third season and that she’s writing a follow-up to her best-selling book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?.\n\nThe Secrets Behind Addictive Storytelling\n\nThis panel was already impressive before it started: It was packed to max capacity with people standing up in the back rows and sitting down on every square inch of floor space to hear what these industry experts had to say. The discussion, led by Hearst Magazine Digital Media president Troy Young, was an all-encompassing look at how different media industries, from magazine publishing to reality show production, create “addictive” and engaging content for consumers. Jonathan Perelman, the senior vice president of Buzzfeed, which is known for its highly clickable listicles and quizzes, spoke about successful brand-sponsored content, the popularity of the listicle and how Buzzfeed is trying to get it’s investigative and longform stories as highly shared as their cat videos. Joanna Coles, editor-in-chief of Cosmopolitan, touched on compelling stories that ended up being featured in the magazine, including one about a transgender musician, saying that in order for content to be addictive, it has to be good quality and it has to resonate with people in an emotional way. A&E executive Bob DeBitetto spoke from the successful television network’s perspective saying that part of the reason of why current shows, especially dramatic series like True Detective and A&E’s own Bates Motel, are particularly captivating is that great film and theater actors are migrating to television and producing an elevated level of content. He also revealed that his network spends a good amount of time discussing the shareability and the social media impact a show will have from research and focus groups, and having that addictive quality is important to networks with the proliferation of binge-watching shows that are available to viewers all at once like Netflix's House of Cards.\n\nThe Heart Machine\n\nThe Heart Machine, directed by Zachary Wigon, is a love story, or perhaps more of a heartbreak story, set in the digital age. The film takes place in present day New York City, where Cody and Virginia, who’ve never met in real life, are carrying out a relationship over Skype, because while Cody is in NYC, Virginia is doing a six-month fellowship in Berlin. Cody, played by John Gallagher Jr., who you may recognize from HBO’s The Newsroom, starts to become suspicious of Virginia’s whereabouts, believing that she’s lying to him and actually living in the East Village because of details he’s noticed during their Skype chats. His unconfirmed fears drive him to edge of madness: He stalks people who might know her and places she might frequent, hoping to get some answers, all while creeping out everyone he comes into contact with. Meanwhile, Virginia keeps up the ruse of being Berlin, but actually does live in the East Village like Cody suspects, and as the audience goes on this suspenseful journey to figure out the truth about this horribly messed-up relationship, the ending feels like a punch to the gut. Cody and Virginia, and everyone left in their relationship’s wake was incredibly well acted, and the point was driven home by the affecting ending: At the end of the day, it’s damaged, selfish people that ruin a relationship—not the often-demonized digital devices.\n\nStay tuned for previews, recaps and interviews throughout SXSW here."", 'Here are some things we saw and experienced on the third day of SXSW 2014.\nRunning the Show: TV’s New Queen of ComedyMarie Claire editor-in-chief Anne Fulenwider hosted this panel with actor, writer and producer Mindy Kaling and her fellow The Mindy Project cast members Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally.\nThe ballroom was already half-full an hour before the panel, which speaks greatly to Kaling’s general popularity.\nThe discussion, led by Hearst Magazine Digital Media president Troy Young, was an all-encompassing look at how different media industries, from magazine publishing to reality show production, create “addictive” and engaging content for consumers.\nThe Heart MachineThe Heart Machine, directed by Zachary Wigon, is a love story, or perhaps more of a heartbreak story, set in the digital age.']"

They say, why aren\'t you doing enough? And the answer is, I always want to do more because people should always be doing as much as they can, but my fulltime job is not casting The Mindy Project,"" Kaling said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n""My life is constantly disappointing people, politically. Or something."" Kaling is the show\'s director, writer and producer. She is also its star, playing obstetrician Mindy Lahiri.She was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nHer father is Tamil born and raised in Madras and her mother was Bengali and raised in Mumbai.\n\nKaling identifies as an Indian-American, though she told the panel at South By Southwest she tried not to focus on that.\n\n""I think one of the things that\'s been helpful to me is I try not to think that much about how I\'m an Indian American,"" she told the audience in Austin, Texas.""I can\'t think about my legacy because it stops me from being productive. It\'s a distraction. I don\'t want to stop being who I am, but I can\'t rely on it.""\n\nShe did note that being an Indian-American woman in the comedy world was not without challenges.""People think that you\'re not funny because of the way that you look, [but] you can get so hung up and say, am I the victim of this situation? Or be like, I\'m in charge of it.""\n\nAccording to a study compiled by the American university UCLA, and released in 2013 at the 27th annual National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications conference, ethnic minorities and women remain ""woefully under-represented"" on cable and broadcast programs as lead actors, writers and show creators.\n\nThe same study revealed, ironically, that shows with more diverse casts generally drew larger audiences.To the credit of Fox - the US network which airs The Mindy Project - they have been longtime advocates of more diversity on television.\n\nThe network\'s chief operating office Joe Earley told a 2013 executive conference that more diverse programming was financial beneficial.\n\n""Not only are you going to have more chances of a show being made here, more chances of a show being a success on TV, more chances of making it into syndication, more chances of a show selling globally and making you millions of dollars, but you are going to bring more viewers to our air and keep us in business,"" Earley said.\n\nIn an interview given to the online publication Jezebel in 2011, Kaling noted the gender and race issue were connected.""Even though casting for pilots and movies are open to most ethnicity for parts, there\'s just a scarcity of female parts in general in stuff,"" she said.\n\n""And then, if one of the cast members is a minority, there\'s such a relief with producers that there\'s very little incentive to cast two people of colour, if that makes sense?""""I wish there were more women of color onscreen in comedy, for sure. But I do think that\'s changing. All my favorite shows now compared to, say, even ten years ago, have more diverse casts.

The archives will remain available here; for new stories, head over to Vox.com, where our staff is covering consumer culture for The Goods by Vox. You can also see what we’re up to by signing up here.\n\nMindy Kaling briefed the audience on her hot pink outfit immediately upon taking the stage at her SXSW conversation with Marie Claire Editor-in-Chief Anne Fulenwider yesterday: ""I dressed for the Austin I thought it would be,"" she said, acknowledging the unfortunately low temperature. ""This is Antarctica. I look crazy. I look like my plane got stopped in Miami.""\n\nKaling exudes comfort-in-her-own-skin and looks terrific in bright colors, so she quickly settled into conversation with the apparel update out of the way. Fulenwider opened the discussion by pulling out a quote where Mindy said she can assemble a tweet in 45 seconds, and made her do it on the spot—it took 17 seconds for Mindy to compose this (bonus points for the hashtag). The conversation covered Kaling\'s career and her experience in the world of media from the perspective of a young woman of color—questions she\'s answered again and again, which yielded some very honest frustration and fatigue on her part. After the jump, some of the most brilliant, genuine gems from the conversation.\n\nBuilding the role of Mindy Lahiri: Because Tina Fey\'s Liz Lemon so perfectly captured the career that Mindy Kaling actually lives and breathes, she didn\'t want to mimic that for her show. It was important that her character have a job that echoed her own work life—long hours, hard work, and success—but in a different venue. She also noted that she had to ""give Mindy Lahiri a career where she was successful and helped people"" in order for the audience to take her seriously. ""Your character can\'t say \'I hate recycling\' and be an assistant editor at Vogue because she\'d be a horrible person."" Fulenwider paused and replied, ""No comment.""\n\nMindy Lahiri\'s suspiciously hot boyfriends: ""I hire men to make out with me. It\'s prostitution.""\n\nBeing constantly compared to all other women in television: It was evident that Kaling is weighed down from being measured against Poehler/Fey/Dunham, or any female who happens to write, produce, and act. ""They want to put you in a pageant you never wanted to be in. No one ever says \'Is Seth Rogan too Steve Carell-y?\'""\n\nAttaining role model status: She\'s constantly being asked to speak at engagements that discuss the novel prospect of women working, or women of color working (another topic she\'s been asked to death). ""I have to leave my job to go talk about how it\'s important for women to work."" When it comes to being patted on the back for the ""important strides"" she\'s making for women/women of color (depending on who\'s patting), Kaling notes that it\'s weird to be looked at like a political figure when all she\'s trying to do is write a funny TV show—and happens to be an Indian-American female.

The mood thus far had been jovial at “Running the Show: TV’s New Queen of Comedy,” a Marie Claire-sponsored panel discussion of The Mindy Project, spotlighting the show’s creator/runner/star Mindy Kaling, and the topics were fairly innocuous (her writing process, her next book, the recent Mindy/Danny cliffhanger). But when the time came to field questions from the mostly female audience, one woman posed this query: “You guys have a great, diverse set of characters, but was it a conscious decision for Mindy to be the only female doctor, and the only doctor color of show?” There were a couple of minutes of pleasant response, with co-panelists and Mindy co-stars Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally earnestly praising their female cast members. But by then, Kaling had lost patience: “I look at shows on TV, and this is going to just seem defensive, but I’m just gonna say it: I’m a fucking Indian woman who has her own fucking network television show, OK?”\n\nThe audience applauded, but Kaling was just getting started. “I have four series regulars that are women on my show, and no one asks any of the shows I adore — and I won’t name them because they’re my friends — why no leads on their shows are women or of color, and I’m the one that gets lobbied about these things. And I’ll answer them, I will. But I know what’s going on here.” Some laughter (some of it nervous) echoed through the ballroom. “It is a little insulting because, I’m like, God, what can I — oh, I’m sitting in it. I have 75 percent of the lines on the show.”\n\nMindy Kaling, Ike Barinholtz, and Adam Pally. Photo Credit: Jason Bailey / Flavorwire\n\n“And I’m like, oh wait, it’s not like I’m running a country, I’m not a political figure,” she continued. “I’m someone who’s writing a show and I want to use funny people. And it feels like it diminishes the incredibly funny women who do come on my show… I don’t know, it’s a little frustrating.” And at this point, Pally piped up: “Well, we took two different tacks in the answer.”\n\nYou have to sympathize with Kaling, who has found herself in the position, throughout her show’s run, of doing much but being criticized (as in, say, the frequent criticism that her character only dates white men) for not doing more. It’s easy to grind an artist down with that kind of a barrage, and her argument that she just wants “to use funny people,” along with a later insistence that “my full-time job is not the casting director for The Mindy Project,” can sound like some kind of an (admittedly distant) cousin to Jerry Seinfeld’s recent comments about caring only about funny, to the detriment of diversity.\n\nDoes Kaling get off the hook because of the giant strides in television she herself represents? Sure thing. But the pressures of having to be all things to all people can take their toll — most obviously in the extensive retoolings and cast overhauls that have occurred throughout her show’s two-season run. Asked about her personal strategy for creating real change, Kaling certainly doesn’t come up short on ambition: “I feel that I can just be successful, hire people that I think are cool, and try to live my life in a way that doesn’t cause embarrassment or shame to people. And try to be, at this point, a role model, and be on good behavior… And try to do a show that doesn’t offend people too much and isn’t irresponsible.”\n\nThe sheer magnitude of that laundry lists prompted some chuckles from the SXSW audience; they were realizing, the more she added to it, that The Mindy Project might be a more accurate title than they’d previously thought.', 'The mood thus far had been jovial at “Running the Show: TV’s New Queen of Comedy,” a Marie Claire-sponsored panel discussion of The Mindy Project, spotlighting the show’s creator/runner/star Mindy Kaling, and the topics were fairly innocuous (her writing process, her next book, the recent Mindy/Danny cliffhanger).\n“It is a little insulting because, I’m like, God, what can I — oh, I’m sitting in it.\nI have 75 percent of the lines on the show.”Mindy Kaling, Ike Barinholtz, and Adam Pally.\nPhoto Credit: Jason Bailey / Flavorwire“And I’m like, oh wait, it’s not like I’m running a country, I’m not a political figure,” she continued.\nDoes Kaling get off the hook because of the giant strides in television she herself represents?']"

It’s Antarctica here.”\n\nThe actress-comedian-writer-producer, currently the star and creator of The Mindy Project, started off the hour-long panel, led by Marie Claire Editor-in-Chief (and Vanity Fair alum) Anne Fulenwider, by proving another talent—speed tweeting. Kaling, who has said, “If you can’t tweet in 45 seconds, it’s not the medium for you,” tweeted out a message (Miami? Austin? Antarctica? Where am I? #sxsw) on Fulenwider’s phone in just 17 seconds. How does she feel about her social-media presence? “It’s mostly just for me to tease my writing staff,” says Kaling, who has 2.7 million Twitter followers and counting. “It’s just for fun. If it were to become more than that, I wouldn’t do it.”\n\nThe five-time Emmy-nominated actress, who says she always knew she wanted to write her own show one day, went on to discuss her creative process and what it’s like in the writing room of her successful Fox TV series, which was recently renewed for a third season. “People contribute and then things sprout from that,” she says of working with her writers. “It’s like having really creative conversations with your funniest friends.”\n\nTwo such friends—castmates Ike Barinholtz and Adam Pally—joined Kaling and Fulenwider on stage to talk about their boss. “Much like Kim Jong Un…he rules with an iron fist, but sometimes in that fist is a rose,” joked Barinholtz of Kaling’s role as creator, director, and producer of the show, continuing, “She’s the best boss I’ve ever had.”\n\nWhen asked if she liked being the person in charge, Kaling responded, “The one thing I do miss is being a part of the gang.__ __It’s such a fun job, there are hardly any complaints. The only complaint is that I want to be able to be like: ‘Fuck our boss!’”\n\nSo, what’s her secret to balancing her many roles on the show? “The reason I’ve been successful is my Richard Nixon-like focus,” she says.\n\nAn audience member asked Kaling, who published her best-selling book, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns), in 2012, if she had another book on the way. “I’m writing a book right now,” she replied. “I’m very excited about it. I’m gonna be finishing it probably at the end of this year.”\n\nAnother audience member wanted to know more about the show’s mid-season cliffhanger, when Kaling’s on-screen character Mindy Lahiri and co-worker Danny Castellano (played by Chris Messina)finally kiss. “It became a matter of not if they should do it, but when,” Kaling said of the long-awaiting smooch. “The name of the first episode [after the mid-season break] is ‘French Me, You Idiot.’”\n\nThe second season of The Mindy Project will continue on Fox on April 1st.\n\nMore Mindy Kaling Goes Out to Lunch with John Heilpern', 'Kaling, who has said, “If you can’t tweet in 45 seconds, it’s not the medium for you,” tweeted out a message (Miami?\n“It’s mostly just for me to tease my writing staff,” says Kaling, who has 2.7 million Twitter followers and counting.\n“I’m writing a book right now,” she replied.\n“It became a matter of not if they should do it, but when,” Kaling said of the long-awaiting smooch.\nMore Mindy Kaling Goes Out to Lunch with John Heilpern']"

I don’t run the country, I’m not a political figure, I’m someone writing a show and I want to use funny people. What should I be doing? It’s a little frustrating to me,"" Kaling continued.\n\n“People have a higher expectation for me. They say, \'why aren\'t you doing more?\' The answer is: I always want to be doing more, because people should always be doing as much as they possibly can. But my full-time job is not a casting director of \'The Mindy Project,\' my job is producer-writer-star.""\n\nBeing Kaling, she did this quite sweetly, and reassured the well-meaning questioner who was somewhat aghast at the response. But her gender and race are obviously issues that come up more than she\'d like.\n\n""I have to leave my job to go talk about how women need jobs as a woman of colour,"" she recounts at one point to panel interviewer Anne Fulenwider of Marie Claire. ""And if I say, \'I have to do my job,\' then they say, \'but you\'re not supporting women then!\' \'But I have to do my job.\' \'Well, then screw you!\' My life is constantly disappointing people politically.”\n\nShe adds that she\'s rather jealous of her male colleagues who aren’t incessantly compared to each other like women in entertainment are.\n\n""You don\'t hear, ‘Is Will Ferrell too Steve Carell-y? Is Danny McBride too Aziz-like? There\'s this mentality that there can only be one woman who is successful and funny and running their own show and if there\'s more than that you must hate each other, and no.”\n\nKaling, who attributes her success to her ""singular, crazy Richard Nixon-like focus"" and said she’s currently working on a second book, has been on network television since she was 24. She began as a writer-star of “The Office” (Kelly Kapoor 4evah!) before graduating to become the boss of her own show, “The Mindy Project,” which she told the crowd has been picked up for a third season.\n\n“It’s challenging to get your own show, no matter what. I’ve only lived my life once so I can’t compare it,” she said when asked earlier by Fulenwider about how much her race and gender may have hindered her.\n\n“One of the things that has been helpful to me is that I try to not to think that much about the fact that I’m an Indian-American. So many people will look at me and think ‘you’re different from everyone else.’ But I can’t. I can’t think about my legacy, it’s a distraction. I don’t want to deny who I am, because it’s so important to me, but I can’t rely on it.\n\n“In New York coming up as a standup, people will think you’re not funny because of the way that you look, so you say, \'I’m not going to think in these terms at all.\' You have to ignore it. That’s my advice to people. You can’t get hung up on thinking, ‘Am I the victim of this situation?’ No, I’m in charge of it.”', 'Travis P Ball via Getty Images AUSTIN, TX - MARCH 09: Actress/comedian Mindy Kaling attends \'Running the Show: TV\'s New Queen of Comedy\' during the 2014 SXSW Music, Film + Interactive Festivalat Austin Convention Center on March 9, 2014 in Austin, Texas.\nBut my full-time job is not a casting director of \'The Mindy Project,\' my job is producer-writer-star.""\nBeing Kaling, she did this quite sweetly, and reassured the well-meaning questioner who was somewhat aghast at the response.\n""And if I say, \'I have to do my job,\' then they say, \'but you\'re not supporting women then!\'\nI can’t think about my legacy, it’s a distraction.']"

The standout moment came when God warned her to stay away from the Tree of Knowledge.\n\n“Are you saying that in, like, a ‘I suggest you don’t?'” Dunham asks. “Or in like a ‘Definitely don’t’ but with a side of ‘Maybe do.'”\n\nGod’s response, “Well, Eve, you’re clearly gonna do whatever you feel like soooo, whatever.”\n\nWe definitely believe that’s how God handles any situation involving our generation.\n\nLater in the night, SNL‘s new cast member Sasheer Zamata took on Scandal‘s Olivia Pope and assigned nearly impossible tasks to her team. Dunham played the chipper, idiotic “Kelsey,” incapable of handling any assignment on her own. It showcased Dunham at her most annoying… and we loved it.\n\nwww.youtube.com/embed/nT5CNaHchPY?feature=player_detailpage\n\nThe show even started with a message to Russia from Neeson.

I just haven’t met them yet”).\n\nHer 45-minute keynote largely ran though her life, growing up in New York with two artist parents (a painter and photographer) and her beg-borrow-and-steal mentality to filmmaking (she maxed out a credit card, donated her $5,000 worth of babysitting funds, borrowed money from her parents and her best friend’s parents to make her early DIY movies). The hyphenate constantly emphasized the importance of having a “ferocious work ethic” and to be perpetually working on something – a script, screenplay, short – anything. Creators should be creating, she said.\n\nShe traced her SXSW experiences, from having “Creative Nonfiction” rejected one year at the festival and then accepted the next, to feeling like her entree into the industry really began when she won an award in Austin for 2010’s “Tiny Furniture.”\n\nThe 27-year-old also made sure several times to apologize for the “molestation tweet” that she sent and promptly deleted. Her account tweeted, “I just made and deleted a not so great molestation joke. Sorry guys. I am really sleepy. SNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.” In back-to-back tweets she added, “But I should know better, and do. Even naked girls get embarrassed. Sleep well and thanks for an amazing weekend.”\n\nDunham also joked about the tweet, which the audience immediately forgave her for, a palpable “ooohhh” echoing through the auditorium.\n\nThe two-time Golden Globe winner also spoke about budgets, or the lack thereof, saying, “Lack of budget is no longer an excuse. (I realized) holding up a camera and letting people wander around documentary style is no longer acceptable.”\n\nDunham said she knows “there isn’t a place right now for me in studio-funded movies.” By holding down four jobs on “Girls,” she said she’s trying to change the role of women in Hollywood. To bolster her point she cited Cate Blanchett’s Oscar acceptance speech and a quote from dance legend Martha Graham.\n\nShe fielded questions for 20 minutes, ranging from her favorite “Girls” episode (the one that aired this past weekend because of the host of women, including June Squibb, with whom she worked) to a guy who admitted that he and his fraternity brothers watch her show every weekend looking for advice.', 'AUSTIN — “Something has to change and I’m trying” — that’s the message “Girls” creator Lena Dunham delivered with her keynote at SXSW on Monday, addressing the differences in opportunities for male and female actors in Hollywood as well as her distaste for Republicans.\nDunham added that she does not care for ratings (though she admits HBO wishes she did), Deadline Hollywood and Republicans (“I’m sure there are some good ones.\nSNL has a way bigger audience than our usual cozy girls audience, so I was seeing a rash of very different kinds of twitter rage.” In back-to-back tweets she added, “But I should know better, and do.\nThe two-time Golden Globe winner also spoke about budgets, or the lack thereof, saying, “Lack of budget is no longer an excuse.\nTo bolster her point she cited Cate Blanchett’s Oscar acceptance speech and a quote from dance legend Martha Graham.']"

While her sitcom Girls has been met with international acclaim, Lena also has her fair share of critics out there. Particularly those who slam the 27 year old for her regular nudity on Girls and, well, pretty much every other appearance she does. Her SNL hosting job last Saturday to mark International Women’s Day was no exception.\n\nFunny woman Lena Dunham hosted last weekend\'s Saturday Night Live\n\nThe highlight for us, and many others who reviewed the sketch show, had to be the ‘Biblical Movie‘ sketch. Appearing as Eve, Lena characteristically wears no clothes, alongside SNL’s Taran Killam, who played Adam (Driver). Genius. The result was a smorgasbord of feminism, while Lena also customarily poked fun at herself (appearing surrounded by decimated apples).\n\nSadly, Lena’s opening monologue wasn’t received with universal praise. The Daily Beast commented “From her opening monologue, Dunham was charming. But not effortlessly charming, which is usually the modifier when someone uses “charming” as an adjective. Dunham does this peculiar thing where her charm comes with very intentional effort. There’s something about her line delivery that makes the sort of sophisticated precociousness she gives off seem carefully crafted”. Ouch. Although they did admit that the rest of the show was, on the whole, stronger than recent episodes of the sketch show.\n\nWatch Lena Dunham arriving for the Letterman show:\n\n\n\nScreen Crush concluded that the episode overall scored a B- and felt ""‘like buying the generic brand ‘Saturday Night Live’"". Any comedian undertaking the task of hosting Saturday Night Live has got an extremely daunting job on their hands. Hosts of the show are scrutinised by the world and their performance is cited for years to come when people discuss whether or not they truly are a great comedian or not, depending on how their SNL played out.\n\nUnfortunately for Lena, despite all the promo work that went in to bigging up her big night, Saturday’s SNL averaged a 4.1 household rating and a 2.1 in adults aged 18-49 with Local People Meters. This means that household ratings were down 11% and 19% in the 18-49 market (the younger half of which is Lena’s target audience) in comparison to Jim Parsons’ SNL the week beforehand.\n\nBig Bang Theory\'s Jim Parsons hosted SNL the week before Lena\n\nLena\'s performance on Saturday had many pros and cons. Lena certainly proved herself able to pull off a successful sketch as well as adequaetly hosting, although doubts about her ability to play anyone other than a diluted or accentuated version of herself have been raised.\n\nDid you watch Lena Dunham hosting Saturday Night Live? Do you agree with The Daily Beast that her charm isn’t effortless? What do you make of Lena\'s ability to play roles which are outside of her comfort zone, such as her Liza Minelli bit?', 'So, reviews for Lena Dunham’s stint hosting Saturday Night Live have been a very mixed bag.\nHer SNL hosting job last Saturday to mark International Women’s Day was no exception.\nWatch Lena Dunham arriving for the Letterman show:Screen Crush concluded that the episode overall scored a B- and felt ""‘like buying the generic brand ‘Saturday Night Live’"".\nAny comedian undertaking the task of hosting Saturday Night Live has got an extremely daunting job on their hands.\nDid you watch Lena Dunham hosting Saturday Night Live?']"

We were very happy that Ms. Dunham chose to avoid a musical opening, as that has been done to death people…TO DEATH.\n\n“OHH CHILD” DIGITAL SHORT\n\nThis short is hysterical, because it’s so smart. You won’t see the end coming from a million miles away and Lena’s frustration throughout is spot on.\n\nBIBLICAL MOVIE\n\nMaybe it’s because I love Girls so much, but I would 100% see The Garden of Eden as interpreted by Shoshanna, Hannah, and Adam.\n\n“SCANDAL”\n\nI usually don’t like these sketches, because they alienate anyone who doesn’t watch the source material. This time around though, Lena plays a character who says exactly what the audience is thinking.\n\nThat wig though….not good.\n\nWEAKEST SKETCH: THE KATT WILLIAMS SHOW\n\nLena as Liza seems like it should have been a good idea.\n\nAnd, for the record, Ellen DeGeneresdid not call Liza Minnellia transvestite.
